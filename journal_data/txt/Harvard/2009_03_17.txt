After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I regard myself as a conservative in the aesthetic sense,” Ross G. Douthat ’02 once explained to The Harvard Crimson in his final year in Cambridge. Already a long-running Crimson columnist and editor of the Harvard Salient at the time, he had earned a reputation as a prolific writer and the foremost conservative on campus. With his recent selection to replace Bill Kristol ’73 as editorial columnist for the New York Times, he will become—at the tender age of 29—one of the nation’s most preeminent political commentators and visible conservative intellectuals.
The Harvard community, and especially those involved in the campus media where Mr. Douthat began his journalistic career, welcomes this news in particular. Mr. Douthat’s speedy rise through the ranks of opinion journalism does our newspaper—as well as the Salient—proud. Harvard for a long time has been privileged as a fertile ground for launching careers of all sorts, especially in journalism. Mr. Douthat, author of Privilege, the celebrated autobiographical account of his undergraduate years, offers further encouragement to the campus’s aspiring writers and thinkers.
Although Harvard has particular reason to celebrate, the rest of the public should similarly laud the Times’s smart choice of Mr. Douthat. The columnist whom he will replace, Mr. Kristol, has ancestral ties to the luminaries in the American conservative tradition. His father, Irving Kristol, chartered the school of thought known as “neoconservatism,” and he studied for his doctorate under Harvey C. Mansfield, Jr., ’53, conservativism’s elder statesman and principal brain trust. Despite these credentials, Mr. Kristol’s short run on the Times’s editorial page had yielded little more than uninspired boilerplate. With Mr. Douthat taking his stead, the Times will now feature a conservative whose intellectual vintage is much younger but who has already earned a reputation as an independent thinker and reformer.
The succession of Mr. Douthat to Mr. Kristol’s post perhaps represents a larger movement within conservatism. As the American right, hammered by two consecutive electoral defeats and without a clear political or intellectual leader, struggles to find its identity, Mr. Douthat will be able to articulate a fresh vision and sound principles in which his moribund movement may rediscover its raison d’être. 
Liberals here at Harvard and throughout the country indeed may find Mr. Douthat’s positions and philosophy no less objectionable than his predecessor’s. Yet Mr. Douthat, a captivating author who appreciates nuance and spurns unsophisticated ideology, will contribute not only his perspective, but also, perhaps more importantly, a respectable approach and attitude that conservative pundits too often have lacked. Mr. Douthat is no Rush Limbaugh—for better or worse, conservatives in this country and on this campus will have a smart and rational exponent around whom they can rally. 
As a self-described aesthetic conservative, we can only hope that Mr. Douthat will inaugurate change not only in substance but also in style among his fellows on the right. In the spirit of the great Evelyn Waugh—from whose novel he had borrowed the title of his Crimson column—Mr. Douthat promises to bring a conservative voice to the Times that is more intelligent, more elegant, and more enjoyable to read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few crimes are more disturbing than violent murders at schools. We deplore the tragic shooting in Winnenden, Germany, that left 16 dead on Friday. Such attacks shake communities to their cores, and we understand that, in the aftermath, societies must look within themselves to both understand why such attacks happen and to help prevent them in the future. In the aftermath, a call has gone out to remove violent video games from store shelves. Banning video games or enforcing a blanket social restriction, however, is not the answer.
After a tragedy such as this, video games often receive immediate scrutiny. The games can have violence only matched by films, but with the added element of a player’s interaction. Studies may have found corollary evidence linking violent games to violent behavior, but, as anyone who has taken even the most basic statistics class can remind us, correlation does not equal causation, and there is no convincing evidence of a causal effect here. There are simply too many lurking variables—socially awkward teenagers may play violent video games, but so do many perfectly happy teens. We cannot prove that playing the games somehow morphs teens into serial killers.
As with Columbine, and the recent shootings in Finland this September, and even in Germany in 2006, many people are concerned and look to lawmakers to respond. We must be reasonable, however, in our expectations. There will always be sociopaths and oddballs in any society or era. We cannot hope to make every single person happy or non-violent. Exaggerating the link between video games and teen violence in this case smacks more of political ploy than effective measure. Policymakers who push for new bans on violent video games help placate the doubts their constituents feel while demonstrating their own supposedly proactive response to crisis. Action without reason, however, is not enough to prevent such shootings in the future and only acts a psychologically placating solution.
Part of Germany’s shock comes from the fact that this represents the second high-profile multiple killing since it tightened its gun control laws following a school shooting seven years ago. Obviously gun control is not the cause of such crimes, but perhaps this shooting shows that such measures are not enough. The shooter’s father was a shooting club member who owned 15 legally licensed weapons. More of the weight of such crimes must fall on the parents and others who leave such weapons in reach. Allowing unlicensed individuals to access one’s weapons should incur tougher penalties. Stricter penalties and regulations on gun sales could help keep such weapons out of troubled hands, but, as long as licensed guns are available, we must work harder to keep them secure.

In the last few weeks, 23 of North America’s top universities have signed up to join a brand-new competitive collegiate league. Students from McGill, Princeton, Stanford, University of Chicago, Yale, and Harvard have answered an irresistible call: the opportunity to introduce an entirely new game into the hallowed halls of college sports. 
Instead of pads and helmets, this sport merely requires a computer, keyboard, mouse, and Internet connection. These tools are standard for any college student, and travel costs are negligible, since the opposing teams can play each other online. The game is “StarCraft: Brood War,” and by starting the Collegiate StarCraft League, the Princeton gaming club, “SmashCraft Heroes,” might be setting a new precedent in North America. However, it follows a model that has been tested for years elsewhere in the world with incredible results. 
In South Korea, “electronic sports,” or eSports, is an $81-million-per-year industry. The bedrock of this relatively recent phenomenon is the game StarCraft, published in 1997 by American company Blizzard Entertainment (now Activision Blizzard, a Viacom company). There are four major StarCraft tournaments that play three seasons annually, at around two months per season. The matches are recorded in front of a live studio audience (comprised mostly of high-school-age female fans) in one of the high-tech “eSports stadiums” sprinkled across Seoul. The footage is televised on one of the two cable channels or one Internet TV channel devoted exclusively to eSports content. In estimate, there are 18 million eSports fans in the country of 50 million people, which means that professional StarCraft and other games receive the second highest television ratings of any televised sports. 
A top StarCraft player in Korea may not be perceived at the same level as Tom Brady or Manny Ramirez are here, but they are certainly well known among the younger set and rakes in over $100,000 per annum. Professional StarCraft players in Korea—players with pro gaming licenses—are paid yearly salaries on an average of $20,000 per year just to compete in a computer game, with top players earning more. Ever heard of Lim Yo-hwan, also known as “SlayerS.BoxeR”? Additionally known as “Terran Emperor,” this 28-year-old was earning $300,000 per year in salary alone, not counting product endorsements, before he entered the Korean air force two years ago. His fan club includes more than 500,000 members. This does not even count the many international fans that stay up until 4:00 to watch his matches live over the Internet. In 2006, MTV.com included him in their article “The 10 Most Influential Video Gamers of All Time” alongside the creators of the web-comic “Penny Arcade” and the folks who modified “Half-Life” to make a game called “Counter-Strike.” But, beyond his hall of fame status in the eSports scene, this competitor has all the hallmarks of a true-blue, larger-than-life sports star. 
There is no secret that the CSL derives most of its inspiration and organizational structure from Korean StarCraft—even its name is an adaptation of the names of two tournaments called the “OGN StarLeague” and the “MBCGame StarLeague.” But, while this student-organized league aims to emulate its more established cousins across the pond, only time will tell whether the similarities will extend beyond a snappy initialism. 
On February 7, the CSL had its inaugural match between Princeton and MIT. Two groups of college students occupied rooms hundreds of miles away from each other, and yet they and their audience (the matches were streamed live online) were very close in spirit. The Daily Princetonian covered the match in a Sports section article that will become a weekly feature. The Harvard Crimson should follow suit when the Harvard team plays. 
The video-game industry is already predicted to grow—not shrink—during this economic recession, and, as many competitive games reward high levels of skill and talent, it was inevitable that eSports would come into being. Despite the superficial differences between athletic sports such as football and competitive StarCraft, both activities have achieved great popularity and generated entire entertainment industries because they tap into the natural human desire to enjoy and identify with excellence. The CSL might not ever attract the same eSports following in North America that the OSL and MSL enjoy in Korea, but I will certainly be watching this historical league grow and mature. And, besides, there’s nothing better than kicking back and watching a good game of StarCraft.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few pieces of paper may have recently jeopardized the lives of 2.75 million refugees.  Earlier this month, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, citing crimes against humanity and war crimes. As pundits and scholars alike have warned, al-Bashir’s retaliation was brutal. He immediately shut down 13 relief agencies, giving no explanation other than allegations that the ICC and these NGOs were conspiring against him. 
Ocampo’s ICC indictment was a bad idea from the start. In a nation ravaged by government-sponsored war, torture, rape, and murder, ensuring that humanitarian NGOs remain active is crucially important for the lives of ordinary Darfuris. The now-defunct NGOs contributed 80 percent of the workers to the UN World Food Programme’s efforts in Darfur and maintained hygienic standards in packed refugee camps. However effective or ineffective these organizations may be, 2.75 million refugees depended on their aid, along with millions more. 
Others argued that the international community would mobilize around this indictment, justifying Ocampo’s actions. This cold calculation of politics for blood was wrong. Instead of increasing aid or taking multilateral action against Darfur, the UN remains silent about NGO expulsion. Why? China is unwilling to retrench its support for Sudan. It blocked a basic press statement from the UN Security Council that would have condemned Khartoum for this retaliatory injustice.  The African Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, two potential sources of international support in the region, remain silent, and are unlikely to act against al-Bashir. 
With these grim results, risking Darfuri lives for a poorly structured indictment process has proven tantamount to manslaughter—or at least gross negligence. Policymakers expected this reaction from al-Bashir. Shortly before Ocampo issued the indictment in July, a reporter asked him whether he thought the potentially terrible consequences of the arrest warrant would be his fault. Ocampo cavalierly replied, “Today they are being killed. Today they are being destroyed and have no hopes.” 
With proclamations like this, Ocampo positioned himself as a rescuer who could swoop in and immediately change Sudan. He implied that tomorrow things would be different. Tomorrow Darfuris would not be destroyed and would have hope. It is not that easy. Even if the situation had improved, Ocampo’s individualistic view of the indictment process would still be untenable. It overestimates the impact of one body—whether it is Ocampo or the ICC on al-Bashir or al-Bashir on Darfur. The recent backlash does not invalidate international law as a force of justice. It invalidates international law as a blunt instrument, used by prosecutors like Ocampo.
What, then, is the alternative? How should the ICC have approached this extraordinarily delicate situation? To answer these questions, look back to 1819, when the British Empire prosecuted the human rights violators of the 19th-century: slave traders.
Staffed by both British and local judges, mixed commissions were anything but individualistic. Through a series of bilateral treaties with the French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and American empires, Britain convinced states to cede sovereignty to Britain in its effort to crush the slave trade. Not only did these international tribunals charge foreigners with the task of judging domestic citizens, but they also worked in tandem with the Royal Navy as it seized illegal slavers on the high seas.
Jenny S. Martinez, a professor at Stanford Law School, called these courts the first “international human rights tribunals” in a recent article.  As such, they preceded a line of famous international courts, including the International Military Tribunal at Nuremburg (1945) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (1993). What makes the mixed-commissions system an apter analogy in terms of Darfur today, though, is the peacetime incentives behind its establishment.
Mixed-commission courts were not post-conflict institutions intended to mete out justice for war crimes. They were, instead, functional components of Britain’s global efforts to suppress the slave trade in peacetime. Countries ratified the courts’ founding treaties because of incentives like money, threat of attack, and involvement. Each nation had a judge and a commissioner of arbitration involved, holding equal power on the court benches. The model was largely successful; the mixed commissions liberated about 80,000 slaves in their 50 years of existence.
The ICC is not a 19th-century superpower engaged in gunboat diplomacy. However, it should look to these cooperative commissions for guidance. The problem in Darfur has become more political than ever. 
Al-Bashir shut down these NGOs not only to prevent an alleged conspiracy, but also to reassert his political might in this uncertain time. That is why the indictment was so wrongheaded in the first place—millions of lives have been compromised for what has become a P.R. stunt.
Political problems call for political solutions. A viable case against al-Bashir would be one that respected his Sudanese sovereignty. ICC efforts that involved state actors in Darfur, specifically Sudanese judges, would lend this international legal action domestic legitimacy among oppressed and propagandized Darfuris. This collaborative and respectful approach is the only road to justice.

It was Saturday night in the Currier fishbowl when Aaron C. Fallon ’11 grabbed the mic and ordered everybody to the dance floor. And no, he was not calling for all the single ladies or for anyone to walk it out. Instead, Fallon was heralding a completely different dance form: Irish step dancing. Last Saturday, Corcairdhearg—the Harvard College Irish Dancers—together with the Currier House Committee hosted the Currier March Party, featuring a traditional Irish Ceili before breaking into a St. Patrick’s Day-themed party with DJ Double Kay. With intriguing offerings of green beer, pots of (chocolate) gold, live Irish music, and, of course, plenty of dancing, the event drew in both Irish step enthusiasts and curious partygoers. Taking the name Corcairdhearg from the Irish word for “crimson,” this dance crew is the first at Harvard dedicated to the Irish art, with a big vision already in sight.DANCING WITH THE STARSCurrier HoCo Treasurer Daniel E. Farrell ’10 says that the idea for teaming up with Corcairdhearg was the “perfect blend” of traditional Irish culture and traditional Currier party culture for a spring bash, as Fallon is also a Social Chair in Currier HoCo. “It was like the stars aligned when we had this Irish man with a stellar dancing background,” says Farrell. Stellar is right. Fallon, one of the founders of Corcairdhearg, has been Irish dancing since he was about five years old. The two other founders, Moira E. Forberg ’11 and Alana C. M. O’Brien ’11 have also both been dancing for almost 15 years. O’Brien and Fallon are both still very active in the arena of competitive Irish dancing, often traveling to compete in regional, national, and even world championships. Both competed in the World Championships of Irish Dance in Belfast, North Ireland last April after placing at the North American National Championships.However, Ceilis, traditional social events filled with Irish music and dancing, are not just about letting dance champions take center stage. “The focus isn’t on what we could do,” says Fallon. “It’s about getting everyone up on their feet.” Ceilis are all about letting everyone, from amateur dancers to the downright rhythmically challenged, partake in the fun that is Irish dancing.  FROM THE TOP Last year, however, organizing a Ceili might have proved impossible. Corcairdhearg is a new student organization, founded in the spring of 2008. The idea stemmed from Fallon and O’Brien’s own interests. Also, as competitive dancers, they were constantly on the prowl for practice space. Meanwhile, Forberg, who also used to compete, longed to get back into Irish dancing. “When I came to Harvard, I realized I missed Irish dancing. I didn’t realize how much I love it until I stopped,” she says.  Fallon and O’Brien discovered that there was no community or space on campus for Irish dancing.  So, together with Forberg, they founded Corcairdhearg, with a three-pronged mission to perform, to teach, and to compete, while helping others to do so.  Caitlin D. Driscoll ’11, a former competitive Irish dancer, says she became very serious about dancing again as soon as she found out about Corcairdhearg. “It has rekindled my love for Irish dancing. It’s not the same when I practice alone,” says Driscoll. Driscoll was so inspired that she is going to compete again in November.  Corcairdhearg has also been extremely successful in past performances, most recently as an opening act at Cultural Rhythms. The success of the Corcairdhearg’s performance at Cultural Rhythms also speaks for the instructional mission of the club. According to Fallon, only half of the performers were experienced while the others were beginners who wanted to become involved. “They looked so legit and it was really exciting because they hadn’t been doing it forever,” he says. Corcaidhearg has regular workshops in dance studios that are open for beginners who have never heard of a reel—a fast tempo dance—and for the more experienced hoping to perfect that hop back. Forberg says teaching members of Corcairdhearg is a learning experience because they all have completely different backgrounds. Still, she says that the organization is dedicated to providing individualized attention.So far, they have been pretty accomplished. “When the club started up I was so excited and I joined immediately,” says Eva Kirilova ’11, who says she had dabbled in Irish dancing in middle school. “We always have fun when we get together.”KEEPING UP IN TIMEStill, Corcairdhearg is working out some of the kinks of being a new club.“We’ve been trying everything out...and it’s hard to gauge student interest until you have an event. The Ceilis were big successes and we had never planned one ourselves so it was an interesting and scary process,” says Fallon. Gauging student interest for workshops has also been a challenge. One of the goals next year is to have an established workshop schedule with different levels and progressive lessons. “By the end, they can show what they’ve learned,” says Forberg.  The biggest goal of Corcairdhearg is to hold its own dance show. After being called upon by so many other student groups to perform, Corcairdhearg would love to host an Irish dancing show and be the ones to bring in other student performers. And, of course, continuing monthly Ceilis is a big agenda. FOR THE LOVE OF THE JIG?At the March Party, strangers and friends alike joined hands, took each other by the waists, and spun each other ’round and ’round to the upbeat rhythms of a live musical ensemble. While some, like Corcairdhearg members, did shine in their element, other novice Irish dancers had just as good of a time laughing over missed beats and stumbled steps. “At the root of it, it’s a traditional, cultural, fun, social, rhythmic, musical activity that I love,” says Fallon. O’Brien resonates this sentiment. “Dancing is just a whole new world,” she says. Corcairdhearg strives to introduce this other world to Harvard.With the luck of the Irish on their side, green really may be the new crimson.

When the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission announced that Ratatat and Sarah Bareilles would be performing for this year’s Yardfest, an annual debate immediately took over House email lists and dining hall chatter. Some agreed with the picks, and some paid no attention, but naysayers held up the announcement as the most recent example of the CEB’s ineptitude. It seems crazy, the argument goes, that if Brown can get Nas and Of Montreal for their Spring Weekend, Harvard must settle for Third Eye Blind and Gavin DeGraw (and when given the opportunity to host Girl Talk, the Yard was left with little music and a near-riot). However, the CEB and the HCC, which are, together, in charge of selecting the Yardfest artists, say that such frustrated sentiments are built upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the selection process. Most importantly, while Brown will charge as much as $50 for their Spring Weekend, Yardfest is free and open only to undergraduates.Jason B. McCoy ’08, the Campus Life Fellow, or “fun czar”, explains that it is a matter of Harvard’s core values. “The reason for [Yardfest] is to provide an opportunity for all Harvard students to come and enjoy the events, regardless of socioeconomic status or any other limiting factors,” he said. As James A. McFadden ’10, Vice President of the CEB, explained, it’s an issue of integrity as well. “The CEB and the University are here to serve the students, not to put on a concert that makes money,” he said.Despite these limitations, the selection process is straightforward. The fun czar, in conjunction with the CEB, submits a budget and list of possible dates to a booking company, Pretty Polly Productions, which then sends back a list of possible artists. With the list in hand, the CEB and the HCC work in conjunction to choose and book the artists; though the CEB controls the budget and thus technically has the last word, there is usually little friction between the two organizations.But narrowing down this list is still a tough process. Artists tend to significantly raise their prices if they know that they are the student’s choice, so direct polling is usually avoided. Instead, the CEB and the HCC have to ask for preferences in genre.“[The polling] helped us mainly just to see that, clearly, there was no one artist or one genre that Harvard wanted,” McFadden said, who’s also a Crimson editorial editor. The administration has made things easier by giving the CEB and the HCC more autonomy. According to Kevin M. Mee ’10, the president of the CEB, the administration had already picked Gavin DeGraw for last year’s Yardfest without student input.“We had to work very hard after that  to get the Wu Tang Clan,” Mee said. “This year, there was no artist selected beforehand—the CEB had a lot more control.”And, given this context, the CEB and the HCC believe that they’ve really succeeded this time. McFadden explains that Ratatat, a New York City duo that mixes rock and electronica to create catchy, driven and lyric-less songs, was an especially fortunate catch. They were not originally labeled as available, but after persistent communication directly between the CEB and their manager, Ratatat finally agreed to come.    However, Harvard is a diverse place with high expectations, and no artist choice will ever satisfy everyone. Christa M. Hartsock ’10, the president of WHRB, looked forward to seeing the show. “People I’ve talked to were excited about Sarah Bareilles,” she said. “I’m not sure about how Ratatat will be received—there are no lyrics to their songs, and I don’t know about how that fits in. And I’m interested to see how they transition from the small venue they normally play in, to a huge yard.”Joseph C. Higgins ’11, a member of Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, was not so positive. “Sara Bareilles, to be quite honest, is one of the lamest human beings I have ever heard of,” Higgins said. “Ratatat I’d never heard of, but I listened to their stuff, and it could work. It was interesting. But I just think Sara Bareilles is really lame.”This kind of backlash does cause the members of the CEB to feel like scapegoats. “We have to put up with a lot,” said McFadden, whose dream Yardfest would consist of Kanye West, Jimmy Eat World, and The Decemberists. He recalled being spit on during last fall’s pep rally with Girl Talk as well as hearing people say in the dining halls, “The CEB is so retarded.”“There’s the misconception that CEB lives under a rock—‘does CEB have an affinity for washed-up ’90s bands?’ We’re in the same boat as you guys,” he said.Yet McFadden maintained that they learn from the criticism and that he doesn’t take the flak personally. “That’s sort of what’s fun about the CEB—working our hardest, trying to prove people wrong about Harvard not being a fun place,” McFadden said.Mee, who somewhat damningly chose the resurrected Blink-182 as hisdream Yardfest artist, agreed that they were always hoping to improve on previous years. “The CEB is very young—we still have a ways to go to become properly institutionalized,” he said.So is there hope for a Rihanna-led Yardfest? McCoy is defiant both about the event (“Third Eye Blind was Junior High for me,” he said. “I loved it!”) and about the possibility of other options. He said that for student organizations willing to raise capital and charge for tickets, the sky is the limit. The Browns of the world may soon be losing out; Rihanna just might ditch them for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hungry students looking to grab a bite in Maxwell Dworkin will soon have to search elsewhere, as the building’s café will cease operations starting this Friday. 
An e-mail sent yesterday to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences community by Executive Dean Fawwaz Habbal stated that “in light of the current financial environment and the increased number of new and nearby café/dining options, SEAS and Harvard University Dining Services have elected to discontinue service at the Maxwell Dworkin Café.”
Currently, the café, located on the building’s first floor, offers Starbucks coffee, Tazo teas, breakfast pastries, freshly made grab-n-go sandwiches and salads, soups, packaged snacks, and bottled beverages. In addition, there is a 24-hour Crimson Cash-operated self-serve espresso bar for cappuccinos and lattes.
According to the message, the operation was never profitable and has relied on a “significant subsidy from SEAS” ever since it opened in September 2005. Despite numerous efforts in the past to increase its viability—such as introducing new foods, expanding hours, and advertising—the final verdict was that the café was “not economically feasible.”
SEAS communications director Michael P. Rutter said that the decision came as a result of continuous assessments by SEAS regarding the café’s financial viability, as well as attempts to cut costs across the University. 
“This is just one of a host of activities being done to balance the books in light of the financial situation,” Rutter said. The closing of the Maxwell Dworkin Café is not the first budgetary decision on campus to impact students’ stomachs. Earlier this year, financial concerns prompted the Barker Center Café to end its free coffee program, and the Freshman Dean’s Office is currently considering restricting proctors’ meal plans next year to reduce expenses.
Habbal’s e-mail reminded students of the numerous dining options nearby, including Greenhouse Café in the Science Center, Northwest Café, Buckminster’s at LISE, and Harkness Commons in the Law School.
Although there will no longer be an employee working at the café, self-service options will still be available. According to Rutter, SEAS plans to increase the number of vending machines and to maintain the espresso bar.
Though Maxwell Dworkin Café floor supervisor Donna R. Spears said she viewed the closing as “unexpected” and “disappointing,” she acknowledged that the café had many slow days, and that its limited hours—8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.—meant that many students turned to other options.
Rutter said that the Maxwell Dworkin Café—which features armchairs and a plasma television—“was always primarily a social space, and secondarily a café.” SEAS plans to maintain the social role of the space, and is looking to install more seating.
Molly M. Rooney ’11, who said she uses the space to do work after class, said that she was indifferent to the loss of the café. 
“The café is very underutilized, but enhancing the social aspect would be great,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard currently ranks thirteenth on the Environmental Protection Agency’s list of the top 20 colleges and universities that purchase the most green energy, though final results will not be announced until next month.
The ranking is part of the intercollegiate Green Power Challenge, an annual competition that tracks the amount of renewable energy purchased by 45 schools in 22 collegiate athletic conferences throughout the academic year.
Though Harvard has participated in the competition for several years, the Challenge’s emphasis on the number of green kilowatt hours of power purchased is not fully compatible with the University’s current energy-saving tactics. 
While Harvard is also pursuing a diverse portfolio of green energy purchases, the University is striving to curb emissions by increasing efficiency and reducing electricity demand. Earlier this year, University President Drew G. Faust announced plans to cut Harvard’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent of 2006 levels by 2016.
Electricity use currently comprises nearly 50 percent of Harvard’s overall greenhouse gas emissions, according to Mary Smith, the manager of energy supply and utility administration for Harvard. 
“Harvard has focused on increasing efficiency and reducing the demand for energy in addition to purchasing green energy,” said Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the Office of Sustainability. “We are looking to reduce emissions through a combination of energy efficiency and reducing of demand through changes in individual personal behavior.”
Harvard University Operations Services, the office that manages Harvard’s utilities, also runs the Blackstone Steam Plant, which decreases energy consumption by providing high-pressure steam to around 200 buildings for space and water heating. This provides Harvard with increased fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, Smith said.
Harvard’s green purchases are heterogeneous, including wind and small-hydro Renewable Energy Certificates as well as on-site solar generation from panels at the Business School and Science Center, Smith said.
While the EPA rating cites Harvard as having purchased 8 percent of its energy from green sources, Henriksen said the real number falls closer to 12 percent.
Despite the discrepancy, Harvard still lags behind the University of Pennsylvania in the competition—which purchases enough RECs to account for nearly half of its total energy consumption—for the third year in a row.
“While it’s nice to be ranked well on these lists, we would like to make sure that we do everything we can to look at Harvard’s procurement strategy,” Smith said. “This means that we want to consider not only Renewable Energy Credits but renewable energy and on-site sources of energy. We’re very focused on results and will do whatever we can to reduce consumption. If we can all use less we will be even further ahead on these ratings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama and Ronald S. Sullivan—the newly selected Master of Winthrop House—first met on the basketball court, long before they were both high-profile Harvard Law School alumni. During Sullivan’s first year as a law student, Obama was a 3L. And though the 44th president had already made history at that point by becoming the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review in 1990, the two didn’t get to know each other in a professional setting.“We played intramural basketball games, sometimes on the same team, sometimes on opposing ones,” Sullivan said. “Obama was really very good, and he still is.”More than a dozen years later, after having taken separate paths with their law degrees, Obama and Sullivan extended their casual friendship. The President asked Sullivan to serve as an informal adviser during his historic bid for the White House.And just three months after Obama transcended racial barriers to become the first black president, Sullivan has made history of his own. In early February, the clinical professor of law and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, were selected as the first black couple to serve as House Masters in the College’s history.Sullivan, Robinson, and their 8-year-old son, Ronald III, will move into Winthrop House this July, replacing outgoing House Masters Stephen P. Rosen ’74 and Mandana Sassanfar, who have led the House for the past six years and stepped down in January for personal reasons.NEW HOME, NEW PLANS Though Winthrop House undergraduates said they will miss the commitment and spirit that were characteristic of Rosen and Sassanfar’s leadership styles—reflecting on moments like Rosen’s raucous procession last month through the House dining hall to unveil a freshly baptized Straus Cup trophy case—they said they are “enthusiastic” about their incoming House leaders.Despite the fact that Rosen, who is a fixture at Winthrop intramural games, won’t be cheering on the sidelines next fall, Winthrop House undergraduates remained positive.“Dr. Rosen’s leaving will do nothing but rouse the troops,” Winthrop resident Lawrence N. Benjamin ’11 said. “If anything, we’ll fight harder [in IMs].”While he and his family plan for their July move, Sullivan said he hopes to absorb as much as possible about Winthrop House culture over the next three months. He and Robinson, who is a lecturer at the Law School, said they plan to be active on all fronts of House life, adding that they hope to expand opportunities for undergraduates to connect with the larger University community—in particular, with their colleagues at HLS.Sullivan said his and his wife’s administrative experience will be brought to bear as House Masters. And although the two are only the second House Master appointments from the Law School, Sullivan said they have had broad exposure to undergraduate life.While the couple was dating in the early 90s, Sullivan interacted with the undergraduate community as a resident tutor in Leverett House. When he returned to the Law School as a professor, he rekindled his connection to House life as a member of the Lowell House Senior Common Room.“My view is that it starts with a level of comfort,” Sullivan said. “Stephanie and I bring a love and appreciation for community, and I anticipate spending significant amounts of time maintaining and improving the ‘espirit de corps’ of the House.”Former African and African American Studies Professor J. Lorand Matory ’82, who chairs Duke University’s Department of African and African-American Studies, said that Sullivan is “warm, friendly, open, and accustomed to dealing with many types of people,” and is thus popular among his colleagues. Matory added that it was “important” to integrate Harvard’s graduate schools with the College population.“I think lawyers serving as our new House Masters will let us sleep even more soundly at night,” said Michael C. Koenigs ’09. “Their understanding of the law would always be a benefit for sometimes lawless students.” ‘LONG OVERDUE’ Those “lawless students” will become a part of history next semester with the House Master appointments. Undergrads had been advocating for diversity among House Masters prior to Robinson and Sullivan’s selection.  “There is a sense that it’s been long overdue,” Black Students Association president Timothy D. Turner ’09 said, noting that the BSA specifically spoke of the issue with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds last November.Hammonds reiterated her commitment to usher minority faculty into recently opened House Master positions in an interview with The Crimson in December.In early February, Hammonds announced the conclusion of her search, and Sullivan said he accepted without hesitation, making the historic selection official the day after Hammonds offered him the position.Sullivan and members of the administration pointed to a dearth of black professors among Harvard’s faculty, which presented the administration with a limited pool of minority candidates from which to choose House Masters.Robinson and Sullivan emphasized the “honor” of the selection.“We are humbled and happy that we have been selected at a time that seemingly breaks a barrier on the side of race,” Robinson said.  Stating that race is still a pervasive “issue” in the country and in higher education, Robinson added, “I don’t think Harvard would be left behind—it’s a leader on most issues.” Although the selection represents a step forward in terms of race relations, Matory said certain problems persist.“The term ‘Master’ does not invite everyone equally,” he said. “This term was alienating for me both as undergraduate and then as a professor. It’s deeply offensive to every black person I know on this campus.”A GOOD FITTo Robinson, Winthrop House represented Harvard’s progressive history and was emblematic of the University’s acceptance of diversity, as the House was the first to welcome Jews and Catholics.  For the couple, the opportunity to raise their son in a “rich, vibrant, engaging” community of undergraduates and graduate tutors was an added incentive.But when it came down to making the decision, Sullivan says he simply felt it was right.“It’s hard to give voice and vocabulary to it. It was a vibe. It felt comfortable,” he said. “I felt like it would be the perfect place for myself and my family.”—Staff writer Bita M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States must take decisive action against genocide in Darfur by appointing a special envoy and stepping up involvement in the region, said activist and award-winning actress Mia Farrow at an Institute of Politics event last night.Speaking to a small group of Harvard students and Darfur advocates, Farrow cited horrors she witnessed on her many trips to the region as evidence that citizens must urge politicians to lobby for new policies concerning the genocide.Though she is best known for her cinematic and television roles, Farrow has recently taken up the mantle of human rights activist, focusing particular attention on the genocide in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands have been killed since 2003.Farrow focused on her own accounts of the widespread bloodshed and violence she saw on her most recent 4-week visit there for much of the event.“There were tribes where 100 percent of women over the age of eight had been raped,” said Farrow, who showed images of victims during her presentation. She said that approximately 40 percent of children in the region were malnourished, and that many large villages had been reduced to ruins.Farrow said she witnessed the destruction of one village, in which 60 people were burned alive.“Families are stuck wandering, not sure if they’ll find food or water, not sure if their attackers will come find them,” she said.Farrow called for UN sanctions, arms embargoes, and the appointment of a special envoy to the region to stop the bloodshed.“The Obama Administration has not yet appointed a special envoy to Sudan,” she said, adding that American citizens must call their representatives and demand action. “We must protect these citizens whose government cannot or will not protect them,” she said.According to Farrow, China is a major force in enabling the killing, as the Chinese government has helped fund the country’s arms purchases. China has also exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council, blocking efforts to sanction Sudan in 2007.Joanna I. Naples-Mitchell ’10, a member of the Harvard Darfur Action Group, said she believed Farrow’s proposed measures would produce positive change in Darfur.“An envoy to Sudan should be our number one priority” Naples-Mitchell  said.The event—which took place at the IOP’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum—was co-sponsored by the University Committee on Human Rights Studies, the Harvard Human Rights Advocates, and the Harvard Darfur Action Group.

Student Organizations Center at Hilles Manager David R. Friedrich has been named Assistant Dean of Harvard College and Director of the Student Activities Office, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced yesterday. 
In his new role, Friedrich will be responsible for supporting and overseeing the College’s student organizations. This will include ensuring that clubs are apprised of the College’s rules and regulations, making certain that organizations re-register each year, and helping groups manage and develop their financial resources.
Friedrich assumes a post similar to the one formerly held by Paul J. McLoughlin II, who was promoted to the position of Assistant Dean of Harvard College and Senior Aide to the Dean of Harvard College last September.
A graduate of Gordon College, Friedrich came to Harvard in 2006 to serve as the founding manager of the SOCH.
“The nice thing about David is that he has already worked so extensively with student organizations,” said McLoughlin, who supervised Friedrich during his tenure as assistant dean of the college in the Office of Student Life and Activities. “He has already proven that he knows how student organizations work at the College.” 
Friedrich said his highest priority in his new role would be to increase the opportunities the Student Activities Office provides student group leaders to participate in trainings and workshops to enhance their leadership abilities.
He said he also plans to work on improving communication between student groups and providing campus organizations with a more central place from which to gather information pertinent to their needs. 
“I’ve really enjoyed working at Harvard and working with the student organizations that have been using the SOCH and to be able to continue that,” Friedrich said. “To do it in a broader way is something that is really exciting to me.”
According to McLoughlin, Friedrich was selected in a process that included interviews with a search committee, a group of student organization leaders, Hammonds, McLoughlin, and Associate Dean of the College Judith H. Kidd, who will oversee Friedrich’s work.  
McLoughlin said that Friedrich was the “strongest finalist” among the group considered and added that during Friedrich’s tenure managing the SOCH, “we never received one complaint in the College from a student group or student who worked with him.”
This is not Friedrich’s first time overseeing a college’s student organizations. Before coming to Harvard, he served as the Director of Student Activities at Endicott College in Beverly, Mass.
“I find that it’s a really dynamic environment working with students, and I am excited about working hard to find ways to help them develop personally and professionally,” Friedrich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing attackman just reached a whole new level. 
Freshman Jeff Cohen has torched opposing goalkeepers and has breathed new life into the No. 16 Harvard men’s lacrosse (3-1, 0-0 Ivy) throughout the season. 
Thus far, Cohen’s innate ability to find the net has been on display throughout the Crimson’s four games, with his latest antics coming on Friday in a rebound win against Hartford.
This past weekend’s career high in points is clear proof of Cohen’s scoring capabilities. The freshman notched five goals and had one assist to lead Harvard’s 18-7 rout of Hartford. It was a great way for the Crimson to bounce back from its disappointing loss to UMass the previous weekend, after beginning the season with two victories over ranked opponents. Cohen scored once in the first half as part of a strong offensive front that kept Hartford at bay. In the second half, Cohen scored first and then kept adding to the Crimson’s growing tally throughout the period, making it impossible for the Hawks to attempt a comeback. The freshman not only scored but also shared, making several passes to teammates and acquiring an assist. 
“I thought he did a nice job capitalizing on opponent’s mistakes and being at the right spot at the right time,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “Cohen has good instincts, and when he gets a chance to score he knows how to put it at the back of the net.”
It was Cohen’s best performance of his collegiate career thus far, though he had quite an impressive start this season.
To kick off the campaign, the men’s squad faced Duke in what seemed to be a glaring mismatch. The Crimson beat all expectations, though, when the team came out victorious in a 9-6 contest that saw the beginnings of Cohen’s brilliance. Harvard was down by one when Cohen tied it up thanks to a combined effort with captain Max Motschwiller. Then the freshman put the Crimson on top on the scoreboard, igniting a run that forced the Blue Devils into an unexpected deficit. Duke threatened to make a comeback, tying it up at three, but a goal from junior Jason Duboe followed by another successfuly shot by Cohen put those worries to rest. 
“He’s a good guy to be around—a very positive kid,” Motschwiller said. “He doesn’t get down on himself and he’s there to pick us up when the team is down.”
Cohen’s hat trick against the ranked Blue Devils created high expectations for the rookie, and his superb performance earned him Ivy League Rookie of the Week and Turfer/New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association Co-Player of the Week. It also earned Harvard a ranking for the first time since the middle of last season.
“He’s learning to work hard every day,” Tillman said. “He is consistently working hard, and it’s hard as a freshman to play at a fast pace, but he wants to be really good so he’s working hard at that.”
Those expectations were lived up to in the following game. Cohen continued his good play with a goal and two assists against Stonybrook, showing another glimpse of his scoring prowess and illustrating his unselfishness. The Crimson outperformed another powerhouse lacrosse program, 12-4, and set up high hopes for its encounter with UMass. The Crimson’s offense couldn’t come through, although Cohen mustered an assist. 
The freshman knew about the anticipation surrounding his play coming into the season. The Syosset, N.Y. native comes from a family of lacrosse players. His two older brothers, Steve Cohen ’06 and Greg Cohen ’07, played for Harvard’s varsity lacrosse program. Their influence on Cohen led to a sensational high school career full of accolades and accomplishments, acquiring two U.S. Lacrosse All-American awards and obtaining the Long Island scoring record of 260 goals. His fantastic lacrosse resumé earned him a national top -four ranking coming into the school year, and he has yet to disappoint so far. He is ready to set himself apart from the rest, and perhaps create a little bit more history on the collegiate level as well. 
“With the way things are going now he’s fitting in our team real well,” Motschwiller said. “If he continues to work hard he will not only be the team’s leading scorer but he also has the capability of becoming the league’s top scorer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team took to the water again this weekend for the second time in its spring season. While both teams were originally scheduled to compete in separate Maryland-based events this weekend, only the women’s team made the trip to the Old Line State to race in the Navy Women’s Intersectional in Annapolis.The co-ed team passed up on the St. Mary’s Team Race Intersectional in St. Mary’s City and instead stayed close to home to compete in practice team racing against some very talented alumni on the Charles River.The Harvard women stood up admirably to the challenge of being the sole Crimson representative on the water, however, as they took home a fourth-place team finish in a field of sixteen teams from up and down the East Coast.“We were happy with our results this weekend,” sophomore Meghan Wareham said. “It was a great place to start and we now know what we have to work on as the season progresses.”Although the Crimson lineup at the Navy Intersectional utilized pairings that had not been together for quite some time, the Harvard women competed well in finishing just three points out of second place.The Crimson were represented by senior skipper Megan Watson and her crew, Wareham, in the A division races, where the pairing took home a fifth-place finish.“This was the first time I had been paired with Megan in a 420 [type of boat] since probably October,” Wareham said. “We did not have much wind, so the races were quick, but we still got some solid racing in.”The Harvard freshmen duo of skipper Emily Lambert and crew Annie DeAngelo represented the Crimson well in the B division, where the pair also took home a fifth place finish, matching their veteran teammates in the A division with forty four points.“The freshmen performed really well this weekend,” Wareham said. “This was really a jump-in and go regatta, as we have not really done much fleet racing practice. However, we were still happy with our results.”Charleston took home the top team prize on the weekend, with the Elis from Yale and the Boston College Eagles tying for second place. The Crimson and St. Mary’s College rounded out the top five of the affair.“Most of the competitive teams on the East Coast were there this weekend,” Wareham said. “And we look forward to competing with them later this season and beating them.”Wareham pointed out that the one area the Harvard women hope to improve upon as the season progresses is their starts. She said the Crimson needs better consistency in getting off the line, as they were plagued this weekend with rather mediocre starts.Back in Cambridge, the Harvard co-ed squad decided to skip the six-hour van ride to St. Mary’s City over the weekend and opted to instead engage in some practice team racing with some Crimson alumni and other talented sailors.“With everyone having midterms and papers right now, we decided to stay home and not make the long trek two weekends in a row,” junior Drew Robb said.The Harvard co-ed team is scheduled to compete in Maryland next weekend at the Truxton Umsted Regatta and to spend its Spring Break in the region as well.However, even without being able to compete against its collegiate counterparts this weekend, the squad took advantage of a great learning opportunity.“This weekend presented us with a unique opportunity to learn from some talented sailors,” sophomore Teddy Himler said. “We were sailing against some reigning team racing champions and some four-time All-Americans. The opportunity to race against them allowed us to learn from the best sailing teams out there.”Himler also commented on the Crimson’s hopes for its next few regattas, as it begins the fleet racing portion of its schedule.“We hope to gain consistency over these next couple of weekends and really come together as a team.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the foggy gray abyss between the well-charted territory of varsity athletes and non-athletes lies a land previously untouched by many members of the Harvard community. It lurks all around us, and its citizens increasingly grow in numbers. And yet it stays just under the radar of the Crimson’s most avid sports fans. This is the world of club sports.
Although this reality is foreign to many Harvard students, it is a place that I have inhabited for the past three years. Joining the Harvard Cheerleading Squad within my first weeks in Cambridge, the in-between sports scene has always been my home. Between our club status in my first two years, and our new technically-JV-but-what-does-that-really-mean designation, being a foggy-gray-area athlete has always kept me guessing about what I’m really in for.
Deciding to be a member of a club sports team has its definite pros and cons. There is a greater degree of freedom to choose which tournaments to participate in and a lesser time commitment than varsity athletics; however, funding is limited and access to most Harvard athletic amenities is strictly prohibited.
For some club sports aficionados, this choice was made for them upon matriculation. Certain very visible club teams, such as Ultimate Frisbee, Rugby, and my personal favorite, Cheerleading, constitute the highest, and only, level of intercollegiate competition available at Harvard—it’s either club or nothing.
Senior Christopher Stevens, two-year captain of the Crimson’s Ultimate Frisbee team, enjoys this distinction.
“We’re allowed to not totally commit ourselves to a schedule of three seasons of workouts, but still compete at a high level and showcase our athleticism,” Stevens said. “[Frisbee] has debated moving up to a JV or Varsity status, but we have remained a club sport because of that freedom.”
The lessened time commitment is a definite perk of club athleticism. In some sports, however, the efforts of fundraising required for competition can equal the lost practice time.
This year, my team entered into its second year as a competitive squad, receiving a bid to the crème-de-la-crème of collegiate cheerleading competitions—NCA Nationals in Daytona Beach, Florida. Yet, this amazing accomplishment soon became overshadowed with the costs of the expedition, totaling a whopping $16,000 for entrance fees, travel expenses and lodging. Between practices, two-a-week basketball games, and fundraising to account for the hefty costs, the time commitment to cheerleading began to look like that of a varsity athlete.
Club sports teams do have options for funding assistance built into the Harvard extracurricular net—most notably the UC grants available to all clubs. Ultimate Frisbee applies for the UC retroactive grants, and it gains some support from the Athletic Department’s club sports fund. However, the latter source only covers two tournament fees for the frisbee team, and for cheerleaders, the budget is exhausted after traveling to (required) away football games. Whether it be selling frisbees or advertising cheergrams, club sports teams must therefore find some way to provide for their hefty costs.
Many teams also suffer from a poorly-documented alumni database, which puts a serious dent in the club’s piggybank.
“We’re struggling [with alumni], but we’re trying to figure out who played,” said Stevens, whose team has an alumni network with a thirty-year hole in it. “Hopefully in the future we’ll start contacting alumni and drawing in some funds.”
In addition to funding and related time commitments, my daily life is a personal testament to the gray-area-athleticism paradox. I get to prance around campus in my wildly comfortable gray DHA tuxedo, but since club participants get final picks at the gear, it is sized more appropriately for an offensive lineman than for myself. I also get the opportunity to travel to away football games as part of my team’s budget, although the mandatory trips take place in a white sniper-esque van driven by a coach or teammate. And starting with this season, I get a letter, but it’s minor…what does that even mean?
Club sports provide both opportunities and limitations for those wishing to participate in lower intensity or competition. They allow one to become best friends with Lavietes, Jordan, and Murr, while simultaneously getting barred from Palmer-Dixon and Dillon. However, even with the low rung on the Harvard athletic totem pole, club sports provide an extraordinary outlet for non-varsity students.
“[Frisbee has] certainly been the extracurricular I’ve been most involved in—it’s been my community at Harvard,” Stevens said. “This is an option on campus and it can be a social circle as well as an athletic circle.”
It is true that I wish I could get my DHAs before the end of my season, use the trainer when I become injured, and spend a smaller portion of my life selling cheer paraphernalia to cover competition fees. However, when I pull on my Harvard crimson and white and show off the results of my endless practices, it’s all worth it.

... from a trash can.
Well, not really. But Somerville recently purchased 50 BigBelly cans of the Wall-E sort. You know, the kind that squishes incoming trash in cute little cubes, emits aww-inducing mechanical noises, and...well, ok, they're not that adorable.  They just text message the waste management people when they're full of crap.
Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick was so taken by the BigBelly cans that he has proposed blowing $21.8 million of  stimulus package funds on installing over 7,000 of these machines in all the state's parks.  Yes folks, that's your bailout stimulus money at work.

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
Quincy House is the oft forgotten and underrated sibling in its neighborhood, as it tends to get overshadowed by its more ostentatious and overrated neighbors.  How does this gem rate among FlyBy’s version of the 4 C's? Find out after the jump.
Location: So Flyby might have a slight bias toward Plympton Street, but the location is clearly ideal. It's a central hub between party venues on the river and the drudgery of the Yard.  Finals club groupies can rejoice—no matter which club you got crazy at last night, your walk of shame shan’t be too protracted.  Quincy House also offers quick access to Tommy’s, which proves invaluable when you run out of mixers at 12:30 am.
Rooming: Confused. Quincy’s dormitories are built in contradicting styles: brick traditionalism on one side and concrete modernism on the other. Dewolfe offers an enticing option with its many amenities and proximity to Quincy, so residents can still actively participate in their House community, unlike the Kirklanders there. Otherwise, sophomores should be prepared to share cramped bedroom quarters, in exchange for a sizable common room. While the unattractive monolith that is New Quincy is often cited as the House’s greatest drawback, inside, juniors can get spacious singles with modest common rooms, and seniors can get massive common rooms complete with picture windows. In the days of party grants, Quincy was notorious for offering a host of possible party locales to the masses every weekend. The balcony suite, which combines two gigantic senior common rooms, is arguably one of the best spots to throw down on the river. Those who value aesthetics over room quality should still hope for Lowell or Adams, but the more pragmatic types should know Quincy rooming is superior.
Dining Hall: Revealed preferences. There's a reason everyone wants to eat in Quincy. Its proximity to the yard, sensible servery, and its bright and open feel make it one of the most popular dining spots on campus. The floor-to-ceiling windows satisfy naturalists and voyeurs alike. But severe overcrowding during peak hours, coupled with the unattractive and indecipherable mural (unlike Leverett, you actually can forget that its there), keep it from entering the dining hall pantheon with Dunster. Just a few weeks ago, the People’s House finally lowered the iron curtain, and purged the freshman from dining during lunch and dinner, reminiscent of Harvard President Josiah Quincy III’s, the House's namesake, suspension of the entire sophomore class. The People’s House pioneered the community dinner and trayless dining, and in true Trotsky form, has exported its radical agenda to other Houses. But as always, there’s nothing like the original: Community Dinners in Quincy are unparalleled, with delicacies such as alligator prepared by House Chef Diana, and Kopi Luwak, the most expensive coffee in the world. And need we even mention Quincy Grille?
House List: Quincy-open is about as unremarkable as its name. Many residents choose to receive the digest version of the list and some simply never sign up. On the subject of dining, however, Quincy is quite vocal. One of the most heated perennial debates concerns the House’s environmental dining policies (trayless dining induced numerous residents to produce fiery manifestos). In a recent exchange one resident went so far as to compare the packed dhall to a “refugee camp.” They must have temporarily confused Quincy with Leverett or the Gulag—unclear which.
House Masters: Lee and Deb Gehrke were formally installed as Quincy House Masters last year. Not only do they make it a point to join residents in the dining hall and at HoCo events, but they also open up their residence more often than most Masters. They live in a palatial penthouse suite atop New Quincy, complete with a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, RockBand, and a deck that spans half the length of the building, offering views of Cambridge and Boston only rivaled by Mather Tower. A true opiate of the masses—all Adamsian jealousy seeps from your mind upon experiencing the master suite.
House Culture: Although Old Quincy was once named Mather Hall and constituted part of Leverett House, today Quincy fosters a vibrant and unique House culture. During freshman week, the House puts on a Field Day in which the three classes compete against each other in epic contests of water balloon toss, pie eating, and tug of war, just to name a few. During the year HoCo and the Masters put on entertaining events like Iron Chef, Family Feud, pumpkin carving, and Assassins. The only notable black mark is the weak stein clubs, especially compared to Dunster’s epic happy hours: attendance is lower, alcohol is poorer in quality, and revelry is virtually non-existent.
 The Rating: AAA*.  Quincy’s default risk is as close to zero as any house. No matter what your persuasion, Quincy will satisfy.  So if you get The People's House, just imagine all the people ...who wish they'd blocked with you.
*Ratings run as such: [AAA > AA > A > BBB > junk > subprime]
