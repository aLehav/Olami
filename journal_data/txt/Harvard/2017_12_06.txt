After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Republican-controlled Congress is on the verge of their first legislative victory since the presidential election: a complete overhaul of the tax system that will cut taxes by about $1.5 trillion. This tax plan will significantly impact the federal government and every individual American––helping some while harming others. Unfortunately, the tax plan poses devastating consequences for higher education.
Indeed, we have criticized the Republican tax plan for its proposed tax of university endowments, which would substantially harm Harvard and limit its ability to provide for its students.  However, the plan has devastating implications for individual students at Harvard as well as at universities throughout the country. The version of the tax bill passed by the House of Representatives would significantly harm graduate students by treating their graduate tuition waivers as income, thus subjecting them to income tax; as such, up to 145,000 graduate students will be taxed on money that they never actually possess.
We are extremely disappointed with this provision of the House’s tax plan. This plan disproportionately harms graduate students across the country who contribute knowledge, teaching, and labor to our educational institutions. Not only do graduate students contribute to the advancement of education by teaching undergraduates and providing the bulk of the labor in labs, but they also contribute to the general productivity of society.
Higher education is one of the core elements of innovation; in today’s technical world, it takes years of training to advance to the cutting edge of current knowledge and generate new ideas. Graduate education is among the best ways to undertake this task. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for jobs that require higher education outside of the academic setting, and yet these jobs require graduate studies to be fostered within universities. In the long run, pushing students away from graduate school will hurt the nation itself most. Their contributions and the innovations fostered by higher education continue to push American industry and society for the better.
Moreover, this plan would decrease the accessibility to education for many potential students who cannot afford the additional tax hike, while further burdening the lives of current students. Seeing as graduate students already have a difficult time making ends meet, this legislation would make financing higher education prohibitively expensive for many. As students of underrepresented backgrounds already face a slew barriers along their path to higher education, this plan would make graduate schools significantly less diverse. A commitment to diversity is at the cornerstone of modern academia, and adding additional financial burdens to graduate students will only further undermine those ideals. It adds only insult to injury that this tax plan further perpetuates corporate welfare. We thus believe that this provision of the tax overhaul is shortsighted.
We urge Harvard to fight against these tax provisions with every ounce of strength it can muster. Between the tax on graduate students and the tax on large endowments, this legislation is a direct attack against higher education; as a leader of academia, it is Harvard’s responsibility to lead the way. Furthermore, it will be crucial for our incoming president to be a forceful advocate for universities. As such, the presidential search committee must choose a candidate who is committed to protecting Harvard’s resources for the sake of serving its students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard acceptance letter is a golden ticket to the wonders of Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Once you’re in, the world of bottomless chocolate rivers, everlasting candy, endless library shelves, countless experts, and infinite learning opportunities is at your fingertips. You suddenly have access to an overwhelming array of academic, intellectual, cultural, and professional resources. The only problem is that you have to find your way through the factory yourself.
Freshman fall, College students get a HarvardKey login and an online course catalog of over 2,000 classes—and are told to pick what interests them. Pulled in every direction by the well-rounded interests that got them into Harvard and overwhelmed with the options, students can easily miss out on the best classes to take. While there are certainly advantages to the academic exploration that comes with such trial and error, semesters spent exploring instead of fulfilling prerequisites can keep even the most driven students from taking more intellectually rewarding classes in the future.
But the difficulties don’t end with academics, or with freshman year. Finding extracurricular activities often comes down to stumbling upon the right booth at the activity fair on the Quad’s lawn, or striking up the right conversation with the right upperclassmen. Scheduling class during Office of Career Services workshops, forgetting about Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships office hours, or spending the weekend studying for a midterm instead of researching internships on Crimson Careers can mean missing the deadline for exciting summer programs. Not knowing to look online for Writing Center appointments, to check department websites for research offerings, or to go into office hours simply to chat with professors can mean poor papers, missed jobs, and lost conversations.
Academic and faculty advisers, Peer Advising Fellows, resident deans, administrative offices, and fellow students are extremely helpful and more than willing to offer advice for navigating such opportunities, but the burden of reaching out to these mentors and resources—and even knowing that they exist—is up to the student, which often means study and work schedules, other commitments, networking inexperience, shyness, or plain forgetfulness comes between Harvard’s students and Harvard’s opportunities. Especially for people heavily involved in extracurricular activities or part-time employment, non-native English speakers, or students living thousands of miles away from home for the first time, this is a serious problem.
In short, if students don’t have the time, memory, confidence, awareness, or luck to reach out for resources themselves, they’re left floundering in Willy Wonka’s chocolate river like Augustus Gloop. The problem isn’t the quality, but the accessibility of Harvard’s advising system.
University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler won a Nobel Prize this year for thinking about these types of problems. He presents his finding in an acclaimed book, co-written with Harvard Law professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, called “Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness.” In brief, Thaler and Sunstein advocate policies of “libertarian paternalism” when it comes to areas of finance, health, environment, education, and even marriage. The idea is to give the typically irrational, irresponsible, undisciplined, and epistemically limited human actor just the right push to help him make the rational decision. This comes down to the architecture in which choices are presented—letting people make their own decisions, but changing the accessibility of those decisions in a way that helps people make the right choice (“right” being determined, for better or for worse, by those arranging the choices). This could mean something as simple as putting cookies slightly beyond the reach of apples in the cafeteria line. It could also mean a radical improvement of Harvard’s advising system.
The College’s advising networks need a nudge. No matter how helpful the resource offices, advising fellows, and websites may be, it won’t make a difference until we make those resources more convenient, advertised, and accessible for students. From PAFs to faculty and academic advisors, most advising conversations are opt-in, and besides academic advising holds once a semester, no systematic accountability exists. What if Harvard were to institute mandatory advising check-ins on a monthly basis? What if advisors were required to meet with students a set number of times each term to ask questions about next semester’s classes, summer opportunities, and academic plans? Such mandatory advising checkpoints may be what the College needs to help students rationally take advantage of the opportunities at their fingertips.
Even if it avoids such libertarian paternalism, Harvard can still use small nudges to make big improvements in the accessibility and organization of current resources. This could include ensuring freshmen academic advisors are actually familiar with undergraduate course offerings, providing incoming students with a concept map of introductory classes and possible academic and co-curricular tracks based on their interests, improving the communication and coordination between undergraduate resource offices, and creating a centralized resource hub—similar to Stanford’s advising website—for information and announcements about classes, summer programs, and extracurricular activities.
This isn’t about enabling students who don’t have the discipline or motivation to self-start, or about taking advantages away from students with that initiative. It’s certainly true that no one will hold our hand and guide us through the professional world once we leave Harvard. But we haven’t left Harvard yet, and we came here, in the first place, to learn. Students cannot access the opportunities they don’t know about, and if they don’t have the time, confidence, or awareness to reach out, they shouldn’t lose chances to learn. Yes, Harvard students are driven. But we need guidance—and sometimes a nudge—to take full advantage of the opportunities these four years give us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EDITORS’ NOTE: The Crimson is not, and has never been, a perfect institution. In the last few years, we have taken a number of steps to become a more welcoming organization for editors of color, but we recognize there is more work to do. We are publishing this piece in the interests of continuing an internal dialogue about how to address important questions of diversity and inclusion.
— Juan V. Esteller ’19, Editorial Chair
— Derek K. Choi ’18, President
Ruben: April 2016. Black Magic, a student-written play, features a plotline about how difficult it is to be an underrepresented minority on The Crimson. I didn’t understand the plotline then. I do now.
February 2017. On a post-election campus, multiple editorial writers are understandably interested in writing about race and identity. A higher-up tells me that we should be careful with the kind of pieces we run, since we don’t want to become “Renegade with better fact-checking.”
Zoe: March 2017. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana fails to make Harvard feel like a home for first-generation college students. Tears feel like they won’t stop falling when that failure seeps into a staff editorial meeting where I’m fighting to explain the pain to other non-first generation Crimson editors. It is one of many times my marginalization has been up for debate in this building.
R: April 2017. We write a column about being chastised for speaking Spanish, but we hide that it happened at The Crimson. At a Crimson open house this fall, two freshmen come up to me and tell me that they read, and loved, that column. I thank them. I don’t tell them that we had to fight to get it published.
Z: November 2017. Deliberations mean invisibility. Sitting in a room filled with people who look nothing like me. My voice is lost in a process of decisions rife with favoritism, where the future of The Crimson remains in its ways of the past. I have to continuously remind myself why I decided to comp this organization in the first place.
R+Z: For many editors of color, The Crimson can be an incredibly toxic environment. Writers miss class, push off assignments, and ignore their mental health under a culture that leaves little room for self-care. Black and Latina women are constantly underrepresented on the masthead. Our organization’s issues with race and equity lead far too many talented editors to walk out the door of 14 Plympton St. indefinitely.
Aaron H. Aceves ’15, a former Associate Arts Editor, recounted subtle encounters with racism. “When I was an editor for the Arts board I was one of three people of color, and what I experienced with white staffers was racial obliviousness, an ‘I know every word of this A$AP Rocky song so I can say the n-word’ type of racism.’”
His experiences led to the sense of isolation that many editors experience, especially when they are among the only black or Latinx members of their board. “The funny thing though was that I’d look to the other people of color, but they’d just look away because they were closer to the majority upper-middle class, white higher ups. I felt like if I ever addressed these thoughts I’d be more ostracized than I already was.”
Nian Hu ’18, a former Associate Editorial Editor, recounted a moment during her tenure as an Editorial Board’s comp director where a piece criticizing the paper, penned by a black female comper, led to a misunderstanding that caused some in The Crimson’s leadership to suggest cutting her. Had the situation not been clarified, Hu felt that the comper might have been cut if she, the comper, and other editors of color hadn’t suggested otherwise.
Ifeoluwa T. Obayan ’19, an Editorial Comp Director, was cleaning up after an Editorial social in the building when another board entered for an event. They were all men, and none were black, yet they began blasting loud rap music that prominently featured the n-word.
“I immediately felt uncomfortable and gathered my things to leave as quickly as I could,” Obayan said, noting that it reminded her of the dynamic during her Editorial and News comps. “I was showing up to meetings and writing stories, but I still felt invisible, like no one cared to know my name.”
For the sake of the organization, we treat these problems like secrets and speak of them only in whispers. For the future editors of color, for the work we’ve personally done to mentor those who come from backgrounds like ours, for the hope we hold. We are selective with what we indulge, because we want to prepare minority editors while also reminding them that their experience can be fruitful. We rope in our tongues because, if we hope to see a diverse group of leaders at The Crimson someday, we need editors of color to stick around.
We’ve been complacent in upholding this troubling silence. We’ve written, critically, about the spaces we struggle to fit into and the borderlands we’ve sought to inhabit—the classroom, pre-professional programs, Harvard as a whole. We haven’t touched our own institution until now. To enact change, we must chronicle, candidly, what it means to be an underrepresented minority at The Crimson.
If we do not break our silence, we run the risk of perpetrating giving racial diversity nothing but lip value, allowing the organization’s leadership—ourselves included—to abdicate themselves of blame. Attendance at the organization’s Diversity and Inclusivity Committee meetings coincidentally rises in the weeks immediately preceding leadership elections, the seemingly superficial interest only serving to heighten the fear that the committee’s hope for true change in the building will never come to fruition. We must stop responding to criticisms of our issues with race by pointing to authors of color, without asking why they stop writing for us or why they aren’t officially elected members of The Crimson. If the organization continues to nudge those who feel uncomfortable or unwelcome into silence, it won’t be held accountable.
We’re critical of institutions because we love them. If we return to The Crimson, and if our prose finds life on these pages again in the future, it’ll be because we’re convinced that it can be an organization any Harvard student feels they can be a part of. To accomplish that, The Crimson needs us more than we need it. But if it continues to justify silence and complicity as a way of blindly protecting its reputation, desperately needed change will not come.

They’re here to stay.
After a year and a half of debate and discussion about the College’s historic penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, University President Drew G. Faust announced Tuesday that the policy—or sanctions—will go into place as originally outlined in May 2016.
Formulated, revisited, and revised behind closed doors by two separate committees, the policy has been met with protest, resistance from some members of the Faculty, and changes in membership policies for over half a dozen unrecognized student groups.
This semester, the Faculty continued its debate over undergraduate social life, ultimately voting down a motion intended to prevent the sanctions. University President Drew G. Faust was expected to make a decision regarding the future of the policy after the Faculty had completed their discussion on the matter.
Now a decision has been made—but it’s not just Faust’s decision. A policy that once started in the College’s Office of Student Life has now reached the University’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation, which voted to approve the sanctions Monday. Here’s a brief explanation of Harvard’s social group policy and how we got here.
Breaking from the College’s near-three-decade-long pattern of administrative distance towards its unrecognized social groups, administrators made the historic move in May 2016 to regulate Harvard’s off-campus social life.
The policy—which applies to the Class of 2021 and all successive classes—bars members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities from holding leadership positions in recognized student organizations, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The Corporation’s decision stipulates that the social group penalties will be reviewed after five years, with intermittent reports to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences during that period.
That’s not happening.
After continued Faculty pushback last year, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith created a committee to revise or replace the sanctions. Co-chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, that committee released its preliminary recommendation in July: that all social groups on Harvard’s campus—including gender neutral groups—be “phased out” by May 2022.
In a 22-page report, the committee explained that a potential social group ban would replace the current sanctions and would take effect beginning with the Class of 2022. Other colleges like Amherst and Bowdoin, which have banned Greek life, provided inspiration for the committee’s recommendation.
The decision was met with significant backlash from opponents of the original sanctions. A report in The Crimson later that month showed that the recommended ban on social groups did not receive a majority, or even a plurality, of the committee’s votes.
In its final report, the committee listed a watered-down version of the ban as one of three recommendations for the future of undergraduate social life at the College. The committee gave Faust the option of keeping the sanctions, adopting a ban on membership in unrecognized single-gender groups, or pursuing a list of “some other possible solutions.”
The latest decision by the Corporation nullifies any attempt to ban social groups. The next time a ban could feasibly come up for discussion is during a future review of the policy.
The Corporation, a 13-member body of lawyers, academics, and business people, ultimately made the decision. They voted on Monday.
That the Corporation made the decision is unusual. The Corporation does not typically involve itself in debates over undergraduate social life. It stepping in to make the decision extends the reach of the policy beyond Faust’s presidency and ties the hands of Harvard’s undetermined 29th president.
Even before they were even announced, Harvard’s efforts to penalize social group membership were controversial. Shortly after Faust’s announcement, the original policy garnered national attention and sparked strong opinions across campus; many students, faculty, and outside observers opposed it, while some professors, varsity coaches, and members of the Harvard Corporation publicly stated their support.
Unsurprisingly, the clubs themselves have harshly opposed all proposed regulations: the proposed ban also fed speculation that final clubs would potentially sue Harvard.
More than anyone else, though, it has been opposition from professors at Harvard that have most shaped the debate. In particular, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and eleven other faculty members drafted a motion opposing the sanctions in May 2016, resolving that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
That motion divided professors for months, ultimately prompting Khurana to create the committee to revise the policy. Lewis reintroduced his motion after he found the committee’s recommendations unsatisfactory. The Faculty ultimately voted down Lewis’s motion last month, paving the way for the continuation of the sanctions.
Seven social groups have changed their membership policies since Harvard announced it would penalize social group membership: the Bee Club, the Delphic Club, the Oak Club, the Sabliere Society (now the “Sab”), the Seneca, Alpha Epsilon Pi (now the “Aleph”), and Kappa Sigma (now the “KS”).
In the months after the sanctions were announced, the Oak Club, the Sablière Society, and the Seneca, announced plans to adopt gender-neutral membership policies. They joined the Spee Club, which allowed women to join in the fall of 2015.
Alpha Epsilon Pi, was the first fraternity to become co-ed and disaffiliate from its national chapter in the spring of 2017. Kappa Sigma went co-ed in September 2017 and subsequently was “unanimously expelled” from their national chapter.
Over a dozen social organizations continue to operate as single-gender. Six out of eight traditionally all-male final clubs remain all-male. The Fox Club’s undergraduates unilaterally welcomed several women members in the fall of 2015, but graduate board opposition ultimately quashed that effort. The women’s membership was revoked their membership this summer.
Two fraternities—Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon—remain all-male. None of Harvard’s four sororities—Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma—have made changes to their policies.
After a year and a half, it appears debate over the scope of the penalties is officially over. Further discussion over the implementation of the decision is likely to continue with College administrators. Last spring, a committee recommended that the College’s Honor Council be responsible for adjudicating cases where students are found in violation of the policy.
Lawsuits could also be coming down the pipeline. The Fly, one of the all-male final clubs, retained legal counsel last year, while other clubs also considered legal action after the announcement of the proposed ban.
Next fall, the Class of 2021 will become the first class affected by the sanctions to go through punch—the final clubs’ months-long selection process for sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 5, 2017 at 6:08 p.m.
The College’s May 2016 penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations will remain in effect after the Harvard Corporation voted to keep the policy unchanged on Monday.
In a historic intervention into undergraduate social life, the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, formally voted to adopt the policy and ended more than a year of contentious debate over the sanctions. The 13-member governing body’s vote is meant to ensure the policy will remain in effect under the tenure of Harvard’s next president, who will take office in July 2018.
University President Drew G. Faust, who serves on the Corporation, announced the Corporation’s decision to the Faculty during their monthly meeting Tuesday afternoon. She also sent a letter Tuesday to Harvard affiliates, co-signed by Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72, that outlined the Corporation’s decision.
“We cannot ignore the responsibility we bear in relationship to our students’ experience in these settings and their effect on the broader community,” Faust and Lee wrote in the letter. “The USGSOs have a very different relationship to the campus than was the case a generation ago, and it cannot be seriously disputed that the overall impact is negative.”
“We proceed on the hope that the existing policy will be a powerful inducement to change,” they wrote.


The social group policy—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bars members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions, serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious post-graduate fellowships.
[Confused about the status of Harvard’s social group policy? Read an explanation here.] 
Maintaining the sanctions was one of three options before Faust and the Corporation for the future of undergraduate social at Harvard. In January, after significant Faculty pushback to the policy and the way the way it was crafted, the College formed a committee to study “whether the policy can be improved, either by changing aspects of its existing structure or through some broader revision.”
The committee ultimately recommended three possible options: keep the current set of penalties for members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, ban membership in the groups, or consider an undefined set of alternatives.
The Corporation also voted Monday to require a comprehensive review of the policy, set to take place in roughly five years. The standing Committee on Student Life, a student-faculty group, will also make “periodic, interim reports” to Faculty members and administrators, according to Faust and Lee’s letter.
The standing committee’s work will “ensure that the College has an ongoing understanding about how the undergraduate experience is evolving in light of the policy,” Faust and Lee wrote. The pair wrote in their letter that they “recognize that the existing policy may not be effective in addressing all aspects of the problems identified through the careful work of the committees convened in recent years.”
The Corporation’s decision comes in the midst of Harvard’s ongoing search for its 29th president, begun soon after Faust announced her plans to step down. In their letter, Faust and Lee wrote the Corporation acted in part to ensure Faust’s successor could not alter the College’s social group penalties.
“At this moment of presidential transition," Lee and Faust wrote, "the community has an interest in being assured that the decision announced today is not contingent on the occupant of Massachusetts Hall."
As the Corporation reviewed the three possible paths forward, it discussed all possibilities with Harvard’s lawyers, according to the letter.
“The questions raised by the USGSOs implicate a range of fundamental institutional interests,” Faust and Lee wrote. “Every option under consideration, including maintaining the status quo, presented a set of legal considerations requiring advice from counsel.”
The College’s social group policy took effect this fall with the arrival of the Class of 2021—but administrators said they were awaiting a finalized policy before imposing punishments on members of single-gender groups.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email sent to students Tuesday afternoon that Harvard will implement the social group policy consistent with recommendations he accepted in February 2017. He also wrote that the Office of Student Life will “oversee the implementation” of the penalties.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and staffers in the Office of Student Life will work with students —including members of single-gender social groups—to enforce the penalties going forward, according to an emailed statement from O’Dair.

Within the manila folder lay his Harvard application—the essays, transcripts, and standardized test scores that Shane E. Campayne ’19 had labored over since he was a freshman in high school.
On top of it all was a single sheet of paper. Below the official letterhead of the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, handwritten circles, scores, and scrawled marginalia overlaid lines of neatly printed text, Campayne recalled. Numbers were assigned to acronyms. One row summed to a “+4,” another to “-3.”
“It’s nothing like I thought it would be, with paragraphs, explanations, and detailed notes,” Campayne said. “It was more like circles and stars and weird kinds of numbers.”
“Not a lot of it made very much sense to me,” he said.
Motivated by curiosity, Campayne had requested to view his admissions records last year. But, after looking at the record presented to him—a page of numbers that didn’t add up and a few sentences of comments—he said he was left disappointed.
“It kind of felt as though I was a number,” Campayne said. “It was less a process of, ‘Here is a person’s strengths, and we really think this is a good candidate for Harvard,’ and more like, ‘Oh, this person gets a plus-four in this category and a minus-three in this category, and if you sum it all up, he passes the average to get in.’”
Each month, the Registrar’s Office receives approximately 200 requests from College students wishing to see their admissions files, according to Michael P. Burke, the registrar for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Like Campayne, some say they were just curious. Others say they requested their files to reassure themselves that they belonged at the College.
How Harvard decides which of the tens of thousands of high school applicants to admit is not only the subject undergraduate curiosity. An anti-affirmative action group has sued the University, arguing that its admissions processes illegally disadvantages Asian-American applicants. And the Department of Justice is conducting its own investigation into the same allegations.
But for some of these students, the scrawls on the single-paper summary provide no clear-cut sense for why they received an offer of admission, leaving them dissatisfied and doubtful.
To view their admissions files, student must email the Registrar’s Office to indicate their interest and fill out a form with their name, class year, and House. According to the form, students can expect to wait up to 45 days, the maximum allowed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
During appointments, students have 45 minutes to read through their files and take notes while a proctor looks on, Burke said.
Every student that makes a request sees a summary sheet, comments from two admissions officers assigned to review their file, and their application. If they did not waive FERPA rights when applying to college, they can also see letters of recommendation from their teachers.
Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 first confirmed to The Crimson that students could access their admissions records through the Registrar’s Office in January 2015.
While McGrath said students have always had the right to view educational records, including admissions files, the practice gained popularity earlier in 2015 after The New York Times reported a group of students at Stanford University had successfully used FERPA to view their records.
In the months that followed, student requests at the College increased from a “handful” a month to 100, Burke said. The Registrar’s Office now receives about 200 requests per month, mostly from freshmen, according to Burke.
To handle the demand, the Registrar’s Office assigned an employee to process the requests in 2016, Burke said.
For some students, the information provided can raise more questions than answers.
In interviews with The Crimson, five students who had viewed their admissions files said they were disappointed at the opacity of the summary sheet, which did not label numerical scores that rated the quality of essays, recommendations, and other material.
“It’s a lot of coded language—they use abbreviations for some stuff,” Patrick C. Barham ’21 said. “Some of them are a little bit intuitive—like ‘TR,’ for teacher recommendation. On mine there was a ‘four by five,’ ‘five by four,’ and that was my AP scores.”
“They refer to things I didn’t exactly understand, but you’re not really allowed to ask about it so you’re just sort of left to your own,” he added.
The length and content of comments depend on the individual officers assigned to the file.
Three students—Barham, Ben I. Sorkin ’20, and Cora A. Neudeck ’19—said they saw comments about specific grades, work experience, legacy status, and geographic background.
Campayne and Sorkin both said they had only seen a few brief remarks, while Barham said he saw multiple paragraphs.
“It only left me three sentences of real feedback, but I’m sure the in-person deliberations were more strenuous,” Sorkin said. “It kind of made it seem like they go through them quickly so you can’t take it too personal—whether you deserve to be here or you don’t.”
Barham said that what he thought would stand out the most in his application did not correspond to what the admissions readers had highlighted.
“Was I surprised by what I saw?” Barham said. “Yes and no.”
“The parts that were really highlighted in my application were...about me being from another country, Costa Rica,” he said. “I guess it didn’t cross my mind that that would be such a big deal. But it is—they mentioned it three or four times.”
Sorkin said he did not find anything in his file that he had not already guessed.
“This is what I tell people now,” Sorkin said. “The interview report was a nice pat on the back. It was nice to read what character traits stood out in the course of those 45 minutes, but the admission notes said nothing.”
“They pointed out a ‘B’ I had gotten my sophomore year, an 89, which I thought was interesting,” he said. “But nothing life-changing.”
According to McGrath, the information does not give students a full picture of Harvard’s admissions process, which is based primarily around discussion rather than written comments.
“I think if people felt it would be helpful to them to understand how they might’ve been perceived at some point and if they are curious,” she said. “I don’t think they learn much about our process, because our process is a series of discussions and conversations.”
On its admissions website, Harvard states that its "admissions process enables us to give deliberate and meticulous consideration of each applicant as a whole person" and "considers growth and potential, interests and activities, character and personality, and contribution to the Harvard community."
Short of major changes to FERPA or to the admissions process itself, McGrath said that the material available to students will remain the same for the foreseeable future.
“Students have a federally-guaranteed right to see their educational records—that’s the definition under which they can view their folders,” McGrath said. “I don’t know what the future will bring, but I’m not aware of any changes that will be made.”
The lack of clear information ultimately led some students to think about their place at Harvard differently. For some students seeking an explanation for their acceptance letter, the experience turned out more painful than they expected.
“It certainly wasn’t the most glamorous comments about me, so in some aspects it did kind of hurt,” Barham said. “That really puts a lens on it: do you really deserve to be here?”
Katherine M. Vincent ’19, who viewed her file her freshman year, said she did so out of a sense of “impostor syndrome”—the feeling that, deep down, she didn’t really belong at Harvard.
Viewing her admissions file, she said, didn’t quite give her the assurance she was looking for. But upon reflection, Vincent said she ultimately realized her experiences at the College matter much more than lingering questions about her admission.
“At the end of the day it made me realize it doesn’t matter why I got in—what matters are the friendships I make, the classes I take, extracurriculars, that’s what will stick with me,” she said. “Ultimately, for whatever reason, I got in and I might as well just go with it.”
Barham said he had too come to terms with his comments.
“I don’t think that there’s a Harvard type,” he said. “You’re here, so you have to make the best out of it.”
When Government and Sociology Professor Theda R. Skocpol learned Donald Trump would be the 45th president of the United States, it was the middle of the semester for USW 31: “American Society and Public Policy,” a class she co-teaches with Sociology Professor Mary C. Waters.
Skocpol said the themes of the class, which examines how policy issues and inequality manifest in American society, had come to national prominence throughout the contentious 2016 campaign season. Shortly after the election, she met with enrolled students outside of regular course hours to debrief.
“The outcome of the election was a surprise to a lot of people, and so we scheduled an extra meeting to talk about what some of the kinds of social trends that had been at work in the election might be, although that was at an early stage where there hadn’t been a lot of time for people to gather even all the data, let alone reflect on it,” Skocpol said.
While Trump may have given new relevance to some issues in the course, Skocpol said the idea that Trump would change how or what professors teach at Harvard is “ridiculous.”
“We’ve been teaching that course for years, and the purpose of the course is to think about how policy issues and politics and inequality play out in American society,” she said. “We didn’t change it because of Donald Trump.”
Other instructors agreed. While Trump’s election may have shocked academics and students at Harvard—derided by some conservatives as a liberal enclave, a “Kremlin on the Charles”—several professors say his presidency has not fundamentally altered the way they teach their courses.
“I have been teaching at universities both before and after the Trump election, and there are some things that have changed,” History and Literature lecturer Emily Pope-Obeda said. “But at the end of the day, I think a lot of the things that are going on with this administration are actually just bringing to light tensions that existed within university spaces in the first place.”
Because of some of the Trump administration’s controversial stances—like skepticism of climate change—several professors said there is a need for increased dialogue about these issues in the classroom.
Environmental Science and Engineering Professor Daniel P. Schrag, a former member of President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, emphasized the importance of courses on climate change such as Science of the Physical Universe 29: “The Climate-Energy Challenge.”
“I think it’s really important that every Harvard student has access to a really good course on climate change and how to solve it with energy technology,” Schrag said. “I’m continuing to teach this course, I think, partly because of President Trump, because I feel like we need more Gen Ed courses that are about this topic.”
Schrag said he hopes that the Trump presidency encourages Harvard to offer more classes focused on this topic.
“Students at Harvard should understand the observations, the evidence, for why climate change is a serious concern for their future and for the future of the world, and should think about what a responsible path to dealing with it is,” he said.
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Professor Ali Asani, who teaches courses on Islam, said he thinks Trump’s presidency emphasizes a  high degree of “religious illiteracy” in the United States.
“One of the things that I’ve done in trying to teach about Islam, especially my Gen Ed courses, is to create an awareness of this broader spectrum, and that when people hear things in the media about any sort of declarations about Islam, no matter by whom, they should be asking about which Islam, whose Islam, in which context,” he said.
In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. In wake of the order, some Iranian-American Harvard affiliates said they felt unwelcome in the United States.
Asani said that, in his courses, he hopes to provide historical context so students—both Muslim and non-Muslim—will realize the situation will not always look so “bleak.”
“I sought on the one hand, in my courses, to provide students who are Muslim who are taking my courses, a sense [that]… history goes in waves,” he said. “It’s cyclical.”
Khalil G. Muhammad, a professor of history, race, and public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, said he found that although much of his syllabus for Democracy, Politics, and Institutions 931: “Race, Inequality, and American Democracy” remained identical to that of past years, Trump’s election and presidency has offered additional opportunities to tie historical issues to contemporary ones.
“My syllabus was mostly built before the election, and the content of the course has a large focus on history, particularly United States-based anti-racist ideas, practices, and policies. And, as such, whether Trump were president or not, 95 percent of the content would be there anyway,” Muhammad said. “That being said, because Trump has been so articulate for a set of ideas that have been recurring in American history, he and his positions have been very prominent, contemporary examples that connect the past to the present.”
Muhammad said the current political climate offers unique opportunities for faculty who teach courses about United States politics and domestic policies.
“I think, in many ways, it is an ethical imperative for being educators in a time when you couldn’t ask for better material to illustrate how important these issues are,” he said.
In addition to necessitating increased dialogue, some Harvard faculty say the Trump administration's actions over the past year mean there is a need to represent a more diverse set of narratives and viewpoints in their classrooms.
“I think what’s frustrating and overwhelming to a lot [of students] about what they’re seeing in the news is that there isn’t that diversity of representation. These voices aren’t being portrayed,” Pope-Obeda said. “So what we end up talking about is how much more you can see when you read somebody’s story than you can from seeing pictures in the news.”
Pope-Obeda, who teaches History and Literature 90CT: “Deportation and the Policing of Migration in U.S. History,” said it is important to read texts that represent the diversity of voices in underrepresented groups, as opposed to works that simply state how these groups have been affected.
“I think it’s really important to have a syllabus and curriculum that doesn’t just show the events of the time period, but also shows the discussions,” she said.
Tali Zechory, a preceptor in French, said the humanities are an important area in which to engage with politics.
“I think that what we do in the humanities, when we look at texts, we look at different kinds of voices, and we think about how people mobilize and use language to express this. When we think about that, that helps us understand what’s going on. That helps us understand the world, and I think that’s crucial,” she said.
Government and African American Studies Professor Jennifer L. Hochschild said she has worked to include viewpoints she personally disagrees with in her class United States in the World 15: “Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration: From Obama to Trump.” Trump has also inspired a change to the subtitle of the course—it used to be called “Is the American Racial Order Being Transformed?”
“I’m trying to incorporate, probably more seriously than I have, genuinely conservative views into the class, because clearly, this country is much more mixed on issues of race, ethnicity, and immigration than I at least would like it to be. But again, I feel like my responsibility as a professor, [and] students’ responsibility as students, is to engage with people they disagree with,” Hochschild said.
Government Professor Joshua D. Kertzer, who teaches Government 1790: "American Foreign Policy," said Trump’s presidency has left its mark on his teaching.
“The course definitely has the same structure, but it’s that some of the topics resonate more—or have new meaning—now than they did before,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final word on the College's penalties on members of single-gender social groups, which has divided the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for months, was met with limited protest from the attendees at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
University Drew G. Faust’s announcement that the Harvard Corporation had voted Monday to maintain the current sanctions on unrecognized final clubs, fraternities and sororities failed to incite the drama of recent Faculty meetings—some of which had to be moved to larger venues to accomodate heightened interest. Because Faust made the announcement during the President’s Business, it did not appear on the meeting’s agenda beforehand.
Ultimately, a proposal on advanced standing drew more argument at Tuesday’s meeting than the fate of the College’s unprecedented penalties against single-gender groups.
Members of the Faculty were the first to receive the news. As Faust spoke, the letter arrived in the email inboxes of faculty and students.
Faust read a letter co-signed by herself and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, and then offered brief personal remarks on the decision, which were followed by sustained applause from the Faculty.
“We need to affirm the educational and humane power of diversity and the importance of each one of our students so they all can feel that they too, are Harvard,” she said after reading the prepared statement.
English professor James T. Engell ’73, a longtime sanctions opponent, was one of just two professors to respond to Faust’s announcement at the meeting. He raised concerns of Faculty governance, arguing that it is historically the purview of the Faculty to legislate on matters of student discipline.
“The statement that you read is definitive in saying that the actions that remain in place are not a form of discipline,” Engell said. “Why does the Corporation not regard this as a matter of discipline?”
Many other vocal sanctions opponents, such as Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, were not in attendance. He later declined to comment on the Corporation’s decision.
Anthropology professor Arthur Kleinman, while supportive of the Corporation’s decision, questioned whether Faust and Lee’s statement adequately addressed the moral and personal development of Harvard’s undergraduates.
“The point of academic development is obviously central to what we do, but moral and emotional development has always been central to the idea of the University,” Kleinman said. “I was surprised that from the educational dimension of the statement that was read, we didn’t hear about the University’s responsibility for the emotional and moral development.”
After the meeting, professors had mixed reactions to the decision.
“I support it about 55 percent, and the other 45 percent is reservations. I’m worried about the sororities,” History Department Chair Daniel L. Smail said after the meeting. “There's sort of collateral damage there.”
“I think actually it excludes people; it doesn’t include people. It excludes people who want to have a good time in college and I wasn’t that type, so I didn’t mind being excluded,” Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 said.
Faust had planned on waiting to make her announcement until the Faculty had completed discussion on a series of motions brought forth this semester. The final remaining motion on the topic, from East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor David L. Howell, aimed to affirm that, when multiple values come into conflict in the University, it is up to faculty and administrators to balance them.
However, Howell formally requested to withdraw his motion at the meeting on Tuesday, drawing no objection from the Faculty.
“We’re all suffering from motion sickness, so perhaps giving people dramamine for the soul would be helpful,” Howell said. “Perhaps my sin is that I think of the Faculty and administration as partners rather than adversaries. I don’t see how a college in the 21st century could be otherwise. Perhaps we should have a conversation about faculty governance, but I don't think my motion is the proper vehicle for that discussion.”
More contentious to the Faculty in attendance than Faust’s announcement, however, was Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris’s proposal to substantially change the College’s Advanced Standing program, which allows undergraduates to either graduate in three years or earn a master’s degree in four years.
If the motion passes next semester, all students will be eligible for Advanced Standing; previously, students were required to have earned high scores on several Advanced Placement exams before entering Harvard. Now, students must take five classes for six semesters in order to complete a master’s degree in four years, and they can not graduate in three years.
Five professors raised various concerns about the proposal, such as the untenability of earning master’s and undergraduate degrees in four years and the important reasons certain students might have for graduating in three years.
“I view this as an instance of us deciding to shoot ourselves in the foot and give ourselves a self-inflicted wound with regards to the master’s program,” Computer Science professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher ’91 said, speaking of the importance of the Advanced Standing program in recruiting top CS students.
The Faculty also approved changes to the College’s cross-registration policies, limiting students to eight credits at Harvard’s other schools, and voted to push Faculty meeting times up one hour to 3:00 p.m. for the 2018-2019 school year.

Elizabeth C. Keto ’18, a History of Art and Architecture concentrator and Crimson Arts Chair, will take her passions for art history and curating to the United Kingdom as Harvard's only 2018 Marshall Scholar.
Keto, one of 43 U.S. recipients of the Marshall Scholarship, will use the funds for a two-year master’s degree program at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. She plans on studying art history and will enroll in a program called “Curating the Art Museum.”
The tuition, travel fares, and cost of living expenses will be covered by the Marshall Scholarship, which is funded by the British government and allows recipients to study at any university in the U.K. The goal of the scholarship is to “strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments and their institutions,” according to the Marshall Scholarship website.
Keto, a Quincy House resident, said she was attracted to the Courtauld Institute because it boasts the well-known Courtauld Gallery, which hosts the university’s art collection. Ultimately, she said she’d like to pursue a career in “museum work and curating,” the culmination of a long-held passion for drawing and painting and her experience studying art history at Harvard. She said she wants to ensure that people of all identities and backgrounds are able to create and enjoy art.
“I definitely want to do something connecting works of art with the public,” Keto said. “I also think that now is a really important time for a new generation of curators to be coming in and thinking about how to make museums more inclusive, both in terms of the artists they represent, and in terms of the visitors they’re attracting.”
Keto began the process of applying for the scholarship last summer. She had to receive Harvard’s endorsement before she could proceed with the other parts of the application, which included essays and a panel interview. Keto found out she was selected in mid-November.
Sarah E. Lewis ’01, assistant professor of History of Art and Architecture and of African and African American Studies,  served as a mentor to Keto throughout the application process. Lewis is a former Marshall Scholar herself.
“I was thrilled but not in the least bit surprised when Elizabeth Keto let me know that she had been awarded the Marshall Scholarship,” Lewis wrote in an email. “I have no doubt that she will offer the field of art history new ways to consider its role in the creation of a more inclusive and just civic society.”

The College Democrats gathered at the Massachusetts State House Tuesday to press for the passage of five bills advocating for a wide range progressive of issues as part of their biannual Lobby Day.
At the State House, the Dems lobbied for five bills. A pair of bills dealt with campus sexual assault: One, in the House of Representatives, establishes a task force to create a model sexual assault survey to be distributed to students who attend universities in Massachusetts, while one in the Senate calls for universities to establish and adopt policies on dating and domestic violence.
The Dems also pushed for three bills in the House: One prohibiting the use of public resources for immigration enforcement purposes, one establishing a fund to improve working conditions for academics, and one aiming to reduce non-recycled materials by turning them into alternative fuels.
Each student was assigned to a task force that represented one of the five bills. Members of each group then met with state legislators throughout the day.
Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18, the legislative director of the College Democrats, said the Lobby Day  was well attended.
“We had about between 40 to 50 meetings scheduled, and then we’re going to do drop-ins to dozens of other offices,” Shafer-Ray said. “The hope is that we meet with legislators that are sitting on committees where our bills are, as well as the House leadership and Senate leadership.”
Alexander Z. Zhang ’20, the communications director of the College Democrats, said that although the lobbying event is not new, it has seen new changes this year.
“Last semester was really successful; we got a lot of meetings,” Zhang said. “But this semester, we were able to really target key legislators, so people on the committees that we need the bills to go through. So that’s one of the biggest changes.”
Shafer-Ray, an active Crimson columnist, added that the Dems have been preparing for the legislator meetings for months.
“I would say that Lobby Day isn’t just one event—it’s really been a series of events," they said. "It’s not just one like the one day we’re at the State House lobbying, it’s also all this build-up all semester where we’re sending persuasion emails to every single member of the State House.”
Shafer-Ray added that the meetings were successful. “We’ve been told by many staffers and legislators that by just showing that people really care about these bills and going to those meetings that we’re really making a difference and we’re really swaying opinion,” they said.
Representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier, co-sponsor of three of the House bills, echoed Shafer-Ray’s sentiments.
“I’m really confident with your help we’re gonna get these passed the finish line,” Farley-Bouvier said. “Once we’re able to do that here in Massachusetts, we’ll be able to take these bills and we can see that these bills being a model for other states across the country, knowing that in this realm that we are in right now, this era that we are in right now, it’s all about state by state passing the bills. We really can’t count on the federal government anymore to protect our citizens.”
The College Democrats will hold another Lobby Day in the spring semester.

Boston developer Ronald M. Druker has donated $15 million to the Harvard Graduate School of Design to renovate and expand Gund Hall, its 45 year-old Quincy St. home.
The gift, announced last Friday,  is the largest single donation ever made by an individual to the Design School.  Druker, a 1976 Design School Loeb Fellow, is known for leaving his mark on a number of buildings in the Boston area through his family’s namesake development firm the Druker Company.
Gund Hall, which opened in 1972, houses all departments of the school under one roof. The building provides studio and workspaces for 500 students and over 100 faculty—a capacity well under the the school’s 2016 matriculation of 826 students. The building’s limitations have been a source of contention between students and administrators in recent years, with some master’s students unable to find available desks.
“I kind of feel homeless,” then-Design School student Aman Singhvi said in 2016 on the lack of space.
Although the Design School has not specified plans for the renovation of Gund Hall, construction will likely include the construction of a new building.  The school also plans to rename its primary exhibition gallery the Druker Design Gallery.
Druker, who has advised and taught at Design School in a number of capacities—including chairing the school’s strategic planning committee—is involved in the planning of renovations funded by his donation, according to a Design School press release.
“For more than four decades, the Design School has played an integral role in both my professional and personal life. I’m pleased to have this opportunity to serve as a catalyst in creating the environment that fosters innovative design education,” Druker said in the press release.
The current building was designed by John H. Andrews, a 1958 Design School graduate. His selection was met with controversy after he was selected to design the building by then-University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 despite a unanimous recommendation from the school’s faculty to hold a competition for the design.
Drucker’s gift is the largest donation to Grounded Visionaries—the Design School's component of the Harvard Campaign—to be specifically allocated towards the expansion of the school’s facilities.

City councillors approved tens of thousands of dollars in funding to expand work programs and social help for homeless teens in the city at their weekly meeting Monday.
The Cambridge City Council allocated more than $35,000 to help the Cambridge Youth on Fire program, a drop-in center for young adults experiencing homelessness. The agency has impacted more than 3,000 youth since it opened in 2000, and provides services such as hot meals, health care and screening, and education programs.
The money came alongside other moves by the City Council to support teens in the city, including the allocation of funds to create a teen youth intern program at the Moore Youth Center.
Councillor Dennis J. Carlone was particularly excited by the programs, and said he hoped to see them expand to include more organizations and work areas.
“One thing this project could do is include the Charles River Basin maintenance,” he said, adding that they had expressed interest in a partnership. “Landscape maintenance is a great skill to learn and potential job employment.”
The City Manager’s team responded that as long as appropriate supervision was available, the city would be “absolutely” interested and would help facilitate that program.
The city also addressed expansions to its curbside composting program, which was approved for the creation of four new positions and the purchase of new bins and other infrastructure. The approved funding stands at roughly $1.4 million, the majority of which was a one-time upfront cost for new equipment.
Although they were in support of the expansion, multiple councillors voiced concerns about other issues, including the potential for increasing rodent problems, negative environmental impacts where the waste  compost ends up, and data privacy.
The bins, which come with barcodes that are scanned when they are collected, allows the city to track data about the bins, which some councillors saw little value in.
“What are we going to tell them ‘you’re not composting enough,’” Carlone said. “My data is my own.”
Councillors also discussed concerns that large, long-term construction and urban development projects were impacting access to small businesses as well as another resolution that impacts the ownership of beehives by Cantabrigians.
The current slate of city councillors have two more meetings this term. The newly-elected councillors will be sworn in on Jan. 1.

UPDATED: December 6, 2017 at 11:56 a.m.
Harvard’s next president will be unable to easily alter the College’s policy on single-gender social organizations, limiting the authority of the University’s top office on one of the most contentious campus issues in recent memory.
The Harvard Corporation—not University President Drew G. Faust alone—made the final call about the future of undergraduate social life at Harvard, ending more than a year of debate about the policy. At a meeting Monday in Loeb House, the Corporation voted to maintain the controversial policy Faust first announced in May 2016.
That policy bars members of single-gender social groups—beginning with current freshmen—from holding campus leadership positions, serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious post-graduate fellowships. Sticking with the policy was one of three options recommended to Faust by a committee tasked with reviewing the sanctions.
While the policy hasn’t changed since its inception, the people calling the shots have. The Corporation’s vote Monday places responsibility for the policy—originally an initiative spearheaded by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—in the hands of the 13-member body to ensure continuity amid the uncertainty of a presidential transition.
Faust, who will step down in June, has also played an important role in the policy in the last 18 months: She unveiled it, has repeatedly defended it, and met with faculty reviewing it.
The decision to delimit the president’s authority represents a departure from the Corporation’s traditional patterns of behavior—and illustrates that the body’s power is virtually unchecked, according to major donor Peter L. Malkin ’55.
“I think that there’s no limitation on the power of the Corporation other than the Constitution of the United States,” Malkin, who has also served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, said. “So I think it’s an involvement in regulation of student life that’s unusual for the Corporation, but I think it’s clearly not ultra vires—it’s not outside their authority.”
In a letter to Harvard affiliates Tuesday afternoon announcing the decision, Faust and senior fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72 outlined the rationale behind maintaining the policy and made the case for the Corporation’s enhanced role—arguing that the Corporation was poised to consider “legal considerations,” alumni relations, and “the responsibility of the University to meet the non-academic needs of its student body and to define the fundamental character of the College itself.”
“Each of these considerations implicates the fiduciary responsibilities of the board—all the more so, at this moment of presidential transition, when the community has an interest in being assured that the decision announced today is not contingent on the occupant of Massachusetts Hall,” Lee and Faust wrote.
The Corporation will review the policy after five years, when members will present a report to the Faculty assessing its efficacy. Whoever becomes Harvard’s next president in July will have no choice but to oversee its implementation for the first few years of his or her tenure.
Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge area lawyer who represents the all-male Fly Club, said he doesn’t pity Harvard’s next president.
“It shows a lack of a respect for whoever that is going to be tapped to be the new president,” he said. “I can’t imagine that a new president of Harvard would be particularly happy assuming office with this hornet's nest the first thing to greet me.”
But the presidential search committee has previously indicated it is likely to choose someone who will embrace the challenge.
Lee said in an interview last month that he expects the search committee’s pick to share Faust’s views on single-gender social organizations.
“I'm quite certain that whoever we pick is going to make the issue of diversity and inclusion and the issue of Harvard being a place that is open, accepting, and comfortable for everybody we bring here—it's going to be one of the priorities of the new president," Lee said. "If that's true, then it’s very unlikely that they’re going to have a radically different view than we have on things like the single-gender organizations."
All 15 members of the search committee—composed of the Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—took their current governing board positions under Faust, who said at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting that she considers efforts to reduce the influence of single-gender social organizations a cornerstone of her legacy.
“As I approach the end of my presidency, I see one of the central emphases and commitments of my nearly 11 years in office as the expansion of access, the emphasis on inclusion and belonging,” Faust told faculty members.
"I see the consideration of the issues surrounding the [unrecognized single-gender social organizations] as very much within that movement toward opening opportunity and eliminating arbitrary exclusion,” she added.
With implementing the policy already on the agenda, changing undergraduate social life may inevitably be part of the next president’s legacy as well.

UPDATED: December 6,  2017 at 3:12 p.m.
Single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations met the news that Harvard will not be changing its penalties against them with the same condemnations they’ve lodged against the University in the year and a half since the policy debuted.
Members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted Monday to keep the policy as it was when University President Drew G. Faust first announced it in May 2016.
The new stamp of approval did little to sway long-time critics of the policy, which, starting with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions, becoming varsity captains, or receiving endorsements for a number of prestigious fellowships.
Graduate president of the Fly Club Richard T. Porteus ’78 said the decision was “not surprising,” adding that the announcement did not change the Fly’s calculus in responding to the policy.
“The Fly will act to preserve its autonomy,” Porteus said. “But Harvard is still in the ‘I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down’ phase of all of this, and until we feel the wind, we’re not going to spend unnecessary money on legal strategizing.”
“We’ve put in place what we need to, and we will respond in an appropriate way when there is something to respond to,” he said. “And at this point, there isn’t. It’s talk, and we’re as curious as anyone what this talk amounts to.”
The Fly Club had previously retained legal counsel to explore options, including a potential lawsuit, to challenge the College’s policy.
Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge lawyer who represents the Fly Club, said he was disappointed in the decision.
“[Harvard] stubbornly stuck to what I think is a decision that violates the independence of its own students, the autonomy of its own students, and is very ill-considered,” Silverglate said.
Silverglate, a longtime critic of the University, said Tuesday that he and his clients will continue to weigh “several options.”
“I will be meeting with my fellow counsel and with my clients over the next few days and weeks to discuss this,” Silverglate said.
Silverglate declined to comment on whether he was providing legal counsel for single-gender groups other than the Fly.
Heather Kirk, a spokesperson for the North-American Interfraternity Conference, also slammed the Corporation’s decision in an emailed statement. The NIC is the national umbrella organization for three of Harvard’s off-campus fraternities: Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Sigma Chi.
“Harvard could not be more wrong,” the statement reads. “It’s ironic that one of the most exclusive institutions in the world is limiting what organizations students can join. This infringement on a citizen’s basic rights must be challenged.”
Bartle Bull ’60, a graduate member of the A.D. Club, also condemned the policy.
“As a former civil rights lawyer in Mississippi, Crimson editor, officer of a Harvard final club, publisher of The Village Voice, New York State campaign manager for Robert Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, and worker in Afghanistan for women’s education, I believe that Harvard’s policy regarding single-gender social organizations is an exercise in intolerance and discrimination and violates constitutional principles of freedom of association,” he wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
Newly sworn-in Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice-President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, despite previously voicing support for “the idea” of penalties on single-gender social groups during their campaign, did not take a position on Faust and the Corporation’s decision in a statement Tuesday.
“This has been a long process for many students, and we respect that this news can come with a variety of responses. As the leaders of the Harvard Undergraduate Council, we believe in a Harvard college that is inclusive, accepting, and welcoming to all students,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College spent 19 months trying to decide the fate of its social group penalties: It formed and consulted two separate committees, held a vote of the full Faculty on the subject, and produced three reports on the sanctions together totaling more than 90 pages.
But it took the Harvard Corporation just a few hours Monday to put an end to the saga. Thirteen Corporation members—prominent lawyers, business magnates, and academics among them—jetted into Cambridge, stepped into sleek black cars, and were chauffeured to Loeb House to vote to maintain Harvard’s penalties.
With the vote, not only did the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—reshape the future of Harvard’s social clubs, but it also plunged into an ongoing debate about who gets to mold undergraduate life at the College.
Since University President Drew G. Faust announced the College’s social group policy—which, starting with the current freshman class, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and prestigious fellowships—in May 2016, it has sparked widespread debate among students, professors, and outside critics. At stake was not only the policy itself, but the governance of the University.
In particular, some professors charged that administrators should have involved them in the policy-making process, inspiring vigorous debates across months of Faculty meetings. The discussions have focused as much on the principle of shared governance as on the clubs themselves. That debate ended Monday.
At Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, English professor James T. Engell ’73—who claimed last fall that the policy “threatens a constitutional fabric”—asked why the policy decision was made by the Corporation when student discipline, according to the University statutes, falls under the purview of the Faculty.
“If we’re going to have shared governance, it needs to be shared governance,” he said.
Engell’s comment was only the latest flare-up in more than a year of faculty pushback.
The most vocal anti-sanctions advocate, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, introduced two motions designed to counter the College’s policy over the past year and a half. He withdrew the first after Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith convened a committee composed of faculty, students, and staff with the power to “revise or replace” the sanctions.
The second motion was voted down, 130-90, at the November 2017 Faculty meeting.
In a letter sent to Harvard affiliates announcing the results of the vote, Faust and Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 wrote that the Corporation was grateful for faculty feedback throughout the formulation of the penalties.
“We wish to close by expressing our deep appreciation for the work of the… Faculty as a whole,” Faust and Lee wrote. “We have developed a deeper understanding of the complexity of the issues presented by the USGSOs.”
After the motion failed, and after the Corporation’s decision Monday, Peter L. Malkin ’55, a prominent donor, said he thinks the Faculty have now effectively ceded power to the administration.
“I think the real shift is that the Corporation and the Faculty have agreed to give this authority to the administration, whereas I think historically it would have been the role of the Faculty,” he said.  “But I think the Faculty passed on an opportunity to enforce its authority. And to the extent that the Faculty suffers a diminution of its authority in general, it’s the Faculty’s own doing.”
Not only does the Corporation’s vote close a debate about University governance, it also marks intervention into an area usually left untouched by the body: undergraduate social life.
University governing boards do not often wade into undergraduate social affairs. Charles A. Shorter, a member of the board of trustees for the City University of New York, said it is atypical for university trustees in the CUNY system to weigh in on student life.
“Very seldom have we as trustees gotten involved in student life decisions unless it is requested and unless it becomes an issue that quite frankly is system-wide,” he said.
Former Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane said the move is not wholly unprecedented at Harvard, though.
“The Corporation has periodically dealt with student issues throughout my time there,” she said in an interview in April. “We don’t tend to get into the details of student life routinely, but we have several times, and we are responsible overall for the health and welfare of the University in the broadest fiduciary sense.”
When this has happened, the president or FAS Dean has typically brought the matter to the Corporation’s attention, according to Keohane.
In their letter, Faust and Lee took pains to detail a rationale for the body’s involvement. Faust and Lee wrote the sanctions “implicate a range of fundamental institutional interests” under the Corporation’s purview, including possible legal challenges and alumni concern over the final clubs.
“Perhaps most importantly, the decision speaks to the responsibility of the University to meet the non-academic needs of its student body and to define the fundamental character of the College itself,” Faust and Lee wrote.
Faust previously said she thinks the Corporation has ultimate power to determine the fate of student social life.
On Monday, it did.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LEXINGTON, Ky. — A 17-2 run by No. 7 Kentucky midway through the second half lifted the hosts to a 79-70 win over the Harvard men’s basketball team on Saturday afternoon. The stretch blew the roof off an otherwise back-and-forth contest that saw the Crimson at arm’s length for most of the game’s first 26 minutes.
A fast start from the Wildcats put the seventh-ranked team in the country in the driver’s seat early on. However, a series of three-pointers found the bottom of the net for Harvard, getting the Crimson within five by the intermission. Sophomore forward Seth Towns was the catalyst and high-point man for Harvard (3-6), finishing the game with 25 points off the bench, the majority of which came off of triples. Freshmen Hamidou Diallo and Kevin Knox paced Kentucky (7-1), combining for 39 points on 14 made field goals.
LIVING AND DYING BY THE THREE
While missed jumpers and the ensuing long rebounds played a major role in creating a first half deficit, three-pointers would ultimately allow the Crimson to stay competitive for much of the afternoon. Sophomore forward Chris Lewis was bullied inside by the Wildcats’ massive frontline, a reality that also made the paint a no-fly zone for Harvard’s perimeter players. But the Crimson played the hand that it was dealt.
Twenty-one of Harvard’s 37 first half points came from beyond the arc. While typically one of the ball club’s top marksman, Towns had to shoot himself out of a funk on Saturday. Less than 48 hours after registering just two points in 11 minutes against Northeastern, a performance that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said “really hurt” the Crimson’s chances, Towns was back with a vengeance against the Wildcats. The sophomore converted on his first four tries from long range and was the one player that Kentucky’s defense consistently struggled to contain.
“I was pleased with how Seth came off the bench for us and gave us a shot in the arm,” Amaker said. “I’m hoping that we can use portions of this game to get our team to become a better basketball team.”
While Towns led the charge, freshman forward Danilo Djuricic got in on the action before the break. Playing in front of an estimated 22,922 spectators did not appear to faze the rookie, who hit two three-pointers in the first half, the second of which cut the Wildcat lead to three. The love of the long ball was nothing new for Harvard—the team entered Rupp Arena averaging 22.6 three-pointers per contest. The success, however, was, as the Crimson shot 42.9 percent from long range, a far cry from its 26.5 percent season average before Saturday.
“Give Harvard credit,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. “They shot the ball. [Amaker] did a great job of putting his people in positions. It was another good game for us to play where another team’s not going to just give us a win. This team needs that.”
Sophomore guard Bryce Aiken did not catch the same bug that struck Towns and Djuricic, however. Aiken converted on just one of his seven attempts from long range. Likewise, junior sharpshooter Corey Johnson made only one of his three attempts on the afternoon.
Harvard’s momentum from beyond the arc did not carry into the second half, a variable that helped spark the decisive Kentucky run. After seven threes in the first half, the Crimson converted on just two triples through the first 13 minutes of the second half. Turnovers plagued Harvard during the stretch, and the Wildcats took advantage. By the time freshman guard Reed Farley ended the three-point drought with a pair of long balls, the game was already out of reach for the visitors.
SWITCHING IT UP DEFENSIVELY
Although Harvard, like most teams in the country, cannot compete with Kentucky’s size and athleticism, it tried to neutralize the Wildcats by giving different looks on the defensive end. Early in the first half, Amaker resorted to a zone defense, a tactic that he rarely employs, to try to stymie a hot start from the hosts.
“We think that once we get ahead we can take our foot off the gas and take it a little easy, but Division-I basketball at this high level, you can’t do that and teams will get back in it,” said Kentucky freshman guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
The move made sense on paper since Kentucky entered the contest having made just 32 three-point attempts all season and had attempted just two triples before the switch. But the tactic also marked a major risk for a team that has struggled to consistently stop opponents using man-to-man defense.
“We were trying to see if we can disrupt rhythm,” Amaker said. “Obviously in an environment like this, they can really get it going and if we can kind of slow it down or create tempo that we want, [they can’t]. We can sometimes do that by changing defenses and it had its moments where it was effective, but no matter what defense you play, they’re just hard to keep off the backboard.”
The ploy paid off in that Kentucky was inefficient from long range. However, the Wildcats feasted on second-chance points and transition buckets.
“I thought they did a tremendous job of [offensive rebounding] and driving in, slashing to the basket and certainly attacking the glass,” Amaker said.
In the five-plus minutes that Amaker employed a zone defense in the first half, Kentucky converted on just one of its five three-point attempts. However, the cold shooting was overshadowed by three offensive rebounds, two layups, and a dunk by the Wildcats. The Crimson only managed to cut the deficit from six points to four during the stretch.
Amaker returned to zone after Lewis trimmed the Kentucky lead to seven with a pair of free throws, but it did not matter.
A turnover fest for the Crimson on the offensive end, headlined by a string of six straight possessions with a giveaway, meant that Kentucky could run like the horses that bring natives of the Bluegrass State so much joy. The Wildcats thrived in transition off Harvard turnovers and rarely needed to get set during its 13-0 run spanning a mere 3:05.
“It got away from us a little bit and I thought that was our inability to maintain composure on the offensive end, which is a little disappointing for us,” Amaker said. “We have to do that in an environment like this.”
