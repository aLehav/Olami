After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CLARIFICATION APPENDED
“Up until LSD, I never realized that there was anything beyond this normal working state of consciousness,” George Harrison famously said in 1987. “But all the pressure was such that, as Bob Dylan said, ‘There must be some way out of here.’ I think for me it was definitely LSD. The first time I took it, I just blew everything away. I had such an incredible feeling of well being, that there was a God and I could see Him in every blade of glass. It was like gaining hundreds of years experience within 12 hours. It changed me and there was no way back to what I was before. It wasn’t all good, though, because it left quite a lot of questions as well.”
Forty-five years after the fateful day when Bob Dylan took another position in the book of rock legend by introducing The Beatles to marijuana, these two acts still remind the contemporary world of the vast possibilities that mind-altering substances provide in creative pursuits—and their potentially world-changing implications.
Present-day artists continue to seek ways to emerge from a hackneyed state of consciousness—where the sky is blue and grass is green—into a kaleidoscopic world where they can discover new possibilities for their work. And despite stereotypes to the contrary, Harvard has a definite community of drug using, and promising, artists who embrace their ability to both connect with one another on various mental levels and break free of the constraints imposed by the insular “Harvard bubble.”
“I feel like it’s the kind of people who like to have conversations and are interesting,” says a senior Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, referring to those Harvard artists who use drugs. “They like to get high and get out of this bubble that is Harvard, that is oppressive and socially limited and makes you jump through hoops all day and sometimes you need to get out of your own bullshit and just shoot the shit.”
Whether you call it “getting out of your own bullshit” to “just shoot the shit” or something else, many artists on campus use drugs—mostly alcohol and marijuana—as a means to find their way out of here, and to some extent, to find a way out of their own minds. Lighting a bong or hitting the bottle, these students use conscious-altering substances to lubricate the transition from thought to work, a process possible when sober but sometimes easier while not. Some use the activity as a communal starting point, gathering around campus to drink or smoke before setting off to work. At other times, they sit alone with a bottle of wine or a well-rolled joint, pondering words and paint.
Yet despite this dabbling, Harvard mothers needn’t start worrying that their Ivy dollars are contributing to the mass decay of society. Users on campus, despite being users, are ultimately still Harvard students, too concerned about their academic success and artistic integrity to fall into serious dependency. When all is said and done, they want to produce high-quality art that will resonate with an audience on an emotional, intellectual level, not a chemical one.
BREAKING THE SEAL
“[It’s] evident to everyone that [The Beatles] entered their most fertile creative period after they began smoking grass and taking LSD,” wrote Extension School instructor John McMillian in an email; he is currently working on a book about the legendary band. “Same for Bob Dylan. And I can think of several major writers, like Edgar Allen Poe, Aldous Huxley and Jack Kerouac, whose use of narcotics, hallucinogens and stimulants apparently enhanced their work. But certainly there was a destructive side to this as well. Diminishing returns set in pretty quickly, and several of the people I just mentioned ended up suffering mightily because of their use of drugs. This may well be a question worth researching, but I would never suggest that someone try to enhance their creativity by experimenting with drugs in an unsupervised setting.” Like the many greats who preceded them, student artists—both poets and painters—use drugs to ease the process of creation.
“I oftentimes smoke marijuana before going to the seven hour VES classes or before I work on a piece,” says one student, “but less for creative inspiration than for getting the mind and body into a sort of a mode for allowing the creativity to come. It helps you not get fixated on a certain idea or color and allows a little more flow in the creation of whatever you’re making.”
Most students agree that these drugs don’t provide creative thoughts; rather, they loosen the constraints of a rational human mind and build the confidence necessary to express unique or nonsensical ideas. “Drugs can sometimes facilitate a person’s ability to differently represent the creativity that is already inside him,” says Justin B. Wymer ’12, a poet, who admits to occasionally using alcohol outside of its societally-sanctioned role as a conversation starter and instead as a literary jumpstart.
“Sometimes I drink just a little bit because it is a way to break consciousness,” he says. “I don’t think drinking makes me more creative. But I think it makes me less afraid to say the creative thoughts that I already have.”
This artistic objective to break with a preconceived reality comes from a long line of poetic thought, reaching all the way back to Andre Breton and the origins of surrealism. By breaking with the predetermined images of the world in their accepted states and by embracing the unconscious, which does not play by the rules of reality, artists can shed insight on society in interesting and progressive ways.
“For me, colors and tastes really cross over with the other senses. And a lot of times whenever I’m sober [I think], ‘Wow, people are going to think that sounds crazy,’” Wymer says. “But when I say that someone talks to me in cinnamon when I’m not as inhibited as much with alcohol, I’m not afraid to write it.”
Lingering in the unconscious can thus produce unique and seemingly illogical thoughts, but it takes an artist’s trained, and sometimes tripped-out, mind to grasp the images produced there and recreate them on the conscious level.
If a little liquor can reduce self-critical anxiety and facilitate the flow of creative thought, who wouldn’t want to indulge in such an effective weapon? Not all students are on board the yellow submarine—or any other color submarine for that matter.
Ingrid V. Pierre ’12, a devout Buddhist and VES fine arts concentrator, chooses to abstain from drug use entirely, and the idea of usage while undertaking creative pursuits strikes her as particularly unsavory.
“Being a Zen Buddhist is all about freeing yourself from any unnatural elements, which will hinder your own ability to pursue what you want to achieve in life. In my case that’s to make art,” she says. “In the fine arts department, it’s about being fluid and free while also staying focused.”
While some students may take a toke before picking up the paintbrush, Pierre is wary of the consequences of drug use and their effects compromising the integrity of her art. She is determined to pursue her painting with an unadulterated state of mind.
“I don’t particularly like all the stuff The Beatles did when they were high. I think it cheapens everything,” Pierre says. “[Drug use] does get in the way of art making and an honest representation of your skills... I think it’s possible for people to produce good work when they’re high. But if you rely upon that as your sole artistic inspiration, it’s an awful thing. What happens when you don’t have access to it?”
BLAZING NEW PATHS
Yet most artists on campus are far from dependent on their drug use. Realizing the potential dangers of an addictive habit and not needing to always be high, they deviate from the stoner stereotype, just as likely to be taking drugs to focus as to chill out.
“I think the whole idea of a stoned artist is a cliché. It’s not real and especially not at Harvard,” Pierre says. “People here are very conceptual, but they don’t need drugs to augment that.”
In addition to the intelligence on which they can rely, Harvard students are simply too busy to pause long enough to have the extensive, conscious-altering experience that can produce creative results in a timely, practical way.
“For me, it [marijuana use] is not the creative inspiration—it’s not some hallucinogenic experience,” says a junior VES concentrator. “I don’t know how much time people here have for that.”
“[Creative writers] drink a lot before they write. Visual arts people smoke more. People here are really too serious, though, at least about their academic ventures,” she adds.
For some, this dedication to academics made Harvard more appealing than schools for the arts.
“I chose to come to Harvard [instead of RISD] because I didn’t like the scene,” Pierre says, considering her comparative impression of drug use at either school. “All the stereotypes of an artist, that’s what you see there.”
Psychology professor Shelley H. Carson affirms the notion that drugs may be less present on our campus in comparison to others. “I would expect there to be less drug use in the artistic community at Harvard, because their ability to be an artist depends on their ability to stay in school,” she says.
Being an artist at Harvard also usually means a great respect for the creative process. “I think the people at Harvard are much more cerebral,” Pierre says. “They care more about the work they are producing. They are really sincere.”
This insistence on artistic integrity and quality typically necessitates an inclusion of a sober perspective even when the artwork was produced under the influence. “Even for me, whenever I occasionally write while I drink, it still takes me being sober to go through and edit and do revisions,” Wymer says. “It’s not that every time I drink and write it’s going to be fantastic.”
Indeed, many acknowledge that the work they create while drunk or high may not consistently be of the greatest quality. “Sometimes it’s shit,” he continues. “Sometimes it’s not.”
DIFFERENT STRAINS
The times that it’s not, however, do not necessarily indicate the magical effects of drug-induced, or drug-dependent, brilliance. From dissolving the inhibitions of artists to temporarily rearranging their worlds, drugs themselves play something of a placebo role in revealing creative insights.
“Although there is no reason to believe that marijuana enhances creativity, there is evidence that marijuana makes people feel more creative,” UC Davis Dean Keith Simonton says. “That seems to be because self-critical judgment gets turned off. Only later, when they’re no longer high, and they look at what they produced, do they realize that they were nowhere as creative as they thought at the time. The same holds for many other altered states of consciousness. We might have a particularly wonderful dream some night, but find that it bores our friends silly when we try to recount it.”
Yet the research that does exist has hypothesized that artists tend to be more open to and garner greater benefits from experimenting with drugs, even if these effects remain in the mind without translating onto paper or canvas. Researchers prospose that the magnitude of a substance’s psychological effects differs according to one’s genetic makeup. In her research review, “Creativity and Psychopathology: A Shared-Vulnerability Model,” Carson argues that creative individuals tend to respond more positively to the high that drugs induce, since their naturally less inhibited state is more conducive to artistic production. “Genetic vulnerability factors... may predispose certain individuals to experience altered mental states that provide access to—and interest in—associational material typically filtered out of conscious awareness during normal waking states,” Carson explained. “They are smoking because of that openness,” Simonton reiterates, “not open because they’re smoking.”
But the danger associated with substance abuse is always a lurking threat. Considering that the fine line between occasional use and dependence isn’t always so easy to maintain, Simonton warns that consistent drug use can quickly devolve into a harmful and unproductive habit. “The minimal research that has been conducted suggests that marijuana does not enhance creativity. In fact, it seems to depress creativity, especially when the use is chronic,” he writes in an email.
But these studies are not definitive because of the legal difficulties that the scientific community faces in attempting to validate the benefits of drug use oft cited by artists.
“The reason is simple: you can’t really conduct research in the laboratory,” Simonton writes in an email. “As a consequence, almost all investigations on the topic are questionnaire-survey type studies in which students are asked about their use of marijuana and then tested on measures associate with creativity. Because the studies are correlation rather than experimental, it’s hard to discern the causal relations.”
Hallucinogens, on the other hand, have been proven to play a more pivotal role in dictating the direction of an artist’s work. For example, LSD was commonly given to interested test subjects to gauge the drug’s effects and was found to disinhibit normal sensory perceptions, launching the artist into a potentially productive psychedelic experience. These more psychoactive drugs can actually become a type of muse that influence the content of the art, the most famous example of these acid trips being “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.”
Still, as one poet emphasizes, “If you want [your art] to be accessible to a lot of people, [drug use] is unlikely to be a regular thing.”
Owing to their awareness of the dangers of approaching their art from a drugged-out perspective, Harvard students continue to smoke and drink before, during, and after working, but only occasionally. These artists pull their art from a core of genuine creativity.
“I think that creativity that someone has is already inside the person,” Wymer says. “So the only thing that drugs do is release.”

CLARIFICATION
The Nov. 13 arts article "High Art" took a quote about drug use in art from Extension School instructor John McMillian out of context. In addition to saying that many artistic greats used drugs during their most creative periods, McMillan said that he does not advocate drug use and that some of the artists suffered mightily from the negative side effects of drugs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For decades, the business model of network television has been simple: NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX rent out our eyeballs to advertisers. Better programming, more eyeballs, more advertisers. People don’t pay to watch network TV—if anything, someone should have paid us to watch the last two seasons of “Heroes.”
Hulu, it seemed, understood this. Since March 2008, the website has provided premium network TV shows for free, legal online viewing. Hulu also carries non-network content from the likes of PBS, Bravo, E!, and A&E, not to mention a surprisingly adequate rotating buffet of B-movies. The site is even gracious enough to offer a choice between standard commercial breaks or a longer presentation at the start of the episode. It’s a perfect symbiotic relationship between viewer and network.
But on October 21, News Corporation—you can already tell something evil is coming, can’t you?—Deputy Chairman Chase Carey announced Hulu’s plans to introduce a subscription fee as soon as next year. I’d reference the goose that laid the golden eggs, but Rupert Murdoch probably owns the rights to it.
Much like print journalism, television has struggled to maintain its traditional business model in the face of Internet competition. Last fall, for instance, more viewers watched the debut of Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin on “Saturday Night Live” online than on TV. It would seem that the logical corporate strategy should be to remain firmly on the defensive—could you imagine the New York Times charging readers a fee to view the day’s articles on its website?
Indeed, the user-friendly approach worked marvelously for Hulu. In March 2009, YouTube reported more than fifteen times as many video views than Hulu, but the latter’s growth was nonetheless so rapid that it lead some analysts to speculate that Hulu might overtake YouTube in ad revenue this year. Now that Hulu has threatened us with a subscription fee, though, how will YouTube be affected?
It’s easy to see why, relatively, YouTube doesn’t represent a particularly attractive option to the major networks. Its uploaded videos are rife with copyright violations, and the user-flagging system for inappropriate content detection is less than efficient. But YouTube, a financial juggernaut since before its acquisition by Google, has nevertheless taken steps in Hulu’s direction. The site managed to swing deals with CBS, MGM, and Lions Gate to show full-length, high quality versions of their television shows and movies with advertisements.
And, since April of this year, YouTube has provided its users with this corporate-mandated content—but the pickings are slim. The highlights, by a significant margin, are “The Late Show with David Letterman,” “The View,” and the original “Star Trek” series. That’s hardly a balanced TV diet.
However, if Hulu were to charge a subscription fee, those choices would quickly become appealing to disgruntled former Hulu users. I am a firm believer in the economic viability of something for nothing, even when the something isn’t especially spectacular.
But forget YouTube—if Hulu charges a subscription fee, it places itself in direct competition with Netflix. The online DVD (and now Blu-Ray) rental giant, which has already effectively vanquished Blockbuster, is more than up for the challenge. In addition to the more than 100,000 titles available for rental by mail, Netflix offers over 12,000 movies and television shows for instant online viewing. As of now, Hulu is only licensed to show several trailing episodes of popular, currently airing shows, with the occasional complete series sneaking its way into the collection. Hulu would have to increase its scope exponentially to contend with Netflix.
The force that Hulu has most egregiously underestimated is piracy. As things stand, choosing to watch last week’s “30 Rock” on Hulu instead of MegaVideo is almost a statement of morality. It has never been easier to stream an illegal copy of a television show or film. And the resilience of guerilla TV is formidable; every time the FCC summons the judicial will to quash one website, another inevitably appears in its place. It’s hard to imagine that many of Hulu’s now-faithful viewers wouldn’t turn to illegal sources to fulfill their TV-watching needs for free.
To put this in perspective, let’s consider that Hulu has never been a grassroots, anti-establishment company. Its ownership is divided amongst News Corp, NBC Universal, and Disney. This raises questions as to how conflicts of interest on the board of directors will play out—if Hulu charges a subscription fee, will NBC still show full episodes of its shows for free on its own website? And how much will the subscription cost? We don’t have the facts.
As mystifying as Hulu’s plan may be, it’s hard to believe that its corporate overlords haven’t crunched the numbers. Besides, there are permutations of a subscription-based Hulu that would be more acceptable than others. I’d understand the implementation of premium, ad-free version for the criminally impatient or the addition of extra features accessible only to those who pay for them. And it would be hard to turn down a subscription if it offered access to a video library expanded to rival that of Netflix.
But failing that, I don’t think I’ll be convinced that anything should change. Consider this an ultimatum, Hulu. Give me free television, or give me—well, just give me the free television.

Imagine a play. Any play. Now remove the following elements: plot, character, setting, context. What remains is “Attempts on Her Life,” the play by Martin Crimp that opens tonight and runs until November 21 in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
The play is a set of 17 multilingual, multimedia vignettes centered around a theatrical construct named “Anne,” the production’s closest approximation of a main character.
“The arc of the show is that you’re introduced to this person, Anne, and you’re not absolutely certain of who she is,” says director Matthew C. Stone ’11, who is also a Crimson arts comper. “As the play goes on it attaches many different attributes to her, and by the end of it you see this identity that you started out with that’s been completely dissolved.”
Thematically, the play presents a plethora of modern issues—genocide, pornography, consumerism—exploring the destabilizing effects of these elements on Anne who is portrayed by multiple actors in different settings.
“People have claimed that this isn’t even a play; it was written without characters, without setting, without any context for the scenes whatsoever. You can literally go through and make anything you want out of them,” Stone explains. “There are two traditional ways of looking at it. The first method is to look at each scene as a distinct world and focus on the discontinuity of each scene and how each one addresses different issues in the modern world,” Stone says. “The other method is to look at the continuity of the way it’s written and the fact that each scene focuses on writers or people from the media constructing narratives around Anne.” This production, according to Stone, will focus on the middle ground between the two traditional interpretations.
Ella G. Gibson ’13, who plays several of the myriad versions of Anne, agrees with Stone on the essential lack of a central character. “A lot of the scenes are not character-driven but are driven by imagery, so a lot of the focus is on the imagery that the text evokes as opposed to the relationships between the characters,” she says.
“The definition of Anne is expanded over the course of the play until she’s not just a person; she could also be a product, and the play references her multiplicity,” says actor Joe G. Hodgkin ’12, who plays several of the peripheral male characters.
In addition to an absent central character, his play is insistently plotless, focused instead on the fragments of Anne’s identity and the issues that destroyed it.
“I don’t think the play suffers at all from not having a plot, because there’s still a sense of continuity to it,” muses Stone. “Tonally, Crimp writes with such a strong voice that that alone could tie together the whole piece... so there is a sense of continuity and structure throughout the whole thing, and it remains engaging the whole way through...It’s not a play that is interested in story in a traditional sense, but it’s definitely a play that is interested in making you think.”
Multiple forms of media are incorporated into the play, as are nine different languages ranging from Spanish to Croatian to Slovenian. “Another sort of theme in this play is how we talk about the world and how we process information about the world and talk about these elements,” Stone says. “And what those elements of the world do very nicely is they help elucidate those themes by mimicking media and technology in society.”
The show’s set continues the innovative removal of traditional theatrical elements present throughout the production, striving to destabilize and jar the audience. “Attempts” makes ample use of the Experimental Theater, scattering the seats into groups that are diffused across the black box space.
“We started passing around ideas during the summer over email. Basically we just wanted something really different... I don’t think that anyone has used the space in that way—diagonally, asymmetrical, and no seat risers, which is kind of atypical for [Loeb Ex] shows,” says co-set designer Snoweria Zhang ’12, who is also a Crimson photographer.
All of these bizarre elements combine to form the profound “Attempts on Her Life,” which asks some of the most prevalent questions of the modern world in the most uncommon ways.
“The core question in this play is ‘How do you know who anyone else is anymore?—yourself included,’” Stone says in between runs of one of the play’s numerous multilingual vignettes. “I think it asks us to consider a world where terrorism, genocide, and abuse and all these things are sort of the norm and then ask ourselves how we can go on living in this world and why we don’t give these things more thought.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Archie Jones is the English everyman: a bit dithering, culturally ignorant, but fiercely loyal in a pinch. Jones lives in an England haunted by the Second World War and the disintegration of the British Empire, one reeling from the influx of brown-skinned people with gleaming white teeth. He takes it all in his distinctly English way, his big eyes and open countenance accepting without understanding: “He liked people to get on with things, Archie. He kind of felt people should just live together, you know, in peace or harmony or something.”
But reality often isn’t that simple. London’s strange, new ethnic milieu—the setting of Zadie Smith’s amazing first novel “White Teeth”—is rife with fear and uncertainty. A generation on the decline—Archie’s generation—retreats into an imagined past for comfort, while the next struggles with a seemingly divergent identity. With an acute sense of both the pathos and the humor of the modern immigrant’s lot, Smith crafts a narrative that entertains and evokes and succeeds in both superbly.
Thirty years after the war in which they fought together, Archie is reunited with his best friend, the Bengali Muslim Samad Iqbal. “White Teeth” follows the Iqbal and Jones families before and after the reunion. Samad and his feisty wife Alsana raise their twins, Magid and Millat, while Archie and Clara raise their daughter Irie. The children attempt to eke out their place in English society, not really belonging to the culture of their parents or the place where they were born: “Millat was neither one thing nor the other, this or that, Muslim or Christian, Englishman or Bengali; he lived for the in between, he lived up to his middle name, ‘Zulfikar,’ the clashing of two swords.” Like many of the writers of the emergent “hysterical realism” movement, Smith sets her agenda in character dynamics rather than plot. Dialogue explicates characterization well beyond the ability of any narrative description, and Smith’s skill with dialects provides comic relief through amusing background characters. With their delight in vulgar-language, even in salutation, two ancient and impossibly rude Jamaicans, Denzel and Clarence, steal every scene they’re in:
“‘What dat bambaclaaat say?’
‘’Im say evenin’.’
‘Can’t ‘im see me playin’ domino?’
‘No man! ‘Im ‘ave a pussy for a face. How you expec’ ‘im to see any little ting?’”
O’Connell’s Poolroom, Samad and Archie’s home away from home, represents the new Britain; neither Irish nor a poolroom, it’s owned by Abdul-Mickey, an Arab with bad skin whose family names “all sons Abdul to teach them the vanity of assuming higher status than any other man, which was all very well and good but tended to cause confusion in the formative years.” Abdul-Mikey adds the second­—English—name as a sort of qualifier for the first.
Archie floats serenely above the new racial order, buoyed by his belief in the power of the coin toss. But Samad, confronted with a hostile, foreign culture and a young, indifferent wife, retreats into what he thinks he knows best: his own culture and religion. Smith makes it clear, however, that the latter—already irrevocably changed by his life in England—is reaching for a past that never existed.
Smith is at her parodic peak when depicting the characters’ cultural misunderstandings, and their casual racism. In a flashback where the pair are lost in a tank, waiting out a war, Samad and Archie’s talk inevitably turns to girls, specifically Samad’s unborn betrothed. This amuses Archie. “‘Where I come from,’ said Archie, ‘a bloke likes to get to know a girl before he marries her.’ ‘Where you come from it is customary to boil vegetables until they fall apart. This does not mean,’ said Samad tersely, ‘that it is a good idea.’” The irony of course is that Archie, who met his first wife in Italy after the war, knows nothing of her long history of mental illness, “two hysteric aunts, an uncle who talked to eggplants, and a cousin who wore his clothes back to front.” Smith’s novel condemns neither side, and instead shows flawed and evocatively human aspects of both cultures.
Samad and Archie’s stories, as well as the stories from their long-suffering young wives’ points of view, make up the first and best half of the book. But “White Teeth” changes once Smith takes up the mantle of the new generation, the products of cross-cultural fertilization. Smith provides a snapshot of Archie’s daughter Irie writing feverishly in her diary. Her depiction of overwrought adolescence is pitch-perfect: “8:30 P.M. Millat just walked in. He’s sooo gorgeous but ultimately irritating! Tight jeans as usual. Doesn’t look at me (as usual, except in a FRIENDLY way).” Once the new generation, Irie and Millat, becomes old enough for their own narratives, the focus on character voice wavers. But their struggles to assimilate are no less universal than their parents’.
Smith ties up the characters’ story arcs into a neat little bundle at the end of the book. She contrives to unite the old and young in one room. Every main character attends the launch of a genetically engineered mouse with something to prove, whether in protestation or celebration. By putting them together to duke it out, Smith purposefully offers a chance for redemption and closure unavailable in real life. This conclusion is an unsatisfying end, but the point of the book is not the plot. Her rich, realistic portrayal of the characters and their view of London make “White Teeth” a book worth reading.
“White Teeth” is funny. It is a charming and thought-provoking look into British society, the immigrant experience not seen by the outside world. It reveals the society’s flaws, poking fun at everybody but condemning nobody. Zadie Smith shows the confusion of trying to understand the present in the context of a past that never existed; “The funny thing about getting old in a country is people always want to hear that from you,” Archie muses. “They want to hear it really was once a green and pleasant land. They need it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Repetition as de-existence / as condoned & re-spun vapour / which continues to post-exist / as mirages across an ark / as lucid underwater scent.” Thus begins “The Bedouin Ark,” the opening poem in Will Alexander’s new collection of poetic monologues. It is not a propitious start: the combined effect of “de-existence” and “post-exist” in this context is one of self-conscious jargonizing. “Ark” is one of five shorter poems that serve in this context as an introduction to the title poem, which at some 70 pages could be described as an attempt to resurrect the genre of the poetic epic. The shorter works are slight and awkward; Alexander’s fulsome imagery is suffocating in the absence of meaning. It is only in “The Sri Lankan Loxodrome” that he creates a thematic and narrative canvas vast enough to contain his ambition. The result, however, is decidedly odd.
Alexander is in the midst of a love affair with his thesaurus that is torrid enough to rival John Banville or Salman Rushdie. “Gravid,” “photopic,” “calcareous,” “neurasthenia”: there is no shortage of ten-dollar words in this book, which can read at times like a combination of medical dictionary and arcane nautical treatise. Alexander provides a glossary at the end, but this covers only the most obscure and technical areas of his vocabulary. As overbearing and unnecessary as his lexical tendencies can be, if they’re at home anywhere, it’s in the narrative monologue of a Sri Lankan sailor, Loxodrome, “whose commission is to de-poison sea snakes / to somehow bottle their arteries in clouds... [his] command / to capture them as beasts / whose colour is aurulent and xanthic.” Throughout, the atmosphere is ethereal; yet the narrator’s fantastical adventures and dream-like reflections are more artificial than inspired, more plodding than lyrical.
Alexander’s inspiration seems to be culled as much from the natural beauty of Sri Lanka as the sufferings of its people, who have endured 26 years of civil war. As an African American writer in the tradition of Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire, Alexander sometimes goes astray in his characterization of the post-colonial experience, misguidedly evoking a universalized disposition in Africa as in South Asia. He transposes this affinity onto his narrator, who makes the reverse gesture: “I am Mahayana & of Africa / both Sri Lankan & non-Sri Lankan.” Alexander’s uncomplicated humanism is filled with such platitudes.
This is, of course, ostensibly a poem, not a sociological treatise. At several places in the poem, however, Alexander’s narrator allows politics—Sri Lanka’s historical tragedies—to enter and tarnish his otherwise halcyon vision of the Indian Ocean. Thus, while the sailor is “a wanderer in a zone of fluctuating kelvins,” he has “been reported as expired at Jaffna,” the largest city in Sri Lanka’s predominantly Tamil north-east and the epicenter of its civil war, and “burned in effigy for interminable wanderings.” Alexander knows well enough that it would be near-impossible to write affectingly of Sri Lanka without acknowledging its civil war. Too often, however, this is done in a token and evasive fashion. When the narrator says that he is “neither Sinhalese nor Tamil... a ghost from Esta Rieglio,” in a country where the binary distinction between Tamil and Sinhalese is all-encompassing, it is politically naïve.
As the text plods on, the poem collapses under the weight of its interminable references. The writing is always dense, but seldom beautiful. The polysyllabic scientific terms, forgotten place names, and global cultural figures with which Alexander litters his opus ensure that the poetry is characterized by mechanical coldness, not joy or pathos. At one point, the narrator describes himself as “stunningly wrought powerless by my sudden lexical commingling.” It is a moment of wonderfully unintentional irony.
In his novel “Pnin,” Vladimir Nabokov—no stranger to “lexical commingling”—persistently described the title character in a series of epithets (“polite Pnin,” “brave Pnin” etc). Alexander’s narrator has a similar obsession for self-characterization. “Subnormal,” “heteromorphic,” “perpetual like Assyrian cups,” “not like Odysseus” or Vasco da Gama, but rather “Egyptian or Phoenician,” he thuds and thunders.
Too often, however, he writes in a voice so chronically self-indulgent that by the end of this monumental poem even its most grandiose aural gestures are reduced to ambient noise. Alexander has chosen a deeply unusual setting for his epic: both Sri Lanka and old-fashioned nautical adventuring are idiosyncratic interests for an American poet. The island, despite its physical loveliness and tragic recent history, is yet to inspire a fitting work of poetry or prose, and for all its ambition, “The Sri Lankan Loxodrome,” does not do justice to its subject.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The common complaint with contemporary poetry is that it’s too complicated, and the effort one makes to understand it grossly outweighs the rewards. Given this supposition, attending a poetry reading might seem daunting, even downright absurd. Though I think that this sentiment does hold some real validity, ultimately, I don’t believe it. This week I’ll propose a way of experiencing the poetry readings typically found at Harvard to those of us who have difficulty taking away meaningful experiences from them.
As oversimplified a complaint as it may be, it would be unwise for the poetic community to dismiss the confounding quality of contemporary poetry entirely. It is often quite difficult to divine meaning from poems written today—even for those intimately involved in reading and writing them—particularly on the first go-round. This stems from the myriad ways of experiencing a given poem and each way’s respective degree of appeal. Readings based on analysis—a summary of the narrative thread or a pinpointing of the poem’s speaker, for instance—are as important as emotionally subjective reactions. Both are more difficult (the former to produce, the latter to explain) in contemporary poetry than, say, in a Shakespearean sonnet. This isn’t to say that Shakespeare isn’t complex, or less complex than contemporary lyric poems. It is that the difficulties of poetry have spread from the depth of the emotion expressed into the poem’s literal coherence and project.
Even more, there’s a prevailing sense that much of contemporary poetry is being written to be read more so than to be heard. With the rising popularity of free-verse in the twentieth century, the visual layout of the poem—line breaks, indentations, punctuation, stanza breaks, spaces, etc.—has become increasingly important, replacing emphasis on the auditory landscape of rhyme and alliteration. The disappearance of these poetic devices, which formerly served to aurally delineate the poem, has resulted in an ambiguity as to how the poem’s visual arrangement informs the way it’s to be read aloud. Since the primary sense being used in reciting poems today is sight, the poet has shifted his aims to stimulate the eye, at times privileging it over the ear.
Nevertheless, poetry has an oral component, and though it is underemphasized, there is something awoken in any poem when it is actually spoken out loud. Echoing sounds connect lines that are semantically distinct. An emphasis placed on a key syllable can release meaning in the same way a sound wave can shatter glass. Listening to a poem is to hear language in its most primitive usage: expression of the unapparent. But what happens when no one, save for the most astute listeners, can understand what is being expressed? Does this not defeat the original point of even talking, if you will not succeed at communicating?
My honest opinion? It doesn’t matter. Unless you are a particularly experienced and skillful reader of poetry, I do not think there is much “meaning” to be had at poetry readings. Instead, I propose that this isn’t really the point of poetry readings, and that rather, the environment of the poetry reading paradoxically makes poetry more accessible by making no pretensions to being strictly analytically intelligible.
It starts with the sound of the poet’s voice. That, after all, is really all one gets at such a performance. I’ve found that poets tend to have beautiful reading voices. It makes sense, given that their vocation requires them to be as intimate with words as a carpenter with wood. It is the most immediate pleasure of a reading, the way the sound of an instrument pleases more immediately than the composer’s melody. I remember, when Simon Armitage read in Houghton Library earlier this semester, sitting in rapt attention to a repetitive poem (that I would have probably rushed through had I been reading it) simply by virtue the sound of his voice. I ended up savoring the repetition because he recited it so beautifully. Seamus Heaney’s reading voice seems to be composed of the sounds of nature. His r’s and deep vowels sound like a small stream, and his c’s and k’s sound like the rocks that the water breaks against.
It is through attention to the poet’s voice that you start listening to the words. The voice conveys the emotion and cadence of his expression, and so an interest in the words naturally arises. However oblique the concatenation of lines and images, the voice sustains your attention, and you let the poem to begin to work within you.
And so poetry begins to do what it’s supposed to do. While good poems almost always yield to analysis, no author writes a poem for it to be analyzed. Ironically, a poem written for analysis would most likely be a bad poem, not conducive to any meaningful analysis.
The joy of a poetry reading is that the poet’s voice diffuses the anxiety of not being able to “figure out” the poems, and allows for the poems to begin their emotional work. Sometimes a poem strikes you, but often it will not. It really depends on your emotional state when the poem encounters you. I believe that poetry readings are especially important in contemporary poetry precisely because, in returning to their oral roots, they remove the intellectual anxiety attached to the art form, and allow it to be enjoyed the way music is enjoyed, by the sage and the neophyte alike.

In 2005, as Carrie Underwood was making her seemingly untrammeled run to victory on the fourth season of “American Idol,” judge Simon Cowell famously predicted that not only would Underwood go on to win the competition, but she would also outsell all previous “Idol” winners. The next three years made Cowell appear remarkably astute. As Ruben Studdard and Fantasia Barrino fell by the wayside, and Kelly Clarkson grappled with artistic—and perhaps just general—confusion, Underwood’s first two albums established her as Nashville’s leading female star. With a string of country number-ones and an uncontroversial personal life, Underwood’s was verily an unqualified success story.
The past two years have seen that narrative interrupted, not so much by missteps on Underwood’s part but, rather, by the emergence of rivals: Miranda Lambert, whose fiery country-rock made Underwood seem tame by comparison, and, above all, Taylor Swift, a true singer-songwriter whose undeniable hooks, felt lyrics and incandescent enthusiasm have propelled her to a level of national stardom far above Underwood. It is no coincidence, then, that in the same week that Swift has a Springsteen-esque seven singles simultaneously in the Top 50 (pop, not country), Carrie Underwood released an album that from outset to coda is a unified attempt to move from the mainstream of Nashville to the mainstream of global pop. Unfortunately, “Play On” is a stilted, forced effort that will fail to satisfy either her country base or the pop fans she aims to reach.
The first song, “Cowboy Casanova,” despite its title, is a distinct break from Underwood’s earlier work. It affects a Lambert-lite stomp and swagger, but Underwood is no rockstar. She sings in perfect pitch, but there is no feeling; in a market where the pop audience demands sincerity, or at least heart, Underwood can provide neither. Worst of all, the song lacks recognizable hooks or an engaging melody. It’s all bluster, no substance.
The pattern that “Cowboy Casanova” establishes becomes depressingly familiar as the album goes on. This is surely one of the least melodic albums ever released by a conventional candidate for pop superstardom. With the sole exception of “Quitter”—a light, playful track firmly in the traditions of Nashville—the entire record consists of overwrought, impeccably produced, tuneless and indeed lifeless numbers as utterly forgettable as the “coronation songs” that “American Idol” winners sing in each year’s final show.
In fact, the most plausible explanation for this excrescence of an album is that Underwood and her handlers have decided that the best way to crossover from country to pop is to make an album in the tradition of the television show that launched her career. As any follower of “Idol” will know, its judges and producers have always maintained a healthy distaste for melody or, indeed, music in general, preferring to applaud and highlight performances of vocal excess, culminating most often in “glory notes.” It is an aesthetic comprehensively rejected by the record-buying public, if the album sales of most “Idol” winners are any indication. The key to Underwood’s prior success was that she discarded the vocal theatrics prized by Randy Jackson for solid, conventional country music written by hardened Nashville pros like Josh Kear and Hillary Lindsey. “Play On,” by contrast, features the talents of a murderer’s row of pop songwriters: Max Martin, Savan Kotecha, Chantal Kreviazuk and—now it all begins to fall into place—”American Idol” judge Kara DioGuardi. DioGuardi is partially responsible for “Mama’s Song,” a toe-curling piece of moralizing that, along with “Change” and “Temporary Home” (about homelessness), constitutes the album’s musically and emotionally hollow core.
On one level, focusing on Underwood’s voice might make sense, as she is a technically flawless natural, as effortless a female singer as any in a genre which has a richer tradition of great female vocalists than any other. As her eponymous 2005 debut and 2007’s “Carnival Ride” showed, she can sing country—and ballads in particular—with verve and gusto. But on those albums she sang the songs; here, she overpowers them, such as they are, with pyrotechnics. The result is impressive, perhaps, but certainly not enjoyable. Nor can Underwood be excused for the poor quality of the songs, as she is credited as a co-writer on seven of them. The album is a continuous lyrical train wreck, befouling every subject it touches, from love—“He is good, so good / And he treats your little girl like a real man should” (from “Mama’s Song”)—to changing the world: “The world’s so big it could break your heart / And you just wanna help / But not sure where to start” (from “Change”). The album’s nadir comes when Underwood pledges to “Unapologize.”
It would be unwise to doubt the ability of someone with Carrie Underwood’s telegenic looks, extraordinary vocal gifts, and successful track record to, one day, become a global pop sensation. But if Underwood truly intends to crossover into the pop mainstream—or at least to an audience consisting of someone other than Randy Jackson—she will need to start by hiring a new set of songwriters. Taylor Swift might be a good start.

Far from requiring an extra dose of Ritalin to enjoy, Wale’s “Attention Deficit” is a refreshingly eclectic album that will immediately grab your attention and hold it as Wale (pronounced Wal-ay) takes you into his personal world of DMV hip-hop. After self-releasing a series of mix-tapes that were popular in the D.C. area over the past couple years, “Attention Deficit” is Wale’s first album with a major label. Nine of the 14 tracks feature at least one guest artist and this collaboration allows Wale to showcase his diverse talents and musical interests. But Wale’s drive to establish himself as a member of the national MC club transcends the variety of tempos, beats, and artists on “Attention Deficit” and imbues the album with an enticing intensity.
“Chillin” is a fitting first single for Wale to use as an announcement of his arrival on the main stage. Resolutely defiant about his hip-hop credentials, the track declares Wale’s unique affiliation with the DMV, Wale’s hometown area of D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. As if to prove that he was born ready to compete with hip-hop heavyweights like Jay-Z and Kanye West, Wale goes all out to make “Chillin” stand out. While establishing his hip-hop skills by rapping about the tried and true subjects of cars, cash, and clothes, Wale also samples from “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” by the long-forgotten 1970s pop band Steam and welcomes Lady Gaga onto the track. “They keep sayin’ whale, but my name Wale” he complains before proclaiming “you redundant, you never ever change.” Unfortunately the collaboration with Lady Gaga, which sometimes feels stilted and forced, is the weakest component of the track. But Wale redeems himself and “Chillin” with the quick wordplay that has consistently earned him praise from critics.
On many tracks Wale portrays himself as an industry outsider who has had to fight the establishment to earn his due respect. Nowhere is this clearer than on “Triumph,” the strongest of Wale’s non-collaborative efforts on the album and also the first track. He unabashedly claims that he “asked Mr. West for a little bit of help” but was rejected, proof of the fact that new artists “gotta get it ourself.” On “Mirror,” Wale and Bun B ask “mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all” and assert that Wale’s understanding of the urban experience is more pure than those of mainstream artists. Wale wants to distinguish himself from rappers who create outlandish media personas by allowing his audience to experience the “realest” person that looks back at him in the mirror.
Acutely conscious of his roots, Wale is proud to claim allegiance with an alternative urban environment that is culturally and musically distinct from New York and Los Angeles. Washington D.C. was the center of the go-go movement in hip-hop and funk, a heritage that Wale readily appropriates for “Attention Deficit.” The go-go of the ’70s can be heard in the jaunty beats, percussion, and horns that populate the entire album. But it is even more explicit in the bits that Wale samples for “Chillin” and “Mamma Told Me.” This truly unique musical inspiration sets Wale apart and gives credibility to his claims that he is something new and different.
Though the majority of songs on “Attention Deficit” are light-hearted jibes at the establishment, Wale also displays an interest in dissecting racial issues and romantic tribulations. Contrary to my first thought, “Shades” is not a meditation on the value of stunna shades. It is in fact an examination of intra-race relations between African Americans with different skin tones that ponders the various stereotypes faced by people on account of their skin color. Slower-paced and more relaxed, “Contemplate” and “Diary” explore the pain of love lost. Though these are not the tracks that immediately jump out at first listen, they are actually the most meaningful songs on “Attention Deficit” and suggest that Wale has a future after his success prevents him from rapping about his outsider status.
“Attention Deficit” is a success because it is unabashedly fun and true to Wale’s roots. The exciting beats and clever lyrics grab attention and Wale holds the listener with his novel take on modern hip-hop. Though Wale’s attempt to set himself as an outsider to the music industry is clichéd, his music is truly unique. If nothing else, the willingness of artists like Lady Gaga, Pharrell, and Gucci Mane to work with Wale demonstrates that his talents are appreciated and that his assault on the status quo will have an impact on the hip-hop community.

Since 2001, Chris Carrabba and his not-so-merry band of pop-punk troubadours have been quietly establishing Dashboard Confessional as one of the decade’s most consistent alternative rock bands. Saddled with the much-overused “emo” stigma, Carrabba’s music—combining the heartfelt, earnest lyrics of U2 and late R.E.M. with the gift for swelling, melodic pop hooks of ’90s bands such as the Goo Goo Dolls and Gin Blossoms—surpasses the restrictions of any disparaging genre classification.
In recent years, Dashboard Confessional has balanced its identity between two disparate sounds: urgent punk—like breakthrough single “Hands Down”—and lovelorn, acoustic balladry, such as the early fan-favorite “Screaming Infidelities.” Carrabba’s newest effort. “Alter the Ending,” strikes a middle ground between these two extremes, but the final product is somewhat inconsistent; “Alter the Ending” excels in the realm of emotional power ballads but also contains a great deal of uninspiring three-chord filler, resulting in a uniform-sounding album with limited success.
The album’s opening track, “Get Me Right,” begins with a single, insistent guitar riff and then proceeds to build with electronic synths, gunshot drums, and Carrabba’s voice nervously fluttering above the ruckus as he pleads. “I know you’ll get me right / Oh Jesus, I’ve fallen.” The song’s religious overtones do not quite fit with the remainder of the adolescent-themed album, but thrown listeners will feel right at home as the record then effortlessly transitions into a somewhat predictable pop-punk nugget, “Until Morning.” Armed with chugging guitars and swelling vocals, Carrabba asks his lover to stay by his side, proclaiming, “If this is heaven, or if it’s just a warning / Say you will stay with me, even if it’s just ’til morning.”
Unfortunately, what makes “Alter the Ending” an often dissatisfying listen is the uniformity of about half the album’s songwriting. Consisting of the same thick guitar lines, intense drumming, and vocal acrobatics of Carrabba’s wobbly tenor, the band’s newest efforts sound like weak facsimiles of “Hands Down” and “Vindicated.” The songs feebly retread old territory rather than covering new ground.
Dashboard Confessional unfortunately elects on “Alter The Ending” to limit the usage of their greater strength: the acoustic, heartbrokenly witty ballads on which they built their early career. Two of the album’s finest tracks, “Even Now” and the moody closer “Hell On the Throat,” excel above the rest due to the naked emotion and simplistic strumming, enhanced only occasionally with a shimmering synth or lonely drum beat. On “Even Now,” Carrabba softly sings, “Even now, I can feel your eyes / Watch me as I strum / Much too late at night / And I always can find you again.” His gentle, wavering tone on such tracks complements his music much more effectively than his aggressive screams on louder songs as he paints intimate portraits of failing relationships and missed opportunities.
The album’s most sublimely beautiful composition comes at the conclusion, with the quiet struggle of “Hell On the Throat,” as Carrabba desperately mourns, “All these years in the cold / Play hell on the throat / ’Til everything I say burns like cinders / Well it’s hard to belong / To a girl or a song / In the crease of a strangling winter.” It is at such moments that “Alter the Ending” truly shines; unfortunately, such compositions are few and far between on the album, included as afterthoughts rather than centerpieces, taking the backseat to one too many loud alt-rockers.
Still, the lack of mellow moments on the album does not entirely sour the affair, as Dashboard also chooses to indulge their newfound penchant for power ballads. Without the false urgency of the faster numbers, the ballads still retain the melodic prowess of Carrabba’s songwriting.
“Everybody Learns From Disaster,” with its galloping beat and Bon Jovi-esque lyrics, full of reckless abandon and an “us-against-the-world” mentality, proves to be the album’s best narrative, as Carrabba recalls the glories of a band on the move, reminiscing, “We stayed in the sun too long / Suffered a terrible burn / Now everybody learns from disaster / We stayed on the run too long / Hoping we’d never return.” While none of the ballads can measure up to “Stolen,” arguably one of the decade’s best alternative love songs from the band’s 2007 magnum opus “Dusk and Summer,” many of the tracks, including “Belle” and the Semisonic-recalling “Blame it on the Changes,” come very close.
“Alter the Ending” ultimately proves to be sufficiently satisfying, but on most of the album, Carrabba seems somewhat lazy. “Belle of the Boulevard” and “Hell on the Throat” prove that Dashboard Confessional is clearly capable of greatness, but unfortunately, they failed to harness their skill in order to make “Alter the Ending” a more compelling listen.

Arish “King” Khan and Mark “BBQ” Sultan know how to have fun. They know so well, in fact, that the Canadian duo often tends towards unabashed—and some may argue, sinful—hedonism, as is the case with their third, full-length collaborative effort, “Invisible Girl.”
King Khan enjoys being practically naked on stage, save boxers and tribal necklaces, and Sultan often sports a turban. In the ’90s, they wreaked havoc as members of The Spaceshits, until the band was blacklisted by most venues in Montreal. They aren’t exactly upright people. So “Invisible Girl” isn’t the kind of album that is going to make you a better person through its “art.” However, by combining the simple rock ’n’ roll sounds from by-gone days when it was still cool to be happy, and the shit-all attitude of punk, with lyrics often explicit enough to make a college frat-boy cringe, King Khan and BBQ deliver an album that will make you dance and forget all shame.
The album begins with “Anala,” an old-school pop song, whose percussion section is comprised of muted clapping, snare rolls, and a bassy vocal line (“um bau bau, um bau”) provided by Khan. Floating above is Sultan’s voice, empathetically harmonizing with “ooh-aah” and very simple lyrics about girl troubles. The lighthearted pop sound continues through to the second and title track. It ups the fun notch by incorporating tambourines, seagulls, a distorted, power-chord based guitar backbone behind a melodic, single-line riff, and lyrics addressed to, one can only assume, the mermaid on the album cover.
The third track, “I’ll Be Loving You,” is once again a ’50s pop-inspired love song. By this point listeners may assume that the whole album is going to be as innocent as their guitars and tambourines suggest. However, tracks like “Animal Party” and especially “Tastebuds” betray this expectation. “Animal Party” is perhaps too literal: the singer receives an invitation to a great party by “Mr. Pig” who articulates himself with pig honks. “Tastebuds” is a very forthright expression of a male’s sexual desires. (Though even among the immature references to oral sex, most of the songs feature a clichéd variation on “I love you.”) Indeed, much of the lyrics on “Invisible Girl” are best described as rather juvenile.
The track “Spin the Bottle”  is an instance of this indulgence. The chorus goes “I’m in love with you, you’re in love with me.” This track in many ways exemplifies the album: while the lyrics are fairly mindless, the music is redeemed through its copious hooks and infectious dancability. The simplicity of the lyrics encourages singing along even at first listen and the rhythmic guitars inspire instant foot tapping.
The song that contrasts most with the upbeat tone of the rest of the album is “Third Avenue.”  The fast-paced rhythm that pervades the album is replaced by a slow Motown groove. Appearing right in the middle of the album, it gives the listeners some space to relax.  It also allows Sultan’s voice to shine through, his high notes lightening the track’s soulful edge. The fact that this track appears right before “Tastebuds” is perhaps intentional, and makes the latter more surprising than it would have been were it standing alone.
The easy complaint to make about “Invisible Girl” is that it is too fun. The thorough indulgence in pleasure often leads to a lack of rigor. The songs are not  technically complex. All the songs except “Third Avenue”  are in simple 4/4 time and most of the songs are based on a three-chord progression. King Khan and BBQ are by no means exploring new grounds in music through the album. But this, of course, was never their intent.  They want to make music that’s as fun to play as it is to listen to, and absolutely nothing more.
Because what’s rock and roll without a little hedonism? “Who knows how to rock?” asks Sultan in “Third Avenue”  Answering his own question: “We do.”

AMC’s runaway hit “Mad Men” rounded off its third season this past Monday, and once again it is tempting to see creator Matthew Weiner’s depiction of an advertising agency in the early 1960s as a mirror of present times. Praise be to that firey avatar of all things good, St. Joan Holloway, however, that the recent season finale made the more direct of these comparisons seem misguided, irrelevant. Far from a show focused solely on capturing the essence of another time, or even our own time, the season finale of “Mad Men” made it clear that the show aims to remind viewers of the potential for creativity and forward-thinking to fundamentally change our lives in America.
Certainly, the parallels between Don Draper’s time and ours are unavoidable. There is the new, handsome, and inspirational President and the overwhelming sense of great change (and potentially, calamity) on the horizon. Direct comparisons fall short, however, if signaled by nothing more than the tragedy of President Kennedy’s assassination. With his death it becomes clear that although we do not know how the lives of Mad Men’s characters will turn out, we are, relatively speaking, omniscient to the impending historical events that will undoubtedly shape their lives, quite the opposite from how we know our own futures. We know that the Beatles are coming for them, but what is in store for us?
If anything, the best lesson to date that can be drawn from the show is the one manifested in the remarkable pluck and ingenuity of the Draper himself. Faced with the decision to continue on blindly, and unhappily, as a piece in a nebulous mechanism he has no control over, our man refuses to resign himself to the station of a corporate whore (as his mother was, and as he views his soon-to-be ex-wife Betty to be). I, and certainly many fans, expected this finale to be a doomsday episode–the death of a character seemed inevitable. Instead, Don (really, Weiner, who co-wrote and directed the episode) embraced the notion that the only viable way to dig oneself out of seeming disaster is to innovate and march forward. In a turn of events that Hitchcock himself could have imagined, Draper manages to release himself from the fetters on pre-’60s corporate conventions, venturing out into uncharted territories–helming an independent company and living what is sure to be a rollicking life as a single man in the age of free love.
Don looks forward just enough, realizing that rebellion is most successful if a group effort. The intense misery of the final undoing of his marriage and the previous episode’s wrenching depiction of the President’s death are balanced by an overwhelming sense of open-mindedness, measured risk-taking, camaraderie, and a near total severance from the comfort and predictability of the past.
Believably, Don comes to this approach organically. In rounding the troops needed for this insurrection, Draper keenly approaches the talented Peggy first. His initial failure of an attempt to sway her to join him, more of a command than a supplication, is keenly followed by an admission of her creative force. “With you or without you, I’m moving on, and I don’t know if I can do it alone. Will you help me?”
It’s Don’s season-long struggle with his daddy issues (alternately brought to life through often irritating flashbacks to his childhood and his relationship with Conrad Hilton) that allowed him to break through. Unlike Betty, who in times of distress reverts to childhood–she might as well have reached for a Demerol when she picked up her newborn during the final fight with her husband–Don’s reflection on his upbringing in the finale is both a source of inspiration and a farewell to the solace found in blaming one’s problems on one’s parents. His secret is out, he’s free to fuck, and he’s shrugged off the stifling atmosphere of his midtown office.
All signs point to the necessity of innovation, but it’s really Don’s meeting with Hilton that forces him to change his trajectory. “I got everything on my own,” says the consummate American businessmen. “It’s made me immune to those who complain and cry because they can’t. I didn’t take you for one of them, Don. Are you?”
Needless to say, I can’t wait to see what the new office is going to look like next season, let alone what a Draper bachelor pad will hold. If Joan’s return is evidence of anything, it’s that change is coming, and those who can see it coming just in time will be the ones to make it.
As viewers we are left with the incontrovertible knowledge that “Mad Men” is not, at its core, a show about the 1960s, the Obama era, or the space between. Rather, it’s a series about the phenomenon of reinvention and independently-spurred change in America and the many forms that personal evolution and even revolution can take.

On paper, “Pirate Radio” already has the groundwork for a compelling viewing experience. Released earlier this year in the UK under a different title (“The Boat That Rocked”), the film is the second directorial project of Richard Curtis, who previously pioneered the underrated niche genre of gender-neutral date movie with “Love Actually.” Like that movie, “Pirate Radio” also features a large ensemble cast of established actors, among them Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kenneth Branagh, and Bill Nighy. But even though the film succeeds with a funny script and top-notch acting performances, those elements take a backseat to what the film is ultimately about: the music.
The year is 1966, and despite England’s successful production of some of the most famous rock ’n’ roll bands in the world, the national British radio only plays two hours of the music per week. To combat this, a group of DJs have established a radio station on a small freighter in the middle of the North Sea. Here they cohabitate while playing rock ’n’ roll 24/7 with a listener rate—according to the film—constituting half of the country’s population at the time. The film begins with the arrival of Carl (Tom Sturridge), who has been sent by his mother to the boat after being expelled from school, in the hopes that he may spend more time with his godfather, Quentin (Nighy), Radio Rock’s nutty station manager. The ship’s eclectic personalities—including The Count (Hoffman) and Dr. Dave (Nick Frost)—have popular consensus on their side, but the boat is under legislative siege from the government. Their fiercest opponent is Minister Alistair Dormandy (Branagh), who is committed to shutting down “the drug takers and the lawbreakers and the bottom-bashing fornicators of this recently great country.”
“Pirate Radio” puts the music center stage. Over its two-hour running time, Curtis has assembled a massive classic rock playlist of over 50 songs that never feels out of place against the on-screen action. Classics like “My Generation” and “Jumping Jack Flash” are immediately identifiable, but lesser known performers like The Hollies or Darlene Love fit just as well. Occasionally, Curtis takes a more literal approach; Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son” plays during a moment between Carl and his newly-discovered father, and The Turtles’ “Elenore” echoes the name of the girl who one of the characters ends up marrying. But the songs are so strong and so catchy that it’s hard to care when such straightforward connections are created between music and plot. It is clear that “Pirate Radio” is a love letter to rock ’n’ roll’s golden era and its sweeping influence, complete with an end credit sequence displaying every major album of the last 40 years.
Aside from a superb soundtrack, the film’s other strength is its wonderful cast of character actors. Hoffman remains at his brashest and bawdiest as an American DJ, a stark opposite from Nighy’s prim, if slightly spaced-out, British gentleman. Unquestionably, though, the funniest performance comes from Kenneth Branagh as a viciously polite British official intent on destroying Radio Rock. His outraged caricature is particularly evident during a scene in which he casually threatens to outlaw one of his subordinate’s haircuts. Nick Frost’s (“Shaun of the Dead”) portly and shameless ladies man, Dr. Dave, consistently cracks jokes and snarky comments, despite being of little importance to the film’s plot. Another character named Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke) justifies his namesake during a frustrating game of Taboo; in the hopes that his teammate will know exactly who he means, he describes Jesus as a nice guy with a lot of friends who didn’t wear shoes.
The film’s narrative of a small group of rebels fighting against the government is somewhat bland, but rarely, if ever, does the plot overshadow the characters of the film. The final segment of the film devolves into an unnecessarily long action sequence a la “Titanic,” but the movie ultimately ends on an upbeat note, and this feel-good conclusion works; there is a deep gratification in seeing such likeable characters succeed.
In the midst of one of the station’s more stressful crises, The Count muses that “all over the world, young men and young women will always dream dreams and put those dreams into song.” While at times overly sentimental, “Pirate Radio” and its sprawling soundtrack capture the freewheeling spirit of a transformational era.

“Judge me, you bitch!” yells Test Subject #20 at the female protagonist of “Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.” Played earnestly by John Krasinski—who also directs the movie—Test Subject #20 (real name: Ryan) is just one of many confused and impetuous males to find themselves uncomfortably put on the spot by Ivy League graduate student named Sara. Krasinski’s eponymous adaptation of a 1999 short story collection by the late David Foster Wallace takes the blunt emotional starkness of the written interviews and puts them into motion on the screen in such a way that the audience can’t help but feel directly addressed by each subject. The film—a short 80-minute affair made up of strung-together interview segments—doesn’t hold very well as a narrative in its own right, but it does an elegant and powerful job of conveying the central themes of Wallace’s work: the immediacy of existence and the pure moment of visceral human reaction.
Best known for playing affable Jim Halpert on NBC’s “The Office,” Krasinski tackled one of his favorite works for his directorial debut. In adapting “Interviews” for the screen, he returns to his college roots as an English major and playwright at Brown University. Wallace’s unnamed interviewer is here given a distinct collegiate identity as Sara Quinn (an icy Julianne Nicholson), who hopes to investigate “the social effects of the post-feminist era” by conducting and recording interviews with male test subjects in a stark, white-bricked basement room. Sara is a reserved, turtlenecked brunette with closely cropped hair and a voice recorder that never leaves her side. Still shell-shocked from a brutal break-up with Ryan, she conducts these interviews as a partially academic, but mainly personal, investigation into the male psyche.
The movie’s opening scenes give the impression that Krasinski has filtered Wallace’s prose through a sieve that seems oddly like one of romantic comedy. “Modern woman is a mess of contradictions,” one student remarks to another. “That makes it so hard to know what they want.” Statements along these lines abound in this highly verbal film, but the interview segments go far beyond a women-are-from-Venus approach in unfolding the fragility of both genders in their relationships. When describing why he fell in love with his wife, Sara’s boss, Professor Adams (Timothy Hutton), asks, “Do you think this sounds shallow? People’s real reasons?” Indeed, the reasons most test subjects give for justifying how they act toward others highlights the absurdity, cruelty and vulnerability of humans in their dealings with one another.
The beauty of “Interviews” is the ease with which Krasinski’s cast makes Wallace’s almost untouched text spring to life, highlighting the rhythm of the short stories and giving each narrator a distinctive personality. One scene which occurs outside the interview room involves a conversation between two businessmen, which perfectly tunes Wallace’s prose to their bitten-off speech patterns. Test Subject #3 (Christopher Meloni) brings a bitterly funny tale to life when he launches into the colorful story of seeing a girl crying on the ground at Dayton airport “bent over so you can, you know, just about see her tits. Totally hysterical and with the waterworks and all like that there.”
In a clever cinematographic twist, Meloni reenacts the flashback while narrating. His buddy joins him and they stand over the bawling girl with coffee cups in hand, casually observing her breakdown. Meloni narrates over the entire sequence, explaining that the girl was waiting for a man who never came; in another elegant shot, the film cuts back to her waving goodbye to her lover as he ascends the airport escalator, Meloni and his companion descending the parallel escalator, still talking, just moments later. Far from being merely a gimmick, this technique highlights the implicit interactivity of the interviews—not only between interviewer and subject but between the subject and the different people he recalls in his attempt to capture a particular emotional moment.
The film functions best as a set of such fragmented moments; Krasinski’s original plotline involving Sara remains the movie’s most bland and least convincing device. Scenes that show Sara in class, at professors’ cocktail parties, or in cafés with her friends, have a TV-show quality to them; they remain vignettes without developing her character and only tenuously tie the interviews together into a coherent narrative arc.
In a film otherwise focused on personal testimonies and confessions, her blankness seems to stem out of banal grievances. Her Krasinski-scripted loneliness does not have the same stark impact as that of her friend Harry (Benjamin Gibbard of “Death Cab for Cutie”), who uses Wallace’s words to confess the way he feels when his girlfriend is about to climax during sex: “This moment has this piercing sadness to it—of the loss of her eyes. I become like an intruder.”
The emphasis on blindness and seeing is on target; Sara, like the audience, is a witness—always emotionally interacting with the world she is watching. Reacting is human; when Ryan erupts and shouts “Judge me!” he is not only demanding but acknowledging the power of natural human behavior to utterly devastate. In Krasinski’s film, as in Wallace’s prose, no man or woman is left spared.

When a film is rated R by the MPAA due to “intense sequences of epic warfare,” it’s difficult not to be intrigued, if not excited. And “Red Cliff”—an amalgam of “300,” “Lord of the Rings,” and “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”—certainly lives up to these expectations. With grandiose battle sequences, crisp and masterful cinematography, and an endless showcase of the beautiful Chinese landscape, director John Woo’s triumphant return to his homeland is an instant classic. Through the retelling of historical events nearly two millennia ago, Woo’s “Red Cliff” becomes a powerful celebration of Chinese culture and tradition.
Woo, a legendary Chinese film director with an impressive repertoire, has been in Hollywood for the past 17 years. In 1992, he emigrated to the U.S. to take L.A. by storm. Blockbusters like “Mission: Impossible 2,” “Face/Off,” and “Windtalkers” brought Woo a degree of fame that even his early success in China could not have predicted. After establishing himself as a prominent Hong Kong director with gritty films such as “Hard Boiled” and “A Better Tomorrow,” Woo descended into predictable, high-octane Americanized dramas that seemed to hamper his directorial creativity. “Red Cliff” marks a return to both his native land—the film was shot over one year in and around Beijing—as well as his native tongue—the film is entirely in Mandarin with English subtitles flying across the screen.
“Red Cliff” is set in third-century China during the fall of the Han Dynasty, before and during the Battle of the Red Cliffs. The country is being torn apart by civil war, and a power-hungry Northern warlord is looking to eliminate the only two remaining sovereign kingdoms in the South. “Red Cliff” maps the alliance of these two politically distinct yet ethnically united peoples in the face of destruction, paying particular attention to the resilience of Chinese people.
The film’s original two-part release, titled “Chi bi” in China, clocked in at a daunting 280 minutes. In coming to the states, the film was cut to 150 minutes; the abridged version still retains the primary plot’s themes of alliance and conflict at the sacrifice of several subplots of love and intrigue.
Through the use of intense live-action shots along with extensive yet tasteful use of CGI, Woo successfully captures the enormity of the war scenes as well as the immediacy of one-on-one combat and melee face-offs. The sheer vastness of Woo’s Chinese navy and army—with tens of thousands of ships extending past the horizon—encourages a dizzying suspension of reality. Whether witnessing enemy horses blinded by mirror-shields, naval ships destroyed by suicide fireboats, or diseased, dead soldiers floated across to the enemy’s shore to infect their army, the film’s frenzied violence permeates every frame.
But what makes “Red Cliff” truly a marvel is Woo’s meticulous and surprising cinematography. Though he depicts the brutal, primitive, and rough-seamed battles of blood and violence, Woo handles the entire movie with great care. Inventive camera angles—shot from a cavalry horse’s perspective or from the tail of a dove—meet well-timed slow motion sequences. The soldiers’ dull armor and the tan sands on which they travel create a stunning contrast with the bright, multi-colored banners they carry into combat. For the most part, Woo eschews loud, crashing music in favor of delicate, melodic Chinese stringed instruments, which are often played by characters in the movie.
By incorporating majestic panoramas of the Chinese landscape, wise sayings of their philosophy and folklore, and harmonious music from their ancient instruments, Woo conveys with pride an important series of events in his country’s history, one unfamiliar to most Western audiences. In a dramatic departure from both his early mob movies and his American action hits, Woo’s “Red Cliff” serves as an entertaining war film set within a stirring and resonant celebration of Chinese culture.

In the opening scene of “(Untitled),” Josh Jacobs (Eion Bailey) questions his failed musician brother, Aaron (Adam Goldberg), about when he’ll finally surrender his dream of becoming a famous composer. “I’ll give it three more years,” the brooding pianist replies, “and if I haven’t made it by then—”
“—You’ll get a job?” his brother offers hopefully.
“No,” the furrow-browed musician snaps impatiently. “I’ll kill myself.”
This exchange, though brief, aptly summarizes the overall experience of watching this film. It begins with high hopes for artistry and authority, makes plodding steps toward achieving these goals, and remains largely unsuccessful. The audience patiently grants the film time to develop, but instead of maturing, the plot slowly abandons its attempts at greatness and withers. The film succeeds in its early attempts to satirize the modern art world, but soon grows convoluted and unnecessarily dark, much like 2006’s indie house failure “Art School Confidential.”
The film’s premise is quite ordinary. Aaron, a quirky, experimental musician, falls for Madeleine (Marley Shelton), a trendy Chelsea gallerist, and the two struggle through the difficulties of art and love. The morose hipster boyfriend is a comfortable role for Goldberg, who portrayed a similar character in 2007’s “Two Days in Paris.”
In this role, Goldberg draws us fully into the mind of a tormented musician. His character is acutely aware of all sounds and overly sensitive to any kind of distraction which occurs during his performances. In one of the film’s more memorable scenes, a woman at Goldberg’s concert lightly fans herself with her program, sending Aaron into a spiraling frenzy. Ripping a huge American flag from the back of the stage, he whips it back and forth in the concertgoer’s shocked face. “This is what I hear when you do that!” he shouts over the din created by his waving flag of fury. These moments go beyond merely depicting an artist’s psychological turmoil, opting instead to situate the viewer directly within the artist’s sensory perceptions. Such moments are marred, however, by Goldberg’s unchanging facial expression: a swarthy, angry scowl of painful misunderstanding. Too often, he is perfectly content to let his eyebrows do the acting for him.
The film benefits from a few genuinely thought-provoking discussions of modern art. One scene raises the question of artists who challenge current artistic conventions but remain unpopular—are they true visionaries, or do they simply lack creative talent? At a swanky dinner party early in the film, one guest whispers to another that an under-appreciated artist lacks a following because he is “ahead of his time.” Looking skeptical, the other guest quietly replies, “But what if time never catches up?” These moments, if somewhat exceedingly self-aware, are at least delivered in a manner that seems understated and reflective.
The dialogue becomes grating, however, when the film’s characters stop following normal conversation patterns, and instead begin to communicate with speeches that sound like contrived publicity blurbs for art shows. “Your work pushes the boundaries of modern thought, thrusting past the limitations of human emotion and cognition to create the ultimate expression of human consciousness,” Madeleine enthuses to an artist during a show. These kinds of inflated, preposterous mini-monologues quickly grow tiresome, and instead of humorously mocking the bourgeoisie art world, they come across as simply an irksome staple of it.
The film’s second half suffers from a plethora of increasingly distracting elements. Chief among these is its score, which alternates between vaguely eerie and uncomfortably alarming. A host of strange, unnatural sounds accompany moments of onscreen tension, at times recalling the abrasive and bizarre soundtrack of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie but without Anderson’s artistic discretion. The film’s surprising turn toward a dark and haunting ending, as typified by a grotesque and unexpected murder scene, also proves jarring and unnecessary. If this film were an artistic hopeful, it would probably do well  to accept its limited talents, give up its dream, and get a real occupation.

W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan’s “The Sorcerer,” running at the Agassiz Theatre through Sunday, is a rollicking romantic farce that centers on a magic love potion. As prepared by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players, this theatrical elixir, despite somewhat uneven ingredients, surely casts its intended spell.
“The Sorcerer,” an early collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, tells the story of an idealistic young nobleman, Alexis Pointdextre (a role shared by Benjamin J. Nelson ’11 and Zander J. MacQuitty ’10), who decides, on the eve of his wedding to Aline (Marit A. Medefind ’12), that he wants all the citizens of his village to share in the bliss of love. Hoping to realize this plan, he hires a professional wizard (Nathaniel Koven) to brew a love potion for all to drink. Hilarious chaos ensues. As a range of characters, including Alexis’ father Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre (Michael A. Yashinsky ’11, who is also a Crimson Arts comper) and Aline’s mother Lady Sangazure (Sofia M. Selowsky ’12) fall madly and inexplicably in love with whomever they first behold after drinking the philter.
This characteristically absurd plot requires an adroit handling of Sullivan’s appealing music, which Music Director Jesse C. Wong ’12 provides admirably. The orchestra plays with real verve, supporting the singers while maintaining a strong presence. The six-person chorus, too, sings well and energetically.
The success of a show like “The Sorcerer,” with a fundamentally weak plot only resolved by a deus ex machina, depends largely on its soloists, whom stage director Davida Fernandez-Barkan ’11 manages effectively. The role of Alexis is well handled by Nelson (in last Saturday’s matinee performance). His strong tenor and zestful portrayal of his foppish, affected character provides many of the performance’s most rewarding moments. In particular, his over-the-top exchanges with his father, played with great aplomb by Yashinsky, are delightful.
Medefind also gives a very effective performance as Aline. The role offers limited dramatic opportunities, but Medefind’s light yet textured soprano brings great charisma to the part, especially in the song “My Kindly Friends/Happy Young Heart.” Selowsky shines as Lady Sangazure, combining vocal agility with dramatic sensitivity. Her rich timbre and mature legato stand out particularly in her aria “My Child, I Join in These Congratulations” and her duet with Sir Marmaduke, “Welcome, Joy!”
Despite only making a few appearances, the titular sorcerer is perhaps the operetta’s most memorable role, and Koven certainly delivers, blazing through the patter song “My Name is John Wellington Wells” and eliciting gasps of delight from the many children in the audience during his other numbers. As Koven seems to understand, the character’s distinctive combination of weird and respectable qualities exemplifies Gilbert and Sullivan’s preoccupation with juxtaposing the ironic and absurd.
In supporting roles, the warm baritone of Robert A. Knoll ’13 lends humanity to the lonely vicar Dr. Daly. The mother-daughter pair of Mrs. Parlet (Amrita S. Dani ’13) and Constance (Megan M. Savage ’10), two excessively emotional villagers, also give solid comic turns. And when the entire ensemble appears together in the finales to both acts, the performers’ shared delight in the music creates a wonderful, tangible energy.
Perhaps attempting to capitalize on this gaiety, the production incorporates the choreography of Antonia M. Pugliese ’12, with varying success. In particular, during Sir Marmaduke and Lady Sangazure’s duet “Welcome, Joy!” the busy movements distract from the comic interaction between the two self-important aristocrats. But the chorus dances well in a number of scenes, adding to the production’s festive feel.
The show’s peripheral elements serve to provide a solid background to its comic madness. The lighting design of Tiffany M. Bradshaw ’10 contributes effectively to the mood, despite a chaotic and disorienting series of color changes near the finale. The gaudy Elizabethan costumes, created by Pugliese, further add to the production’s merrily boisterous feel.
Fernandez-Barkan ably handles this topsy-turvy romance, drawing out the wit of Gilbert’s libretto as Wong gives Sullivan’s music its due. “The Sorcerer” may be a light opera from Victorian England, but, thanks to this production’s charms, the work still amuses today.

A charity effort at heart, Project East was first conceived by Timothy M. Parent ’09 and Kristin S. Kim ’09 three years ago. The runway show aims to expose Harvard students to cutting-edge fashion by featuring established Asian designers and student designers who attend Parsons School of Design or Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). By donating the proceeds of the event to benefit the China Tomorrow Education Foundation, Project East will help build a school in rural China. Organized by executive producers Tamara Harel-Cohen and Alexandra Clarke, Project East will take place November 14, in the Northwest Labs.
The Harvard Crimson: What is the inspiration for this year’s show in particular, and how does it differ from previous years?
Tamara Harel-Cohen: The previous two years Project East was held in tents with a raised runway. This year there will not be a formal runway—it will have a warehouse, industrial vibe, but a lot of the clothes we have are playful, resort collections. Two collections will have girls walking barefoot, so it will be a flirty feel. Our logo is red flowers so we are trying to bring that into the space—there will be a lot of flowers around and on the runway to create a floral, industrial chic feel.
Alexandra Clarke: The tent was a really cool idea, but it wasn’t very practical. Many people ruined their shoes last year. The Northwest Labs is actually a cool modern artistic gallery/warehouse space. Since we don’t have to pay as much as we had to for the tents, we have extra money to do lighting, set design, a cooler runway space, chairs, and to create a very professional-looking show.
THC: Can you speak a little about the process of requesting designers to contribute pieces for the show? Who in particular did you get this year?
TC: Half of the show is established names. This year we have Vera Wang, Derek Lam, Guiliano Fujiwara, and Andrew Gn, who are four of the biggest names in the industry. We always invite edgy, young designers. The other half of the show is composed of student designers. We invited 10 designers from Parsons and two RISD designers. We want the audience to look at the clothes and say, “Wow I never knew you could do that with clothes.” There are some really wild things. The bigger names are less avant-garde in their designs, so it’s nice to have the students who can take risks in their designs and mix it with what you see in stores.
THC: What were some of the biggest challenges this year?
TC: Basically, it’s been really hard this year because designers have been really hit by the economy. A lot of designers didn’t have their own runway shows, so it was hard to persuade them to lend out their clothes for a charity show.
AC: It has been really tough this year. Last year we got a huge grant from Macy’s, and this year they have been really helpful, but they just couldn’t give us the grant. We really had to re-evaluate the show and decide what to keep. As a result we cut our budget so much that we’ll probably raise double what we did last year... We’re getting the space [in Northwest Labs] for a steal, but it was somewhere we always wanted to do in spite of the budget cuts.
THC: What relevance does this show have to students at Harvard?
AC: We really try to emphasize the students in every aspect—the photographers, the models, etc. After the show, we send the designers pictures, so it’s really great to have these photographers get exposure. We’ve tried to strengthen our relationship with Harvard, and we’re going to become an official student organization in the spring.
TC: And I feel that this is the one show on campus that is only about fashion. We have a charitable purpose, which is very important, but the fashion really separates it from the other shows. It’s not about performance or who models but the clothes themselves.

True to its name, the F.U.D.G.E. Theatre Group’s latest production, “Nevermore,” has certainly transformed my image of Edgar Allen Poe in an irreversible way. Nevermore will I see Poe in the same light. Nevermore will he simply be a talented but crazed author whose work reflected this juxtaposition of character. Instead, after seeing the aforementioned musical, I will empathize with the early loss of loved ones, the sense of stark loneliness, and the tortured mind that defined this misunderstood poet. Through “Nevermore,” director Joe DeMita is able to convey the Gothic writer as twisted but human, a man whose depth of emotion, experience, and feeling typifies the inevitable solitude of a writer.
The musical’s opening scene sets the sinister tone that persists throughout the production. A soft drum ominously begins to pound, a heartbeat of foreboding that only Edgar Allen Poe could inspire. The lighting, formed of flickering lanterns and the soft green glow of midnight, calls to mind a dungeon, to greatly sinister effect.
Onto this scene stumbles Poe (Ronny Pompeo), seemingly in a drunken stupor. Pompeo successfully inhabits the role with a wild look in his dark, sunken eyes. Five women file in behind him, the five most influential women in his life, ranging from his mother to a whore with whom he forms a relationship. The women circle Poe—who collapses—and begin quietly singing adaptations of his most famous poems in unison, including “Annabelle Lee” and “Alone.” Each woman seemingly competes for Poe’s recognition as the inspiration for her respective poem. This opening scene forces the audience to recognize the pathos in Poe’s life and movingly conveys the emotions that inspired his works. This early success is repeated throughout the evening.
The rest of the play continues in a similar vein, with scenes and songs based on Poe’s poetry and his difficult experiences—both romantic and maternal—with women. As each woman sequentially enters and leaves the stage, a new dimension of meaning is placed upon each poem; the muse behind the words is unveiled. The women separately represent something to Edgar, a trait of character or quality of life that he never had. Amongst many impressive performances, Joelle Kross as Virginia, Poe’s 13-year old bride and first cousin, is particularly adept at imbuing her character with youth and innocence. Likewise, Shawna O’Brien plays Poe’s mother, who dies while her son is still an infant. O’Brien subsequently stalks the stage as a ghost, becoming the authority figure of the play and chastising her son’s melancholic tendencies.
Instead of the more rigidly defined progression of action and character development that define the plots of most plays and musicals, DeMita’s direction opts instead to expose the inner workings of one individual. The play is basically psychoanalytical; the busy, flowing, often frenetic musical numbers and dynamic stage direction affords the audience a rare glimpse into Poe’s psyche. Unfortunately, this “glimpse” extends into an hour and a half long exposition, a bit generous for the lack of a distinct plot; further, the abundance of scenes constructed to convey a universal sense of loss causes the theme to become less affecting in its repetition. Despite this, “Nevermore” does an excellent job of presenting an understanding and sympathetic vision of its antihero.
While it may lose some of its luster as it progresses, “Nevermore” nevertheless accomplishes what it set out to achieve: to reveal the twisted blueprint of nature and the tormented existence of one of America’s greatest poets. Behind the verses and behind the music, the man with the pen, the imagination, and the hopeless yearning for something more than reality is left to be discovered.

It would be hard to accuse Polish artist Krzysztof Wodiczko of being timid or unambitious. His works, which often utilize the exterior of entire buildings—including a former munitions factory and a cathedral—focus on what has become a highly politicized issue: the battlefields of the Middle East and their casualties. Wodiczko’s focus has been on the dialogue of veterans; he will often project video of the veterans speaking, while broadcasting their words. His most recent work, created for and shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston, is smaller in scale, but does not depart from the frank manner in which he addresses war. Wodiczko attempts to make his audiences understand the nature of war by inundating them with emotionally charged visual and auditory material. He comes tantalizingly close by plastering safe and static public buildings with the frightening chaos of a foreign war, but his aggressive approach overwhelms the substance of his pieces.
Wodiczko’s piece, “...Out of Here: The Veterans Project,” on display until March 28, consists of two parts. The first, installed in a small dark room, contains screens that show similar installations Wodiczko has created. These works consist of video testimonies from veterans that are amplified and projected on various forms of architecture.
Wodiczko relies predominantly on documentary in his work. Most of the dialogue he presents comes directly from veterans. This technique, in effect, positions Wodiczko in the role of translator—by projecting the veterans’ words and playing them at full volume, the artist focuses on, but does not profess to change, their messages. The choice Wodiczko makes to amplify the voices with loudspeakers and display the videos on public buildings is deliberate. His confrontational style unavoidably instills in the stories a larger political message that the veterans may not have originally intended.
The crux of the exhibition, however, is Wodiczko’s new work, housed in the larger of the two spaces in the ICA. The room, which displays images projected onto the walls, gives viewers the experience of standing in a warehouse. The majority of the room is black, with high windows projected on three sides. Shrouded in darkness, the viewers can only see what would plausibly be visible through these windows. At the beginning of the installation, the frosted glass panes reveal only a blue sky.
Inside the room, viewers become witnesses to an unfolding story, played out through the windows and accompanying sound. The scene begins uneventfully, but ominously. Pundit-like voices discussing a Middle Eastern war flood the room, and then sounds of everyday life replace the conversation. The shadow of a soccer ball flits by the projected window. Other voices chatter in Arabic while music plays in the background. The scene seems unexceptional, but the shadow of a helicopter signals the chaos that is to come.
Suddenly, American soldiers arrive, and it becomes apparent that they suspect that dangerous forces dwell inside the warehouse. Cacophony erupts—the soldiers shatter the windows and blow holes into the sides of the building. The volume of the audio element deafens. Just as abruptly, the commotion ends, and sounds of street life resume, as if oblivious to the passing turmoil. Only the twisted metal of the windows serves as a sign of the skirmish that just occurred.
Wodiczko tries to achieve verisimilitude in this piece with visual and auditory effects, without relying on his usual documentary measures. Yet he still encounters the problem of exploitation. By creating his own narrative and dialogue, he projects his perception of the defining characteristics of war onto the audience.
What is most frustrating about this piece is how close Wodiczko’s depiction of war comes to feeling real. He manages to truly immerse the audience, particularly with the absence of apparent gore, but the dialogue he pairs with the images is ineffective. The men talking seem as if they are reading off a script; what they say is a clichéd version of what one might expect soldiers to say, and the way that they say it is stilted rather than realistic.
The visual cues also take on a mechanical quality. It becomes clear that the images are computer-generated, and because of this realization, the explosions and smoke seem more suitable to a video game.
The ICA introduces Wodiczko as an artist who has expanded the definition of a veteran to refer to any victim of war. With “...Out of Here: The Veterans Project,” Wodiczko attempts to transform the audience into veterans. He transports them into the center of the kind of confrontation that is an everyday reality for many. However, because audience members remain protected by the walls of the warehouse environment, and by the fact that they cannot directly participate in the narrative, they remain as spectators.
The full immersion technique of this piece serves its function in the beginning, when it is simple and understated. However, as soon as the attack from the soldiers begins, the work veers into cliché. Wodiczko is at his best when he manipulates images and scale, instilling simple images with significance. His choice to project closed fists on a government building carries much more weight than the booming loudspeaker that often accompanies these images. Wodiczko shouts with all his strength to turn the audience’s attention to the horror of war, but the terrible images and stories he portrays hardly need amplification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decision of a group of protestors—which included several Harvard students—to stage a “sleep-out” in support of climate-change legislation last Monday evening in Boston Common might strike observers as odd. Yet while setting up tents in the very tame wilderness of central Boston is peculiar, the cause the demonstrators supported is not. The students, through their transient tent city, intended to call attention to climate change and show support for introducing a bill that would require Massachusetts to be powered with 100-percent renewable energy by 2020. As expected, the protest was broken up by Boston police officers, and now nearly 70 participants have been served citations for trespassing on public property. But the Harvard administration’s lack of support for its protesting students has added a mini-drama to this strange story that could have been avoided at little cost.
Given Harvard’s rhetoric about sustainability and “Green is the New Crimson” campaign, it is disappointing that, when the university was approached by Harvard students interested in staging a sleep-out for climate change on the Harvard campus, administrators rejected the students’ petition. Allowing the students to stage a protest here would have helped to raise awareness on campus, showcased Harvard’s commitment to dealing with the pressing problem of climate change, and avoided what is now a headache for the administration and protesters alike.
Last night, HUPD officers brought the long arm of the law to bear over an attempted sleep-out in Tercentenary Theatre. Around 10:15 p.m., protestors were forced to dismantle their tents and head back to more conventional accommodations while policemen stood by. This sort of silly incident should have been avoided—peaceful, respectful protestors harm no one with their decision to sleep in tents outside a freshmen dorm.
Also, while Harvard’s officers didn’t hand out any arrests or citations last night, city police might not be so accommodating. Yet students who chose to return to future sleep-outs planned in Boston will have to do so knowing that Harvard’s standard protocol stipulates that any student who is arrested is subject to a six-month mandatory leave and that the university has declined to state whether it would apply the same standard to those arrested while sleeping out.
The administration already made the poor choice of not allowing students to stage a sleep-out in a controlled environment where there was no risk of lawbreaking—it should not compound one folly with another. This cause in particular is in line with Harvard’s mission, and its supporters should not be needlessly burdened. The administration should refrain from blocking harmless protests and potentially meting out unwarranted punishments and instead show that it agrees that climate change is a cause worth sleeping for.

Dear UHS,
I know that you’re already under fire for your swine-flu quarantining practices, so criticizing you for something else might be like kicking a lame dog. Everyone can see you’re beleaguered as it is. However, sometimes it’s necessary to kick that lame dog, no matter how trustworthy a companion it has been. If you suddenly find it on your chest as you sleep and it won’t get off, you might have to remove it forcefully. And you, UHS, are weighing me down.
A few weekends ago, I went to you looking for help. I had dislocated my shoulder dancing. Yes, dancing. One too-forceful fist pump, and out popped my shoulder. After several unsuccessful attempts at popping it back into place on my own, I decided to go to you, even though I knew that you usually don’t handle shoulder dislocations. I guess I just thought that having you help call an ambulance might be preferable to having to figure everything out on my own.
But by the time I made it, my shoulder was no longer the main issue. On the way, unwellness overwhelmed me and I passed out, hitting my head on a fence as I fell. Ironically enough, the impact knocked my shoulder back into place. But I had traded the discomfort of a dislocated shoulder for a gash on my head.
You can understand why, once I reached you, all I wanted was a sling for my arm and some stitches for my head. Instead, you gave me a heavy dose of disdain and blame. You openly doubted my story of injuring myself while dancing, even after I told both a nurse and doctor that I had congenitally loose shoulder joints. You looked at me skeptically when I explained how I fell. You asked if I had been drinking, and when I admitted that I had, you rudely thrust a Breathalyzer into my face to register my BAC. At somewhere between .082 and .112, it was above the legal limit to drive—but hardly criminal. Yet that’s what you treated me as. (I was drinking, but that’s not why I fell down.)
Your attending physician, clearly harried and overworked by the usual Saturday night clientele, made no bones about the fact that she had no time for me. She sent me away to Mount Auburn Hospital with only the explanation that she was too busy to tend to me (rather than explain that UHS did not have CT scans and I needed one for my head). At the hospital, I had to wait five hours for my head to be sewn up, but there was none of the attitude that had characterized my time at UHS. No recriminations, no doubting, no judgment. It was professional.
I don’t remember the exact time that I returned to you, UHS, though I think it was somewhere around six or seven in the morning. I sat in the waiting area for a while, sure that I was just going to check in and check out. Little did I know that I was listed under “alcohol-related injuries” and so was going to have to stay until the daytime physician reported for duty. When I left the room they had placed me in to ask what time I could expect to be released (I had planned to work on my thesis prospectus), I got no comprehensible answer to my question.
Instead, the on-duty physician, the same one from the night before, exploded at me: “Do you see any of the other patients roaming the halls making demands? Do you have an appointment? No, I don’t think so. What makes you think you’re so special?” Thoroughly taken aback, I tried to get out that all I wanted was an idea of when I’d be able to leave so that I could plan my day. Frustrated, I trudged back to my room, and a nurse had to be sent in to calm me down. The daytime physician arrived two hours later, and in comparison our interaction was as pleasant as could be.
I wouldn’t make a fuss about this, UHS, if I felt that this treatment was a unique situation. It’s not that I’m singling out the first doctor as malevolent. I understand she was just stressed out, overworked, tired. But you are staffed with academics like her who did not sign on for this, who prefer the low-simmer stress of the classroom to the adrenaline spikes of the emergency room. They are wonderful when it comes to the quotidian checkups that most of us use you for—but when it comes to a head wound, especially on a busy Friday or Saturday, the frightening possibility exists that bedside manner may become a weekend casualty.
Especially if alcohol is involved. Alcohol might make us act drunk, but it makes you, UHS, act crazy. You fixate on the substance rather than on the substantive problems. We hear anecdotes all the time of friends showing up drunk and with broken ankles, yet only treated—with a sneer—for the alcohol. The psychological trauma of having to spend any time in a hospital (where no hospitality is to be found) is hard enough as is without having those who are supposed to “help” only helping increase our sense of shame.
All my best,
Sanders Bernstein

I know what you’re thinking: Pointless paper shuffling, deeper deficits. Where do people get the nerve to suggest more bureaucratic mess? Creating another cabinet-level department would waste precious time, energy, and resources. On the other hand, the unemployment rate is into double digits, and we need to flesh out some fresh ideas for recovery.
A U.S. Department of Culture could provide jobs to thousands of Americans. As it does in most other advanced democracies, it need not promote any specific artists, but rather serve as an economic engine and revitalize the national spirit broadly. The department could directly invest in arts education, museums, libraries, public radio, and public television. It could create special task forces—for example, a young “artist corps” for low-income schools and neighborhoods, an original Obama campaign idea. It could establish federal writing projects to promote cultural literacy and historical memory. As a bonus, culture department officials could serve as popular diplomatic emissaries.
France, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and the UK all have ministries of culture. Some might say that’s all fine and good, but those countries are not America—where the government generally refrains from interfering with our sense of who we are. Young Republicans may see little worth in more red tape—even if it’s wrapped around reinvigorated national pride. Young Democrats—who have ironically paid less attention to public culture over the last decade than Republicans—may fear the purview of the state over something as precious to progressives as the arts.
But, truth be told, we’re not too far off from a Department of Culture as it is. We just need tie it all together. In addition to the National Endowment for Arts—which received $50 million in stimulus money—we have the National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute for Museum and Library Services, National Public Radio, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the State Department’s cultural programs, and ,of course, the Smithsonian. All in all, the argument against rolling out the frontiers of the state is pretty weak—they’re already rolled. If anything, a Department of Culture would make federal support of cultural programs less of a mismanaged mess.
A Department of Culture could hire administrative staffers and full-time workers in addition to putting the unemployed of the arts sector back on their feet and working for a common purpose. Some might argue that financing artists should be low on our priority totem pole. But artists are taxpayers, rent-payers, and consumers—just like everyone else. This country has 100,000 nonprofit arts groups, which employ some six million people and contribute $167 billion to the economy per year. Of course, in the long term we could use more engineers and science teachers, but right now we really need more working Americans exchanging goods and services.
The vision of an expanded federal role in promoting American culture isn’t entirely unprecedented, especially in challenging times. Although it only hired a few employees, during the Great Depression, the Farm Security Administration received a mandate for a national photography project that did much to lift the spirits of the country. In the early days of both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, officials lobbied hard for an Arts Secretary. Shortly after President Obama’s election, music composer and mogul Quincy Jones briefly pushed for a cabinet-level position so the average American kid might know who Toni Morrison and Joan Baez are.
Some might contend that a Department of Culture would quickly become a Department of Propaganda. It could fall into the wrong hands. Yet this is a fear for any federal department. There’s a risk that even the Department of the Interior can fall prey to private contractors and a particular political ideology. Perhaps a more important question: Why should anyone have the authority to say what American culture is? There’s a fear that the Department of Culture could become an ethnocentric, gender- or class-biased agency. But the department need not take this route and could legitimately maintain a position of unity through diversity—just as the Smithsonian and the NEA have.
If anything, the department could play a prominent part in the big picture of bringing Americans together in tough times. Some days it seems this country has a problem solving social problems, and part of that is because many Americans from different backgrounds don’t recognize the importance of each other’s contributions to American vitality and well being.  It might be a special mission of the department to put Americans more in touch with one another in times where we need more trust and solidarity.
It’s a shame cultural policy is not perceived as “real” public policy. As Americans, we have a responsibility for both stewardship of our heritage and the welfare of our posterity—in both material and immaterial terms. At the heart of American culture has always been a special knack for innovation in challenging circumstances. It is entirely appropriate that we should now consider jazzing up our institutions and investing in our best, brightest, and most beautiful to aid in national recovery.

Who courts anymore?
Everyone complains about the demise of dating. The notion that Harvard students are either “married,” consigned to an endless series of strings-optional hook ups, or unofficial members of True Love Revolution has become so widespread that it’s practically a truism. Visit HarvardFML, and amidst a sea of complaints about Ec10, loud roommates, and general academic difficulties, you notice a trend. People are in love with TFs who are contractually obligated to rebuff their advances; people can’t hook up; people hook up too often; messages are mixed, wires are crossed, and over it all emerges the mournful wail of a generation unable to find anyone to date.
One recent poster typifies this trend: “I settle for a new hookup each weekend since no guy wants a relationship. FML.”  The half-dozen or so responses to this exclamation are illuminating, including one that reads: “I want a relationship. But you wouldn’t consider me, ever, since I don’t go to parties, am ‘no fun,’ and apparently am an asshole.” Whoever this is, he sure knows how to advertise!
David Brooks recently penned a column about how cell phones have destroyed the roadblocks that courtship used to impose. Constantly texting a whole universe of potential partners, he complains, forces you to maintain an ironic distance from any given person. But the thing about irony is that it has a time limit. Years ago, I started ironically using the phrase “totes” as a form of assent. Now I hurl “totes” everywhere, even at people who ask me if I want whipped cream on my lattes. “I didn’t used to actually say ‘totes,’” I apologize, ruefully. The barista nods. “I didn’t used to call people Dudemeisters,” he admits.
This is exactly why ironic dating is impossible. It escalates suddenly, and you find yourself married to a man you’d only approached because your friends thought his ears looked funny.
While Brooks’s account of oversexed people manipulating universes of multiple potential partners through their cell phones is, as he admits, a little too colorful to be representative—who are these people texting? How can I meet them?—he does make one accurate observation. Whether it’s thanks to the movies, the prevailing winds, or perhaps changing global temperatures that make bedsharing essential to survival, the culture has changed. We can’t pretend we still live in those halcyon days when your parents arranged your whole romantic life for you and the only things you had to worry about were catching polio or that your doctor would use too many leeches. We have to find our own ways of making choices, instead of quietly contracting dysentery to escape unfavorable matches the way we used to.
But David Brooks and the like fail to acknowledge that we live in an era where potential partners expect to exchange vast amounts of personal information before any dating can take place. In the days of gentlemen callers, all that you knew about your expected significant others was whether they enjoyed glass unicorns and whatever else you could glean from a 30-minute conversation. Now, you have to fill out 25-page online questionnaires specifying your every preference, sometimes with disastrous results. Once I filled out an online dating form saying that I had completed “some college” and that “level of education” was “very important” to me. For weeks, I received invitations to meet “creatively unemployed” 54-year-olds who also had completed “some college.”
However cynical and even “ironically detached” our generation has become, we still cling to  the notion that somewhere out there, maybe lurking in the dark behind some building, is the right person for everyone. But how do you find this person? As David Brooks and the FMLers might argue, the system we have going doesn’t seem to be doing an optimal job, and it’s certainly running up our texting bills. Out of this frustration emerges the hook up culture, where that old saying about cows and milk has been altered past recognition. “Why marry the cow if you can get the milk for free?” our parents asked. “We know we’re not marrying the cow,” our generation replies. “But in the meantime, hey! Free milk!” In these economic times, you have to take all the handouts you can get.
But until we figure out a better solution, perhaps we should cool it a little. The problem with no-strings-attached hook ups is that sometimes people forget to take all the strings off. Shouldn’t we get to know each other before we start getting to know each other? Maybe, before leaping into bed, everyone should sit down and fill out comprehensive forms that cover our opinions on politics, philosophy, free-range chicken, and that one episode of Sex and the City where Samantha confronts those transvestites. By the time we finish the form, we will have a) found true love, b) passed out from boredom, or c) sobered up enough to realize how odd-looking that guy’s ears are.
Sounds like a plan to me.

The Mexico City Metrobús, a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, was awarded the John F. Kennedy School of Government 2009 Roy Family Award for Environmental Partnership yesterday.
The award, given bi-annually, celebrates “an outstanding public-private partnership project that enhances environmental quality through the use of novel and creative approaches.”
This year, it was given to multiple parties involved in the funding and operation of the transit system, including Marcelo Ebrard, the Mayor of Mexico City, the World Bank, the Shell Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
Ebrard gave a speech about sustainable megacities to a packed Piper Auditorium, located in the Graduate School of Design. A private award ceremony followed, which was held in the Malkin Penthouse at the Kennedy School.
Metrobús Director Guillermo Calderon attributed the success of the project to the high capacity and low emission rates of the new buses. The Metrobús fleet also has separate lanes from other vehicles on the road, which “reduces travel time by 40 percent.”
“A lot of people have come to Mexico City to learn from Metrobús to [implement] this system in other places,” he said.
Steve Knaebel, a consultant to the Metrobús project, said that the transformation brought about by the transit system is societal as well as environmental.
People who would normally drive to their destinations are now willing to take public transit because of its “speed, convenience [and] reliability,” he said.
“[It] is changing the social mix of the passengers,” he said.
The group then discussed another problem faced by cities today: densification. Nancy Kete, the Director of EMBARQ—the World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport— said that as world motorization rates are increasing, the urban sprawl phenomenon is “absolutely unsustainable” and will serve to damage the environment.
Ebrard said that during this economic crisis, his main goal for the next year is to find financial resources to fund initiatives like Metrobús.
“We want to introduce new technologies, produce energy for the city, …[and] expand the public transportation system in the city,” he said.
Ebrard added that this is a global issue, which schools like Harvard should help to solve.
“Harvard is one of the most important institutions in the world,” he said. “People in the world are following discussions at [the University].”
Some students who attended the speech, including Nicole K. Carter ’13, praised Mexico City’s response to the sustainability issue.
“It’s interesting to see how megacities are dealing with new challenges for combating climate change,” she said. “It provides a good model to understand how, in the future, other cities could possibly solve these problems.”

Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., spoke about his book “Colored People: A Memoir”, a homage to his family and West Virginia hometown, to a crowd of nearly 500 people last night in Sanders Theatre.
Gates, who was at the center of a national controversy over his arrest by the Cambridge Police this summer, touched on the incident, but devoted the majority of the talk to discussing his book.
The presentation, hosted by the Cambridge Public Library’s ‘Cambridge READS’ program and sponsored by the Harvard Bookstore and Porter Square Books, featured a conversation between  Gates, a professor and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies, and Callie Crossley, national media commentator and public speaker.
Gates began by reading excerpts from his memoir, including the preface in which he explained his compulsion to write “Colored People” as an attempt to preserve the rich memories of growing up colored in the 1950’s, negro in the early 60’s, and black in the later 60’s in small-town Piedmont, West Virginia, with a family who stressed the importance of education.
“My whole being is from Piedmont, West Virginia,” said Gates.  “I wrote a love letter to those people, a love letter to my mother, a love letter to that way of life.  Nothing thrills me like seeing the hills of West Virginia.”
He also discussed the necessity for younger generations to understand life in America before the Civil Rights era, commenting on the great disparity between the opportunities he had growing up versus those of his older brother, Paul “Rocky” Gates.
“I’m keenly and acutely aware of the privileged position I have. I think about all those generations of frustrations before me,” said Gates. “They had just as good ideas as mine, if not better, and they could not actualize them.  I think that would have killed me, or killed something in me.”
Gates also differentiated between willing association and forced separation, mentioning the significance of being proud to find comfort in cultural rituals and traditions and the importance of maintaining multiple identities.
The presentation proved to be moving as Gates described the profound loss of his mother who he attributes much of his success to.
“I was really touched by the passages he read and how he got very emotional,” said audience member Meredith C. Woods ’83.  “As an African American, his book really speaks to me and my own cultural experience.  It is so important because it speaks to a lot of people’s American experience no matter what ethnicity you are touching on.”

Harvard and five other institutions of higher learning signed a statement articulating their commitment to promoting medical technology accessibility to developing countries on Monday, stirring both criticism among students that the University did not do enough.
In the document, entitled “Statement of Principles and Strategies for the Equitable Dissemination of Medical Technologies,” the constituents have agreed that “intellectual property should not become a barrier to essential health-related technologies needed by patients in developing countries.”
Krishna M. Prabhu ’11, a member of the Harvard chapter of the Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM), said that he thought that medical patents were problematic and adversely affect human health in developing countries such as India and China.
Patents significantly increase the price of drugs in these nations due to the lack of competition from producers of the similar product, he said. Without a patent, the generic drug is likely to become more affordable.
Currently, the six-school pledge makes an exception for “special circumstances” in developing countries, including India, China or Brazil, allowing drug patents in some developing countries.
“The biggest issue is the fact that they are still planning on patenting in the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China—and that is problematic,” said Jillian L. Irwin ’11, a member of Harvard UAEM. “For us, the challenge is to ensure that they are not putting patents [on the drugs] and that there is a strategy in place for poor people to get them.”
Both Irwin and Prabhu said that the statement signed by Harvard does not guarantee access to affordable, generic drugs for those in developing countries.
According to Prabhu, “Harvard has covered no bases.”
Kevin Casey, a spokesperson for Harvard, said that decisions about these technologies are difficult to make.
“There is a very delicate system of innovation that the technologies make before it is brought to the market place at all,” he said.
“It is an evolving field,” Casey said, adding that, “Right now our efforts have resulted in very important principles.”
Students from the Harvard UAEM suggest forming a committee made of both students and global health experts to review policy.
“They are not unprecedented because committees like these have existed for conflict of interests,” said Prabhu. “In the end, it is better for more people to think about how we license out technology.”
The Harvard UAEM will be holding a rally in the Yard next Thursday.
CORRECTIONS
An earlier version of the Nov. 13 article "Harvard Pledges To Make Medical Technology Accessible" misspelled the last name of Krishna M. Prabhu '11 as Praghu.
In the initial version, Prabhu was also indirectly quoted as saying that patents adversely impact human health worldwide. In fact, his concerns about patents were specifically made with respect to developing nations.
The version also incorrectly referred to the Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) as UAME on one occasion, and said that the organization's rally on Thursday would be held in front of the Science Center. In fact, it will be held in the Yard.

Journalists must stop focusing on entertainment and return to serious political investigation, said journalist and historian Taylor Branch at an Institute of Politics Forum last night.
Branch, who won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1988 for his series “America in the King Years,” spoke about “The Clinton Tapes,” his recently released book chronicling his time as the historian and confidant of President Bill Clinton.
Speaking as part of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center’s Theodore H. White Lecture, Branch used the media’s role in the scandals of the Clinton administration to demonstrate the need for journalistic reform. He said that he sees the Monica Lewinsky scandal as a symptom of the breakdown of the process.
The media’s failure was “made possible by the fact that over those five years the other scandals had eroded our understanding of what a proper investigation of a President should be to the point that a sitting President should be compelled to answer questions about his sex life,” Branch said.
He emphasized that journalists no longer focus on the real issues.
“Even in The New York Times, it’s just got a lot of silliness in it—like a page one story about whether Obama plays basketball with too many men,” Branch said.
The audience was partially composed of those drawn by the discussion of journalistic issues.
One such attendee with an interest in the media, Daniel S. Sullivan, a Harvard Extension School graduate, said, “I find that Taylor Branch really represents the mindset of a journalist who believes at getting at the heart of the piercing questions we have.”
Other audience members came to hear Branch’s unprecedented insight into Clinton’s policy process and home life.
According to Daniel Okrent, a friend of Branch’s who served as the first public editor of The New York Times and who is a currently a visiting professor with the Shorenstein Center, Branch’s personal history with the Clintons during their time working together on the McGovern campaign allowed him unparalleled access to the President.
“I came as a Clinton fan,” Hannah Masoud, who works at the Harvard-affiliated non-profit Partners In Health, said.
During the event, the Shorenstein Center also awarded the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism to Nat Hentoff, a historian and former syndicated columnist.

Harvard University’s “labyrinthine” library system should be drastically restructured in the next few years, according to the Task Force on University Libraries’ report released yesterday.
“Harvard libraries can no longer harbor delusions of being a completely comprehensive collection,” the report said in a sober assessment of the challenges facing the system.
In order to alleviate budgetary pressures, the report prescribes a series of solutions, among them the possibility of closing some of Harvard’s 73 libraries and reassessing the University’s ambitious, comprehensive collection strategy.
“No single institution can bear the burden of acquiring the entire world’s informational output,” the report says, acknowledging that Harvard’s previous strategy of a “single university” collection is unsustainable.
It recommends that the system—the largest at any university in the world—adopt a twenty-first century approach that focuses on greater collaboration with other institutions of higher learning and shift toward more digital purchases, rather than traditional print resources.
The report is the product of a year-long investigation initiated by the Provost’s office into a heavily decentralized system that has experienced escalating costs and a falling budget in recent years.
Library expenditures grew by 25 percent between 2004 and 2008, and the libraries experienced heavy budget cuts last year after both the University endowment and the dollar fell, leading the Harvard College Library—the largest unit within the system—to seek a $12 million cost reduction by 2010.
The Task Force was charged in the wake of budget concerns across the University, said Provost Steven E. Hyman. But he said yesterday that the goal of the task force is “not to wring money out of the libraries” but to put in place long-awaited reforms.
“The issues we addressed are fundamentally independent of the financial crisis and its impact on library and other budgets, in that we’d have needed to address them even if the economy and our endowment had been stable or growing last year and beyond,” said Andrew D. Gordon ‘75, a history professor and task force member. “That said, the crisis makes it all the more important to follow up on this report.”
Hyman said he hoped the subsequent implementation working group will achieve “substantial progress” within a year on some of the report’s core reforms, which include putting in place new models for library funding and governance.
In addition, the report stated that the library system—composed of 73 disparate entities and 1,200 full-time employees—currently lacks a common organizational structure, and individual libraries are responsible for managing acquisitions.
Many libraries use computer systems that are incompatible with other Harvard libraries and peer institutions, preventing collaboration both within and outside the university. Harvard is also the only Ivy League institution that does not participate in BorrowDirect, a library consortium that allows for inter-school loans and eases the burden on schools to maintain a frenetic pace of book acquisition.
Hyman said he hoped the next year would also see the creation of software that would correct this compatibility problem and facilitate cooperation with peer institutions, one of the major recommendations of the task force report.
The effort towards collaboration is a transition away from the emphasis on growth that has led the 370-year-old system to expand into one of the top five largest libraries in the world.
“The more crucial question is whether we have access—the less crucial question is whether we own it or not,” said Task Force Chair and Harvard Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth.
“This is a phenomenal system, but it’s not ideally positioned to move into a kind of twenty first century library environment, which is evolving as we speak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day was perfect: overcast and misty. Eyeing the familiar high school track, she tried to hold back her nervous excitement as she adjusted her biker gloves and knee pads. Today, she had ditched the bubble wrap that usually covered her hand and knee padding. But she had added something new: elbow pads on her shoes.
A large crowd of students, faculty, and parents gathered behind her, chanting, “Let’s go, Laura, let’s go!” But their voices slurred into a muted blur. She could not hear them.
Slowly, as she had practiced so many times before, she bent down on her knees. Her fingers edged up against the white starting line. Then someone yelled, “Go!”
Placing one knee and hand in front of the other in a perfect rhythmic motion, she began to crawl.
As a high school junior, Laura E. D’Asaro ’13 broke the world record for being the fastest person to crawl a mile. In doing so, she raised over $5,000 for the American Cancer Society during a Relay for Life fund raiser. One-and-a-half years after that momentous June day, D’Asaro—an unconditional optimist who seeks inspiration in unusual non-profit ventures—continues to explore the philanthropic potential in breaking world records. Her latest project is starting a club at Harvard that will work to raise money for charity by breaking world records.
“WORLD RECORD IN PROGRESS”
D’Asaro’s crawling adventure started in January 2008, when she flipped past the flashy cover of the “Guinness World Records” at a bookstore near her home in Seattle, Wash. Intrigued, she entertained the idea of pursuing a record herself.
Two of the entries especially caught her eye: a man who had done the most number of cartwheels in an hour, and another who had the most number of snails stuck to his face for 10 seconds. But though she had some gymnastics experience, she did not feel up to the challenge of doing over 1,000 cartwheels. And she did not “want to be known as the girl who stuck snails to her face.”
Then D’Asaro saw the record time for crawling the mile: 23 minutes and 45 seconds. Realizing that crawling is “not a popular sport,” D’Asaro decided that this was the record she wanted to break.
In her initial test crawl, which took place on her school track, she completed the mile in 45 minutes. Armed with newly purchased biker gloves and kneepads, D’Asaro spent a week crawling around her neighborhood. On her second attempt around the track, D’Asaro found that she had improved her time by 10 minutes. She realized then, she said, that her project was actually “feasible.”
Every day for the next five months, rain or shine, D’Asaro padded her hands and knees as soon as she came home from school, securing them in layers of bubble wrap with long strips of duct tape. Then, wearing a sign on her back that read, “World Record in Progress,” she would begin her daily crawl. During these 45-minute training sessions, she sometimes brought her dog along, attaching its leash to a harness on her back. Other days, she asked a friend to walk with her.
“You had to walk briskly to keep up,” said Matthew E. D’Asaro, her older brother.
Meanwhile, D’Asaro’s school began organizing its annual Relay For Life, an event during which participants run or walk for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society. D’Asaro realized the fund raiser would be the perfect occasion to break the crawling record.
Now, when she went out on her daily crawls, the “World Record in Progress” sign taped to her back sported an additional line: the URL for her Relay For Life donation page. Money from neighbors and passersby soon came pouring in.
A NATURAL PHILANTHROPIST
When D’Asaro first announced her crawling project to her family, no one took her seriously.
“None of us would believe her because it seemed so completely odd,” Matthew said. “But that’s usually the case with Laura: When she sets her mind on doing something, she does it.”
This was certainly not the only time that D’Asaro had proposed—and actualized—a philanthropic vision.
In 2006, she raised over $13,500 selling lemonade and cookies to build a new playground for a local park. A year later, she mobilized classmates to record and distribute 150 books-on-tape to help disadvantaged children in her community learn to read. And earlier this year, she e-mailed over 100,000 elementary school teachers across the nation, asking their classes to participate in a card-making campaign for nursing home residents. This last effort resulted in her family’s e-mail service being temporarily shut down because she was suspected of running a spam operation.
Matthew, an engineering student at the University of Washington, helped her create Web sites for these projects, but all of D’Asaro’s initiatives have been self-directed. Her father, an oceanographer, and her mother, a former computer technician, have played mostly supporting roles.
But, D’Asaro said that they have been consistently dedicated to helping her succeed. “I mean sometimes they roll their eyes, but they’re always there,” she said.
Matthew said D’Asaro has more “happy energy” than anyone else in the family, adding that this “excess of enthusiasm” is a response to “living with three other people discussing technical matters” all the time.
“I’m happy about 98 percent of the time,” D’Asaro said. “I just don’t see a reason not to smile.”
A CONTAGIOUS SPIRIT
Now that she is at Harvard, D’Asaro hopes to spread her interest in breaking world records to raise money for charitable causes. Her ultimate goal is to form a permanent philanthrophy-focused club on campus.
So far, D’Asaro has started planning a Student Initiated Program through the Freshman Dean’s Office that will tackle some of the easier group world records first, such as recruiting the most people to balance books on their heads simultaneously or staging the largest game of “Duck, Duck, Goose.” Although the SIP is still in its early stages, she has already announced the intention to break these two records, along with 36 others, to Guinness World Records officials.
D’Asaro is also seeking businesses to sponsor her proposed attempt to break the record for the world’s longest handshake. Her friend Christopher D. Frugé ’13 has agreed to be her partner in this endeavor.
D’Asaro’s motivation for these projects comes from innovative humanitarian enterprises that she reads about online. This summer, she started collecting these ideas in a journal. Inside the front cover, she has inscribed her guiding mantra: “What would you do if you knew you could not fail?”
Finding creative solutions to world problems, D’Asaro said, is her greatest dream.
“I want my life to mean something,” D’Asaro said. “When I die, I want [the world] to be a better place because I was in it. Each day is an opportunity to do that.”
22 MINUTES, 4 SECONDS
She had reached the last stretch of her crawl, but she refused to think about this. Ignoring the track timer, she forced herself to focus only on her breathing and counted silently: one, two, one, two.
Her father followed her with a video camera, his feet just a few steps behind her.
“Let’s go, Laura, lets go!” The crowd’s enthusiasm mounted.
Then her second foot crossed the finish line, and suddenly she could hear again. The cheering roared in her ears.
Her heart pounding, she tumbled to the ground with a smile on her face.
She was already beginning to celebrate what had been the most painful, yet exhilarating 22 minutes and 4 seconds of her life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer criticized the federal response to the economic crisis in a lecture yesterday sponsored by Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics, an appearance some media outlets called ironic due to Spitzer’s resignation in the midst of a prostitution scandal.
Speaking before a packed audience and news cameras, Spitzer emphasized that the Obama administration should invest more money in job creation and infrastructure, rather than directing money to propping up large banks and other bankrupt companies.
“Too big to fail is too big not to fail,” Spitzer said. “There are only two people who seem not to get that so far: [Former University President and National Economic Council Director] Larry Summers and [Treasury Secretary] Tim Geithner.”
Instead of giving $182 billion to insurance giant AIG, he said, the government should take such action as promising to buy 5,000 electric cars in 2013 and building electric charging stations along the highway system.
Spitzer criticized the federal assumption of bank debts, saying that socializing risk while privatizing gain creates an asymmetry and distorts incentives.
The former New York Attorney General also argued that the government must intervene in the marketplace in order to enforce integrity and transparency, claiming that markets will not address certain core values, including issues of discrimination and the minimum wage.
He added that only the government can ensure competition and prevent monopolies.
“I thought his suggestions were really enlightening, and politicians should pay more attention to them,” Amanda E. McGowan ’13 said.
Spitzer also addressed broader problems with corporate governance, which  he said were “at the heart and soul of what has failed in the last 30 years.”
He emphasized that to limit the power of CEOs, shareholders must become more involved with reforming companies.
Spitzer served as New York’s main legal adviser from 1999 to 2006, when he became the state’s governor. In 2008, he resigned due to his connections with an elite prostitution ring. Prior to his address, numerous media outlets noted what some framed as a contradiction in the disgraced former governor speaking at a center for ethics.
Safra Center Director Lawrence Lessig introduced Spitzer as “perhaps the most important living prosecutor of a wide range of corruption.”
“No one doubts that what Governor Spitzer did was wrong, to his family, to his state, to his supporters across the country, to himself. This much is serious and clear,” Lessig said. “Likewise, no one doubts that until the moment he was charged, Governor Spitzer inspired the best in our profession.”
Following the lecture, one audience member asked whether Spitzer would comment on whether the revelations leading to his resignation were exposed due to someone’s ulterior motives, but Spitzer refrained from commenting.
“I won’t respond to it, and it’s not material to why I resigned,” said Spitzer, answering the question.
“I resigned because it was the right thing to do. The actions were wrong, and why they were made public doesn’t relate to anything I did, and it doesn’t excuse it,” the 1984 graduate from Harvard Law School added.
The lecture was one of several in a series on institutional corruption that Lessig launched this year.
Spitzer’s daughter, Elyssa A.L. Spitzer ’12, is a Crimson news editor.

Winner of the 1992 Booker Prize for The English Patient, poet and novelist Michael Ondaatje, delivered the fall Morris Gray Lecture yesterday to students and the general public, a break from tradition for the semi-annual lecture series’ tendency to  host poets exclusively, English Department members said.
In this unconventional selection of the author, the English Department is trying to expand the focus of the semi-annual lecture series beyond poetry, English Professor of Poetry Jorie Graham said.
Other English Department instructors were equally enthusiastic about the Sri Lankan author’s lecture.
Director of Creative Writing Bret A. Johnston said, “The lecture typically only has a poetry reading, but because [Ondaatje] is so successful both in prose and in poetry, we thought he’d be a wonderful lecturer, reading both his prose and poetry.”
Indeed, Johnston introduced Ondaatje as a writer who is “alone in construction of verse and narrative.”
The writer read several of his poems, including “The Great Tree” and “A Gentleman Compares his Virtue to a Piece of Jade,” and parts of his 2007 prose novel, Divisadero.
By intertwining his prose with the poetry, Ondaatje showed his versatility with language, while demonstrating the new focus of the lecture series, Johnston said.
Ondaatje said in a discussion following his readings how he began as a poet and “never imagined writing a novel.”
“But I think I wanted to take everything from poetry to prose,” Ondaatje said. “I tried to bring the same intimacy and precision from poetry to my prose.”
Ondaatje is best known for his novel “The English Patient,” which was adapted into an Academy-Award winning film.
Ondaatje has also won the Governor General’s award, presented by the Governor General of Canada, for two of his published books of poetry.
Although Ondaatje was born in Sri Lanka, he moved to England and then to Canada, where he studied and became a Canadian citizen.
Ondaatje also wrote a semi-fictional memoir, titled “Running in the Family,” about his childhood in Sri Lanka.
The spring Morris Gray Lecturer will be W.S. Merwin, another writer who has composed both prose and poetry.
Merwin won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry twice, in both 1971 and 2009. He also won the Tanning Prize, one of the highest honors bestowed by the Academy of American Poets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Businessman Stephen Pagliuca and social activist Alan Khazei ’83 battled it out yesterday in a debate held in Austin Hall at the Harvard Law School. Both men are running in the Democratic primary on December 8 to fill the seat of former Mass. Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
This discussion, portrayed as a battle of the alumni—Pagliuca graduated from Harvard Business School—brought together over 50 students and community members, drawing attention to the fast approaching primary elections. The debate was sponsored by the Harvard Law School, Business School and the Harvard College Democrats.
Khazei framed himself as a “social entrepreneur,” one who has spent his whole career in public service.
“We need a new approach, to get out of the tired debate of not Big Government versus Big Business, but rather Big Citizenship,” he said. “All of us need to get involved in politics. We each need to be involved in service. We all need to pick our causes we care about and join others for change.”
Pagliuca stressed both his experience in business, starting a venture capital fund that invested in health care companies, and his middle class roots.
“The issues that we are facing today: we have a job crisis. People are either out of work or they think they will be out of work.” He added, “I am really a representation of the American Dream...the number one thing you have to do is get an education.”
The only direct confrontation occurred with a question about accepting money from lobbyists or PAC’s, which both candidates eschewed. However, Khazei highlighted the personal wealth that Pagliuca, co-owner of the Boston Celtics and managing partner at private equity firm Bain Capital, was pouring into the race. Besides that, the two largely agreed on issues such as immigration reform and the current health care bill.
Students supporting the candidates stood outside Austin Hall with campaign signs and posters, and enthusiastically expressed their endorsements.
Jackson F. Cashion ‘13, said that he was supporting Alan Khazei because “he’s really inspiring with his work in public service”, which includes founding the non-profit organization City Year for urban development in Boston.
“[Mr. Khazei] does have a big group on campus, and does have youth support,” Cashion added.
Gabriel S. Neustadt ‘13, an intern on the Pagliuca Campaign, said that he thought Pagliuca’s character was needed in the Senate, even if he was an outsider and not a career politician.
“He pulled himself up and has the business experience to know how to work on the issues,” Neustadt said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard and Penn kickoff tomorrow’s Ivy League football championship game, all eyes will be on one side of the field.
Informed fans and bleary-eyed, “Holy crap...How the hell did I end up sleeping in the bleachers at Harvard Stadium last night?” observers alike will know that the matchup to watch is the Quakers’ run defense versus the two-headed Crimson tailback monster of junior Gino Gordon and Treavor Scales.
At face value, it makes sense.
Penn, after all, has the best defense in the Ivy League—and maybe in the entire Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division 1-AA)—but is especially punishing against the run.
Gordon and Scales, on the other hand, have heeded the advice that Will Ferrell’s character in “Kicking and Screaming” gives to the diminutive Byong Sun and the oversized Ambrose—they have formed a “megaperson.”
The duo has combined for 937 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns this season, giving Harvard the best ground attack in the Ivies by far.
But while the clash of rushing titans rages on in the trenches during Harvard’s possessions, another, less heralded battle on the other side of the ball may very well turn into Waterloo in one of these squads’ campaigns to conquer the Ancient Eight.
I’m referring to the matchup between Crimson senior linebacker Jon Takamura and Penn quarterback Kyle Olson. In a game that might come down to which squad can marginalize its few weaknesses most effectively, each player will be charged with holding bubble gum to a leaky faucet just long enough for his team to pull away with a win.
Olson gets the nod against Harvard despite Quaker starter Keiffer Garton making his return from injury. Olson has been mostly uninspiring behind center this season, but he’s coming off a 238-yard, three-touchdown performance against Princeton.
Yes, I know it was the same Princeton that has been outscored 237-82 by its opponents this season, but Penn and its seventh-ranked passing game will take whatever sliver of optimism it can get at this point.
It has to, at any rate, because failure for Olson spells the return of a rusty and still-banged up Garton, and what that will look like is anyone’s guess.
But with Harvard’s run defense as good as anyone’s (besides the Quakers’), Penn’s only option will be to take to the skies. The Crimson’s pass D ranks just sixth in the Ivy League, and while its secondary remains intact, its front seven have been losing starters to injuries all season.
If Harvard hopes to contain the Quakers’ aerial assault, Takamura is the X Factor. If he’s on his game, he’ll torment Olson to no end with his versatility. Takamura’s as dangerous rushing the quarterback as he is defending the pass—he’s fifth in the Ivies with 3.5 sacks and second with three interceptions, including one he took back for a touchdown.
The 6’2, 220-pound Hawaiian’s ability to gets in Olson’s head will determine whether it will be Penn quarterbacks or Harvard corners doing most of the backpedaling tomorrow—and probably where the Ivy League title trophy will call home for the next year, too.
DARTMOUTH (2-6, 2-3 IVY) AT BROWN (5-3, 3-2 IVY)
A hearty congratulations to Dartmouth, which is gasping for air right now after emerging from the dank, suffocating cellar of the Ivy League. I must say, Big Green, I didn’t know you had it in you. The grit you showed in your double-overtime win against Cornell last week was certainly the hallmark of a team on the rise.
I look forward to seeing you next season, when, like this year’s Columbia team, you’ll jump out to a hot start, evoke uncontrollable shrieks of “Sleeper!” from the “experts,” and inevitably disappoint everyone who ever believed in you. I’m not bitter, Lions.
Also, does anyone realize that Brown is the only other good team in the Ivy League besides Harvard and Penn? Seriously, look at the records. Yale’s at .500 because it fills its nonconference schedule with creampuffs and everyone else is just awful.
Prediction: Brown 35, Dartmouth 14.
COLUMBIA (2-6, 1-4 IVY) AT CORNELL (2-6, 1-4 IVY)
Ah, the two teams who lost to Dartmouth now play in some kind of Bizarro championship game of ineptitude. At least Cornell has its men’s basketball team and Columbia, well, Columbia’s got Park Terrace Deli across the street from its sports complex. Fantastic sandwiches. If you’re watching a baseball doubleheader, head over in the seventh inning so you can avoid the between-game rush.
Prediction: Cornell 28, Columbia 24.
YALE (4-4, 2-3 IVY) AT PRINCETON (2-6, 1-4 IVY)
Remember how after Harvard started imposing all those draconian tailgate restrictions the Yalies started talking about how now Yale-Princeton was The Game? Yea, have fun at this one Elis. Your limitless kegs are going to come in handy.
Prediction: Yale 13, Princeton 6.
PENN (6-2, 5-0 IVY) AT HARVARD (6-2, 5-0 IVY)
Best. Game. Ever. If there were ever a time for junior quarterback Collier Winters to have a statement game, this would be it. Harvard’s run game might make a dent, but it won’t be anything close to the juggernaut it’s been in recent weeks. It’s your moment, Collier. A huge game from you and Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 becomes a distant memory and you roll into the Yale Bowl a hero.
That would be nice to see, but this game is impossible to call with any semblance of confidence.
Prediction: Harvard 17, Penn 14.
LAST WEEK: 2-2
RECORD TO DATE: 27-17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It always comes down to Penn.”
That was how Harvard football coach Tim Murphy put it. In 2004, 2007, and 2008, his team had to go through the Quakers in order to win an Ivy League championship, and this year is no different. In fact, that statement is more true than ever.
The two rivals will face off tomorrow in a game that will determine the Ivy League championship.
The teams sit tied atop the conference standings with 5-0 Ivy records, both 6-2 overall. Tomorrow’s victor will clinch a guaranteed share of the league title and put itself in a position to win the Ancient Eight outright with a win next week.
With both teams expected to win their regular-season finales, the winner of tomorrow’s battle at Harvard Stadium will have a championship in its grasp.
Harvard is looking for its third-consecutive Ivy title. If it wins, it would mark the first football threepeat since Dartmouth earned three in a row from 1990-92. If Penn, which is on a six-game winning streak, takes this year’s title, it would be its first since 2003.
“When you win the league two years in a row, we’re pinning a bulls’ eye on ourselves,” said captain and defensive lineman Carl Ehrlich. “We took Penn out of contention last year...we know they’ll be gunning and looking for payback.”
The Crimson comes into the contest with the most efficient offense in the Ivy League, averaging 28.9 points per game. The Quakers have the best defense in Divison I-AA, allowing just 11.0 points per game. Something will have to give.
“It’s one thing moving the ball and scoring the points against some of the teams we’ve played recently,” Murphy said. “And playing a championship-level defense like Penn...I think that’s going to be our test.”
Unlike Harvard, Penn does not come in with a high-powered offense; instead, it has won by playing smart, efficient football. The Quakers have averaged fewer penalty yards per game than any other team in Division I, and have the highest time of possession and the best turnover margin in the Ivies.
Because of this, Harvard will have to force Penn to make mistakes and take it out of its “small-ball” style of play. If the Crimson can turn this one into a shootout, the Quakers—seventh in the Ancient Eight in pass offense—may have trouble winning.
Forcing mistakes will require putting pressure on Penn quarterbacks junior Keiffer Garton and senior Kyle Olson, who will likely both see playing time tomorrow. Garton started versus the Crimson last year, and though he ran for 174 yards, he threw three interceptions.
“With Keiffer, you got a guy that, you know, is—with [Columbia quarterback M.A.] Olawale out—probably the best and most athletic quarterback in the league, a kid that just killed us with his feet last year more than with his arm,” Murphy said.
The Crimson defense is thinking most about how to stop Penn’s running game. Quaker halfback Lyle Marsh rushed for 99 yards last week against Princeton and has averaged 4.9 yards per carry on the season.
“I think our defense’s M.O. is we stop the run, that’s what we [hang] our hats on,” Ehrlich said. “If we shut down a team’s running game and shut them down one-dimensionally, we can have success.”
The Crimson has recently been carried by its own running game. Freshman Treavor Scales and junior Gino Gordon have combined to rush for eight touchdowns in the past two games. But the duo should have a tougher time tomorrow. Penn has allowed only one rushing touchdown all season and hasn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher in 21 games.
If Gordon and Scales can’t get anything going on the ground, junior quarterback Collier Winters may need to prepare for an aerial assault.
But this will be no easy task, either. Winters’ receivers will be going up against against Penn corners Jonathan Moore and Chris Wynn, who have combined for six interceptions this season.
On the Harvard defensive side, the Crimson secondary will focus on shutting down Matt Tuten, the junior wideout who leads Penn in receiving.
“[The secondary is] doing a really good job as a unit communicating,” Ehrlich said. “They’re all really good athletes with a lot of experience and football intelligence, and I think them playing together [for so long] has been a formula for success.”
Tomorrow’s game may also end up being a battle inside the 20-yard line. Penn has the highest red-zone efficiency in the Ancient Eight, but kicker Andrew Sampson has only hit eight out of 17 attempted field goals.
Though the stakes are high, many Harvard players have experience in a game of this magnitude. It was just two years ago that Harvard blew out Yale in a battle of Ancient Eight undefeated teams, 37-6, to win the 2007 Ivy championship.
“I think that game was good because it gave kids on the team experience in big time games like that,” Ehrlich said. “[But] we’re well aware we’re only our team, we’re nothing like the team before.”
Though the team is different this year, the path is the same. As Murphy said, the road still goes through Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last November, the Harvard men’s soccer team gazed across the field in disappointment as Penn celebrated a conference crown. Tomorrow afternoon, the Crimson will take the field in its season finale with the opportunity to clinch its thirteenth Ivy title and the chance to earn retribution against the team that shattered its title hopes last year.
“We have been waiting all year to play them,” junior forward Alex Chi said. “It’s a really big game for us.”
Last season in Philadelphia, Penn stole the Ancient Eight title and the accompanying automatic NCAA tournament bid from Harvard’s grasp when the ball trickled into the net past then-freshman goalkeeper Austin Harms in the fifth minute of overtime.
“It was rough seeing them celebrate,” Chi said. “It made our team want it even more.”
But this year has offered a fresh start.
“It’s a different team, different makeup, different mindset, but the same goals,” Crimson coach Jamie Clark said.
This time at home on Ohiri Field, No. 11 Harvard (12-3-1, 4-1-1 Ivy), the only nationally ranked Ivy team, will play Penn (6-7-3, 2-3-1), again with the title at stake. The Crimson controls its own destiny with a single point lead atop the standings on both Brown and Dartmouth, who play each other this week. As long as the Bears and Big Green do not tie, Harvard must defeat the Quakers on Saturday to clinch the conference.
Even though the Crimson has almost certainly assured itself a spot in the NCAA tournament with its season thus far, the team still wants to call itself league champion.
“It’s really important [to win the conference] because we were so close last year,” Chi said. “Winning the Ivy League will give us a much higher seed in the tournament.”
Thanks in part to Chi’s play last week, Harvard has the opportunity to control its own destiny and move up the NCAA tournament bracket. Against Columbia, it looked like the title chance was about to slip through the team’s fingertips with Harvard down a goal late in the second half. But freshman forward Brian Rogers brought the Crimson back and sent the game into an extra period with a goal in the 79th minute. In overtime, the momentum stayed on Harvard’s side, and with fewer than five minutes into the period, Chi scored to keep the Crimson’s championship hopes alive.
“It would have been a major disappointment and put a lot more pressure on us if we didn’t win last week,” Clark said. “It can be good to go through some adversity and fight from behind.”
Coming off last week’s victory, Harvard is looking for its first title since 2006. On Senior Day, the seniors will look to end their collegiate careers the same way they began them.
“That would be pretty special for us seniors,” co-captain Brain Grimm said. “It would be really nice to go out on top.”
While the seniors look to earn their second title, their coach is eyeing his first. In two seasons, Clark is poised to find himself at 10 conference victories in his first stint as a head coach.
“You want to get in the habit of winning things,” Clark said. “If we start getting in the habit of winning Ivy titles, that’s a good thing…but we have to win the first one to begin the habit.”
Offensively, the Crimson has 28 goals this season, averaging 1.75 per game on 15.2 shots. Penn, meanwhile, has managed only 22 goals—1.38 per game on an average of 12.8 shots. On the other side of the ball, Harvard’s defense has been spectacular this season, allowing only 13 goals (.81 per game), while the Quakers have almost doubled that number with 25 goals allowed (1.56 per game).
While these statistics paint a blanket picture of the Crimson’s dominance this season, the team has relied on a number of standout individuals to bolster its efforts. Harvard has seen stellar play from co-captain Andre Akpan and Rogers. Akpan is leading the team in goals with 11 and also has six assists. Rogers’ score last week was his sixth of the season, accompanied by his five assists.
But despite a Crimson roster full of talent, Penn remains the reigning Ivy co-champ, and will look to play the role of spoiler in Harvard’s season once again.
As far as the Crimson is concerned, it is Harvard’s turn to celebrate a championship on its own turf and leave its opponent disappointed.
“We talked before the season about how great it would be to win [the title] in front of the team that took it from us last year,” Chi said.

Brattle Theatre, 2009 A.D. Saturday, about tea time. The occasion was a celebration of the 40th anniversary of that witty British comedy troupe, Monty Python. The “Python-A-Thon,” which took place last weekend, was little more than an excuse to watch every Python movie back-to-back, not that there is anything wrong with that. The films were interspersed with episodes of “The Flying Circus.” The event even featured a special “Quote-A-Long” presentation of “The Holy Grail,” produced by The Action Pack. The Roving Reporter ventured forth to watch movies, bang some coconuts together, and expect the Spanish Inquisition. Holy spam!
 
Ned Hinkle, Creative Director of the Brattle Theatre
RR: Do you find that people really get into seeing all the movies in sequence?
NH: Yeah, I think people get a kick out of coming, especially for the big three Python movies: “Life of Brian,” “Meaning of Life,” and “The Holy Grail.”
RR: What’s your personal favorite Python movie?
NH: “Holy Grail” is my favorite, no question.
RR: Why is that?
NH: I think because I was kind of a fantasy nerd while I was growing up, so it strikes a chord with me.
RR: Are you staging a “Quote-A-Long” version of “The Holy Grail” to try to make it more interactive?
NH: Every screening of “Holy Grail” for a Monty Python fan is a “Quote-A-Long” screening, but it’s fun to have it officially sanctioned.
RR: Will you be “Quoting-A-Long”?
NH: I will probably be “Quoting-A-Long,” yes.
RR: Does that make you feel cool?
NH: No, it’s geeky. I almost got beat up in high school because I was watching “Holy Grail,” and I just couldn’t help myself but say all the lines along with the movie.
 
George Bragdon, Member of The Action Pack
RR: Is it hard work going through the whole movie picking out the best lines?
GB: Yes, it is actually. It’s kind of weird. You think that you watch those movies and you re-watch those movies, and you see them many times—especially for me growing up—and all of that stuff is just embedded in your brain, so to try to think, “What’s the best line?” “Who gets subtitles?” “Who do we call attention to?” It’s difficult choosing.
RR: Do you pick out all the quotes from movies because you yourself love quoting movies so much?
GB: It definitely comes from a very adolescent place of loving a movie so much and quoting them back and forth and realizing how much other people love to do that. What I really love about these shows is that there are not that many occasions when people get to geek out so much, and that’s really what we’re about. Let your geek flag fly. However much you love this movie, you can just channel it all into the experience, and it’s all about sharing the experience with everybody else.
RR: Were you a geek when you were growing up?
GB: I’m a geek now. It’s not over yet.
Ted Lester, Monty Python fan
RR: What is your name?
TL: Ted Lester.
RR: What is your quest?
TL: To seek the Holy Grail.
RR: Really? Where do you seek it?
TL: At the Brattle Street Theatre.
RR: Do you think it’s hidden away somewhere in here?
TL: Yeah, most definitely. Up in the lights.
RR: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
TL: Uh, 42. The answer’s always 42.
RR: What’s your favorite Python movie?
TL: “The Holy Grail.”
RR: Why is that?
TL: It’s got more of a plot than some of the other ones.
RR: You think Monty Python’s about the plot?
TL: No, it’s funny, but some of the other ones, like “Meaning of Life,” are just so bizarre that they’re not as much fun.
RR: What’s your favorite line?
TL: Blue, no yellowwwwww.
RR: Would you be offended if I said I’d throw you into the Gorge of Death for answering my questions wrong?
TL: No throwing me into the Gorge of Death.

Get the skinny in today's Crimson about how Laura E. D’Asaro ’13 crawled the fastest mile ever to be crawled.  Beginning on a track in high school, with bubble wrap and duct tape protecting her limbs, D'Asaro began her climb to glory-on-all-fours.  Hit the link for a video and an inside look at how she made it happen.
