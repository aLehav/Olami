After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many donned Trump flags as capes. Some, zip ties in hand, wore paramilitary garb. But blame for the attempted coup at the United States Capitol this Wednesday extends beyond the cast of pro-Trump extremists who violently breached what should’ve been among the most secure sites in the nation.
Responsibility for the sacking of the Capitol — which has left five dead and several others injured — lies at the feet of lawmakers who, for months, peddled fabrications of election fraud: especially those who, even after the Capitol’s desecration, voted against certifying Biden’s electoral victories, partaking in a desperate bid to rewrite the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
Three Harvard affiliates — U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), U.S. Representative Brian Mast (R-Fla.), and U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.), a former Crimson editorial editor — are among these coup voters.
Part of what drove us to this point — part of why a cornerstone of American democracy found itself collapsed by violence — was the lack of sharp, unambiguous censure of the president's conduct by elected officials and social media platforms. So let us be perfectly clear: we unequivocally condemn the insurrection and its perpetrators. For a democratic leader to attempt to subvert the very democratic institutions that brought them to power is unacceptable. This should be evident and non-partisan — however, the 147 Republicans who voted to overturn election results Wednesday make clear it is not.
Every Trump supporter enabled the Capitol insurrection. Donald Trump would not be a powerful man — one capable of crippling the peaceful transition of power as he has — without those who choose to follow him. Though not all conservatives are Trump supporters, and not all Trump supporters championed election fraud lies or directly supported Wednesday’s events, the president’s followers all bear some responsibility for this dark chapter of our political history. From the voters who, after four years of sustained, well-documented anti-democratic conduct, chose to cast their ballots for the soon-to-be-former president; to the Harvard Republican Club, who chose to endorse Trump in 2020 after rebuking him as a “threat to the survival of the Republic'' in 2016; to the public officials who used their platforms to peddle disproven conspiracy theories propping up the paper-thin fantasy of a stolen election. All continued to support Trump despite his engagement in hateful, delusional lies and, in doing so, set the groundwork for this tragedy.
When you convince millions of Americans that their vote has been stolen, legitimizing baseless conspiracies and riling up their basest, most reactionary instincts, you can only expect that some of them will fight back against the falsified wrong.
That multiple Harvard affiliates fanned these flames with such ferocity that it led them to baselessly vote against the certification of Biden’s win election results strikes us as a plain, knowing betrayal of our democracy – an attempted coup in and of itself.
The Harvard affiliation Senator Cruz and Representatives Stefanik and Mast boast almost certainly helped them attain the positions of power from which they cast their anti-democratic votes this week. Ultimately, a degree from Harvard signifies more than just a completed education. It grants graduates authority, prestige, and social capital that can be leveraged to gain access to the world’s highest positions of authority. It may be surreal to imagine that the people we meet in class today will become tomorrow’s representatives, senators, or even presidents. But this is precisely what happened to Kelby Hagar, a Harvard Law School graduate and former classmate of Cruz. On Wednesday, Hagar wrote his former classmate the following message: “[I am writing you this letter] to provide a warning from someone who you knew years ago, when we were mere students, full of ideals and lacking power: You have lost your way.”
Though there is no single definition of what a Harvard student “should” be, Cruz, Stefanik, and Mast provide a clear portrait of the prestige Harvard can confer being used as it absolutely should not be: in the relentless pursuit of political influence at a glaring cost to morality. The authority Harvard confers should not be used to peddle unfounded conspiracies designed to undermine faith in our elections. Harvard students should not be glowering threats to American democracy. In other words, Cruz, Mast, and Stefanik exemplify the worst of what we could be.
Today, we’re just students — more or less bright-eyed, all lacking deep political prestige. But in the future, some of us may be seated in the very halls of power that today’s affiliates like Cruz, Mast, and Stefanik have helped ransack. At the very least, we will all find ourselves wielding the strange gifts the Harvard name allots us. Not debasing ourselves and this country the way they have is a small way we might help our clearly bleeding republic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is set to receive nearly $7 million in aid from the latest Congressional stimulus package, according to an analysis published Thursday by the American Council on Education, a higher education interest group.
The relief measure signed into law on Dec. 27 provides $22.7 billion in emergency funding for higher education institutions and students. The funding is an increase from the nearly $14 billion allocated to colleges and universities by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, passed in March 2020.
Harvard was allocated nearly $9 million in aid as part of the CARES Act. Following criticism from multiple members of Congress, Education Secretary Betsy D. DeVos, and President Donald J. Trump, Harvard pledged 100 percent of funds to student financial assistance.
In the wake of that announcement, however, Trump announced that he would request that Harvard “pay back” the money it had been granted.
The University ultimately announced it would not “seek or accept” the funding. Multiple peer institutions, including Stanford University and Yale University, likewise declined the aid.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment Friday on whether Harvard plans to accept the latest round of aid. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening.
The latest stimulus package places restrictions on universities that paid the endowment tax in 2019, including Harvard. These universities will receive only 50 percent of their allocation, which is determined by factors including the number of students receiving Pell Grants, the number of students enrolled full-time, and the number of students enrolled exclusively online at the beginning of the pandemic.
In addition, universities that paid the endowment tax — those with at least 500 students and at least $500,000 in assets per student — are required to use their aid exclusively for student emergency aid and Covid-related expenses.
Harvard’s endowment was valued at $41.9 billion as of September 2020.
Among Harvard’s peer institutions, Yale University, Stanford University, and MIT are estimated to receive roughly $4.5 million, $5.3 million, and $3.5 million, respectively, according to the American Council on Education simulation.
In an interview with The Crimson in December, Vice President for Finances Thomas J. Hollister said that Harvard faces an “uncertain” economic future in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Harvard’s revenue dropped by $138 million in fiscal year 2020, according to the University’s Annual Financial Report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts judge dismissed a lawsuit on Thursday from the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign over Harvard’s investments in companies with ties to the prison industry, bringing an end to a months-long court battle between activists and University officials.
The five plaintiffs — all Harvard graduate students and HPDC members — filed the lawsuit in February 2020 on two counts. First, the plaintiffs charged that Harvard violated its fiduciary duty to manage the endowment in good faith by retaining investments in the prison industry. The plaintiffs also alleged that Harvard engaged in false advertising by pledging to atone for its historical ties to slavery while still retaining financial investments in the prison industry.
In 2014, Harvard students mounted a similar challenge against the University over its investments in the fossil fuel industry, arguing that they met the requirements for special standing as students of the University and recipients of its services. A Massachusetts Superior Court judge dismissed the suit in 2015, ruling that the plaintiff’s status as students failed to give them a sufficient and distinct interest in the management of the endowment; an Appeals Court judge upheld that decision in 2016.
Because of the decision in the previous suit, all five HPDC plaintiffs said they donated to Harvard before filing the lawsuit.
Nevertheless, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Judge Christopher K. Barry-Smith ’88 wrote in his decision Thursday that he dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that HPDC plaintiffs lacked standing in proving that Harvard was guilty of violating two provisions of state law.
Barry-Smith wrote that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they have been “accorded a special right in the management or administration of Harvard’s endowment,” despite their donations.
Only the Massachusetts attorney general has the authority to challenge how a public charity, such as Harvard, manages its assets, according to state law. Individuals can obtain “special standing” to file their own challenge only if they possess an interest in the charity that is separate from the public’s interest.
“Contrary to the plaintiffs' arguments, there is nothing contained in that statutory framework that confers standing upon donors to sue in contravention of the Legislature's mandate that the Attorney General has exclusive power and authority to enforce such conduct,” Barry-Smith wrote in the ruling.
He added that because the plaintiffs did not assign conditions to how their donations may be used, they do not hold a personal right in the management of the University’s funds.
“The plaintiffs have not alleged that they have conditioned their gifts, an act that could confer standing, and as such, Harvard is permitted to use their donations as it deems appropriate to advance its charitable purposes,” Barry-Smith wrote.
The judge also dismissed the plaintiff’s second charge, writing that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Harvard’s continued investment in the prison industry constitutes false advertising.
“Whether Harvard's investments in private prisons and prison related enterprises deepen Harvard’s ties to slavery is a subjective opinion,” Barry-Smith wrote. “Plaintiffs are free to advocate that Harvard should do more, to demand divestment, and to urge others to draw a connection between slavery and modern incarceration policies. But they have not stated a legal cause of action.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the case.
Harvard and HPDC have long disagreed about how much money the University invests in the prison industry. Harvard argued in 2019 that its investments totalled only $18,000, a drop in the bucket relative to the University’s endowment; however, HPDC has argued that the number is closer to $3 million, counting indirect investments.
Amanda T. Chan, an HPDC organizer and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said that she was not deterred by Thursday’s ruling.
“I only have this to say: The fight continues,” Chan said. “Harvard fought well for its right to invest in slavery and to profiteer from the prison-industrial complex, but we don’t back down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The storming of the U.S. Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob Wednesday drew shock, anger, and horror from Harvard University administrators, who called for a renewed commitment to truth and democracy.
Violence erupted on Jan. 6 after rioters breached the Capitol building as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died in the chaos, including a Capitol Police officer.
In a statement Thursday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow called the events “an incomprehensible spectacle in the heart of our nation.”
“The rioters who forced their way into the Capitol assaulted the democratic process and endangered public servants who have devoted themselves to the defining work of our democracy — carrying out the will of the people,” Bacow wrote.
Despite bipartisan condemnation of President Donald J. Trump’s role in inciting the violence and multiple resignations from his Cabinet, Bacow stopped short of naming the president in his statement, instead calling for unity against “the lies, lawlessness, and violence” that led to Wednesday’s chaos.
“The future of our Republic depends on our willingness to defend the values that brought it into being,” Bacow wrote. “The time has come for people of every political persuasion to denounce the lies, lawlessness, and violence that have brought our nation to the brink of constitutional crisis.”
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf echoed Bacow’s concerns in a Thursday message to Kennedy School affiliates, writing that the assault on the Capitol imperils democracy and the tradition of peaceful transitions of power.
“Anyone who is truly committed to American democracy should be willing to put that commitment ahead of their desire for particular electoral or policy outcomes — and therefore should be horrified at what has unfolded and rue any part they played, and should do all they can to restore and strengthen the country’s democratic norms and institutions,” he wrote.
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates have signed a petition calling for the U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 to be expelled from the Senior Advisory Committee of the Institute of Politics, which is housed within HKS. Elmendorf did not address the petition in his Thursday missive.
In a Wednesday afternoon tweet, Harvard College Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair called for Trump to be removed from office.
“He should be immediately removed from office for this treason,” she wrote on her personal account. “Inciting violence and insurrection. How did they breach the Capitol? Failure on all levels.”
She added that she was “furious at the double standard” between the police response to Black Lives Matter protesters last summer and Wednesday’s rioters, calling the latter “disgraceful thugs.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a statement to The Crimson Thursday that the scenes of violence pose direct threats to American democracy.
“This situation highlights for me that the mission of Harvard College in educating citizens and citizen-leaders for our society has never been more important,” he wrote. “While I am deeply saddened by the events that transpired, I hope this moment serves to renew our collective commitment to the importance of pursuing the truth."
Bacow echoed a similar sentiment.
“As members of a university community dedicated to truth, learning, research, debate, and service, we condemn ignorance and hatred, and stand in support of the rule of law and the role of knowledge,” he wrote.
