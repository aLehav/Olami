After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May, the Harvard administration announced an external review into the institutional failures surrounding the case of former Government Professor Jorge I. Domínguez. The case garnered national media attention after 18 women spoke out about being sexually harassed by Domínguez, raising concerns that the University knew about his misconduct and failed to act. As graduate students in the Government department, we welcomed the news of an external review. Rebuilding trust in Harvard’s response to sexual harassment is an urgent task — especially when less than half of all Harvard students (roughly 47 percent) think it is “very” or “extremely” likely that campus officials would conduct a fair investigation into a report of sexual misconduct.
However, since the announcement, several worrying signs have emerged. First, the administration appointed a review committee that is not truly external. The committee chair, Susan Hockfield, held a visiting professorship at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2012 and is on the board of Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Another committee member, Kenji Yoshino, spent six years on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, and served as its president in 2016-17. Only one committee member, Vicki J. Magley, is genuinely independent of Harvard. This violates the calls from survivors, graduate students, and the Government department’s Committee on Climate Change, which was set up in the wake of this scandal, for a fully independent investigation. We do not question the expertise and experience of these individuals. But their affiliations undermine the credibility of the review and may deter individuals with important information from coming forward.
Second, we are concerned that the administration is attempting to restrict the scope of the review. University President Lawrence S. Bacow explicitly stated that they are “not asking the committee to review the behavior or decisions of individual members of the Harvard community in regard to the Dominguez matter.” We agree that the focus of the external review should be on institutional failures. But institutions are composed of individuals, and institutional failures cannot be understood without examining individual behavior and decisions. Some may find it uncomfortable to be reminded of their own role in this decades-long case. But as Bacow himself once said: “There are both reassuring truths and unsettling truths, and great universities must embrace them both.”
Despite our concerns over the impartiality and the scope of the review, we still believe it can be successful — as long as the committee is willing to hold itself to a high standard of transparency and thoroughness. So far, the only communication we have received from the committee is that they will visit campus for one day in December. We do not know their mandate, their methodology, or their timeline. This falls far short of the standards set by other institutions, such as a recent independent investigation into sexual misconduct by a professor at Yale that lasted six months and received input from over 100 people.
Worse still, the committee has failed to arrange a meeting with the women who came forward, even when several of them offered to fly to the committee’s preferred location of New York City at their own expense. The committee has offered only two potential dates for the remainder of the calendar year, one of which coincides with the previously scheduled campus visit. If this committee fails to engage with survivors, they will do a disservice to the safety and well-being of our community. We owe it to Terry L. Karl, Suzanna Challen, Nienke Grossman, Yoshiko M. Herrera, Charna Sherman, and many more to demonstrate that their voices have been heard.
To protect the integrity of the external review, we are calling on the committee to publicly address our concerns by taking the following actions:
First, ensure a basic level of transparency by announcing the mandate, methodology, and timeline of the review. Then, provide details on what measures are being taken to minimize potential conflicts-of-interest given the affiliations of the reviewers. And finally, commit to putting in the time and resources to conduct this review thoroughly, by holding more campus visits, proactively reaching out to individuals who may have been impacted by this case, and publicizing the channels through which individuals can provide input.
The external review will not fix the mistakes of the past, but it will help to build a common understanding that ensures those mistakes are never repeated. To do this, the external review must be transparent, it must be fair, and it must be thorough. We have dedicated countless hours to lobbying the administration for this review. To say that we are deeply invested in its success would be an understatement. But we will not participate in a whitewash. When we confront the failures of the past, the truths we uncover are unlikely to be reassuring — but we must embrace them nonetheless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My friend survived sexual assault recently, and I have spent time trying to comfort her and make sure she is doing alright. As a child, I, too, was sexually assaulted, and, as a friend and a fellow survivor, I want to give her the sort of strength and support I wish I had gotten when it happened to me. As always, it is as reassuring as it is heartbreaking to know that I am not the only one.
“When it happened to me.” In writing this column, I realize my default is to make sexual assault sound like this thing that just happens to unlucky people, like when your dog dies or you come down with the flu. Here’s the thing: It’s not, it’s an outrage every time, and we should stop describing sexual assault in passive and impersonal terms.
If you want people to be careful, you don’t say, “Oh, did you hear? Mrs. Finch was murdered two days ago,” you say, “Someone murdered Mrs. Finch.” We shouldn’t say the “prevalence of sexual misconduct at Harvard remains unchanged from four years ago” — we should say, “There are just as many men raping, groping, leering, stalking, and harassing on campus today as there were four years ago.” We shouldn’t just say 52 percent of female students do not believe that the school “will take appropriate action in response to incidents of harassment and discrimination” — we should make it clear that, “On Harvard’s campus, men are making 52 percent of women feel unsafe, and Harvard isn’t doing enough to protect them.”
Those of us who survive are not just statistics — we each have our own horrific story to tell. But when it comes to speaking up, victims are stuck in a catch-22. In order to stop the perpetrator from hurting more people, the victim must submit to a formal investigation. But any attempt by the victim to alert others to the danger the perpetrator poses to the community is considered a kind of slander until (or rather if) the perpetrator is ever convicted.
In Harvard’s case, even if the victim and the perpetrator live in the same House, administrators are not required to separate them until the Office of Dispute Resolution has issued a final report and the Administrative Board has decided on an appropriate disciplinary response (which usually takes around six weeks!), meaning essentially that if the victim lives in the same House as their abuser, the victim is screwed.
Another issue: Harvard is interested in protecting its brand and public image. This motivation means that Harvard should not be trusted to adjudicate what should be criminal cases.
Just look at the latest person to sue Harvard for big bucks. Damilare Sonoiki ’13 never received his degree after the Ad Board found him responsible for the accusations of sexual assault he faced from three women in his senior year. But now Sonoiki, an immigrant from Nigeria, is claiming that the color of his skin influenced the Ad Board, which at the time did not contain any black men, in making its decision, among other factors in the process. Sonoiki seems to be borrowing from the winning rhetoric of Clarence Thomas, who infamously pulled the race card when he called the Anita Hill hearing a “high-tech lynching.” Still, the allegations against Sonoiki, though serious enough at the time to suspend his diploma, apparently were not serious enough to keep him from delivering the Class Day oration. Apparently, folks, the show must go on. We can only imagine how his accusers must have felt, watching Sonoiki be so publicly honored.
At the end of the day, Harvard seems more afraid of being sued than it is of allowing sex offenders to remain on campus. A reformed Title IX Office and sanctions against final clubs have so far failed to protect innocent students. What they have done, to their credit, is removed the excuse of ignorance from the guilty parties. Mandatory Title IX training means that everyone on this campus who rapes, gropes, leers, stalks, or harasses anyone else does so knowing that they are breaking the law.
So, I believe, the solution should be obvious. We need a real commitment from the University to protect the student body and support victims in their pursuit of legal retribution. Enough empty words, fanfare, and virtue signaling — we need dollars spent, we need complete transparency and accountability from the administration, we need bodies in offices around the clock ready to help victims at a moment’s notice.
And when people commit crimes, they need to be taken to court. Harvard should be doing everything in its power to help victims of sexual assault pursue legal action, regardless of their ability to pay, because justice should not be reserved for the rich, and if not because it’s the right thing to do, then because Harvard needs to atone for the abuses it has looked the other way for during its long and troubled history. A leave of absence is not a punishment, nor is shuffling abusers around to different Houses like some two-bit Catholic Church.
In the South there is a saying that rain falls on a sunny day “when the devil beats his wife.” Too many tears have been shed by too many victims on this campus, because even one is too many, and because we were sold the lie that in college better days lay ahead. Harvard has spent enough time playing God — it’s about time we freed the devil’s wife and sent him where the sun don't shine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this point in the year, our Board usually endorses an Undergraduate Council presidential ticket. This year, however, some of the UC tickets have joined student groups led by Act on a Dream in boycotting The Crimson in response to its coverage of a Sept. 12 Abolish ICE rally, during which The Crimson requested comment from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In light of these recent events, we have chosen to forgo an endorsement this year.
As an Editorial Board, we believe first and foremost in the free exchange of ideas among the student voices that make up the College. It disappoints us to know that some of our peers do not wish to work with us or represent themselves through our pages and endorsement processes. In place of our endorsement this year, we would like to offer a few thoughts that we hope the UC candidates will keep in mind as they campaign.
First, we encourage all candidates to recognize the limits of the institution they seek to lead. Consciousness of the failures of past UC leaderships should be a powerful benchmark for the current campaigns. Grandiose promises minimize the important work Council leaders can often do on a smaller scale. A year is shorter than it seems, and the next leaders should consider what they will reasonably have the time to accomplish.
Moreover, establishing institutional transparency and supporting student advocacy and activism are two programmatic goals we believe all candidates should forefront.
Another issue a number of tickets have highlighted is the wastefulness of the UC. The Council has failed to account for more than $100,000 in disbursements since 2017. These financial transactions should be more transparent. Leaders should seek to rein in superfluous spending. And we believe, alongside some candidates, that the UC should prioritize funding inclusive social events and activities led by a broad range of groups and individuals on campus.
This year, we hope that UC candidates move forward with achievable goals to aid the student body and leave behind any political theater that has taken up the Council’s time in the past. Leading the UC should be about more than photo shoots, weekly emails, and flag waving — it’s an opportunity for students to have a say in the disbursement of a sizeable budget that has the potential to have a positive impact on campus. As such, leadership is a serious responsibility — ideally more about thoughtful and inclusive management and policy than flashy politics.
Much as we see our own institutional role, we see the role of UC leaders as a uniting force — one that encourages dialogue and supports student activism and advocacy, even if we’ve disagreed with them on certain issues. As leaders, the candidates should seek to amplify students’ interests and perspectives and promote discourse across divides. Unity isn’t about agreement, but about recognizing the necessity of all the diverse perspectives and challenges that make up a social whole.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

Harvard students experience significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety than the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s reported national average, according to mental health survey results conducted by Harvard University Health Services in 2017 and 2018.
Outgoing Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira said in an interview Tuesday that the mental health surveys included College freshmen, as well as five departments within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Though the departments have not been delineated named, they span the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. The departments surveyed were numbered 1 to 5 in public documents.
The mental health survey documents provided by HUHS showed that the surveyed graduate departments ranged from a 15 percent to 30 percent prevalence rate of depression, and a 13.2 percent to 30 percent prevalence of anxiety.
HUHS’s report cited that this depression prevalence rate is significantly higher than what the CDC has reported.
Barreira said the CDC has reported 7.4 percent and 19.1 percent as national rates of depression and anxiety, respectively, for respondents aged 18 years old and older.
The response rate to the graduate student mental health surveys was high, according to Barreira.
“Our response rates by the way, in all these programs are 60 to 70 percent,” he said.
Student mental health was assessed through a survey that included two standard screening tools — the PHQ-9 for depression, and the GAD-7 for anxiety — as well as questions about the learning environment written by graduate student researchers.
The reported rates of depression and anxiety among graduate students surveyed were also significantly higher than those of incoming freshmen, according to Barreira.
Though survey results indicate depression rates and anxiety rates climbing to 30 percent in some departments, incoming freshmen — who were surveyed during their first week at the College — reported depression and anxiety at rates of 7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.
The PHQ-9 screens respondents into five categories based on their symptoms, ranging from “minimum” to “severe.” A score of 10 or higher out of 27 on the test is considered a positive screening, and includes participants in the “moderate” group, Barreira said. The GAD-7 follows a similar principle, with scores of 10 or above out of 21 considered a positive screening that indicates at least “moderate” anxiety.
“There's a small percentage of students across the University, just graduate students, who we would want every one of them to be in treatment or at least getting an evaluation,” Barreira said.
Beyond clinical symptoms, the survey data also reveals several other factors that point to student mental health issues, according to Barreira. Among these are high rates of loneliness, feeling like an imposter, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
“It really prompts people to think differently about what's causing the distress that graduate students experience,” Barreira said. “That's where it gets a lot of discussion going.”
To address the mental health surveys, Barreira said he spoke with leaders in the departments he surveyed as well as students. The conversations, however, have remained internal.
“We did this with a commitment that the data is only for us to share between ourselves and our faculty in a confidential way,” he said.
Barreria said in a September 2019 interview with The Crimson that he will focus on the Graduate Student Mental Health Initiative after he steps down from HUHS Director this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anand Giridharadas, author of the book 'Winners Take All,' criticized the notion that elite philanthropists can bring about reform in a talk at the Harvard Institute of Politics Tuesday.
Giridharadas said that these wealthy individuals claim to be solving societal problems by donating to charitable causes — but that they are really upholding the social and economic structures that are at the root of these problems. In addition to writing three books on politics in the United States and India, Giridharadas is an editor-at-large at TIME and a former columnist for the New York Times.
“It is the extraordinary elite generosity of our time that upholds a system of extraordinary elite hoarding,” Giridharadas said during the talk in the JFK Jr. Forum.
Giridharadas explained his view that the American people believe that business and entrepreneurship, rather than the “slothful” public sector, are the best ways to promote social change.
“We’re not getting transformational reform because we have outsourced the job of changing the world to the people with the most to lose from real change,” Giridharadas said.
Philanthropy allows the wealthy to “scrub” their tarnished reputations, according to Giridharadas. He also criticized universities like Harvard that accept donations from billionaires — some of whom he said have unethical backgrounds — and even put their names on buildings.
“Harvard has perfected this art and has perfected taking money and remaking the names of people who are scoundrels,” Giridharadas said in an interview immediately after the event Tuesday. “Harvard has allowed itself to become the world's most prestigious drive-through reputational laundromat.”
“There's some money you shouldn't take at all ever, no matter what. Hello, Jeffrey Epstein,” Giridharadas added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment but pointed to recent comments made by administrators regarding the school’s donation policy.
In an interview last month, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that Harvard must have a “principled approach” when deciding whether or not to return gifts. Garber also said there “may well” be occasions when a gift should be returned, and administrators should be conscious of changing attitudes nationwide regarding certain donations. The University is currently conducting a review of billionaire donor and convicted sex offender Epstein’s donations to the University.
Ayesha P. Venkateshwaran, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said she found the talk both “difficult” and “important” to hear — particularly Giridharadas’ opinion that college students have not done enough to protest against this flawed system. Giridharadas said during the event that reform “begins with anybody who’s part of this institution.”
Harvard Kennedy School student Oriol S. Borras also said that Giridharadas raised important points. Still, he pointed out that these criticisms of philanthropy in a capitalist society are not new.
“I would say, like in some countries in Europe, we have parties that are saying what he was saying,” Barras said. “I think the fact that this is being said in the United States, and it's being said in a kind of conservative university as Harvard is, it’s like an innovative thing.”
At the conclusion of his talk, Giridharadas called upon the audience to advocate for a new age of reform through the public sector. He said he hopes the American people can come to speak to each other in “a public language, not a language of optimization and leverage and scale, but a language of public words, philosophical words about the common good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to structural and social divides between athletes and non-athletes, the Student Athlete Advisory Council created a new committee this semester to connect athletic teams and non-athletic organizations on campus.
SAAC comprises five committees, including the newly formed Athletic Outreach committee. The council seeks to provide varsity athletes “a substantial role in the overall policy-formation process regarding relevant and current issues in Harvard Athletics and the Ivy League,” according to GoCrimson.com.
The council is currently working to bring together athletes and non-athletes through initiatives like student-athlete newsletters and student-athlete profiles, according to co-chair of the Athletic Outreach committee Olivia M. Ostrover ’20.
“Too often, student-athletes and students will not meaningfully interact during their time together at Harvard,” Ostrover wrote in an email. “We’ve always known there was a divide between student-athletes and students, but rather than just accept it, we are taking the necessary steps to change it.”
The committee also hopes to organize structured ways for varsity teams to support non-athletic organizations and vice versa. For example, a musical group may perform at a sporting event, and in turn, the athletic team may attend one of the musical group’s shows, according to SAAC Co-President Madison Earle ’20.
‘We need to generate more school spirit around athletics, dance, the arts, and everything and anything associated with Harvard and the incredible people that comprise it,” Ostrover said. “That is a collective effort, and a goal we can only achieve together.”
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise has recently spoken about the structural isolation some student-athletes face on campus. He said the College’s schedule forces athletes to associate with other athletes, isolating them.
Men’s volleyball player Adam Gordon ’21, who serves as his team’s SAAC representative, said that he hopes the new committee will increase awareness about athletics on campus and combat stereotypes that student-athletes often face.
“This committee was created in response to [these issues], as a way to address them and make our presence a little larger outside of the actual athletics and competing,” he said. “Giving back to the school in some way [will] show that we rightfully earned our position on the team at the school and that we have every right to be here as much as any student.”
Faculty athletics representative and former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said in an interview last month that structural issues that cause student-athlete isolation can potentially detract from their academic experience. He said administrative action can work to address this problem.
“There are some practical things we can do,” Dingman said. “We can look at the shuttle schedule to get people back [from the athletics facilities] more. We can look at when classes are offered.”
The student-athlete experience is a topic the ongoing study of the Athletics Department should address, Dingman said. The review would allow an “objective third party” to weigh in on the issue, according to Dingman.
Outside consulting firm Mercer is conducting the review, which was first announced last month by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Claudine Gay. Scalise and other top administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana are on the advisory committee overseeing the study, which will include input from students and staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Tuesday that Harvard’s graduate student union’s Dec. 3 strike deadline is “unnecessary” in light of ongoing negotiations between the union and University.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers — which represents roughly 5,000 Harvard graduate research assistants and student teaching fellows — set the Dec. 3 date after more than 90 percent of union voters supported authorizing a strike in a vote late last month.
Bacow said it was routine to face delays in negotiating first-time contracts with unions like HGSU and said both sides have approached negotiations with the right intentions.
“A first contract often takes a long time to negotiate because there are a lot of issues,” Bacow said. “We've been negotiating in good faith. I think they've been negotiating good faith. We've made progress. We will continue to work to make progress.”
“I think imposing an artificial deadline and saying we're going to strike if we don't have an agreement by this date is unnecessary,” he added.
Dec. 3 is the final day of fall semester classes — meaning a strike would take place over reading and finals period.
HGSU did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. In an email to its members announcing the Dec. 3 deadline, the union’s bargaining committee wrote that it would continue negotiating in an effort to avoid a strike.
The union and the University have agreed on 11 proposals including workplace resources and intellectual property rights, but have not reached a consensus on key issues like student compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
University administrators are already preparing for the possibility of the strike by encouraging faculty members to draft contingency plans in the event that a strike is called. The University has also created a website with guidance on strike planning, especially for courses that rely on student workers to grade assignments and administer exams.
Bacow said Tuesday that his office has spoken with faculty to ensure undergraduates are not seriously impacted by a potential strike.
“We've been talking to the faculty to make sure that they take preparations so that students are not inconvenienced, so that grades can be reported, so that people can graduate,” Bacow said. “People forget that we have people who graduate mid-year. So, as I said, I really don't think it's necessary.”
Bacow also reiterated the University’s position that the compensation its negotiators have offered is “more generous” than the contracts UAW-affiliated unions have signed at other universities.
“It's in our interest to see that the packages which we offer our graduate students are competitive with other universities,” Bacow said. “We want to be able to attract and retain the very best graduate students.”
He also restated that the University does not support HGSU’s proposal for a third-party grievance procedures when issues of sexual misconduct or discrimination arise, arguing that issues could result from a process that operates outside of Harvard’s formal processes for addressing such issues.
“We cannot have two different procedures on campus, I think, for dealing with Title IX complaints, depending upon a student's status in a particular moment in time,” Bacow said. “What they proposed is problematic in a number of different dimensions, and so we're trying to explain why we think that doesn't work, given our legal obligations under Title IX.”
The University and HGSU are slated to meet for their next bargaining session Friday.

Three Harvard Business Review editors and a Harvard Business School professor discussed approaches to resolving workplace conflicts at a live taping of the podcast “Women at Work” Tuesday night, drawing a packed crowd to the Business School’s Klarman Hall.
The Business Review launched “Women at Work” in Jan. 2018, and the podcast has since received roughly 6.2 million downloads across its four seasons, Business Review spokesperson Amy Poftak said. The podcast intends to create a platform for exploring issues women face in the workplace, from managing parental leave to dealing with credit-stealing colleagues, according to the Business Review’s website.
“Women at Work” co-hosts Amy J. Bernstein, Amy E. Gallo, and Nicole T. Torres invited Business School Professor Linda A. Hill to be a special guest on Tuesday’s live show, where the four spoke about resolving conflicts with colleagues or supervisors as a woman, sharing advice on how to manage emotions and move past workplace disputes.
Gallo said that when faced with difficult conflicts, she focuses on being self-aware and proactively managing her responses.
“If we see conflict as a threat to our identity, to our needs or resources, it’s very likely we will go into a stress response,” Gallo said. “The key is to try to calm yourself down. Think about the person, put yourself in their shoes. This helps to break the sort of narcissistic rumination most of us go into when we’re under stress.”
All four panelists stressed the importance of clearly articulating goals while resolving conflicts.
“I’ll admit, most of my adult life and probably for my childhood, too, anytime I entered a conflit my goal was to be right – and that is not a good goal,” Gallo said. “If Linda and I showed up to a conversation both trying to prove that we’re right, then where do we have to go?”
“Do I need to get this project just done and on budget? Do I need to preserve my relationship with this person I’m talking to? Do I need to just get out of this conversation and move on with my life?” she added.
Hill said she tries to recognize defensiveness when she negotiates a solution to a workplace problem.
“Separate their impact from their intent,” she said. “What makes us defensive is when we suggest that we’re not well intended and we can’t be trusted.”
In response, audience member Julie E. Salganik said the most difficult conflicts she has faced in her career have happened when people started conversations in ways that were insensitive, often because of the disparities in intent and impact that Hill mentioned.
“You have to be sincere about not just your goals, but also what you’re experiencing,” said Salganik.
At the end of the discussion, Hill urged the audience to remember that they “are not powerless.”
“If you’re in situations where you’re powerless, you can be taken advantage of. And the most important source of power is expertise, knowing something that no one else knows, having unique knowledge,” she said.

Forty-eight seniors joined the Alpha Iota chapter of the academic honors society Phi Beta Kappa last week, joining 24 other members of their class elected in April.
Election indicates that an “undergraduate's course of study is distinguished by excellence, reach, originality, and rigor,” according to the Harvard College Phi Beta Kappa website. Committees of Harvard faculty and staff who are themselves members of Phi Beta Kappa evaluate prospective candidates.
Overall, about 42 percent of the newest inductees — compared to 44 percent of the Class of 2019’s “Senior 48” cohort — concentrate solely in the Natural Sciences. Twenty-nine percent concentrate in the Social Sciences, and 10 percent study the Humanities. Roughly 19 percent of this year’s cohort are pursuing joint concentrations.
Five of this year’s “Senior 48” concentrate in Applied Math, followed by four students each in both Psychology and Computer Science.
In total, 20 different concentrations are represented, along with eight distinct joint concentrations.
The process for selecting the new inductees started approximately a month ago, when the Alpha Iota chapter president invited students with high GPAs to apply. Three evaluating committees — Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences — are formed which then pare down the list of candidates using their academic records and letters of recommendation.
“I got the invitation to apply a few weeks earlier,” Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator Sophia M. Jackman ’20 said. “It was super exciting to be invited to apply to begin with and then it felt incredible to have actually gotten it.”
Social Studies concentrator Lilla B. Gabrieli ’20 said her professors “flagged that this might be something on the horizon.” Her thesis adviser later wrote her a letter of recommendation.
Many learned of their induction early in the day Nov. 4.
“I found out when I first checked my email the morning it was released,” Government concentrator Rachel F. Tropp ’20 said. “I was on my way to class. It was really exciting.”
Nicholas E. Stauffer-Mason ’20, a joint concentrator in Government and East Asian Studies, wrote in an email that he discovered his induction after completing a tutoring session at the Writing Center.
“The first thing I did was call my grandmother, who was Phi Beta Kappa at DePauw and has always pushed me to do my best academically,” Stauffer-Mason said.
The selection committee looks for students who have exhibited both “depth of study and breadth of intellectual interest,” according to the College’s PBK website.
Several of the new inductees said they have pursued studies in a variety of fields and that the honor affirmed their academic choices.
Michael T. Shirek ’20 — a Psychology concentrator pursuing a secondary in Germanic and Scandinavian Studies — said he hopes to seek a career in film and found the honor to be validating.
“Sometimes it feels like people don’t really want to take me seriously because it doesn't really sound like I’m working towards anything,” Shirek said. “This is a validation of what I’ve done so far for me — that what I’ve done has been worth it.”
Similarly, Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator Sarah M. Lipson ’19-’20 said she has wide-varying interests. Lipson, who is conducting thesis research based in psychology as a pre-med, said she found her academic interests “a little bit tough making everything fit.”
Lipson said she is honored and appreciative to be inducted into PBK.
“I think it’s a nice recognition of all the hard work I’ve put in, and I do hope it recognizes the diversity of experiences I’ve had in the academic sphere,” Lipson said. “At the same time, I also feel aware that this is only one way for that to be recognized.”
“I try to balance an appreciation for the recognition and an understanding of all the other fantastic people and experiences that happen at Harvard," she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Huddling in a circle on a brisk morning in New York City, donned with purple ribbons in their hair and around their arms, the athletes on the Harvard Women’s field hockey team were motivated to win for a few particularly meaningful reasons: to make the best of their last shot at impressing the NCAA voters in hopes to receive a bid for the NCAA tournament selection, and to raise awareness for Meningitis, a neurological disease that affected one of the members of the team, senior forward Maddie Earle.
“Obviously, the game was super important to us, both from a field hockey point of view, as well as due to the fact that [Earle] and [senior midfielder] Olivia Ostrover had organized it as a Meningitis Awareness game,” said junior captain Mimi Tarrant. “I really think that honoring the game for that cause helped us keep everything in perspective. Our main message before the game was to enjoy playing and to play for those who maybe aren’t able to.”
The No. 15 Crimson women (13-4, 6-1 Ivy League) defeated Columbia (7-9 3-4 Ivy League) by a score of 2-1 in the final regular season match of the season. Led by a pair of goals by captain Bente van Vlijmen in the first and third quarters, the Harvard team reached 13 wins for the third straight year, a first for the program.
But to van Vlijmen, although the team came out with a win, there is still much room for improvement.
“We really had to show the NCAA and the people who make the decision for the bid [in the NCAA tournament] in this game that we can take on teams and really dominate them,” said van Vlijmen. “We only beat them by two to one, and that, I think, was a little bit of a disappointment because I know we can do better as a team.”
Although a few unfavorable circumstances threw the team off their game—a frozen field Friday night forced the game to be moved to Saturday morning—van Vlijmen didn’t want to make excuses for the team. It was a game where the Crimson expected to win and win big, so a finish as close as this one showed the team that they need to be more focused and ensure they don’t underestimate any more teams moving forward.
Still, van Vlijmen made sure that the team didn’t walk away without a few highlights. At 12:38 in the first quarter, she put in a shot during a designed play on a penalty corner shot.
“I think [the designed play that led to the goal] really was a big team effort and if one of those little parts of the chain doesn't go right, nothing will go right,” said van Vlijmen. “You score as a team and not as an individual.”
It wasn’t until around four minutes into the third quarter that Harvard netted its second goal, and van Vlijmen noted that the team struggled for a while to find its flow and structure with the offense.
“I started on [Columbia’s] 25-yard line, and when that happens, I really don’t think I just try to put all my power behind what I do and try to be decisive and quick,” said van Vlijmen of the second goal. “We had all hoped that we had scored [the second goal] a little earlier on, but it was still a very important goal.”
The second goal put van Vlijmen in second place on Harvard’s all-time points list. And while she feels grateful to be recognized for such an achievement, the senior noted that this was in no small part due to the help of the rest of her teammates. Without the help of her teammates, especially the defenders, who seldom get recognized van Vlijmen explained, the achievement would not have been possible.
While the Crimson women eventually learned that they did not earn a bid into the NCAA tournament after the selection of teams on Sunday evening, both van Vlijmen and Tarrant had time to reflect on the season.
“Our team has definitely taken big strides this season,” Tarrant said. “With nearly a whole new backline coming in as we got six new freshmen, it was always going to take a bit of time to gel as a new team. Luckily, we managed to do that pretty early on, and we have definitely seen our freshman grow in confidence throughout the season. I think what has been most rewarding to see is the variety of people who have stepped up to take responsibility for the team.”
And in her final season with the team, van Vlijmen is optimistic about the future of the team.
“Overall, I think we’ve shown that this program can compete at the top now,” van Vlijmen said. “We played some games incredibly well, and some games not as well, so I think a huge area where we can grow in as a team is finding consistency and utilizing our talent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball blew out Maine 67-46 this past weekend thanks to a dominant defensive effort in the second half of the game.
The Crimson came into Lavietes looking to avenge a tough road loss to Northeastern that saw the team give up a school-record 44 points to senior captain Jordan Roland.
Despite Harvard (2-0) being heavily favored against the Black Bears(1-1), defending its home court would be difficult without the services of seniors Bryce Aiken, Seth Towns, and Christian Juzang. The Crimson was able to able to respond to this adversity coming off a quick turnaround from its loss to the Huskies.
“I think our kids in terms of what we talked about going into this, regrouping and responding and it’s impressive to me how they were able to do that,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “And again, we’re coming off a loss and those kids, you know, have to kind of show that they were veterans and savvy and also tough, so it was very impressive to me.”
Harvard’s victory did not come easy, as the Crimson’s first half woes continued against the Black Bears. Harvard struggled to score from the perimeter early on and allowed Maine to have easy scoring opportunities off turnovers and offensive rebounds. The Black Bears won the rebounding battle 20 to 14 in the first half and limited the Crimson to 43 percent shooting.
Harvard would go through significant stretches in the first half where the offense stalled, including two separate four-minute intervals where it couldn’t score a single point. The team made only one three pointer in the frame before the final possession and never had the lead in the first period following the 15 minute mark.
As has been the case in its last two games, the Crimson came into the second half with renewed energy and focus. The team played stalwart defense, holding Maine to only 15 points on 23 percent shooting. The strong defensive play was a result of Harvard’s depth and balanced scoring, which wore down the Black Bears’ offense.
“I thought our defense was outstanding in the second half,” Amaker said. “I thought we were able to wear down [the opponents], something we were hoping to be able to do this season. We used our depth and had it become a factor. Just very pleased with our growth from the last game.”
The increased communication between players improved the flow of the offense in the second half where the Crimson shot 62 percent. The team had eight assists in the period as opposed to the three they had in the first half.
“All of us interchanging [in the offense] know helping each other out, it goes a long way over the course of the game, so I think that was the biggest thing,” junior guard Rio Haskett said. “We’re moving that ball around and getting touches going inside out. I think that goes a long way with everybody getting a feel for the game, and you know, they get more comfortable, and play better together.”
With the team missing some of its key players, it was important for the bench players to step up and play a bigger role. First-year guard Chris Ledlum, playing in just his third collegiate game, brought much needed energy and hustle, contributing nine points and six rebounds.
“He’s one of the most athletic guys I’ve seen in awhile,” senior forward Rob Baker said. “He’s a very special talent and he’s gonna flourish this year for sure.”
Along with Ledlum, the play of junior guard Rio Haskett, was critical to rejuvenating Harvard’s offense. The Richmond, V.A. native led the Crimson with 14 points, and made several pivotal plays, including a three pointer to end the first half.
“He has a much more mature game and you know is playing smart on the floor and using his athleticism the right way,” Amaker said. “He's having fun playing and it's nice to see him rewarded you know with some solid play and certainly had his hands all over this game for us here this afternoon.”
Harvard’s improved bench play and lockdown defense was too much for Maine to handle in the second frame. The Black Bears’ bench only scored two points in the game as the Crimson cruised to victory in the waning minutes of the game.
Harvard hopes to remain undefeated at home as it continues its non-conference slate against Siena on Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unselfish play paired with high-quality perimeter scoring propelled Harvard to a 68-51 trouncing over the Siena Saints on Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Going into the game, the Crimson looked to continue its undefeated record coming off of a hard-fought victory against Cal in which Harvard erased a 10-point deficit.
Though the Crimson (3-0) was heavily favored against the Saints (0-3), defending its home court looked difficult without the services of first-year guard and reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week Lola Mullaney. Mullaney, who sprained her ankle in Friday’s game against Cal, averaged nearly 20 points in her first two games for the Crimson. Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said that Mullaney’s status remains unclear.
“Lola’s a great player. She’s a great scorer for us, but I think we have a great team. We have people on the bench that can step in for her,” sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy said. “We miss her obviously but we definitely have different components to our team.”
Tuesday’s game featured breakout offensive performances for Crimson players. Sophomore forward Tess Sussman led scoring for both teams with a career-high 17 points. Co-captain senior guard Mackenzie Barta also had a career high, finishing with 16 points, including four three pointers.
Freshman guard Annie Stritzel scored her first points for the Crimson, aggressively attacking the paint. She finished the game with 7 points. Freshman guard Gabby Donaldson also scored her first points for Harvard, including an impressive three point play off of an and-one pull up bank shot.
“This may be one of the strongest freshman classes I've ever had,” Delaney-Smith said. “I couldn't be more pleased with their work ethic and their ability to learn the system.”
Offensively, Harvard outmaneuvered Siena’s 2-2-1 press. In the back court, Crimson guards kept their eyes up and passed the ball over their defenders. Harvard swiftly moved the ball around the perimeter and found gaps in the zone defense, frequently scoring in non-contested situations. The Crimson distributed the ball well throughout the game, assisting on 20 of its 26 baskets. Harvard shot 40.6 percent from the field, and 35.7 percent from three point range.
The game did not begin well for the Crimson, however. Four minutes into the game, Harvard trailed 7-2. An offensive rebound and putback by senior forward Jeannie Boehm snapped the Saints’ scoring streak and ignited an 11-0 run for the Crimson, during which Sussman scored six points. By the end of the first quarter, Harvard led 13-7.
Harvard built on its lead in the second quarter. In a prolific scoring performance, the Crimson added 24 points to the scoreboard. Harvard’s adept shooting was complemented by its tenacity on defense. Playing man-to-man, the Crimson conceded only four points to Siena in the quarter, so that the visitors went into the locker room at halftime with only 11 points scored.
Harvard’s man-to-man defense held Siena’s dominant scorer, senior guard Sabrina Piper, to only three points in the first half. In Siena’s previous game, Piper scored 21 points against Penn, despite losing to the reigning Ivy League champion 92-44. Against the Crimson, the Paris, France native finished with 15 points.
Trailing by 20 points, Siena came out in the second half with a sense of urgency. The Saints’ intensity on offense seemed to frazzle Harvard players, who rendered a lackluster defensive performance. In the second half, the Crimson allowed 40 points, getting outscored by nine.
Despite the 17-point victory, Delaney-Smith was not impressed with her team’s performance.
“We should have done a better job on the defensive end,” Delaney-Smith said. “I just think this was a whole mindset game...and that’s very upsetting. That’s very dangerous in the Ivy League.”
Harvard’s undefeated record will be challenged on the road this weekend as it continues its non-conference slate against La Salle on Friday at 7 p.m. and Rutgers on Sunday at 2 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team opened its season Sunday in the Jonathan Kaloust Bearcat Open at Binghamton University, facing opponents from 19 different schools and clubs, including EIWA rivals Lehigh, Cornell, and Princeton.
“The guys came in and wrestled hard,” captain Hunter Ladnier said. “We had seven placers, which is more than we’ve had in years past, which I think is a reflection of our hard work week in and week out this fall, this summer, and last spring.”
The headline for the Crimson was the standout performances from members of its freshman class, beginning with Phil Conigliaro, who took home the title in the 165 pound weight class. Conigliaro, a native of Dedham, Massachusetts and former Prep National champion, comes to the Crimson after a summer in which he was named an All-American at the Junior U.S. Open and came in third at the Junior World Team Trials.
Conigliaro eased past wrestlers from Bucknell and Lehigh in the first two rounds before defeating Cornell’s Jakob Brindley in the Semifinals. In the Finals, Conigliaro topped 2019 second-team All-Ivy selection Adam Santoro, also of Cornell, 6-3 to secure the tournament victory.
Also finding success for Harvard was freshman Heavyweight Yaraslau Slavikouski, who finished as runner-up at 285 pounds. The Belarus National Team member narrowly made it past three wrestlers from West Point, winning each match by three points or fewer. In the Finals, Slavikouski was pinned by star Cornell commit Lewis Fernandes, who was wrestling with the Finger Lakes Regional Training Center.
Also making waves were freshmen Beau Bayless and Michael Jaffe, and junior Lukus Stricker, who each placed fourth at 125, 133, and 141 pounds, respectively. Ladnier performed well in addition, placing fifth at 157, while first-year Mike Doggett placed sixth at 184.
A year after finishing a disappointing 2-9 in dual meets and 14th out of 16 teams at the EIWA Championships, Harvard enters 2019 with greater expectations, in large part due to the team’s crop of freshmen, who may make up over half of the team’s starting lineup. The Crimson also got a boost from new Head Assistant Coach Jimmy Sheptock, who joined the team from the University of Maryland and designed much of the team’s preseason workout schedule.
“Guys were able to come into the first tournament in shape and confident,” Ladnier said. “We did a lot of running this preseason, a lot of stadiums, pushed very hard, and spent a lot of time on the mat, as well.”
To Ladnier, the tournament was just the first test in the long journey to reach lofty heights. This was an important step towards our goal of placing guys high at the EIWA tournament,” Ladnier explained. “Sending guys to nationals, and producing national champions.”
The team suits up next on November 24th at the Keystone Classic in Philadelphia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a native of Louisville, Kentucky, there are a few things in life that can be replaced by no other. The sweet, sweet smell of lost bets at Churchill Downs on Derby day. The deafening sound of fireworks at Thunder Over Louisville until you care less after the age of 15. The recognizable rushing of brown water as guck runs down the Ohio River. The bright, gleaning orange barrels dotting the shoulder of Spaghetti Junction. The warm summer day that Dairy Kastle finally opens. Above all of these, however? Hearing that the University of Kentucky Wildcats men’s basketball team has been upset in Rupp Arena by the mighty Evansville Purple Aces. Music to the ears of every Louisvillian.
I will admit, I just wanted to mention this loss so that it is forever on the internet in yet another spot. However, I feel that my incoherent ramblings to start these columns are becoming more and more of a stretch, and they may take away my pen soon if I don’t relate it to Ivy League football in some fashion. While Evansville did pull off what Cornell will be trying this week in the form of an impossible upset, my musings of the Derby City came to mind in the week of Harvard’s final home game. For the last time, seniors will suit up and take the field at Harvard Stadium, the place they have called home for years. Before making the trek to that godforsaken, rundown city in Connecticut that does not deserve the admittedly great pizza it calls home in the season’s final week, Crimson seniors have one last go in Cambridge. At home. So as I sing one song for my Old Kentucky Home far away, half of the Ancient Eight’s seniors will sing one final song at their football homes. For this reason, and possibly having to do with the multiple lopsided matchups, I will be picking every single home team this week.
YALE VS. PRINCETON
Princeton is no longer the top dog. Finally, for the first time since 2017, the Tigers have fallen. But Princeton lost this game in the neutral site of Yankee Stadium, not on their own field. While the westward crossing through the Holland Tunnel usually means disappointment for many, it will mean home for the Tigers. This week, the game will be played on the wrong side of the Hudson, in the friendly confines of New Jersey. The last time Princeton lost at home? At the hands of the visiting Yale, November 2017.
While slightly exciting, do not let this stuff spook you. The Bulldogs still have to play a very good team, and we no longer have time for this spookiness. The temperature has dropped too much, Christmas music is already coming out of my roommate’s speaker, and Waverly Sanitorium is closed. Like I said, this week is about home.
Princeton by 7.
BROWN VS. COLUMBIA
When I moved from Kentucky to Cambridge for college, I did not know what to expect. I did know one thing, however: it was going to be cold as hell. I packed up winter clothing in the blistering heat of August and set off for my new home. For some, this cold would be the most foreign of concepts. My roommate from Tunisia can definitely be counted among this group. When he left his original home in North Africa for Massachusetts, he buckled down for his first New England winter. I will never forget my fellow roommates and I bundling him up like Randy from A Christmas Story as we all embraced our new home.
In Columbia’s version of the Crimson, a reporter detailed how to survive the impending New York winter for those who never have. I commend that, and it really emphasizes the feeling of home. Plus, it was first on the website when I went digging for embarrassing stuff and it directly aligned with my anecdote and column theme, so I’ll throw them a bone against the Ivy League’s worst team.
Columbia by 14.
CORNELL VS. DARTMOUTH
I traveled a long way from Louisville to Cambridge. Both are still home. If I had to travel to Ithaca, however, I’m not sure if I could say the same. Traversing upstate New York and landing somewhere I’m assuming is just north of Greenland, it would be hard not to feel a little homesick. This week, a writer from Cornell’s version of the Crimson wrote an opinion with the title, “Going to Cornell Doesn’t Make You a Better Person.” I don’t have to read that article to believe the headline. Hope the Big Red aren’t too homesick in Hanover, the second-most desolate city in the Ivy League.
Dartmouth by 31.
PENN VS. HARVARD
Penn recently caught some backlash for renaming its law school, as reported by Penn’s version of the Crimson. When the university received a record $125 million dollar donation, it renamed the law school after a donor. The students aren’t happy, and they have reason to be if they read my article. Fancy donor names betray tradition and homeliness. And that’s what this week is all about. Home.
Sorry Coach Cal, better luck next time away from Rupp.

Concentration declaration is a rite of passage at Harvard. Some students know what they want to concentrate in from the moment they step foot on campus, and others are still wavering at 11:59 p.m. on declaration day. To get some perspective on concentration declaration, we asked Flyby sophomores studying the humanities why they declared.
History and Literature: Sarah M. Lightbody ’22
I started saying I was going to concentrate in History and Literature after getting absolutely freaked out in an Opening Days orientation meeting about concentrations. Mid-meeting, I pulled out my phone and scrolled through the requirements for just about every concentration, searching for something that seemed right for me. To be completely honest, Hist and Lit stood out to me because it had very few actual class requirements — it’s a pretty DIY concentration. So I started saying I would concentrate in Hist and Lit.
A little over a year later, I still want that flexibility, interdisciplinarity, choose-your-own-way course of studies. It’s a way to read books, consider art, have tiny class sizes and get to spend more time in the Barker Center (like almost every Hist and Lit concentrator, I’ve fallen head over heels for Barker Cafe). Plus, as someone who wants to study fashion, at a school with not a lot of fashion-centric courses, Hist and Lit will allow me to explore my options without having to worry as much about which department courses I’m required to fit into my schedule.
I’m planning on tying my Hist and Lit concencentration to an Economics secondary. My hottest Harvard hot take is that Ec10: “Principles of Economics” is great, and so I’m leaning into my inner snake. The combination of the two provides an analytical framework from multiple perspectives, which sounds like something straight out of a brochure, but is actually pretty genuine. In any case, I’m excited to see where the next few years take me.
History of Science and Romance Languages and Literatures: Maya S. Bhagat ’22
Coming into Harvard, I was really interested in biology — I’d wanted to be a scientist since I was a kid, and my high school mostly offered STEM classes. Having moved to a new country at age 12, I was also really excited about learning two new languages (Hindi and French) and enjoyed teaching myself history on the side. I took LS50: “Integrated Science” my freshman year, and while I liked and learned a lot from the class, along the way I realized that perhaps molecular biology was not the only thing which was very important to me. I discovered that I enjoyed a good balance of psets and paper classes, and found myself frequently bringing concepts from I learned in history class over to science and vice versa.
I still feel a twinge of guilt when I consider the possibility of leaving behind a career in the lab and question my abilities to be a good historian when I can’t remember the difference between modernism and postmodernism. I’m slow at learning new languages, but I genuinely enjoy the opportunity to peruse literary and cinematic texts at a place where there is less and less time for pleasure reading. Eventually, I do need to decide which way I want to swing in this tussle between biology and history, but History of Science and Romance Languages and Literatures, at this moment, provides me the best configuration to marry all my interests.
English or Philosophy: Michelle Lara ’22
“That’s so different — the admissions committee might like you!” is a reaction I typically get when I tell people my prospective concentration and that I’m also on the pre-med track. I always smile and continue the conversation, but I never know how to feel about it; it’s sad to think I would do it mainly for that reason. The Humanities departments at Harvard are absolutely phenomenal, and they offer opportunities that I'll never have again in my lifetime. I can casually get lunch with one of my favorite authors who is teaching a seminar next semester! I can finally learn how to make a college-level argument and articulate my thoughts in a convincing way! But sure, I'm just doing it for those medical school applications.
Literature is essentially a study of people. It’s fun to think of ourselves as sturdy people with definable — or almost “factual” — traits; by virtue of being human, however, how we define ourselves is a dynamic entity that changes at life’s every turn. Sometimes it takes a dramatic hypothetical to see it, but other times a week-in-the-life will suffice. Literature is the best way to explore the human condition in a life vastly different from yours.
If English is a study of people, then Philosophy is a study of truth. Since humans are such undefinable creatures, it’s impossible to assert how they think and act in a broader sense. Isn’t it fascinating how 2,500 years after Socrates was born, we still can’t agree on the right way to live? And that this issue remains at the heart of contemporary debates? When we then start making claims about the reality of human life and choices, it takes such meticulous argumentation that it leaves you wondering if you’ve been thinking incorrectly your entire life. I’m so tired of hearing about the “uselessness” of it all; I still believe there’s great value in paying close attention to other people.
