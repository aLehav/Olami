Norman Y. Yao ’09 received the 2009 Captain Jonathan Fay Prize from the Radcliffe Institute for breakthrough research on the mechanical properties of cellular networks on Wednesday.Yao was selected for the honor from among the 83 winners of the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize for the quality and impact of his senior thesis, which describes an innovative scientific technique to measure the properties of neurofilaments, one of the structural elements found in nerve cells."More than anything, I am very humbled and honored to have been selected out of such an amazing group of [Hoopes Prize winners] who have produced amazing work,” Yao said.Yao’s senior thesis, titled “Nonlinear Mechanics of Biopolymer Networks,” describes his study of the elasticity of neurofilaments, which have the tendency to stiffen when stretched. Yao devised an approach for measuring neurofilaments’ elasticity that proved more accurate than traditional methods, which are best suited for materials that do not stiffen. His technique yielded high-quality data and made it possible for researchers to discover the origin of the protein interactions that caused stiffening in neurofilaments.“This is a new approach likely to be helpful to many in the fields of biology, biophysics and bioengineering,” said Rosalind A. Segal, a neurobiology professor and the director of the science program at the Radcliffe Institute, in a press release issued by the Institute.Yao’s senior thesis is based on four manuscripts, of which he is the lead author on three and a lead co-author on one.Last month, Yao was also made one of 16 fellows to receive the Department of Energy's 2009 Computational Science Graduate Fellowship--a well-known and highly competitive honor funded by the Office of Science and Office of Defense Programs.According to Mary Ann Leung—program manager at the Krell Institute, which administers the award—the fellowship seeks individuals with promise as researchers.“[Norman’s] academic record, his research record, and his recommendations all indicate that in many cases he is performing at the level of a senior graduate student,” Leung said. “We’re looking forward to seeing what he does with his graduate career.”As part of the program, Yao will receive over $70,000 in yearly stipends, university tuition, academic allowance, and computer support for the duration of his graduate career.“It’s such an honor to be given a fellowship like that,” Yao said. “It allows you to choose any research adviser and gives you so many opportunities in grad school.”Yao credits his undergraduate research advisor, Physics professor David A. Weitz, for much of his success.“My work in the Weitz lab has been the cornerstone of my undergraduate experience and has taught me about the importance of interdisciplinary research,” Yao said in the press release issued by the Radcliffe Institute.Yao said that Weitz was an “immense help” during his fellowship application process, editing and polishing drafts of Yao’s research proposal.“Everything he gets, he absolutely deserves, and the credit should all go to him,” Weitz said of Yao. “Norm is smart, conscientious, kind, and works very hard. You can’t ask for a better student.”In the future, Yao said he plans to wrap up his current research in biophysics and branch out into the field of atomic physics. He will pursue a doctoral degree in condensed matter physics at Harvard this fall.--Staff writer Manning Ding can be reached at ding3@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four journalists from the U.S. and abroad have been selected for the 2009-2010 class of Nieman Fellows, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard announced last week.Those chosen represent a diverse cross-section of the industry, from newspaper editors and photographers to multimedia reporters and radio journalists. This year’s class included the largest proportion of freelance journalists in the 72-year history of the fellowship.“The selection of more freelance journalists and fewer newspaper reporters reflects the changing nature of journalism,” said Nieman Foundation Curator Robert H. Giles. A number of fellowship recipients had recently repositioned themselves by leaving broadcast or newspaper journalism for the freelance sector, Giles said. Newspaper reporters, he said, may not have turned out for the fellowship because they were afraid that a prolonged absence from the newsroom might exact a toll on their employment status, or because they worked for newspapers that no longer support long-term fellowships for their staffers.“The standard for selection that we use involves [identifying] people of accomplishment, leadership, and talent to go on in journalism," Giles said. "Whether they do it as freelancers, magazine article writers, or newspaper journalists is not so much of a problem for us--it’s what they represent and how we think they might grow and make their mark in the years ahead."The fellowship program enables working journalists to spend a year at Harvard pursuing a specific field of study, participating in various seminars, and attending special events. “The [fellows] are specialists in covering certain areas of the world or the country, and Harvard has a lot of experts and researchers in their field who would love to work with them,” Giles said.The fellows’ chosen areas of study span a diverse set of issues. According to a press release for the foundation, Beth Macy, the families beat reporter at "The Roanoke Times," will study the financial, social, and political impact of the aging baby boomer population; former NBC correspondent and current freelance multimedia journalist Kevin Sites will focus on developing a model for sustainable, independent Web-centric journalism; and Russian op-ed editor Maxim Trudolyubov will study the interaction of opinion journalism with contemporary media and society. In response to the journalism industry’s diminishing reliance on print media and its transition to more technologically advanced forms of reporting, the Foundation will introduce a yearlong multimedia curriculum designed to teach the fellows new media skills.The Nieman Foundation, which administers the oldest mid-career fellowship program for journalists in the world, has supported more than 1,300 journalists from 89 countries since its inception in 1938.--Staff writer Monica S.

Quadlings have faced a lot of hard times recently, losing their library, café and potentially some of their shuttle service.  However quadlings can now drown their woes with delicious fro-yo.  Berryline—a beloved staple in the diets of River dwellers—has come to the quad!  Berryline’s new location is on Mass Ave going towards Porter Square, right next to a Starbucks.
FlyBy wandered over to the new location that opened a couple of weeks ago today…hear about our findings after the jump.
The new location is still slightly unfinished.  There is no real sign outside yet—only a whiteboard and a poster, so it is easy to miss.  The inside is decorated with familiar paintings of bug-eyed yogurt creatures and is a lot more bright and spacious than the arrow street location.  The walls are lined with bamboo, there are skylights, large windows and 3 tables for patrons to sit at while they devour  their froyo.   And of course there’s free Wifi, which FlyBy loves.
Owner Matthew Wallace said that the new location’s purpose was to expand (of course), as well as draw some of the crowd away from the other location.  “This new location’s aim is to be more family oriented, as well as stroller and handicap friendly.  Our old location was mostly frequented by Harvard students, and more convenient for Harvard students.  A lot of families that lived near by had to come pretty far.”
Right now the menu is pretty in-line with the Arrow Street location, except with different flavors (Blueberry and Peanut Butter, currently) and a cool mango smoothie.   Eventually, however, Matt says they will incorporate an entire new smoothie menu.   The new location, when finished, will have window seats at a bar, and much more seating in the form of benches around the walls.  The owner joked about how people sitting along the street at the Arrow street location was actually a fire hazard:  “We want this to be a more of a sit down place, while the Arrow Street one is more of a to-go place,” Matt said.
A consolation prize, Quadlings? You have to take what get, right?
