After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What some Harvard students don’t know is how the lived experiences of first-generation, low-income students are often exploited.
Higher education is supposed to be the equalizing step between low-income students and dreams of financial security; however, while visually appearing equal, there are covert ways that the application process is actually anything but. Before they even arrive on campus, FGLI students are often forced to internalize the idea that their traumas are all they have to sell to admissions officers, creating a psychological barrier between them and others at higher education institutions.
When applying to college as an FGLI student, I personally cycled between four personal stories, each harrowing in their own way. I know of friends who wrote about family death, homelessness, inability to make rent or pay for groceries, uneducated family members, health problems that disproportionately affect impoverished people, and dealing with mental health issues as a result of being dealt such circumstances. Coming from a Title I, majority low-income public high school, I knew many students who didn’t have a flashy experience to write on or a unique opportunity afforded to them. They were not equipped to write the gold-standard college essay.
As students across the country prepare for competitive application processes for college admissions and scholarships, low-income students are taught to garner pity while richer students are taught to garner adulation. While the majority of Harvard students have the means to write about their prowess as a learner, others are more reliant on detailing their struggles as a means to boost their successes — often, it is what we are most equipped to use.
Low-income students who write so blatantly of their adversities are competing on two levels. On the one hand, their essays are being placed against students who have had the economic advantage to pursue unique, transformative opportunities. These students have the privilege to curate fantastic experiences which provide fodder for their essays. On the other hand, low-income students are in a contest to see who can garner the most pity while simultaneously appearing as capable as the higher-income students.
This was seconded by a 2016 study by Stanford and Mount Holyoke College. They found that essay content was strongly related to household income and SAT scores. After reading 240,000 UC college essays, they found that students who wrote about educational opportunity, helping others, and family death came from low-income areas and had lower SAT scores. Meanwhile, personal essays seeking answers about human nature and achievement were linked to higher-income students and higher SAT scores.
And it seems that colleges prefer the latter — at least Ivy League ones. In 2013, 67 percent of Harvard students came from the top 20 percent for income. Even more recently, 45 percent of students in the Class of 2025 had a family income greater than $125,000, which is nearly double the U.S. median income level.
I, too, would enjoy writing essays about seeking answers, human nature, and achievement more than writing about my times of peril, especially now knowing they are linked to higher standardized test scores and income. There needs to be appreciation and understanding for students who feel the need to write about their hardship. Yet, there also needs to be room for FGLI students to write successfully about things other than their trauma, even if they do not have sensational experiences under their belt that demonstrate their potential as contributors to humanity.
And my bet is that this is not only relevant to college admissions essays. When applying for other competitive scholarships, positions, or opportunities, it is more compelling for FGLI students to identify as a student who faced adversity and succeeded than to simply be a student. Thus, FGLI students write about their adversity because it is what they are most equipped to do.
All of which begs the questions of FGLI students like me: How exactly am I enough without my past, and when will I feel secure enough in my achievements to not mention my misfortunes?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many major news outlets have reported, Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein was recently elected as the president of the Organization of Harvard University Chaplains. As a humanist, Epstein believes in the goodness of humanity rather than a higher divinity. As president of the chaplains, he now serves as the coordinator and intermediary between various religious groups on campus.
To be clear, this dissent is not to object to Epstein’s election as Harvard’s first atheist chaplain president. Rather, we object to its perceived newsworthiness. The nominating committee within the Harvard University Chaplains’ Organization did its job and elected a new president, as it has many times in the past. In the end, the process worked exactly as it’s supposed to: A qualified chaplain got promoted. What is there to report on by the national press?
While Epstein is the University’s first atheist chaplain president, we doubt that his election would have made the New York Times or any other national media publication had it been at almost any other school. Senior Catholic Chaplain William T. Kelly concurs that the coverage of Epstein’s election has been needlessly “sensational”: “You put the words ‘Harvard’ and ‘chaplain’ in the same sentence: it’s going to get people’s attention.”
Kelly’s statements reveal Harvard’s curious standing in the media: Any news pertaining to the University and its students is seen as indicative of larger cultural shifts in our nation. Harvard becomes a fishbowl, where the home of the "best and brightest" of the nation is constantly overanalyzed.
As Harvard students, we find it very disorienting to exist simultaneously as everyday college students and as the subject of such scrutiny. While our experiences as Harvard students and interactions with the University are, to us, just that, they take on incredibly outsized meaning outside of our community.
So while in our minds, Epstein’s election is merely a product of regular turnover of chaplains and other Harvard staff, we wake up to headlines morphing the new leadership of an organization into the latest wedge in our nation’s cultural war.
At its worst, this external media pressure insisting on a cultural war becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: In this case, it was the Harvard Catholic Center that took the bait, calling Epstein’s new role “purely administrative.” Sure, the president of the Harvard University chaplains has administrative duties, but they also represent the head of a full spectrum of religious and spiritual leaders at Harvard.
In attempting to combat the wave of articles claiming a turning tide in the Harvard religious landscape, the Harvard Catholic Center effectively slashed the excitement that atheist students might feel regarding the now-sensationalized “First Atheist Chaplain President.” This kind of behavior is not acceptable: Harvard University should intervene and keep a fabricated culture war from turning into real tensions on campus by making a statement rejecting the Catholic Center’s callous comments and reiterating its support for Epstein in all aspects — not just the administrative ones — of his presidency.
Epstein’s election might seem a move in the right direction for the representation of atheists in high positions of religious power. But what does representation mean to the underrepresented if it is treated like a footnote, trivialized as “purely administrative” in the aftermath of a media squabble over its significance? Agnostic, atheist, humanist, and other irreligious students cannot feel fully proud of the chaplains’ choice in Epstein as long as the press, staring into the fishbowl, dissects the decision while the University stays silent.
When it comes to matters of representation in higher-up positions, we need Harvard to be explicitly supportive of their atheist chaplain presidents and Black professors and ethnic studies scholars, instead of allowing unproductive debates to persist. When the University hedges attitudes or withholds its words to try to satisfy the media critics and the student body both, it implicitly privileges Harvard’s image at the expense of its students. We, the students — not media perceptions — should come first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, the Harvard Chaplains’ Organization made an eye-catching move that, believe it or not, promises to touch believers and nonbelievers alike. In a unanimous vote carried out by a select group of campus religious leaders, the organization elected humanist chaplain Greg Epstein — an atheist — as its president.
Much of the press coverage surrounding Epstein’s historic election has sensationalized the choice, highlighting the apparent irony of an atheist holding a traditionally religious position (at a school founded to educate clergy, no less). Some explained the situation as only possible at liberal old Harvard. Meanwhile, the Harvard Catholic Center has attempted to downplay the election’s importance by claiming that Epstein serves a purely “administrative role” in the organization – whatever that means.
In reality, Epstein’s presidency is indeed significant, a bit of a shock, and – most importantly – cause for celebration.
The current diversity of Harvard Chaplains helps serve the spiritual needs of the Harvard community and promotes interfaith cooperation and open-mindedness. Epstein’s election only reaffirms this mission. A plurality of this year’s newest students at Harvard identify as either atheist or agnostic, and the number of nonbelievers across the country is steadily rising. Epstein’s unanimous election signals to these students that Harvard is a place where they too can access the grounding life guidance church can offer, sans spirituality.
It also is a powerful message of support for the areligious. Make no mistake: Anti-atheist sentiment remains disturbingly strong in public life. Americans feel more negatively about atheists than about any other religious group except for Muslims. This discrimination against nonbelievers even pervades our politics. The religiously unaffiliated make up over a quarter of U.S. adults but compose just 0.2 percent of the current Congress. Seven states even bar atheists from holding public office.
The stubborn nature of anti-atheist hostility rests, at least in part, within the fact that many tend to associate belief in God with morality itself – and that, by default, irreligion implies immorality. Psychological studies have consistently found participants to be especially distrustful of atheists. Clearly, this is a muddied portrait wrongly ascribing menace to an identity marked only by a lack of belief in a higher power.
Now a figurehead in Harvard’s religious landscape, Epstein is well-poised to help fight the nagging perception that, without God, anything goes. Indeed, while humanists do not believe in a god, their central philosophy emphasizes the goodness of humanity. As the Harvard and MIT Humanist Chaplaincy website puts it, humanism “affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment, aspiring to humanity’s greater good.” Though godless, humanist chaplains like Epstein are clearly devoted to goodness. We hope and expect Epstein’s tenure will reflect his noble, secular beliefs.
The prominence of Epstein’s new position lends visibility and credibility to an underrepresented and stigmatized group. In that way, it's not all that different from the 2017 appointment of Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain, and the 2021 appointment of Matthew Ichihashi Potts, Harvard’s first Asian American head minister of Memorial Chuch. Each move expanded who might feel comfortable seeking help from a Harvard chaplain.
At Harvard, an institution with the motto “For the glory of Christ” for most of its history, the progress Epstein’s appointment represents is both monumental and welcome. It is profoundly moving that his fellow chaplains chose to unanimously uplift him. In the coming years, we hope more can summon the goodwill to drop negative beliefs about nonbelievers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Local residents offered mixed opinions of Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex in Allston following its official opening to students on Sept. 2.
The $1 billion, 544,000-square-foot building, over five years in the making, boasts Active Learning Labs, greenspace, and an engineering student “clubhouse.”
Though some Allston residents shared students’ positive views of the campus, others expressed misgivings about its appearance, the impact it would have on neighborhood affordability, and what it bodes for future Harvard development in Allston.
“I love the way it looks,” Allston resident and Harvard Business School staff member Aileen Tschiderer said of the eight-story structure. “I love the park behind it.”
“It’s nice, and it’s bright. It doesn’t look off-putting,” another local, Marcus Bogan, said.
For others, the building’s modern exterior — featuring a thermoregulating permanent exoskeleton — is indeed off-putting.
“It’s pretty ugly,” resident Eve Frankel said. “But I guess it sort of fits in with the modern look of this area.”
Harry Mattison, another resident, said that while there is impressive science and engineering work happening on the inside of the building, on the outside, it is a “super boring streetscape.” He added that most students would likely head back to Cambridge after classes were over.
“They disappear into the building, classes end. They all may flock back to where there’s interesting things to do in Cambridge,” Mattison said.
Mattison acknowledged that Harvard was not aiming to build a dynamic neighborhood hub and that the SEC building felt exclusive to Allston at large.
“They’re not here to build a thriving, exciting, interesting Western Ave where people go do things after work or on the weekend,” Mattison said. “They’re here to build institutional uses. If you don’t have an ID, it’s not a place for you.”
The SEC and 114 Western Ave. buildings have approximately 20,000 square feet of space that is accessible to the general public, including retail space, a cafeteria, auditorium, exhibit space, and an atrium. Additionally the public has access to the SEC green space from Rena Park.
Frankel said Harvard’s developments have contributed to the rise in local housing prices. She added Harvard Square has become “fancier” and “more expensive” since she was a child.
“The cost of living is really high. And it has gone up,” Frankel said.
For its part, since 2000, Harvard has committed a total of $40 million to the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative which, in collaboration with other nonprofits, creates and preserves affordable housing in Boston and Cambridge. The University also donated approximately 0.7 acres of land at 90 Antwerp Street in Brighton to create 20 deed-restricted homeownership units, including 12 affordable units.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that the SEC is energy-efficient, built with healthy materials, and has a high-tech water management system aimed at mitigating pollution. She added that the work at the SEC, Harvard Business School, and future Enterprise Research Center will ensure the region “remains a world-class hub for research, learning, and innovation.”

UPDATED: September 9, 2021 at 1:45 p.m.
As this year’s freshmen and sophomores processed into Tercentenary Theatre for their convocations, they may have noticed something out of the ordinary: members of the Harvard University Band playing wind instruments through holes cut in their masks.
These accommodations are just one example of the ways in which this fall’s campus reopening has affected the performing arts scene at Harvard, causing groups to reimagine ways to safely perform and attract audiences who have not attended in-person student performances in 18 months.
Chloe A. Saracco ’21-’22, a leader of the vocal jazz ensemble Harvard VoxJazz, said virtual programming prevented members from being able to interact and rehearse with one another.
“The downside was definitely missing the live interaction, connection, rehearsals and constantly seeing each other in-person,” Saracco said. “Obviously, you can’t do a capella on Zoom.”
Despite not being able to perform in-person, Saracco said Zoom allowed for more “creative freedom” and flexibility.
“The upside was being able to put together a somewhat professional polished recording of two of our songs which is something that our group has never done in the past,” Saracco said. “We could kind of take our time to tweak things and make things as best as they could be.”
Still, the group is looking forward to building the club in the coming year.
“It was definitely a challenge to uphold and commemorate the club as it was a pandemic,” Saracco said.
Isabella E. Peña ’23-’24, a Crimson News editor and vice president of the Harvard Opportunes, wrote in an email that the a capella group continued some group bonding traditions virtually.
But a year ago, the Opportunes did not hold auditions, posting online that the online format “severely limited” the a capella experience. This year, the group resumed in-person auditions for new members.
“Even though we’re singing with masks, it’s so nice to actually be able to sing together at the same time and in the same place,” Peña wrote. “I’m so excited to welcome freshmen and sophomores into our little family!”
Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts at Harvard, wrote in an email that the organization is providing support — including guidance, staffing, and financing — to student groups to ease their transition to in-person performances.
“We help them think about how to do their art,” Megan wrote. “With brass players, to name one example, helping them find slotted masks and bell covers that enable them to rehearse with fellow musicians. With acting troupes, discussing staging accommodations while still trying to hold fast to their artistic ambitions.”
Many performing arts groups have been left in a “start-up phase” after going so long without in-person performances, Megan wrote. The Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, for example, will not be producing on the main stage at Loeb Drama Center this fall because of the need for “reinvigorated” theater culture, he wrote.
“Many Harvard students, such as first- and second-years, have no memory of how vibrant the theater scene was and how theater gets done in the first place,” Megan wrote.
CORRECTION: September 9, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated the status of Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club's activities this fall. They will be producing, but not on the main stage at Loeb Drama Center.

As he begins his tenure as chief of the Harvard University Police Department, Victor A. “Vic” Clay said in his first interview with The Crimson Tuesday that he intends to diversify Harvard’s police force and increase communication between the department and the Harvard affiliates it serves.
The interview with The Crimson took place following a monthly breakfast hosted by Harvard Men’s Basketball coach Tommy Amaker at Henrietta’s Table, which is located in Harvard Square’s Charles Hotel.
Clay took over as the head of HUPD in July 2021 after the University launched a nationwide search to replace former HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, who led the department for more than two decades. Riley announced his retirement at the apex of nationwide protests against police violence in June 2020 and on the heels of intense campus scrutiny of HUPD, triggered by a 2020 Crimson investigation that found instances of racism and sexism within the force.
As of last year, nearly one third of students supported proposals to abolish or defund HUPD, according to a fall 2020 survey by The Crimson. Since then, campus groups like the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops have called for the abolition of the department.
Clay is set to confront a skeptical student body as he assumes his new role.
Clay arrived at Harvard this summer after serving nearly three decades in public and private law enforcement in Los Angeles. Before joining HUPD, Clay served as the chief of campus security and parking services at the California Institute of Technology, a position he had held since 2017. Before that, he was chief of campus safety at Occidental College in Los Angeles and spent 28 years with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Clay, who is Black, stressed in Tuesday’s interview that HUPD exists to serve Harvard, and that the University’s police force should be reflective of the campus it protects.
“I want our department to look like the community. I want it to be fair,” Clay said. “The community we serve needs a better police officer out there.”
Clay said he believes police departments should hire diverse officers, including women and people of color.
Clay also said he will prioritize increasing transparency inside the department. His goal dovetails with recommendations made in the final report of a 2020 external review into HUPD launched by University President Lawrence S. Bacow to evaluate Harvard’s policing procedures.
“The day of the cop saying ‘no comment’ is over,” Clay said. “Something happens and we do something, you got to stand up and say what happened, truthfully.”
Clay said the biggest challenge he foresees in his job is proving to Harvard affiliates that HUPD is not the same as other police departments across the country.
“I can’t control what goes on in other police departments or law enforcement agencies around the nation or even the world,” he said. “If we can understand each other on that human level first and understand this is a job, just like anybody else who’s employed, and that I don’t live and breathe this law enforcement thing — we can be wrong — and that some of us need to be fired and put in jail just like regular folks, I think we’d have a better relationship.”

As Harvard students returned en masse to Cambridge earlier this month, Harvard student-run homeless shelters have made plans to operate at reduced bed capacity for overnight guests this fall and winter.
Many shelters in Cambridge had to reduce the number of guests they could house last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. For Y2Y and Harvard Square Homeless Shelter — shelters staffed by Harvard undergraduates — the past year brought acute volunteer shortages given that most students at the College were studying away from Cambridge.
To compensate for the dearth of student volunteers, Y2Y hired professional staff to help run the shelter over the past year, Y2Y Associate Director Mallory R. St. Brice explained.
Y2Y, which provides services to young adults, has also had to operate at a reduced capacity of 22 beds since the start of the pandemic.
“Historically, we have been able to host 27 guests overnight,” Y2Y Staff Director Elizabeth S. “Shea” Hausman ’22 said.
The shelter will return to a “fully student-led model” for the winter season from Oct. 15 to April 15, while maintaining the limited 22-bed capacity, according to St. Brice.
Hausman said the shelter will renege its policy instituted during the pandemic allowing guests to stay indefinitely, opting to return to a lottery system.
“We are now shifting back to something closer to the model that we had prior to the pandemic, which is the 30-day lottery,” Hausman said. “We randomly assign beds for 30-day stays, which can be a really, really critical period of stability for folks who are facing housing insecurity.”
By removing the 30-day lottery during the pandemic, the shelter reduced the number of people who could be exposed to a possible Covid-19 outbreak, according to St. Brice.
“If people stay there longer, there are other people we can’t let in,” St. Brice said. “We think [that] was the right decision to make at the time for those who were able to get in and really just needed a safe place to stay longer term in the context of the pandemic.”
For HSHS, the student-run shelter reopened for the first time this summer from July 1 to August 20 after being closed since March 2020. In its summer reopening, the shelter accommodated 15 guests.
The shelter will open again for its winter season from November 1 to April 15, though it is unclear how many beds it will make available.
“The number of bed spaces that we’re going to be offering is still a little bit in flux,” HSHS Administrative Director Alicia Liu ’22 said. “We’ll probably start with a lower number and work our way up if we feel like all of our health guidelines are being met, and we can provide a good environment for everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part III of our Freshman Survey series. Part I is here and Part II is here. Part IV will be released later this week, along with full data and visualizations.
In keeping with previous freshman classes, Harvard’s Class of 2025 remains predominantly liberal — with 72.4 percent identifying as either “somewhat” or “very” liberal and 76.2 percent supporting Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.
In fact, the proportion of freshmen in the Class of 2025 who identified as “very” liberal increased by 3.5 percent compared to the Class of 2024.
Nonetheless, freshmen’s views on national issues, such as national protests against police brutality and proposals to defund the police, are more conservative this year than those of freshmen last year.
Compared to the Class of 2024, 11.1 percent fewer members of the Class of 2025 favor defunding police departments. Similarly, the proportion of those who favor defunding the Harvard University Police Department dropped by 9.2 percent between the Classes of 2024 and 2025.
Fewer members of this year’s freshman class — 5.9 percent less — favor national protests against police brutality and systemic racism than did last year’s freshmen. Nonetheless, the percentage of students who attended such protests between the two classes are almost identical: 30.6 percent of the Class of 2024 and 30.7 percent of the Class of 2025.
Just before starting their first semesters at Harvard, roughly 78 percent of freshmen responded to a Crimson email questionnaire about their backgrounds, beliefs, lifestyles, and experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The anonymous survey explores topics ranging from political ideology to sexual experience to Covid-19’s impact on their mental health. Of 1,965 students comprising the Class of 2025, 1,537 freshmen responded. The Crimson did not account for potential selection bias in its analysis of the results. Due to rounding, reported statistics may not total exactly 100 percent.
This third installment of The Crimson’s four-part survey of the Class of 2025 examines their beliefs on politics, religion, and Harvard issues, as well as aspects of their lifestyle, such as sex, drugs, mental health counseling, and technology.
Of the Class of 2025 who supported a candidate, regardless of whether they were eligible to vote, 87 percent supported Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election — 3.1 percent fewer than Class of 2024 students who indicated they planned to vote for Biden last year.
Those supporting Donald Trump in the election dropped from 7.1 to 6.3 between the two class years. Of those who supported a candidate, 6.7 percent of the Class of 2025 supported Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins.
Freshmen not affiliated with any political party rose by 3.3 percent, from 22.6 percent in the Class of 2024 to 25.9 percent in the Class of 2025. The proportion of Democratic freshmen decreased from 57.4 percent last year to 55 percent this year, while the proportion of Republican freshmen decreased from 5.2 percent to 5 percent. Independents make up 11.8 percent of the Class of 2025 and libertarians 1.3 percent.
The proportion of freshmen in the Class of 2025 identifying as liberal remained unchanged from last year — 72.4 percent. Those identifying as “very liberal” rose from 31.7 percent of the class to 35.2 percent between the Class of 2024 and 2025.
Freshmen mostly identified as not at all religious (32.3 percent) or not very religious (21.5 percent); only 2.4 percent of respondents said they were extremely religious.
Religious involvement varied by gender and sexuality. No genderqueer or nonbinary respondent identified as extremely religious, and less women — 46.9 percent — identified as extremely religious compared to men at 53.1 percent. Only straight respondents identified as extremely religious.
In addition, the Class of 2025’s religious involvement correlated with their political beliefs. No respondent who identified as extremely religious said they were very liberal, compared to 44.2 percent of nonreligious respondents. Likewise, only 4.2 percent of nonreligious respondents said they were very conservative, compared to 12.5 percent of extremely religious respondents.
Eighty percent of genderqueer and nonbinary freshmen have concerns over experiencing sexual harassment or assault in college, and 76.4 percent of those identifying as female also reported sharing these concerns. In contrast, just 7.3 percent of those identifying as male reported such concerns.
Of this year’s freshmen, 88.2 percent support Harvard’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate for on-campus students.
Among the Class of 2025, 74.1 percent support Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ efforts to negotiate higher wages and greater job protections in their second contract with Harvard.
Additionally, 68.1 percent support divesting endowment funds from fossil fuel investments, compared to 73.3 percent of the Class of 2024.
Regarding the Student for Fair Admissions’ lawsuit against Harvard’s race-conscious admissions process, 27.1 percent of freshmen said they favored the suit, while 25.3 percent responded unfavorably; the rest reported having no opinion or not enough information on the matter.
Among the freshmen, 66.4 percent support the push for Harvard to create an official Ethnic Studies department.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled that certain high-level student athletes could receive increases in education-related compensation for the use of their likeness, although the ruling had little effect on athletes at Harvard. Two-thirds of the freshmen — 66.4 percent — reported being in favor of the ruling, with 4.1 percent opposed.
The Class of 2025 may come into an unconventional campus with rigid Covid-19 testing protocols and masked classes, but they have something in common with previous classes: 62.4 percent of them are virgins. Freshmen who considered themselves to be extremely religious were more likely than their nonreligious classmates to be virgins; 91.3 percent of respondents who said they were extremely religious were virgins, compared to 56.2 percent of respondents who identified as not very religious.
Consistent with previous years, most of the Class of 2025 who reported having had sex said they only had one partner, at 48.1 percent of non-virgins. The number of freshmen who said they had more than one sexual partner decreased with nearly every additional partner, only increasing at the seven and more-than-ten partners mark.
Students who reported being in possession of a fake ID were more likely to be non-virgins than their peers without a fake ID, with fake ID owners reporting virginity rates of 31.7 percent while those who did not have a fake ID reported virginity rates of 67.7 percent.
The rate of virgins mostly increased as students reported taking more Advanced Placement exams, with 53 percent of students who took no AP tests identifying as virgins and 64.7 percent of students who took 10 AP exams identifying as virgins.
In matters of mental health, a slightly higher percentage of freshmen this year reported having sought mental health counseling. While 30.3 percent of the Class of 2025 said they sought counseling, 26.3 percent of the Class of 2024 said they sought mental health counseling. This uptick is on trend from last year as well, with more members of the Class of 2024 seeking mental health care compared to the Class of 2023.
The mental health impacts of the global pandemic and its effect on society may have influenced the Class of 2025 to seek mental health care. About 77.1 percent of respondents who said the pandemic contributed to a mental health decline sought mental health counseling, compared to 28.4 percent of respondents who said the pandemic did not adversely affect their mental health.
First-generation college students were less likely than their peers to have sought mental health counseling, at 74.5 percent to 65.7 percent, respectively. Genderqueer and nonbinary respondents were more likely to have sought counseling (63.2 percent) than women or men. Straight respondents were less likely than members of the BGLTQ community to have sought mental health care.
The Class of 2025 saw a sizable increase in the number of respondents who said they had experience with alcohol. Only 40.3 of respondents said they had never had alcohol before, compared to 47.1 percent of respondents last year.
In line with last year, ecstasy and cocaine were the least popular drugs used by freshmen, with 99 percent and 99.1 percent of respondents reporting never having used these substances, respectively. Other unpopular drugs included LSD and Adderall, which 98.3 percent and 98.2 percent of respondents said they had not used, respectively.
Tobacco and marijuana use slightly increased compared to last year. Roughly 10.2 percent of respondents said they had tried tobacco, compared to 8 percent of respondents last year. Approximately 25.2 percent of freshmen reported having used marijuana, while only 22.2 percent of respondents reported having used the substance last year.
For the most part, students from families who made a combined income of over $500,000 reported alcohol or substance use at higher rates than their peers in lower income brackets. The starkest difference was in alcohol usage rates, with students in the $500,000 or higher income bracket reporting an alcohol usage rate of 79.9 percent and students in the under $40,000 income bracket reporting an alcohol usage rate of 45.6 percent.
Students from higher-income families were also more likely to have a fake ID than students from lower-income families.
Despite now residing in the motherland of Facebook, 24.6 percent of freshmen reported they did not have an account on the platform. Students favored other social media platforms, with most having accounts on Instagram (93.5 percent), YouTube (91.3 percent), and Snapchat (81.4 percent).
TikTok took up the majority of the Class of 2025’s attention, with 80.4 percent of freshmen who use the app spending more than 15 minutes a day on TikTok. Approximately 10.7 percent of TikTok users spent more than two hours on the platform per day, the highest of any other social media app.
Apple won over the Class of 2025, with 88.8 percent of respondents reporting owning an iPhone and 72 percent of respondents reporting owning a Mac.
Just over half of respondents — 53.4 percent — said they had a LinkedIn account. Freshmen who reported that they wanted to go into consulting, technology, and entrepreneurship had the highest rates of LinkedIn accounts, at 84.6 percent, 72.4 percent, and 76.6 percent, respectively.

Coming at you LIVE, from my very tiny and slightly messy dorm room in Adams — where I have spent my entire time on Netflix or sleeping — this is Ashal, your personal interior decorator! *thundering applause ensues*
I am here to bestow my immense interior design knowledge gained from two semesters of living in Harvard dorms and countless hours spent on Pinterest. Soon, your room will be the envy of the entire campus – you have my personal guarantee.
Getting Inspired or Getting Jealous? 
To get started on this decorating quest successfully, begin by finding the inspiration you need on Tiktok, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. And don’t feel guilty! You’re in fact being very productive by enviously liking posts of that nice dorm bed frame you wish you had instead of working on your pset.
Lights, Camera, Action!
I know our generation is permanently associated with LED light strips, but that’s only because mood lighting elevates every living situation. No matter how tiny or weirdly shaped your dorm is, chances are that lights will brighten up the space (pun proudly intended). And if you don’t want to be super basic with LED or fairy lights, try alternative lighting options, like lamps — really anything but overhead (possibly fluorescent) lights.
Picture This: A Photo Collage 
This is a super cheap and customizable way to decorate your dream dorm room. You can print pictures of all your besties, your cute pets, and your summer adventures at our very conveniently located CVS. Put them right above your desk so that when you’re grinding at 2 a.m., you can look back on slightly more fun days.
Breathe a Little Easier: Get Plants!
You may have missed the PBHA plant sale, but it’s never too late to get some plants! Many options are cost effective and low maintenance. Plus, this decor will basically match any pre-existing room theme you have going on. But, if you’re like me and can’t keep a succulent alive for even a month, realistic-looking fake plants are the move. The best part is, no one will ever be the wiser!
This dorm is going to be your home for the next few months, so make it your own. Go put up that funky tapestry and stick that BTS poster to your wall (using wall-safe adhesive, of course!) – just let those creative juices flow.
