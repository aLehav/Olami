After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are so many articles recommending books to read as we all hole up at home that it’s difficult to keep track of them all. Scribd and Audible have opened up their libraries, ebooks can be downloaded at the touch of a button, and everyone has an opinion on what you should be reading in your newfound abundance of free time. But for many book lovers, there’s a big TBR shelf (“to be read,” for the uninitiated) staring us down. Here’s a guide to help you narrow down what to read — and while this list is mostly aimed to help you read what you already own, it’s also a fantastic opportunity to support your local indie bookstore or utilize your wonderful local library.
The Daunting Prize-Winner
Often the most critically acclaimed books are also the most daunting. For me, “Ducks, Newburyport” by Lucy Ellman glares at me from my shelf. This novel was shortlisted for the Booker last year and critics raved about it. The catch? It’s almost 1,000 pages, but most of the novel is a single sentence. Now is a great time to pull out that critically acclaimed novel you’ve always meant to read, but seemed just out of your comfort zone.
The Classic You Always Meant to Read
I’ve been meaning to read Melville’s “Moby-Dick” for years, but there’s always a reason not to: I’m too busy, I want to read the exciting new release, I want to read something lighter. But now, what’s stopping you? Of course, don’t feel like you have to marathon anything. But it is now easier than ever to carve out 30 minutes a day to chip away at that novel you know you should have read (or, that you’ve been pretending to have read all these years). Project Gutenberg, a site that has many classics for free, is a great resource if you never got around to buying that one classic that’s been haunting you.
The One That Got Adapted
Some of us (me) are sticklers about reading books before watching their TV or movie adaptations. Others might want to read a book after enjoying the adaptation. Regardless, now is the time to do it! The only thing between me and an HBO subscription is the fact that I have yet to get around to reading Liane Moriarty’s “Big Little Lies.” There is an abundance of possibilities here, although popular choices include Celeste Ng’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and Donna Tartt’s “The Goldfinch.”
The Long Series
I often put off starting a series if I know I’m about to be busy, because I want to binge all the books back to back. There is no time like the present to finally pick up that series — maybe there are eight books in the series, maybe it’s a trilogy of 600 page books, maybe it’s fantasy that seems complicated — because, really, what else are we going to do? For me, I’m intrigued by Sarah J. Maas’ “Throne of Glass” series and Gabaldon’s “Outlander” series (which also has a substantial adaptation with four seasons and a fifth on the way, to be found on Netflix).
The One That’s Been Sitting on Your Shelf
We all have that one book — or, if I’m being honest, many books — that we’re so excited about, but never quite makes the cut. It’s always getting pushed aside for a new release, or maybe it never seems like the right time. For me, that’s the “Mistborn” series by Brandon Sanderson, which I’ve been excited about for ages but just never got around to picking up. But now is that book’s time to shine! Pull it off the shelf and give it a go — you know you want to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cover of Phoebe Bridgers’s new single “Garden Song” depicts the singer-songwriter smiling in a skeleton costume, her arms raised and her shadow cast behind her by a spotlight, the entire image evocative of the endearing campiness of childhood horror stories. Clearly, in “Garden Song” Bridgers remains obsessed with many of the same motifs that haunt her 2017 album “Stranger in the Alps.” Once again, she is drawn to childhood, the looming presence of death, and the failures of memory and communication. While the images of “Garden Song” seem like familiar territory for a Phoebe Bridgers song, this familiarity is perfectly-suited to a piece that revolves so closely around the idea of revisiting old memories and dreams. “Garden Song” seems less concerned with rooting us in any one moment than it is with flitting through a compilation of each instant so they all brush past at once.
The ebb and flow between the guitar and kick drum and the low-dubbing of Bridgers’s voice (sung by her tour manager) both contribute to a trance-like sonic quality that matches the warped sense of time central to the song. In the first rendition of the chorus, Bridgers expresses surprise at the passage of time, singing “I don’t know when you got taller / See our reflection in the water.” As the chorus repeats, she completely rejects aging as a natural progression, proposing some kind of magic as the most plausible explanation. The lines become: “I don’t know how but I’m taller / it must be something in the water.” One verse after returning to the house where she “grew up,” the 25-year-old sings, “And when I grow up…. It’s gonna be just like my recurring dream.” Bridgers is both grown and still growing, both remembering and reliving. We get a sense of the passage of time as a dream we’ll wake up from to experience again and again. In this way, “Garden Song” functions as a kind of Edenic refuge from the laws of mortality. When Bridgers sings “Everything’s growing in our garden,” she evokes the comforting sense of all your lived experiences blooming side by side, carefully sheltered. However, the following line, “You don’t have to know that it’s haunted,” hints at this refuge as merely a willful ignorance of death. There’s an undeniable elegiac tone throughout “Garden Song,” not only in the skeleton costume Bridgers wears on the cover, but also in the way she leads us through the stages of her recurring dream — as one recalling her life in its final moments. In the last two lines of the song, when “I get everything I want” shifts to “I have everything I wanted,” it’s impossible not to hear a twinge of dissatisfaction as Bridgers places her desires in the past, and the song ends.
The music video reflects this sense of the song as a temporary — but sweet — suspension of disbelief in a haze of childhood memories. The video starts with a forlorn Bridgers sitting alone on her bedroom floor in pyjamas. She takes a long rip from a bong before singing the entire song seated in front of the camera, as if vlogging. Throughout the video, pot smoke continues to fill the room, the lights shift colors, and different characters join and leave Bridgers’s side in a hazy whirlwind, costumed as if out of a children’s book or at a Halloween party. At the end, when the smoke dissipates and the lights settle, Bridgers, alone once again, climbs into bed and buries her face in her pillow. With that, she captures an escape into memory, through a recording that can be played again and again without change.

Harvard students, faculty, and staff are undoubtedly living through the oddest circumstances that the institution has ever faced. At a place so deeply steeped in history and tradition, seismic changes, like the ones we face today, reverberate with ferocity. This type of change usually means discomfort. However, it can also mean discovery and growth.
During this time of transition, I have found myself reflecting on the academic changes and the resulting mix of discomfort and growth. The discomfort is obvious — technical difficulty, access issues, time zones, exam logistics, etc. The unprecedented decision to shift grades to an emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory system is a testament to these highly unfavorable situations. However, there are areas of positive growth that could change our academic experiences for the better. Classes at home create a natural experiment in which Harvard students are now able to learn without the ever-present pressure we feel from our peers. They present the chance to discover and strengthen our own love of learning for learning’s sake.
While the disadvantages of “online Harvard” are seemingly innumerable, little attention has been paid to the significant advantages. At home, for instance, you do not hear the ever-present dining hall chatter about being awake for x hours getting x pages written or completing x problem sets that count for x percent of your grade. Until I got home, I did not have the slightest idea of how mentally taxing this kind of chatter is on both my focus and my confidence. It creates a dynamic of comparison and competition.
In libraries we see students awake until the morning, wondering if we can push ourselves to do the same. In passing conversations, we wonder if we could be as busy as our friend, if we could maintain that type of schedule. In post-class conversations, we compare grades, hours worked on assignments, and the difficulty or ease with which we complete tasks.
On campus, we are creatures of heightened comparison. Our comparisons fuel unrealistic expectations, feelings of inadequacy, and frankly, mental and physical exhaustion. Most of all, however, these comparisons suck the joy out of learning.
At home, however, the chatter has subsided. At home, I cannot socially monetize the hours spent on my problem set. At home, I just learn.
This is true outside of my classes as well. Extracurricular pursuits, whether affiliated with Harvard or not, are now done in the privacy of our homes. We cannot compare the hours spent at practice or in meetings. Now, if we do these things, we do them out of our own initiative, for our own joy.
Harvard students have the unprecedented chance to execute their studies and activities in private, away from the only cohort in the world that would give value to the hours spent or the number of meetings attended. This gives us the unparalleled chance to learn for learning's sake, without the insidious tendencies to compare ourselves to the chatter that inundates our daily lives on campus.
It is important to note, however, that this is an opportunity extended to certain students more than others. Many will have to care for ill family members, lack the internet to properly participate, or face circumstances that make their studies secondary. Though they may not be able to pursue this time to learn without the toxicity we so absently create on campus, I hope, at the very least, that every student notes the peace we have gained from the absence of comparison.
Times of change are times of growth. As we complete the rest of our semester at home, I hope students note the good differences as well as the bad, and recognize the mentally taxing reality we created for ourselves on campus. In this way, the next time we are together, we can seek conversations that empower, not compare. We can choose that extra hour of sleep. We can realize our unique abilities to learn, regardless of what others do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Moral duties have been traditionally framed in reference to individuals, not institutions. Large bureaucracies such as corporations, states, and universities tend to take the separation of ethics and politics for granted. After all, the dominant intellectual framework for decision-makers at the highest levels of these institutions is an amoral calculation of what actions best serve the institution’s ends. Morality is often pushed aside in favor of popular support and self-interest.
Through this lens, viable courses of action estop moral dilemmas, for ethical directives are irrelevant to our deliberation of practical, real-world problems. But if so, is there no place for ethics in politics? And if not, can familiar moral duties to rescue (i.e. Singer’s drowning child) be extended to businesses, civic leaders, and universities in a world ravaged by COVID-19?
One line of emerging political realist thought contends that moral slogans such as “dignity,” “fairness,” and “duties to rescue” are merely fashionable cover-ups for political aspirations. When applied to institutions, what we call “morality” is a mere byproduct of rationalizing our self-interested convictions. Skeptics thus tend to construe moral thinking as confused, subjective, over-demanding, or irrelevant with respect to political decision-making. As such, corporate social responsibility and business ethics are commonly regarded as mere public relations stunts instead of legitimate normative guardrails. Realpolitik considerations on the front burner often trump thoughtful moral reflection.
Where this political realist approach errs, however, is that it assumes that moral theory and practice are structurally distinct endeavors. Practical ethics need not be excessively abstract, idealistic, or empirically disengaged. Moral tenets undergird, albeit implicitly, the foundations and aspirations of contentious political decisions. Conceptions of the common good and institutional ends often hinge on moral values, relations, and priorities.
We believe that institutions such as universities, by virtue of being composed of and working for the ends of moral agents, are implicated in moral responsibilities. These include a commitment to making appropriate usage of their resources to aid affected members of their communities.
But in today’s warped environment and near-wartime footing, what is ordinarily considered beyond the call of duty is now becoming a part of duty itself. Warped environments inspire cooperative and collective action, calling upon special duties and obligations to one another beyond those our communities usually demand.
Extending the project of applied ethics to today’s global COVID-19 crisis, moral directives must inform Harvard’s next steps forward. To date, the University has effectively responded to the outbreak by supporting local tenants and small business owners in the community, housing medical and health professionals, and assisting homeless populations. Various centers, such as the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, have also published white papers and recommendations on steps forward.
Despite these good efforts, our duty to rescue in times of crisis is even more demanding. A strong formulation of Singer’s moral principle informs us that “if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.” With the world drowning under coronavirus, we believe that Harvard, as one of the wealthiest and most powerful institutions of higher learning, ought, morally, to take up lifesaving duties beyond its current uptake.
In view of this, Harvard can expand its current efforts in several possible ways.
First-year dorms and upper-class houses can be made available to the city as temporary housing for individuals who are unable to safely quarantine themselves at home, or who are in need of housing due to untimely eviction. Facilities such as Harvard Stadium can be used as coronavirus testing sites to aid the expansive testing efforts being undertaken across the country. University Health Services can be temporarily open to admitting patients from across Cambridge.
With the economic situation taking a turn for the worse, Harvard can redouble its current allocation of monetary funds to homeless shelters, as well as direct operational University Dining Services to aid food relief programs. Finally, Harvard could strongly consider extending workers’ pay and benefits beyond the current deadline of May 28 to the beginning of next semester.
The looming economic downturn will undoubtedly impact the institution’s finances. After losing more than $30 million due to the pandemic, Harvard’s administration has already determined that it will be unable to cover its budget for the current fiscal year. This will lead some to argue that the University should lend more weight to balancing its budget. But when confronting the challenges lying ahead, Harvard and its affiliates ought to heed University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s own installation address: “We have a responsibility… to use the immense resources entrusted to us — our assets, ideas, and people — to address difficult problems and painful divisions.”
In times of crisis, Harvard must not shy away from sacrifice where sacrifice is needed. It must aspire to transcend its mission as an academic institution and take on the mantle of civic and moral leadership. Though the present crisis is unlike anything Harvard has confronted in nearly a century, we urge the University to display the same resilience, integrity, and generosity of spirit that has characterized it in its most exemplary moments. We have faith that Harvard will remain, above all, an institution that is as wise as it is erudite, as bold as it is thoughtful, and as good as it is great.

Despite its notorious humdrum, the walk from Harvard Yard to the Radcliffe Quad retains at least one mystery: Across the street from Cambridge Common, a small blue house stands out from Garden St.’s otherwise brick exteriors, a sign reading “Tellus” hammered above the door. To most passersby, the Tellus Institute probably looks like an inconspicuous front. Perhaps it’s just another Cambridge family home or a mysterious Harvard research facility. Maybe Tellus is a Greek word, and it’s a frat house in disguise.
Tellus’s interior offers little more clarity. In a small side room, workers sit silently at computers. It’s unclear if the computers are on.
In his office upstairs, the Institute’s Vice President, Allen L. White, offers an explanation.
White has spent nearly 20 years planning for his future on “Earthland.” The Tellus Institute website defines Earthland as a place of interdependence between Earth and humanity, “an overarching proto-country.” White is satisfied with this definition. “Earthland” acts as a guiding north star for White and a handful of colleagues at the Tellus Institute, who describe their work as “envisioning and building global futures.”
“We have transformed from issue-specific concerns to a more holistic global futures institute,” White tells me. “It’s a blend of theory, research, and advocacy.” It’s vague, he concedes, but he suggests there is clarity in the Institute’s history.
When physicist Paul Raskin founded the Institute to combat the nuclear energy crisis of the late 1970s and 1980s, his mission was immediate and practical. He sought a community of ex-academics such as White who would leave their university positions to work “on-the-ground” for tangible solutions to problems in energy policy.
Raskin’s team of geologists, mathematicians, theorists, economists, and political scientists soon grew into a large non-profit consulting group and moved into Back Bay. From their business brownstone in Boston, the Tellus Institute worked for three decades to advise corporations on sustainability, democratize access to non-nuclear clean energy, and fix broken infrastructure around the world.
In the early 2000s, the Institute took a left turn, downsized considerably, and moved into its current blue house on Garden St. In this house, their work has been guided by Raskin’s recent publications, “Great Transition” and “Journey To Earthland.” Somewhere between manifestos and peer-reviewed articles, these books began Tellus’s work in global futurism. They propose that humankind is undergoing a “great transition” akin to the agricultural or industrial revolutions. The texts predict that either “market forces” will hyper-rationalize society to a dangerous extreme, or the world will barbarize into factionalism and violence as inequality rises and crises magnify.
The Tellus Institute, White explains, offers a forum for discussion on theory and organizing for a world that steers us away from these possibilities. Perhaps, White says, there is hope for a future of local eco-communalism. White is quick to assure me that this “food co-op approach is only one of many possibilities we discuss in our journal.”
White is, of course, referring to Tellus’s online journal on global futures, “Great Transition Initiative.” White says the true work of Tellus happens on this forum, where academics, reformers, and theorists from around the world contribute their visions of “holistic futures.” Article topics range from dense economic modelling to treatises on political theory. “Great Transition Initiative” strives to “planetize the movement.”
White’s baritone cascades easily through Tellus’s doctrine. He is unfazed by uncertainty and vagueness. Listening to White, only this is clear: Tellus does not seek immediate answers. It neither proposes immediate solutions nor attacks immediate problems.
Still, the Institute publishes often in the “Great Transition Initiative,” hosts conferences with Harvard researchers down the street, and serves as a very real forum for debate on a “planetary scale.” This, to White, is the value Tellus offers the world. It offers a chance for people of all disciplines to think about their collective future, something he claims is all too rare as academics become more and more “pigeon-holed” into their specialties. The Institute’s weirdness is its virtue.
“This is a moment of intense uncertainty,” White says. “We feel our job is to be there to offer a path, to say here are the changes, here are the methods to make these changes.”

With a limited amount of things to do in quarantine, FM is coming back from its six-year hiatus to provide advice to our eternal and anonymous freshman, Josh. We’ve asked FM writers to help Josh come up with some new ideas to help pass his time in quarantine. Josh didn’t even ask for FM’s advice — so you can be the judge of who’s really crying for help here. Anyway, here are their expert answers. 
Grow a Quarantine Beard.
Social isolation is an excellent time to experiment with new looks and hairstyles. First popularized by shipwrecked pirates, the “Quarantine Beard” adds some wonderful color to one’s face as you stare at your own reflection in the mirror and ask what you have become. “Why is the rum gone?!” you exclaim in your best Jack Sparrow, standing pantless in front of your parents’ liquor cabinet. The beard cackles along with you: “Good one, Harrison!” Hey thanks, buddy! Your quarantine beard also has the added benefit of helping you measure the passage of time: Since you no longer need your meticulously documented G-Cal to plan your days, just use the millimeters of growth in facial scruff to mark time creeping by. — HRTW
Pants?
Should I wear pants today? This is a question I’ve struggled with a lot in quarantine. Here’s the answer: Pants are extra credit during these Trying Times™. Walmart has seen a significant increase in the number of tops sold, but not in bottoms — irrefutable evidence that you’re allowed to neglect wearing nice clothing — or any clothing for that matter — if the region in question falls outside the Zoom shot. Pants? Non-essential workers — but maybe you’ll feel good about it at the end of the day. When you wake up, assess how mediocre you’re feeling: There should be an inverse relationship between high spirits and quarantine pants. In other words, wear pants when you feel your worst. Wearing jeans, however, is intolerable, especially the trendy, vintage kind. Feeling trapped inside is enough — don’t let your pants trap you too. — JFA
Animal Crossing. 
I’m not normally one to brag, but I have the best town. Animal Crossing Town, that is. In case you’re uncultured, a Boomer, or simply not up-to-date on the newest version of the popular Nintendo game, “New Horizons” was released on March 20 for the Nintendo Switch, just in time for my quarantine — I even pre-ordered so I could play one day early. I think you’ll find that it’s literally the perfect game for anyone’s shelter-in-place. Can’t go outside? Well, I have a whole island to explore and can hop a plane whenever I choose. Can’t find your favorite fruits at the supermarket while exploring the aisles in your hazmat suit? Well my island has six different kinds: cherries, oranges, apples, pears, coconuts, and peaches. Miss seeing your friends everyday? I’m living on an island with 10 friends who give me free furniture and compliment me. My real life blockmates maybe said one or two nice things to me total, and they certainly didn’t give me that bean bag chair that YOU PROMISED I COULD HAVE AFTER FRESHMAN YEAR, CHRIS. If you can ignore the fact you’re living with talking animals (I’m back to Animal Crossing here — do try to keep up), a cheapskate raccoon who charges you bells — my town’s currency for everything — and that it’s completely electronic, it’s basically the perfect life. — SPM
Play Trivia Crack. 
You probably already have a Trivia Crack account left over from middle school. Quarantine is the perfect time to revitalize twelve-year-old you. Look past the incessant advertising and poorly-phrased questions — “Identify this popular fish.?” paired with a photograph of, apparently, a Largemouth Bass — in order to prove your intellectual superiority. Oh you didn’t know that was a Largemouth Bass? Huh. If you’re like me, your expertise will be in the art category, where 89 percent of questions concern the work of Vincent Van Gogh. And if you’re like me, your failings will obviously occur in the sports category, because, if it is nothing else, Trivia Crack is a space to affirm exactly who you are. I haven’t changed much since I was 12, I guess. If you get so into it that you start submitting your own questions for the game — for example, a harmless question about Kate Bush — expect them to be mercilessly and overwhelmingly rejected by the Trivia Crack community. — OGO
Great British Baking Show
For some, quarantine is the perfect opportunity to begin a new hobby or hone an existing skill. Baking has proven popular: Some stores are even suffering from egg shortages. But if you can’t bake yourself and/or don’t want to risk souring your dough on expensive, probably fake spices like “caraway seeds” (named for the character from “Gatsby”?), “borage” (apparently not the same as “porridge”?), and “juniper berries” (nearly killed Katniss and Peeta in “Hunger Games”?), there’s a next best thing: binging all seven collections of the Great British Baking Show on Netflix. Instead of despairing over your own unrisen loaf, you can watch Paul Hollywood jab his finger into a contestant’s failed attempt at a brioche and proclaim it “underbaked.” You don’t need your friends to condescend towards you about their baking prowess via their Instagram stories when you could have a real-life British person do it on your own television! Between the soggy pastries, loveable characters, and stunning dessert displays, there’s bound to be something that hits the spot. — JZL
Joyous Unproductivity
I heard that you never had the opportunity to develop hobbies that are meaningful to you because you were too busy being valedictorian, captain of the tennis team, finding a cure to cancer, and volunteering at homeless shelters every day of high school. Is that right, Josh? Well, when you’re used to being busy all the time, it can be hard to be okay with doing nothing. Like mine, your timeline has probably been flooded with people who have large platforms on social media, boasting their two week ab challenges, upcycling projects, or newly discovered artistic skills. I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve even book marked a few of these videos for later, even though you probably never took that second look. And you probably feel bad about yourself for your inability to commit to an activity that doesn’t involve staring at a screen for 18 hours of the day. It’s important to remember that quarantine is not a productivity contest, and that it’s okay for you to not check off everything that’s on your to-do list. I’d recommend you spend this time filling your empty schedule with activities that bring you joy regardless of your unproductivity, whether that be binging a tv series, taking a nap, or FaceTiming friends. — NBF
Zoooooom
Now I’m sure that when you first heard of “Zoom,” you may have thought of the somewhat life-changing but also somewhat mediocre live-action PBS Kids television program that first aired in the winter of ’99 and ended prematurely in ’05. But actually, you and many other people are all sadly mistaken. The current mass discussion over Zoom is not regarding the highly anticipated comeback of a globally beloved television variety show consisting of segments made by kids (called Zoomers!) for kids, but the buzz is actually about a software company specializing in videotelephony. No worries, you can still reclaim that turn of the millenium, chaotic-good Zoom magic on the same platform that you use to watch your lectures! For example, I’m in the middle of a Zoom murder-mystery game with my blockmates to jazz up our days! Others are creating appendage mandalas using Zoom’s group call “gallery view” function. You too can repurpose this academic learning tool for shenanigans with your friends! Or you can just use Houseparty. — KL

Nancy Krieger is a professor of social epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Krieger is known for her theory of ecosocial disease distribution, which examines how different historical, societal, and ecological conditions are made manifest in the health outcomes of different social groups — in other words, how factors like economic inequality affect public health. Fifteen Minutes spoke with her about how the coronavirus pandemic has revealed the social determinants of health inequality and what we can do to alleviate those inequities. This interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Fifteen Minutes: Could you tell us about your work as an epidemiologist?
Nancy Krieger: I’m a social epidemiologist; this means that my focus is on the societal structures and forces that drive population health and its patterns and, particularly, health inequities. Health inequities are differences in health status between social groups that are in principle unfair, avoidable, and preventable.
I do work that’s more etiologically-focused, which means looking at the causes: How do we understand what is causing the patterns that are observed? The first thing you have to do is observe the patterns, then you have to try to explain the patterns. But I also do work as a social epidemiologist on the theoretical frameworks that help you ask these kinds of questions. So I’ve spent a lot of time developing the ecosocial theory of disease distribution that takes into account the kinds of ways in which people actually embody inequality but also can embody justice. So it’s not only about health inequities, it’s also about the conditions that make it possible for people to thrive — all people, with dignity.
FM: A lot of your work centers on the social determinants of health. Could you explain what a social determinant is?
NK: The framework of social determinants of health became very popular in the latter part of the 2000s. The social determinants were seen — they could be policies, they could be forms of governance in societies — as these large macro-structural determinants, whether they were histories of racial inequality, or the history of gender relations or things like that. So it’s also an attempt to no longer look just at the people who are doing worse, but what the relationship is between the people doing worse and doing better. In a more conventional approach, social determinants are things like housing, education, green space, places to play and to recreate, income — and those are important, but you have to step back and ask what’s driving the distribution.
FM: What are some ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted social inequality? How is it related to these social determinants of health?
NK: The COVID-19 pandemic has pulled a thread that is showing how everything is actually connected. So there were health inequities, social inequities, and economic inequities, all kinds of injustice. But COVID-19 has opened up a space for much more visible discussion. You have to think about where people are located, where they’re living at home, with whom, in what conditions, how crowded, how many people per room, how many people are in a household, who is very much exposed to different kinds of people and their work context.
So you’re going to start to see questions of who has what kind of jobs that would increase their risk of being exposed. In those jobs, who’s provided with protective equipment, who’s provided now with gloves and masks? In the hospitals, who’s getting what kinds of exposures — for example, the people who are doing the food services, the people doing the deliveries, the people doing the cleaning and the maintenance — what kinds of protections do they have? So how does that relate to questions of what become occupational disparities?
There seems to be good evidence that having what are called comorbidities, other kinds of chronic diseases — diabetes, cardiovascular disease, other kinds of respiratory diseases — could make you more at risk for contracting the virus. So who has those diseases? For example, you have higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, etc., amongst many populations of color, particularly black and American Indian populations compared to white, non-Hispanic populations. COVID-19 is entering into a society where there already are huge health inequities in relation to the very conditions that make people more susceptible to becoming very ill from COVID-19. This is where the social lens comes in — not giving people individual-level advice and saying “wash your hands,” “cover your face,” “don’t go to work” — it’s actually addressing the context that makes any of that possible.
FM: Some people have talked about this global pandemic as a great equalizer. How do social determinants complicate this assertion?
NK: There are two parts to that. In one sense, it’s true that it is a great equalizer — all humans can get infected. All humans can potentially get sick, and all humans can potentially die. But there are also ways it is not a great equalizer — it is showing all the inequities in our society. The United States is an extensively well-resourced country, but there are enormous gaps in how those resources are distributed. If people are worried about medical resources being overwhelmed in Boston, which is a leading medical center, imagine the situation in countries which barely have a health system in comparison — what’s going to happen?
FM: How do prevention and relief measures such as social distancing or stay-at-home orders affect different groups disproportionately?
NK: People who are considered essential workers — transportation workers, people staffing grocery stores, etc. — have not been treated well and have not been paid well. COVID-19 has illuminated that vividly. So then we want to have these policies that some states are enacting — not just the federal government — to build social and economic buffers so that people can protect their communities and their own health.
FM: Do you think that the pandemic will help ignite a push for different kinds of public health policies in the future? What kinds of policies would address the social determinants of pandemics in order to prevent an event similar to the one we are currently experiencing?
NK: This situation underscores that actually having a health equity perspective is important. It’s all connected. So I wouldn't say it’s only public health policies. It’s about asking how we have policies and programs that are set up so that they’re geared to help people thrive.
For example, air pollution increases risk of potential morbidity and mortality as tied to COVID-19. The current attacks to undo air pollution regulations are obviously not public health policy. Some things are very specific to public health, but other things are about economic policy. Another example is good sick leave policies so workers who are sick don’t go into work when they are sick. That really is not very hard to get your head around, but is hard to mobilize employers around.
FM: Barring larger structural change, is there anything that policymakers can do right now to mitigate the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on marginalized groups?
NK: Absolutely. I mean, steps are being taken to deal with people who are incarcerated in relation to COVID-19 to try to get early release, about making sure that people are not put in detention for nonviolent offenses. There’s stuff going on in legislatures about immediate relief packages, making sure that those packages are going directly to affected families instead of corporations, making sure that testing for COVID is at no cost. So there’s a lot that’s in the immediate here and now.
FM: How do you anticipate this crisis impacting scholarly research in your field in the future?
NK: This is the era of non-communicable diseases, but communicable diseases still really matter. I think that it’s going to call more attention to social determinants, potentially in good ways. I think the idea of developing more robust infrastructure to monitor population health dynamically and rebuilding the hollowed-out shells of health departments will become more prominent.
FM: How do you think we can learn from this crisis to ensure a more equitable response in the future?
NK: First, it’s a reminder of our common humanity. And we have to draw on that common commitment to protect people and care. Second, I think that it is bringing together many groups who have been working on different facets of all the things that COVID-19 is bringing together, as I said — the housing crisis, the environmental crisis, racial injustice. Also, issues around gender relations, what does it mean to ask people to shelter at home, if there are possibilities of domestic violence — it’s making people see the connections. Part of what I do is help with the theoretical framing of things. And in the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, there is an emphasis on embodiment: How do people embody? Our bodies don’t care if you want to parse it out: This is a housing crisis. This is an economic crisis. This is racial injustice. This is gender inequity. Right now, people through their bodies are showing what the problems are in our society, but also what the potential is for people coming to work together to make a better world — one where people can thrive, with dignity, with their rights, in a sustainable way.

When he received the phone call from the Bureau of Indian Affairs at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 27, Cedric D. Cromwell had been hoping for good news.
Cromwell serves as president and chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. His term thus far has been trying: A week prior to the call, he declared a state of emergency for the Mashpee Wampanoag tribal nation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools were shut down, public buildings were closed, and he and the rest of the tribal council were scrambling to gather the resources their people would need to weather the crisis.
That afternoon, Cromwell, the tribe’s vice chair Jessie little doe Baird, and attorneys for the tribe gathered — separately — in their homes for a conference call with R. Glenn Melville, the deputy associate director at the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Melville informed them that he had some “bad news”: The Department of the Interior was taking their land out of trust.
The federal government bringing land in trust grants special protections and privileges to the land and the tribe that owns it. While in trust, land cannot be taken away from a tribe or sold to a non-Native without the approval of the federal government. It is not subject to state or local laws and taxes, because tribes are sovereign nations under U.S. law, and are therefore only subject to federal laws and regulations.
Taking land out of trust means the tribe loses its sovereignty over that land – it becomes subject to state and local laws, and the state gains the right to tax the land and take it away if those taxes are not paid.
“I said, ‘Why are you doing this? What is this about?’’ Cromwell recalls. “He says, ‘I’ve been instructed by the Department of the Interior Secretary to take your land out of trust.’’’ Cromwell and his attorneys repeatedly asked for more specifics. Melville gave the same response over and over again: that he was simply following instructions.
Before the call, the tribal leaders felt fairly confident. “We actually thought we were the first tribe in the country to finish our paperwork and ask for disaster declaration and relief,” Baird recalls. “So we thought the phone call was about our relief requests for COVID.”
Cromwell says he, Baird, and their attorneys felt blindsided by the news. The U.S. has not taken land out of trust since the 1950s, and the consequences of doing so are devastating. The tribe will no longer have sovereign control over its land, and its government and social services will have to be dissolved in the midst of a pandemic. While the tribe will still technically own their 321 acres, they no longer have the trust protections that keep any of their land from being taken away.
Just when Cromwell and Baird were gearing up to protect their community from COVID-19, they realized they would have to use much of their resources to protect their land as well.
“I got off the phone; we huddled with the attorneys,” Cromwell says. “Four o’clock on Friday, in the midst of a pandemic where the whole world is being impacted. And they take the time to call us, a trustee, and say, ‘We're going to de-establish you — destroy you.’”
The decision to disestablish the land is based in a long history of complicated federal-tribal relations. Although the Mashpee have lived in the Cape Cod area since before the first European settlers arrived, the tribe has only been recognized at the federal level for 13 years. It has held 321 acres of land in trust for only five of those years, during which time it has operated as a fully sovereign nation, maintaining its own police department, housing development projects, and Wampanoag-language elementary school.
“Land in trust” is a mechanism the U.S. government established to provide extra protections for tribal nations that had lost much of their land throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Robert T. Anderson, the director of the Native American Law Center at the University of Washington and the Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, describes the process of bringing land into trust: First, tribes must own the land as property owners; they can then ask the Secretary of the Interior to take the land into trust. Once that happens, the land cannot be sold or taken away involuntarily without the consent of the federal government.
“That’s been a huge protection for tribes in the event that state or local taxes apply to the real estate and the tribe can’t pay it for some reason,” Anderson explains. “[The state] wouldn’t be able to take that property through any other mechanism without the consent of the federal government.”
Federal recognition is required to hold land in trust. In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, which was intended to decrease federal control over Native tribes and allow them to largely self-govern. The IRA affirmed Native nations’ sovereign control over their lands, allowed them to purchase new land using federal loans, and authorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept additional tribal lands into trust and proclaim new reservations on those lands.
The IRA also created a register of tribes that were deemed “federally recognized.” Federal recognition means that tribes are recognized as having “a government-to-government relationship” with the United States, as well as “certain inherent rights of self-government” like tribal sovereignty, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs website. They are also eligible for certain services and benefits.
If a tribe was too small or had not made a treaty with the U.S. at any point, it was not eligible to be included in the IRA’s list of benefits. There is a process through which tribes that are not on this register can gain federal recognition, but it is arduous and difficult. It requires tribes to have “established that you have been an Indian tribe since historical times, that you maintain the continuous governmental body with ministers control over your members, and you have a defined territory — even though you may not own it anymore,” Anderson explains.
The Mashpee won federal recognition in 2007, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to take their land into trust in 2015 and grant them a reservation.
A recent lawsuit, however, reversed the Secretary’s decision. The 24 plaintiffs of the suit — led by David and Michelle Littlefield — claim the Department was wrong to take the Mashpee’s land into trust in the first place because the Mashpee did not fit the definition of “Indian” from the 2008 Supreme Court Case Carcieri v. Salazar.
Before the 2008 case, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken L. Salazar granted 31 acres of trust land to the Narragansett Tribe. Governor Donald L. Carcieri sued Salazar, claiming he did not have the authority to do so. Carcieri was concerned that the Narragansett would use the trust land to build a casino or another business that couldn’t be taxed by the state of Rhode Island. The tribe, whose ancestors have lived in the Rhode Island area for more than 30,000 years, has about 2,400 enrolled members; they purchased the 31 acres in 1991 in order to build a housing complex for the elderly. At the tribe’s request, the Department of the Interior took those 31 acres into trust in 1998.
However, the Supreme Court ruled that the Department of the Interior had no authority to take land into trust for tribes recognized after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act.
Though the decision was a blow to the Narragansett Tribe, what was at stake was the 31 acre housing complex. Now, the 321 acres in question are the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s entire land base. It is the last of the land that their ancestors inhabited for over 14,000 years, and they could very well lose it.
“They should have spoken to us with the Darth Vader voice,” Cromwell says. His voice drops an octave and he says, slowly with a dramatic flair, “‘I'm taking your land away.’”
Cromwell is speaking to us from his kitchen, which he says has become an impromptu office now that the tribal buildings are closed. A television plays in the background for part of the call, and at one point, a young girl’s voice interrupts. It’s his granddaughter, and Cromwell asks us to hold on and gets off the phone to help her with something.
“You got what you wanted? You got it? More? You sure? Okay, sweetheart.”
The tribal government currently being run from Crowell’s kitchen descends from the tribe that first greeted the pilgrims at Plymouth in 1621. The U.S. celebrates the Mashpee Wampanoag every November, with each Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, first Thanksgiving pageant, and carved turkey.
“We were that tribe that sat down and first met [the Pilgrims], helped them through their first harsh winters, helped establish Plymouth with some of our land that was the anchor to building the United States of America,” Cromwell says. “And for this administration to say, ‘You, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, you do not meet the definition of Indian tribe,’ is just unprecedented, absurd.”
The Mashpee has a history with Harvard, too. The University’s charter affirms its mission to educate the “English and Indian youth,” because Harvard’s Indian College, established in 1655, was home to four Native students. One of these students, Joel Iacoomes, was Mashpee – he was the College’s first valedictorian but was unable to receive his diploma because he died in a shipwreck heading from the Cayman Islands to Cambridge. He was finally honored with his posthumous diploma at a ceremony in 2011.
The Mashpee’s interactions with settlers, however, were also part of the reason they were never federally recognized. As was the case for many tribes in the Northeast, so many Mashpee died as a result of war and disease brought by European colonists that their numbers were decimated. Today, they boast only 2,600 enrolled citizens.
According to Baird, the Mashpee have been struggling for sovereignty for more than 300 years — since 1709, when they first sent a tribal citizen to file an agreement with the King of England. “We’ve endured every manner of designation,” Baird says. “Everything from traditional village to Indian plantation, to praying town, to Indian district, to incorporated town, and have had citizenship actually forced upon us, had our land alienated from us, had overseers given to us, have overseers removed from us, and through all of that we've managed to maintain our territory.”
Philip J. Deloria is a Professor of History at Harvard, whose research focuses on relations between American Indian peoples and the United States. He explains that there is a “common perception” that Natives in New England “more or less died or vanished. But the fact is, of course, that these people stayed, survived, persisted, resisted, found all kinds of ways to maintain cultural continuity.”
Even though they survived and continued to thrive as a tribe, the Mashpee were not recognized in the 1934 IRA because their population was so low and because they had not made a treaty with the U.S. at any point. After decades of attempting to reclaim land, they were finally able to gain federal recognition in 2007 and moved forward to get reservation land put into trust — the Obama Administration deemed them eligible in 2015. In the five years since then, they have put significant amounts of infrastructure in place: housing, healthcare, a tribal court, and a school that teaches the Wampanoag language.
All of this was at stake in the lawsuit led by the Littlefields.
“This was illegal. If they took land into trust for this tribe, it would be illegal,” says Michelle Littlefield in a 2018 WBSM TV interview. “And we said from day one, ‘If you do it, we’re gonna challenge it.’ And we did, and we won.”
In January of 2016, the federal government placed land in Taunton, Mass. in the Mashpee’s trust to be developed as a “commercial/industrial park” that would include a “400,000 ft. gaming complex,” according to court documents. The next month, the Littlefields and 22 other plaintiffs took the Mashpee to court, claiming that the BIA had “exceeded its statutory authority” by putting the land in trust.
“None of us were happy with the location,” Michelle said of the casino in the WBSM TV interview. “It was not fit for our community.”
Michelle and David Littlefield have been fighting the Mashpee casino project since 2012. The First Light Casino would have been built down the street from their home, and many of the other 22 plaintiffs are their neighbors: lawyers, a realtor, a school secretary, a retired softball coach. The majority of the plaintiffs are married couples, and appear to be white and middle class. One woman, Veronica Casey, was on the Miss Taunton Scholarship Pageant Committee that judged the Littlefields’ daughter, Lyndsey. Lyndsey won Miss Massachusetts and will soon move on to the Miss America pageant.
But the stakes of the lawsuit were more complicated than a desire not to live down the street from a casino. In fact, one of the plaintiffs, Francis Lagace, filed a request with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in 2013 to open Taunton’s region of the state for commercial casino license applications because of “substantial delays associated with an Indian casino proposal.” The lawsuit was partially funded by Neil Bluhm, a Chicago developer who had planned to build a casino in Brockton, 20 miles from the Mashpee casino. Others, it seems, wanted to build a casino of their own. And in a Boston Globe article from 2016, David Littlefield said it was not the casino that he and Michelle were worried about. Rather, it was the “incredible arrogance” of the federal government in creating “an Indian reservation in their backyard.”
In an article from the Taunton Daily Gazette, Michelle said that she is primarily concerned with the Mashpee functioning as a sovereign nation, independent of state laws and regulations. She said that, as far as she is concerned, the land is no longer sovereign Mashpee Wampanoag Territory.
“It’s back on the tax rolls and should now be under state and local control,” she told the Gazette.
The Littlefields did not respond to requests for comment.
The federal government taking Mashpee Wampanoag tribal land out of trust will affect the tribe in innumerable ways. Mukayuhsak Weekuw — a Mashpee preschool specializing in Wôpanâak language instruction and a premier site of Indigenous language revitalization — might be shut down. The tribal court could lose its ability to hear criminal cases. The tribe’s autonomous healthcare system could be adversely affected. Their freedom over economic development could be hindered: Without land in trust, the tribe loses the authority it had to implement its own tax codes and regulate businesses on its land.
The tribe will also lose advantages that allowed it to provide affordable housing to its members. The Mashpee Wampanoag tribal land is situated half in the town of Mashpee and half in the town of Taunton; its borders lie in and around Cape Cod, an area known for its high tax rates. Before its land was taken out of trust, the tribe was considered a sovereign nation and was therefore exempt from state and local taxes, allowing it to provide its members with low income tax rates..
Having the land in trust also allowed the tribe to provide housing to its members: Because the tribe had been considered sovereign, it was allowed to set its own zoning regulations instead of being required to adhere to those of Massachusetts, which meant that it could fit in more houses per acre.
This enabled the creation of the Mashpee Wampanoag Village, a Low Income Housing Tax Credit Housing Project currently under construction in Mashpee. It has 42 units, with one house per half acre of land. The town of Mashpee’s zoning regulations typically require that each house be built on a full acre of property. The tribe’s sovereignty allowed the Mashpee Wampanoag to circumvent those regulations in order to make housing more available to its members. Now, that could all change.
“If we don’t match the zoning, and the permitting office doesn’t provide the same zoning permits for the same zoning that the town of Mashpee has, we’ve lost all that inventory right there,” Cromwell explains. “That’s $12 million worth of houses that goes up in flames because we don’t meet the local zoning laws.”
But Baird is especially concerned about the possibility that the tribal police could lose their jurisdiction over the land. Before the establishment of its own police force, Baird says that the tribe faced brutality at the hands of the local police.
“I watched one man that lived next door to me being beaten severely for fishing on his Aboriginal rights by the Mashpee Police Department,” Barid recalls. “And the County police have also killed a tribal member, unarmed. Shot him to death.” She fears what being brought back under the local police’s jurisdiction might mean for her tribe.
“I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe,” writes Scott W. Carline, chief of the Mashpee Police Department, in an emailed statement. “This holds even more true today. Moving forward I pledge to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe as well as all citizens, an open, accountable, accessible police department responsive to your needs and concerns,” he continues. “We will continually strive to earn your trust, reduce crime, and provide exceptional services while always treating you with dignity and respect.”
Still, Baird says that since the tribe’s own police force has held jurisdiction, the Mashpee have not had issues with police brutality. The police force they have now is made up of tribal citizens, so they often have a good relationship with the people they are serving.
“This would really undo a lot of incredibly powerful and positive work that Native people have done for the last 50, 60, 70, 80 years,” Deloria says of the reservation disestablishment. “This is the untold story of the pandemic — all the bad shit that is still going on in terms of undoing things that have been really positive for Native people.”
The ramifications of this legal decision could send ripples far beyond the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe.
“If they persist in this narrow interpretation of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, in terms of when the Department can take land in trust for tribes that are recognized, it could have an effect on about 35 tribes that are in a similar category to the Mashpee, having been recognized after 1934,” Anderson explains. The decision to consider the Masphee’s land ineligible for trust status would set a legal precedent to take land out of trust for other tribes across the country.
“This is an existential crisis for tribes,” says Jean-Luc Pierite (Tunica-Biloxi), President of the Board of the North American Indian Center of Boston. “What Chairman Cromwell alleges is that the federal government is doing this without a court order. If it can do this without a court order, then that signal is that our reservation lands are pretty much at the discretion of the Secretary of Interior. Any tribe that is recognized after 1934, let’s say, is in danger of losing their tribal lands.”
Pierite is currently researching the tribes that were federally recognized after 1934, and estimates that the number could near a hundred. If his estimation is correct, thousands of acres of Native land could be in peril.
“They’re trying to destroy us and erase us. And if they can do that, you know, now it’s precedent,” Cromwell says. “It’s a template for them to go across America and say, ‘Okay, one by one, one by one.’ And then next thing you know, Indigenous people of this land will be erased.”
As soon as Cromwell got off the Friday afternoon phone call, he convened a tribal council meeting. The council decided to seek both a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order on the U.S., protecting the tribe's land for the time being. During a virtual hearing with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice a few weeks ago, a judge approved the restraining order; a hearing is slated for mid-May.
The Mashpee have also staked their hopes on a bill currently pending in Congress. In January 2019, Massachusetts Congressman Bill Keating introduced H.R. 312 — The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reaffirmation Act. If passed, the bill would reaffirm the Mashpee Wampanoag land as land in trust. Any actions relating to the land would be “promptly dismissed.”
“That bill passed in May of 2019 with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of Representatives,” Cromwell says. He predicts that it will not pass in the Senate, however.
The Boston City Council has passed a resolution in support of Bill HR 312. When Kenzie Bok ’11, the city councilor for District 8, first heard about the reservation’s disestablishment, she and another counselor immediately met to co-write a resolution.
“In the middle of this crisis, the Trump administration came down with a decision that they were going to take the land of the Mashpee Wampanoag out of trust, which really threatens to tribe’s self governance and is a real slap in the face in the middle of this pandemic,” Bok says. “We needed to put the city council on the record in support of the tribe.”
The resolution followed a statement released by U.S. Senators Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) that pledges to fight the reservation disestablishment. With about 6,000 Native people living in Boston, many of them Mashpee, the resolution was passed with support from a large majority of the City Council.
The Mashpee have also received support from other Native American tribes. The National Congress of American Indians, which represents over five hundred tribes and has been an important voice in policy debates about Native issues since 1944, has reached out with statements of support. Individual tribes and Native interest organizations have shown support through letters and on social media, posting the hashtag #StandWithMashpee.
The timeline of legal proceedings going forward is unclear. Besides the hearing in mid-May to address the tribe’s preliminary injunction on the U.S., Cromwell doesn’t know much beyond that. When we ask when all of these changes will take effect, he chuckles grimly and says, “to destroy us? I don’t have any dates on that at the time.”
In the meantime, he hopes for more support from Americans to get the disestablishment decision reversed. “We really need America,” Cromwell says. “Call the senators, and stand with us, and flood the news lines, flood Congress with this and say, ‘Stop it. Come on, stop, stop, stop.’ It's cruel and painful. Help my people. Just help us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus pandemic drags on, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview Thursday that she and other higher education administrators are looking for “rigorous and creative” solutions to ensure academic progress for all students this fall.
On March 10, Harvard became one of the first universities nationwide to switch to remote learning and send most students home in order to slow the spread of the virus. Most universities followed suit soon after.
Gay said Thursday that administrators at higher education institutions will be closely following public health guidance in the coming months to determine when their campuses will reopen. She declined to specify whether any committees within Harvard’s FAS are working on plans for the fall, or when she anticipates a final decision will be reached.
“Where we anticipate we’ll be in terms of the science — the science behind a vaccine and therapeutics — really forces all of us in higher ed to think in a rigorous and creative way about the fall and about all the different ways we might have to consider living and delivering on our mission,” Gay said. “I think everyone realizes that flexibility is the word of the day and it will continue to be for some time.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that Harvard is considering “lots of different scenarios” for what its fall semester might look like. Bacow told Harvard Magazine last week that University administrators are focused on making decisions about the fall, but he fears that by the time those decisions need to be finalized, there will still be “a tremendous amount of uncertainty.”
Gay said Thursday that while the University is currently focused on achieving a “successful end to this semester,” administrators are closely monitoring the progression of the virus.
“Important decisions have already been announced about the summer, and like the rest of the world, and certainly like the rest of higher education, we’re following closely the public health guidance,” Gay said, referring to the University’s decision to move summer programs online.
Gay also said that as the virus progresses, the financial impact of the pandemic will extend beyond the initial $30 million in losses the FAS has already incurred since the de-densification of campus last month.
“We don’t want to anchor too much around this number, because the reality is that the pandemic is a continuing issue,” Gay said. “Responding to it is not something that is confined to those five or six days in March when we were actively working to de-densify the campus.”
Gay said the $30 million figure included refunds for students’ room and board, support for shipping, storage, and travel, a reduction in the term-term time work expectation for students on financial aid, and lost revenue from programs in the Division of Continuing Education.
On Wednesday, Gay announced immediate cost-saving measures for the FAS, including the suspension of all capital projects and cuts to all non-essential spending.
She said Thursday that examples of non-essential spending FAS may cut include travel and speaker series, though specific cuts will vary by academic division.
Gay also wrote in her Wednesday announcement that FAS will suspend all faculty searches until further notice, excepting a “small number” which are already near completion. The University, meanwhile, announced a hiring and salary freeze across all its schools on Monday.
In late March, Gay offered many tenure-track faculty a one-year extension to their tenure timelines, citing the effects of the pandemic on their research. Shortly afterwards, more than 1,200 people signed a petition urging Harvard to do the same for its non-tenure-track faculty — faculty members who do not go up for tenure and instead must leave the University at the end of their time-capped contracts.
Gay declined to say Thursday whether she would extend non-tenure-track faculty appointments, drawing a distinction between the different “contexts” in which tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty are hired.
FAS evaluates faculty for tenure based on a combination of research, teaching, advising, and “citizenship,” according to its tenure-track handbook.
“Our non-ladder faculty are in teaching appointments that are based on curricular need,” Gay said. “Our tenure-track faculty are not in similar appointments.”
“Lecturers and preceptors play a very important role in carrying out our teaching mission at Harvard,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Asian American student groups have organized a “Pan-Asian Visitas” to introduce new admits to their organizations and connect prospective students with current undergraduates, as a supplement to the College’s online “Virtual Visitas” programing.
Kalos K. Chu ’22, co-president of the Chinese Students Association, helped organize Pan-Asian Visitas with student leaders of other Asian cultural organizations. He said that the student-organized Black Visitas, created by student groups including the Harvard Black Students Association, inspired him to create a “Pan-Asian Visitas.”
Chu, a Crimson arts editor, said he hopes the programming helps inform prospective students of opportunities for Asian and Asian American students on campus.
“Our goal is not to convince people to come,” Chu said. “I think our goal — as is the goal of Visitas in general — is to give people as much information about Harvard as possible, about what it's like to be a student.”
“And, in this case, about what it's like to be an Asian or Asian American student at Harvard,” he added. “And then for them to make that decision on their own.”
With campus closed and most students away from campus due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the College announced that they would move the annual admitted student weekend online. “Virtual Visitas” consists of online programming throughout the month of April.
Part of the programming for Pan-Asian Visitas is taking place on its Instagram page, and includes profiles of various cultural organizations, question-and-answer sessions, and Instagram story takeovers by various clubs.
The Instagram page also spotlights virtual events that student groups are hosting for prospective students over Zoom, a video conference platform. These events vary from a dumpling-making workshop hosted by the Asian American Association to a dance workshop series led by the Asian American Dance Troupe.
Julia H. Riew ’21, former president of the Harvard College Asian Student Arts Project, said she sees the Instagram page as a valuable resource to connect students with others who have similar backgrounds and interests.
“When you start college, I think one really great thing you can do is connect with people who have similar interests or similar cultural backgrounds,” Riew said. “And right now, because Visitas is all online and all through Zoom, it's really nice to kind of have that social media platform.”

Another program designed to connect students is a host-hostee pairing, where newly admitted students are paired with a current Harvard student. Pairings are made based upon shared interests and experiences, which were gleaned from a sign-up form.

More than one hundred prospective students have signed up, according to Chu. And, to his surprise, over one hundred current students have also volunteered.

“The amount of seniors that signed up to be hosts, despite the fact that they've had their last semester ripped away from them, is very heartwarming,” he said. “And I think it's a testament of the fact that people care about the school. People care about the Asian, Asian American community here and want to get back to it.”

Prospective student Corine Chung wrote in a direct message on Instagram that she appreciated the effort students put into organizing Pan-Asian Visitas.

“I love how current Harvard students are taking the initiative to reach out to the class of 2024,” Chung wrote. “I think I can speak on behalf of a lot of prospective students when I say that these student-made resources make us feel a bit more at ease about transitioning into college life, and they definitely make us feel more welcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2020 Democratic primary has largely come to a close, with former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the presumptive nominee. Still, student political groups on Harvard’s campus remain divided over whether to coalesce around Biden for the general election.
Three days after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) dropped out of the race for president, Harvard College Students for Bernie, a subgroup of the Harvard College Democrats, announced on Twitter it would not endorse Biden’s campaign.
“It must be shocking to people who outsource their thinking to the establishment, but Bernie supporters tend to have a mind of their own,” a tweet from Harvard for Bernie reads. “If Biden wants our vote, then he'll have to earn it."
The group’s action runs contrary to that of the candidate they formed to support — Sanders himself endorsed Biden on Monday. He said in a Thursday interview with the Associated Press that not voting for the former vice president would be “irresponsible” and help President Donald J. Trump win re-election.
Diego A. Garcia ’20 and Amelia M. Apgar ’20, co-founders of Harvard College Students for Biden, said they were “disappointed” to hear of Harvard for Bernie’s decision not to endorse Biden.
“[We] understand that the outcome of the primary is frustrating to the leadership of Harvard for Bernie. That said, we believe that anyone who sits this election out jeopardizes the millions of Americans who would be hurt by another four years of President Trump,” they wrote in an email.
Over the past several weeks, Harvard for Biden has hosted virtual phone banks, speaker forums, and social events, in addition to focusing more on social media, according to Garcia.
Garcia and Apgar said that the group had seen an “influx” of over sixty new members since Sanders suspended his campaign, and that they plan to emphasize some of Biden’s more liberal policies in the future, which they hoped would “pleasantly surprise” other progressives.
Harvard for Bernie’s position mirrors similar stances taken by other progressive groups, including the Democratic Socialists of America and many campus organizations across the country. In nearly identical tweets, those groups reaffirmed their refusal to endorsing Biden.
“Why is Elizabeth Warren dragging her feet to endorse? This will give us four more years of Trump,” a Tweet from Harvard for Bernie reads.
Harvard for Bernie did not respond to a request for comment.

As surveys find increasing rates of domestic violence during the COVID-19 epidemic, Harvard graduate Ashrithaa “Ashri” S. Anurudran ’19 has formed a task force focused on addressing the issue.
Anurudran said the purpose of the task force is to support those who may be in as much danger staying home as they would be going out during the pandemic — including those experiencing intimate partner violence, child abuse, and elder abuse. She decided to form the group after noticing that much of the public health advice she heard neglected this “marginalized community.”
“All the main public health advice is to stay at home,” Anurudran said. “That should be fine, but for a lot of people that could lead to potentially worse health outcomes than a virus could in some contexts.”
The task force she founded aims to accomplish three objectives: sharing resources, “turning bystanders into allies,” and appealing to policymakers. A page on the group’s website aimed at people experiencing domestic violence includes a shelter locator, hotline list, and safety planning guide.
“The main goal of the task force is advocating for survivors during this difficult time,” she said. “I see it in different ways — like, one, supporting survivors by providing a consolidated database of resources that are specific to COVID-19.”
The United Nations has reported a surge in domestic violence cases since the start of the pandemic, as vulnerable individuals are forced to remain home and healthcare providers and police are overwhelmed.
Anurudran said she has found that many people want to help prevent domestic violence, but do not necessarily know how. To address that gap, the task force she established works to draw attention to “tangible ways” for all people to get involved.
“Doing this work for so long, I realize it's such a sensitive topic, and people do care but they don't know how to be useful,” she said. “We've been reaching out to organizations, we've been asking them like, ‘How can we support you? How can students that are sitting at home support survivors?’”
“Another thing is kind of conveying the sense of urgency to policymakers and public health officials and why they need to consider this as they move forward,” she added.
One of the challenges faced by her task force has been collecting data to support calls to action.
“It's really, really hard to get data on this topic because it's so stigmatized and extremely underreported,” she said.
To combat this challenge, Anurudran said the task force has utilized data culled from Google Trends, police departments, organizations, and a citizen survey.
“We're hoping that with using these four different types of surveys, we'll be able to capture how big the burden is and also how we can help the most,” she said.
The task force also receives guidance from an advisory board composed of experts in a variety of fields. Dr. Lisa M. Bates, an assistant professor at Columbia’s School of Public Health and member of the group’s board, said she has assisted the task force in the data analysis component of their work.
“Part of what they're doing is this very proactive data aggregation approach. We're going to be advising them on analytic approaches and generating reports,” she said. “It's a really impressive aggregation of where to find help.”
Dr. Thomas F. Burke, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, also serves on the advisory board. He met Anurudran during her first year at Harvard, calling her “a force of nature.”
Burke said his experience as an emergency physician aligns well with the advocacy work of the task force.
“[As emergency physicians] we are really deeply committed to those in our society that are most vulnerable,” he said. “We really advocate for social programs that promote equity and access to health care.”
Anurudran, who graduated from Harvard with a degree in economics and global health last year, said she has always been “really interested in sexual violence prevention work.”
“Most of my work throughout college was in Kenya,” she said. “I worked on Empower to Eliminate, which is a sexual violence prevention program for 12 to 14 year old girls and boys.”
Anurudran said the task force has grown from 10 to 15 students to roughly 50 to 60 in the United States, in addition to members around the world, from the Middle East to Europe.
“It has been truly amazing to see how many people care about this issue and how students have quickly mobilized,” Anurudran said.
Paula R. A. Chappel ’20, another task force member, said she began working for the group because of a long-held interest in combatting domestic and sexual violence.
“Feeling that I was strong enough and able enough to help others, I thought that this would be a really great use of my time,” Chappel said. “Why not use the instant connection I have or the passion I have for helping other people to do this work?”
“Especially during this time, I think that helping other people is key,” she added.

Harvard COVID-19 researchers have partnered with Facebook to implement user location data in order to better inform disease forecasting models, according to an April 6 Facebook announcement.
Facebook’s Data for Good program, which offers a selection of de-identified user data to nonprofits, released a series of “Disease Prevention Maps” to researchers.
Both the maps and the data used to make the maps were shared with the COVID-19 Mobility Network, a collective of infectious disease epidemiologists at over a dozen universities, to analyze aspects of the disease.
The Harvard School of Public Health and affiliates at other Harvard graduate schools are listed as network partners on the program’s website.
The Disease Prevention Maps seek to provide new tools for visualizing probabilistic contact tracing — a common epidemiological practice for tracking the person-to-person spread of disease — and overall population movements. Some of the maps are also available online for public viewing.
Other released indicators include a “social connectedness index” to identify “friendships across states and countries” to forecast how the disease might spread next or to whom the infected might reach out for medical help.
“Mobility data from Facebook’s Data for Good program provides a near real-time view of important correlates of disease transmission,” Daniel J. Klein of the Institute for Disease Modeling said in the Facebook press release. “This data, in combination with other sources, allows us to make better models to inform public health decisions.”
School of Public Health Professor of Epidemiology Caroline O. Buckee emphasized the importance of timeliness when creating these models.
“Measuring the impact of social distancing policies is absolutely critical at this stage,” Buckee, who also co-leads the COVID-19 Mobility Network, said in the Facebook announcement. “Aggregated data of this kind provides insights that protect individual privacy but are actionable for policymakers and researchers building predictive models.”
Researchers across the country are using de-identified health and medical data to analyze COVID-19 characteristics.
On Thursday, the Broad Institute announced a consortium alongside Partners HealthCare, Biogen, and Boston hospitals to create a “COVID-19 biobank” of patient data to study coronavirus symptomology.
Eric S. Lander, the president and founding director of the Broad Institute, spoke about the benefits and importance of data collection in combating COVID-19 in a press release published on the institute’s website.
“Patients who have volunteered to donate data to accelerate the shared understanding of the disease play a crucial role in the global effort to overcome COVID-19,” he said. “Through a shared biobank, researchers will be able to identify new patterns and drastically expand our knowledge of a disease.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus pandemic devastates the global economy, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister said in a Thursday interview that administrators will seek to balance the University’s long-term financial welfare with its need for immediate financial support when utilizing the school’s endowment.
As of June 2019, the endowment was valued at $40.9 billion. Hollister noted Thursday that its value has likely declined “substantially” as the stock market reels from shuttered businesses and record unemployment.
Hollister cited an estimate published last month in the Harvard Magazine that put the value of the school endowment’s in the “mid-30 billion range,” and called it “one reference,” but declined to specify the current value of the endowment.
“I'm not going to estimate because it's difficult, mid-quarter to know,” Hollister said. “And the endowment is not made up just of stocks. It also has bonds and other asset classes, and it just would be inaccurate or almost irresponsible to conjecture exactly where it might be.”
A hit to the endowment will have a tangible impact on University operations, Hollister said.
“The endowment is very actively used,” he said. “It's the largest source of revenue for the University, and every penny that can be distributed and used for annual operations is so distributed. Harvard aims — similar to other universities and colleges — to distribute about 5 percent of the market value of the endowment every year.”
Likewise, a contraction in the endowment correlates to less funds to distribute across the University, Hollister said.
In an email to affiliates on Monday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that they would “distribute as much from the endowment as we responsibly can.”
Hollister declined on Thursday to specify what a “responsible” amount entails.
“That's to be determined. The distribution for this current fiscal year, which ends in June, that decision was made some time ago,” Hollister said. “So the challenge will be in the next fiscal year and the fiscal year after that and the fiscal year after that.”
“But the backdrop issue is that if the endowment has lost value, it makes it very difficult, obviously, to increase,” he added.
Hollister said that there are other “limitations” to drawing funds from the endowment. The first limitation is the make-up of the endowment, which consists of over 13,000 separate funds.
“Each is an underlying legal contract with the donor to use the money as the donor requires, and so it's restricted,” Hollister said. “There's a lot less flexibility in the use than people imagine.”
The second limitation is the need to generate future endowment returns.
“The money was given to the university for future generations, and not just the current generation,” Hollister said. “Consequently, what we try to do is spend roughly 5 percent a year, because the rest of it hopefully is earning returns to be available for future generations.”
Hollister said past generations of Harvard affiliates used the endowment sparingly in times of crisis, citing the World Wars, the mid-1970s, and Great Recession in 2008.
“In past downturns, previous generations have lived with hardships and adversity to protect the endowment so that it's available for today's students,” Hollister said. “To honor that tradition, Harvard — consistent with the donors’ terms and with that fiduciary responsibilities — needs to protect some of it for future generations. You can't take it all and spend it now because it's restricted as to purpose and restricted as to when it can be used.”
Despite having the largest endowment in the nation, Hollister cautioned that the University’s wealth is limited.
“Maybe there was a time when Harvard had unlimited wealth but it is not true today,” Hollister said. “Harvard is in the well-resourced category of universities, but if you actually divide the Harvard endowment per student or per faculty member, there are wealthier institutions in the country.”
Hollister said that shrinking revenues would make it difficult for the school to operate, pointing to “key things at Harvard” like undergraduate financial aid that are not entirely endowed.
“If our revenues shrink, and the endowment shrinks, it becomes very challenging for Harvard,” Hollister said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin last week advocating for support for Native American tribes facing economic hardship in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
The team of four researchers — affiliates of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development — argued the public health crisis directly threatens nearly three decades of steady economic development for the tribes.
They wrote that of the hundreds of self-governing tribes in the United States, they are unaware of any tribal gaming enterprises — primarily casinos — that have not shut down amid the pandemic.
Kennedy School emeritus professor Joseph P. Kalt — a letter co-signer who co-founded HPAIED in 1987 — said tribal governments are “tremendously dependent” on revenues from these enterprises.
The results of the researchers’ preliminary economic analysis, which were included in the letter, indicate that tribal governments stand to lose $12.5 billion in revenues, in addition to the social and cultural losses borne by economically diminished tribes.
Kalt repeatedly compared tribal governments to local and state governments that provide a slew of essential services for their citizens. The Navajo Nation — spanning over 17 million acres in the Southwest — is home to roughly 330,000 residents and is about the size of West Virginia by area.
Yet tribal governments like the Navajo Nation lack traditional state and local tax bases. Instead, they are funded almost entirely by tribe-run gaming and non-gaming enterprises, like tourism and manufacturing. With casinos closed and customers few and far between, tribal governments — which run more than half of healthcare facilities within their borders, according to Kalt — may not have resources to adequately respond to the COVID-19 crisis.
Before the pandemic, tribal economies were experiencing long-run growth, despite pockets of enduring poverty. They began to gradually blossom decades ago after the federal government took steps to enable self-governance and self-determination.
But the pandemic may upend that progress. As tribal governments lose revenues, the letter co-signers argue, the tribes could collectively lose more than $127 billion in annual spending on goods and services, 1.1 million jobs, and $49.5 billion in wages and benefits for workers.
Kalt said their analyses also considered spillover effects on non-native populations, as tribal enterprises can economically boost neighboring towns. The researchers found that non-Native Americans will actually face the brunt of tribal decline — 70 percent of the total losses.
HPAIED Research Director and letter co-signer Miriam R. Jorgensen wrote in an emailed statement that “devastated” tribal governments need federal assistance.
“Stimulate monies from the federal government help their economies stay afloat,” she wrote.
Kalt and Jorgensen both stressed that tribal governments must retain autonomy over emergency relief funds, such as those provided by the CARES Act signed into federal law on March 27.
“We think it would be very inappropriate for the federal government to put a lot of strings on how tribal governments spend their CARES Act monies,” Kalt said. “Tribes have proven that, on average, they’re much better at making those calls about how to allocate resources.”
Though Mnuchin’s office has received their letter, Kalt said, the researchers have not received a response.
In addition to federal advocacy, HPAIED assembled an online resource toolbox for tribal leaders struggling to adapt to the pandemic.
Kalt said the team plans to conduct further economic modeling in the coming weeks and release a final report. Despite the plight, the researchers say they remain hopeful. Kalt said tribal officials were “extremely grateful” for their letter.
“American Indian nations are resilient. If they were not, they wouldn’t be here 500 years after the colonization project began in North America,” Jorgensen wrote. “They have survived pandemics before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a change of course, former Harvard basketball star Katie Benzan ‘20 will finish her collegiate basketball career at the University of Maryland as a graduate transfer next season. She had previously stated she would use her remaining eligibility at the University of Texas at Austin.
Benzan, who led Harvard in points and assists during her three seasons on the team, sat out her senior year for the Crimson to preserve a season of NCAA eligibility. In October, Benzan announced that she would suit up for the Texas Longhorns as a graduate transfer for the 2020-2021 academic year.
Since then, Benzan wrote in a message to The Crimson on Wednesday that she reconsidered her decision after learning at the beginning of the month that Texas would undergo a turnover in head coaches. Benzan added that she had previously been “extremely torn” between joining Texas or Maryland’s program.
Last week, Benzan called Maryland’s head coach Brenda Frese to tell her that she wanted to finish out her NCAA career in College Park, Md.
“Maryland has a competitive and winning culture and tradition. Starting with Coach Frese, the coaching staff and the players embody that love and passion for basketball,” Benzan wrote. “I am extremely excited to play for her and to be a part of the Maryland Terrapins women’s basketball program.”
Maryland, a member of the Big Ten conference, has a history of winning. The team has clinched a birth in the NCAA Tournament for the past ten consecutive years, and it is the defending conference champion.
Benzan will bring much-needed experience to the Terrapin program, though. The team saw three of its players enter the transfer portal this month and will likely not welcome back any returning full-time starters.
Frese told The Washington Post earlier this week that she expects Benzan to assume a leadership role on the team next season as both a scorer and facilitator.
“Katie is a proven winner and possesses all the leadership qualities you would want on your team,” Frese said. “She is extremely versatile in her skill set with her ability to knock down an open three and she can utilize her basketball IQ to make a play for her teammates, can rebound and get to the free-throw line.”
In just three seasons at Harvard, Benzan eclipsed the previous program record for three-pointers made, notching 287 shots from behind the arc for the Crimson. Harvard came in third place in the Ivy League during Benzan’s three seasons on the team, finishing behind Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania each season.
Benzan’s departure from the Crimson left the team without a traditional point guard this season. Though several players stepped up to try to fill the role, Harvard finished fifth in the Ivy League — its worst performance in the 21st century to date.
Benzan, who will graduate from Harvard in May with a degree in Psychology, wrote that she plans to pursue a graduate program in either criminal justice or clinical psychology at Maryland.
Basketball may take Benzan, a native of Cambridge, Mass., further than College Park. She wrote she is interested in playing professionally in the United States or overseas after she finishes up her season with the Terrapins.

Just like every other Harvard student, you probably love to hate on the food in the dining halls. And we don’t blame you — it’s pretty easy to complain about HUDS’s beef stroganoff, seitan, and lack of on-brand cereal. But admit it: A few weeks away from campus, and even you are missing some of Harvard’s most iconic meals. We’re here to remind you what you have to look forward to dining-wise when we all get back to Cambridge.
Tomato Basil Raviolini Soup
Okay, we didn’t do a survey or anything, but it’s fair to say that everyone loves this iconic HUDS soup. It’s the basic, classic tomato soup, but better. You probably didn’t even know what raviolini was before getting to Harvard. But now, you know it’s that really tiny pasta that floats in your favorite soup every week.
Garlic Bread + Chicken/Eggplant Parmesan
It seems that HUDS consistently scores with Italian food. The nightly garlic bread, especially paired with the occasional chicken parmesan (eggplant parmesan for our vegetarian friends) is a fan favorite! Admit it, you’ll probably go to bed tonight thinking about how much you miss this crispy, cheesy perfection.
Brunch
Harvard Sunday brunch is one-of-a-kind and deserves a category of its own. From broccoli stuffed chicken breasts to bagel sandwiches to Veritaffles, Sunday brunch is the perfect combination of all our favorite foods from breakfast and lunch. Think about it: In what other context would it be acceptable to eat cereal and salad in the same meal?
Sweet Potato Fries
Sweet. Potato. Fries. That pretty much covers it. Definitely the ultimate dhall food, HUDS sweet potato fries are probably the sole cause of the freshman 15. Don’t try to deny it. We know that if it’s sweet potato fries day, you’re grabbing a second plate at lunch. When something is that good, one serving just isn’t enough.
Dessert
Dessert may not qualify as a meal, but that doesn’t make it any less special. Walking into the dhall for dinner, you can confidently expect some kind of baked-to-perfection dessert waiting for you. Whether it’s tiramisu, Mississippi Mud squares, or a Sunday Sundae, HUDS has always got your back when it comes to sweet treats.
It’s the ultimate paradox of being a college student: you miss the food at home when you’re at Harvard, but you secretly miss the dhall when you’re home. Enjoy your meals away from the dhall for the next few weeks, but remember everything you have to look forward to when we eventually return to campus!

Love it — Hannah J. Humes 
While we all hate midterms in general, timed midterms are the best way to go when taking midterms online. There are a lot of benefits to having your midterm timed and therefore over and done with.
1. Fairness
Let’s be real — in any class, there will probably be people who cheat on take-home midterms. But for those of us who are upstanding moral students (or just too afraid of authority to cheat), having the midterm timed limits how much those who cheat can ruin the curve.
2. More Time = Higher Expectations
Taking a midterm with unlimited time means you can spend as long as you want on it. This likely means more work (ugh). Plus, everyone else is likely to do better with more time, which means you have to as well. Untimed midterms don’t actually take that pressure off; they add to it.
3. Done and Done
If the midterm is due in over a week, you then have a week to stress over it, go over each of your answers, and just generally doubt yourself. If you have 75 minutes, you have to just get it over with and then ignore it until your grade comes back (or never look at your grade and live in denial).
4. Procrastination
The temptation for procrastination has never been higher. Personally, if I open up a test and don’t know the answer, I’m more likely to keep putting it off if I have seemingly unlimited time. You can’t do that if your test shuts down once time is up. Also, having a limited amount of time means you may actually have to study — which will help you learn, while looking up test answers won’t.
Timed tests take the stress off — unless you are one of the people who cheat. Hopefully, now you have some good reasons to enjoy your classes that still give you this type of assessment.
Hate it — Claire J. Hoffman
In the time of Zoom University, take-home exams are more relevant than ever. Some professors are getting rid of exams altogether because #SEMUEM, but some are still making us take exams. To that, I say: Please give us an extended or untimed period of time to take your test.
Let’s think about this here. Overall, I am stressed. This is not new. But, I would so much rather spend time on my own taking an exam then trying to block out a period to take it in one sitting. Sure, I might get the test done faster that way, but is it worth the spike in my anxiety levels? No way in hell. Imagine how nice it would be to be able to do a first work-through of the test, get a snack and think about it, work on it again, exercise and think about it, work on it again, think about it in the shower — you get the idea. Not only is it less stressful, but you end up doing a better job understanding the material this way, instead of trying to cram it all into your head for a two-hour test.
All this is really to say that I’d rather avoid the panic that comes along with a timed test, even if I’m taking it from my dorm/house. Give me the leisurely longer version any day.
