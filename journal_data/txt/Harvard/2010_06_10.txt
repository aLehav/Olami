After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The bursting of bubbles is caused by the dissipation of a larger bubble into smaller ones—a finding with larger implications for current understanding of aerosols, according to a recent study at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
SEAS graduate student James C. Bird, who led the study, found that the forces acting on a bubble cause the film to fold into itself and form a donut-shaped pocket of air. Then, the surface tension breaks the "torus of air" into a ring of smaller bubbles, Bird wrote in a press release.
The study's findings may modify existing conceptions of bubble-mediated aerosols that could have far-reaching consequences on health and climate research.
Prior to the recent study, scientists did not believe that bubbles larger than several millimeters produce tiny air-bound droplets when popped. Prevailing assumptions about the lack of aerosols created by larger bubbles downplayed the level to which bubbles might carry infectious diseases from sources of illness or contribute to the saline level in the air from ocean water.
The research team, which used high-speed cameras to document the rapid rupturing process, determined that its conclusions on the cascading effects of a popped bubble remain constant over different materials. Even bubbles from viscous liquids, such as oil, followed the same two-step procedure of rupturing.
The study's results will be published in Thursday's issue of Nature magazine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though most students have long since left Cambridge for home, one Harvard runner is beginning her summer vacation in a very different way.
A native of St. Paul, Minnesota, junior distance runner Claire Richardson is currently in Eugene, Ore., where she awaits the start of her 5,000-meter race in the finals of the NCAA national championships tomorrow.
On May 29, Richardson qualified for the national finals, placing 9th in the 5k at the NCAA regional championship meet. Her qualifying time of 16:31.83 is the third fastest in Harvard track and field history.
Richardson was one of three Crimson athletes present at the regional championships held at North Carolina A&T. The other two Harvard runners, freshman Carlyle Davis and senior Chas Gillespie, narrowly missed national qualification. Davis was ousted in the national quarterfinals, after running an impressive time of 2:07.37 in the 800, good for 16th place in the opening round of the event. Gillespie missed national championship qualification by a mere 5 spots, as he placed 17th in the national semifinals of the 5,000-meter run with a time of 14:16.68.
The 2010 NCAA Track and Field Championships are taking place June 9-12, and Richardson’s NCAA Championship race is scheduled for tomorrow evening at 6:40pm PDT. Live results for the 5k and all other championship races can be found here: http://www.flashresults.com/2010_Meets/outdoor/NCAA/.
