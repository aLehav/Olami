The first 20-odd seconds of John Maloof and Charlie Siskel’s “Finding Vivian Maier” feature a number of middle-aged and elderly interviewees in their homes staring bemusedly into the camera. The question that caused such a reaction:  “What would Vivian Maier think about all this?” The eventual flurry of contradictory responses (“She would have loved it,” “She would have never let it happen”) establish a confusion that pervades the entirety of the documentary. Siskel and Maloof brilliantly capture a woman who, even after the film meant to illuminate her life, remains remarkably nebulous. The directors embrace all of her battling identities and are impressively unbiased in their portrayal. They let the fascinating story compel the viewer and only flex their stylistic muscles on occasion (even if the flamboyant beginning indicates otherwise). The only weakness in the piece is its focus on the present—Maloof, who discovered Maier, spends too much time talking to the camera and showcasing his role in Maier’s rise. That being said, he and Siskel imbue “Finding Vivian Maier” with a stripped-down aesthetic that allows the dynamism of its protagonist to shine through.
Maier, who spent countless hours finding the right shot and mounting paper, never made any effort to have her photographs displayed. Her personal life is just as odd: a nanny throughout her life, she comes off as both a loving caregiver and an abusive and borderline evil demagogue. Born in New York, she fashioned a fake French accent and played up her false foreign birth. She was a compulsive hoarder, who collected so many newspapers that the floors of her rooms would droop. Seemingly asexual, she often recoiled when men attempted to touch her. Maloof and several of his interviewees suggest that Maier’s oddities point to some sort of undefined underlying abuse. Maloof acknowledges and discusses at length the potential ramifications of his discovery and further probing into Maier’s life. Maloof’s choice to examine the ethics of his pursuit lends the film a sense of subjectivity and transparency that is usually lacking in historical documentaries. The film is both about Maier and about how to present her, which allows it to entirely avoid any Ken Burns dryness and ask important questions about the cynicism of post-mortem examinations.
Maloof is a moral if not especially captivating narrator. His insights about history are on point but are muted by his lack of emotional presence. He discusses his auction-house discovery of the negatives (the initial set of which he bought for a paltry $380), his increasing obsession with their worth, and his eventual decision to devote himself to their restoration and Maier’s reputation. He captures much of this process on film and narrates the entire movie. While a full-blown biographical sketch would have been a completely inappropriate digression, a further exploration of Maloof’s background would have given his search much more gravity. It’s clear that he cares a lot about Maier’s work and story, but his dogged pursuit of information appears almost robotic. Perhaps a Michael Moore-like confrontation with an interviewee could have spiced things up, though likely to tacky results. There is no clear solution to Maloof’s unsatisfying persona—he is a fundamental part of the story, after all. His choice to remain a relatively anonymous chronicler, while probably the classiest way to keep the spotlight on Maier, still fosters an unfortunately detached tone. 
This distance is never clearer than when Maloof describes Maier’s journey towards artistic recognition. He peppers anecdotes by those who knew Maier—almost exclusively the parents and children whom she nannied for—with information about exhibitions, viral social media conflagrations, and new techniques for developing her portraits. Famed experts like Joel Meyerowitz and Mary Ellen Mark offer lofty comparisons of Maier to the legends of 20th-century photographers. These scenes appear slightly defensive, almost as if they are a justification of the film’s existence as opposed to a legitimate discussion about the best way forward with Maier’s work and her place in the photographical canon.
The work and biography is presented so intricately, however, that it mostly drowns out the inconsistency and self-aggrandizement of the present-day discussion. The photos, which are shown liberally, are often beautiful and grotesque. Typically focusing on urban street life and practices, they show everything ranging from desperate drunks to lascivious couples. Maier’s distinctive Rolleiflex camera, which shot facing upwards to create a certain hugeness in the subject, is mesmerizing. Maloof and Siskel’s research is so extensive that they often have the backstory behind particular shots. An especially fascinating tale comes in the form of a child who was taken to the stockyards for a shoot with Maier and had her first confrontation with death. The loss of innocence present in many of the recollections drives home the central point of Maier’s layered past: the macabre is never far from the gorgeous.

After several decades of irony as the dominant tone of artistic and social discourse, there has recently been a swelling movement towards what has been branded “the New Sincerity,” a misplaced effort to return to the cultural womb where genuineness is elevated above all other aesthetic qualities. While the tyranny of immature irony is not edifying, the opposite is no more welcome. The New Sincerity is responsible for Bronies, for “Bound 2,” and for 30-year-olds who watch “Adventure Time”; as a result, it deserves a certain circumspection.
 The film “Heaven Is for Real” fits this ethos to a tee, with the unwelcome addition of a naive version of American folk religion. The blithely agrammatical title says it all: an unhappy marriage of glorified childhood with a dull, simplistic, yet insistent Christianity. Most ominously of all, it is prefaced with words that strike dread into every critic: “based on a true story.” It is unclear why director Randall Wallace, who had previously been associated with moderately successful projects like “Braveheart” (as writer) and 1998’s “The Man in the Iron Mask” (as director), has abandoned himself to such drivel; whatever the case, the harm done to his career by “Heaven Is for Real” should be irreparable, and justly so. 
 The premise is so saccharine that only the harshest satire could have extracted anything artistically worthwhile from it; any film that tried to work with it seriously was doomed to ignominious failure from inception. Greg Kinnear plays Todd Burpo, the saintly fireman-wrestling-coach-garage-door-repairman-pastor of a small town in Nebraska. His wife, Sonja (Kelly Reilly), is a housewife who gives music lessons to the choir on Monday nights. His four-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) is predictable in his lack of complexity and his cloying sweetness—he insists on accompanying his father on a hospital visit, saying “If I’m with you, I won’t be afraid.” Of course, all is not well in the house of Burpo: Todd has fallen behind on paying the bills, and Colton is struck down with a sudden case of appendicitis. Colton later claims to have visited heaven while undergoing the operation. When the story gets out, disbelief and frustration ensue.
 Perhaps the greatest sin of the screenplay is not its leaden dialogue, predictable stock characters, or shameless emotional pandering. It is rather the inescapable fact that it is profoundly, heart-stoppingly boring. The 100-minute playing time drags; sadly, there is not enough real dramatic conflict in the plot to fill even this relatively short space.
 The cinematography is as clumsy as the screenplay. The inevitable sweeping vistas of green Nebraska fields with the equally inevitable obnoxious lens flare are the characteristic item in the film’s visual vocabulary. This Instagram aesthetic is supported on the one hand by awkward framing, and on the other by CGI shots of Colton’s vision of heaven that are so ludicrous and so cripplingly garish that they put Kanye West’s video production skills to shame.
 Ultimately, however, it is the shallowness of the message that destroys whatever chance the film has at any meaningful artistic merit. The dramatic climax, a disappointingly jejune sermon that Todd delivers before his congregation, affirms (without justification) the validity of Colton’s vision while at the same time dismissing the unpleasant but compelling concepts that provide any sort of stakes in the gamble of Christianity: the twin possibilities of Hell versus ultimate meaninglessness. “Heaven Is for Real” is religious pornography: the objects and actions presented are all aimed to please, and there are no real conceptual consequences to any of them.
David Byrne prophesied the rise of New Sincerity in the 1980s during the production of the film “True Stories”: “For years we have been taught not to like things. Finally somebody said it was OK to like things. This was a great relief. It was getting hard to go around not liking everything.” This statement is an insightful criticism of the artistic trends of the 20th century. Some things, however, should never be liked, genuine or not, and “Heaven Is for Real” falls solidly into this category. Heaven may or may not be real, but this film’s execrable quality is certain.

“When you hear a band playing soul music, you just come alive,” Rachel S. Horn ’14 says. As bandleader and saxophone player for The Intrinsics, a Harvard soul-funk band, Horn identifies the genre as a significant part of her life—a sentiment many of the other band members share. Founded this year, The Intrinsics evolved out of The Nostalgics, a student band that played for three years until a majority of their members graduated last year. Horn, a former member of The Nostalgics, teamed up with Intrinsics co-bandleader Ethan I. Simon ’16 to continue the legacy. “Everybody wanted to keep soul music alive on campus,” Horn says. “So this year I decided to join up with Ethan and make this happen.” 
 
Composed of ten band members, The Intrinsics combine vocalists, horns, percussion, and strings to produce an energetic, buoyant sound. The band covers a wide range of musical legends, including Sam & Dave, Michael Jackson, Eddie Floyd, and Prince, as well as contemporary artists like Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars, but always in their signature soulful style. Soul is far from a traditional college band genre, but it is precisely this rarity that helps The Intrinsics stand out. “There’s certain levity to [soul] music,” Simon says. “The typical college campus has all these musical acts…but the niche that isn’t filled is…soul.” Baritone saxophone player John B. Tournas ’16 agrees: “[College campuses have] mostly rock bands, but you can’t really beat music that is engineered to dance.”
 
The band’s large scale does present challenges. For a genre replete with improvisational embellishments and auxiliary sounds, orchestrating the instruments to create the right sonic qualities becomes more difficult. “For the kind of music we play, the tempo has to be just right to make the music gel,” vocalist Nadia L. Urrea ’17 says. According to Horn, it is also logistically difficult to fit everyone’s schedules together; gigs for which all of the band members are available are few and far between. Simon adds that a large group requires a more controlled approach from the bandleaders, which sometimes takes away from the autonomy found in smaller bands. Regardless, for the members of The Intrinsics, the results more than make up for any challenges. “We have a lot of different perspectives, and we get a great sound,” Horn says. Urrea agrees: “We have a lot of instrumentation, but it creates this brassy, festival, party sound that’s really exciting.”
 
When asked about their favorite gig in the band’s short history, most members of the group point to their performance at this year’s Hootfest, the pre-Yardfest party thrown by The Owl. “It was the band’s best gig musically, and it was the best crowd we played for,” singer and trombonist Jeremy S. Sabath ’16  says. “It was beautiful out, so everybody was having a great time—people dancing, people singing, people chanting, people jumping up and down…. What really makes a gig come alive is when the musicians and the crowd are part of the whole performance.”
As the academic year comes to a close, Horn, who will be graduating, expresses excitement for the future of The Intrinsics. “[The other members have] got a good two years in them,” she says, referencing the fact that most of the band’s members are still underclassmen. “People are starting to recognize our name, and that opens up a huge amount of possibilities.” Urrea hopes to start picking up gigs outside of the Harvard bubble and expand the group’s audience base. Sabath agrees: “The band has a lot of potential to make some noise, literally and figuratively.”

Lana Del Rey has managed to merge her forlorn aesthetic with that of surf music in her new single “West Coast.” With notably fewer production details than most of her previous work, the stripped-down track relies heavily on an elegantly manipulated soundscape to create a mesmerizing effect.
Though the chorus does not necessarily feel any bigger than the verses, it features a slowed tempo that amplifies the trademark seductive quality of Lana Del Rey’s voice. Regrettably, once the initial shock of the pop song’s tempo change wears off, the chorus is otherwise musically lackluster. While the lyrics can be difficult to make out in their entirety because of Lana Del Rey’s layered, whispered vocals, they are not completely meaningless, with distant yet emotive lines like “I can see my baby swinging; / his Parliament’s on fire, and his hands are up.”
Nearly all of the vocals are accompanied by simple instrumentation that comprises drums and guitars, reminiscent of a sedated surf-rock jam. In her signature fashion, Lana Del Rey sings, “Down on the West Coast, they’ve got their icons, / their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons,” showing that her thematic content persists even in the wake of her new sound. The arrangement becomes more curious when the addition of a synth that is distinctly reminiscent of a theremin (probably a nod to the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations”) pushes the track to an enchantingly peculiar place.
Of course, the dysfunctional relationships, bad boys, and air of sadness are probably all here to stay, but it does seem like Lana Del Rey is branching out technically. If “West Coast” is any indication, her upcoming album, “Ultraviolence,” promises to be more musically intriguing and subtly referential than “Born to Die.”
“Ultraviolence” has no official release date but is rumored to be out May 1 via Interscope.

Quite a bit has transpired since Kelis’s milkshakes brought the boys to the yard back in 2003. She’s released three more LPs, married and divorced hip-hop legend Nas, earned a culinary degree from Le Cordon Bleu culinary school, and starred in a cooking/reality TV show on The Cooking Channel. Yet all of this has happened without her achieving the level of pop stardom that her innuendo-laden crossover hit suggested she could and would. Though its hook infiltrated the cultural lexicon as soon as it was purred, “Milkshake” achieved millennial timelessness while leaving behind the name of the R&B songstress who served it up. As a result, the last 11 years have largely seen Kelis floating in and out of sonic universes, traversing not only her signature Neptunes-produced neo-soul but also club hip-hop, futuristic pop, and funk. Her lack of mainstream success has allowed her to be a musical chameleon, and with her artistic freedom she’s produced some very successful oddball offerings (2010’s “Flesh Tone”), but also some less cohesive stylistic mishmashes (2006’s “Kelis Was Here”). Fans of both albums, however, should find something tasty to nibble on in her newest, “Food.” Though its retro-leaning soul isn’t the bump-and-grinding Kelis of her earliest days, nor the genre-navigating aficionado of her middle career, “Food” is an album that is thoroughly Kelis from the first bite to the last.
Above all else, to be Kelis is to be completely modern. So when the album introduces “Breakfast,” a mid-tempo banger with its roots firmly entrenched in Motown soul, the listener need not be surprised when Kelis adds a dash of the 21st century, cheekily telling her lover that “maybe we’ll make it to breakfast.” In a similarly au courant manner, “Floyd” sees the newly single music-maker letting off some steam over the state of the dating scene, admitting that, “Sure I’m self-sufficient, blah blah, independent, / truthfully I got some space I want that man to fill it.” The song proceeds in this manner, with her listing her specific desires in a mate (though she “don’t do long distance”), before it opens up to an airy dreamland of a hook in which the underwhelmed Kelis, suspended in harmony, confesses, “I want to be blown away.” If “Floyd” is her searching, “Friday Fish Fry” finds her discovering exactly what she wants. Clad in an uncharacteristic southern twang, the earworm barnburner features Kelis locked in a call-and-response with a hunky-sounding male section over the euphemistic “ice cold water” that she desires.
Therein, however, lies most of the album’s weakness. Though steeped in smart, often blunt lyricism and that trademark nerve that by itself may account for Kelis’s relegation to the fringes of stardom, “Friday Fish Fry” feels a tad out of place. It’s a milder example of what the likes of “Bless the Telephone” with its folksy-pop duet and “Hooch” with its big brass bravado exemplify. Though both are quite accomplished tracks when considered individually, in the greater context of the retro-soul selection of “Food” that Kelis has served up, they confuse the sonic palette.
It’s a minor problem to have, one that can be almost completely forgiven in the light of the cohesion that marks the rest of the album. Hiccups aside, Kelis largely stays within the lines that she’s drawn for herself. And that includes singing the majority of the album in her sweet-spot five-note radius. That may sound like a dig, but it really isn’t. Her raspy croon, wrapped in the smokiness of Amy Winehouse but lacking the complete power thereof, is an aspect of her sound that, unlike many others, Kelis honed and perfected early on. She even cleverly acknowledges its limitations on “Cobbler,” teasing that her lover “makes me hit notes that I never sing.” The song reaches some pretty high territory, but Kelis taps out early, leaving backup singers to tackle the really lofty stuff. It’s for that reason that she should have thought better of “Change,” an otherwise decent track that sees her lingering for a smidgen too long in vocal regions just out of her comfort zone.
For every slight misstep like “Change,” there are far more instantly catchy and successful retro-soul servings like “Jerk Ribs” and smooth midnight snack tidbits like “Runnin’.” “Food” does not, however, come with anything even resembling an immediate calling card like “Milkshake,” and those few who are still holding out for a refill of that brand of Kelis had best push away from the table. And to be sure, there’s absolutely no shame in seeing them go. It means only more space left for the rest of us (along with the new fans this record will surely entice) to enjoy the hardy, experimental, rib-sticking fare with which Kelis is tearing up the kitchen.

 Professor Diana L. Eck stands in front of an ornate trousseau chest in the living room of her home, the Lowell House Masters’ residence. “About six years ago, when they were renovating Baker Library over at the Business School, it had sat on one of the grand staircases, I guess. The renovation took place during the summer, and I was home, and they emailed all the House Masters, saying, ‘Does anyone have room for a big chest?’ And I emailed right back and said, ‘How big?’”
The chest, which is covered in wood carvings depicting ships and kneeling angels, is large and deep, with an open space partially filled with books about religion and back issues of The Chronicle of Higher Education. “And I said, ‘Sure, we’d love to have it––I’ll be right over in my van.’ And it’s so huge and heavy that there’s no way I could get it in the back of my Odyssey van.” The chest did make it back, however, and now sits in the corner of a room filled with other pieces of antique furniture, oil paintings, and objects Eck brought back from trips to India.
While it is uncommon for House Masters to acquire Harvard artifacts in this way––Eck says this has happened once in her entire tenure––the story of how the chest was acquired betrays the agency the House Masters have in the ongoing relationship between a House and its artifacts. As we talked to the Masters of Cabot, Pforzheimer, and Lowell, it became clear that the House Master role can be as different as the Masters themselves. However, a common ground among all of them is the position the House Masters fill as the keepers of the Houses’ traditions and history.
HOUSE FIXTURES
While House communities might feel permanent––a static landscape we enter into as sophomores and depart from as seniors––they are, like Harvard itself, continually evolving. One of the greatest spurs of this evolution is changes in House Masters. Along with her husband, Dr. John R. Durant, and their nine-year-old son, Jamie, History of Science professor Anne Harrington ’82 is just about to complete her first academic year living in the squat, modern Pforzheimer Masters’ residence. “We’re pretty new,” Harrington explains several times as we walk through Pfoho’s many different rooms, though the friendly, familiar interactions between her and the various Pfoho students we encounter hardly betrays this newness. 
In contrast, Eck and Reverend Dorothy A. Austin have served as Lowell’s House Masters for almost 16 years. For several generations of Harvard students, Lowell’s identity has been completely intertwined with the elegant pair of women who preside over its community. “Being House Master is in part being a curator of the history and tradition of the House, but also an innovator,” Eck tells us, standing in one of the many stately rooms within the red brick, ivy-covered Lowell Masters’ residence.
Eck is clearly enthusiastic about embodying this role of House curator, proudly showing us the 20-page booklet she produced entitled “Hanging around Lowell House,” which explains the life stories behind the many portraits adorning Lowell’s walls. Talking to Eck and Harrington respectively, it becomes clear that this intimate knowledge of the House’s multifarious artifacts is something that grows and accumulates over time. “There might be treasures no one has told us about,” Harrington says. “But I don’t think we have any.”
Future dean of Harvard College Professor Rakesh Khurana and his wife, Stephanie R. Khurana, fall comfortably in the middle of this process. With nearly four years as Cabot House Masters under their belts, the two are simultaneously full of stories of Radcliffe and its history and eager to learn and acquire more.
“For whatever reason, in the process of merging between Harvard and Radcliffe, I think a really important part of the history of Radcliffe was lost,” says Rakesh Khurana, who will take over as dean of Harvard College in July. Part of both his and his wife’s project as House Masters has been to revive that history by collecting photographs, taking Radcliffe yearbooks out of Schlesinger Library, and, in the future dean’s case, spending hours on eBay trying to track down various old Radcliffe artifacts. The Khuranas seem to have a sense of their role as caretakers for these artifacts, be they handed down or reclaimed. “Part of it is somebody took the care to preserve it, and somebody took the care to donate it, and somebody took the care to make sure it got passed on, so you feel this responsibility to care for it,” Rakesh Khurana says.
KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
 
Along with preserving and curating the history and culture of the Houses, Masters must also oversee the renovations necessary to keep House life vibrant and relevant to contemporary student life. Yet while certain levels of renovation will always be necessary, the extent and manner to which this is approached is often at the Masters’ discretion. 
 Discussing renovations to Bertram Hall and Briggs Common Room, the Khuranas explain that they use old photographs of what these spaces looked like in Radcliffe days as inspiration for the remodelling process. “It’s the idea that drawing on the richness of the past is a strong foundation,” Stephanie Khurana explains, adding that she believes in “learning from the past and seeing what’s valuable in a very open and transparent way.”
However, the principle of “seeing what’s valuable” must, in turn, involve distinguishing this value from what is not valuable and being ready to know when to let things go. In contrast with much of Pfoho, the Radcliffe Parlor Room in Holmes Hall––a large, well-lit room with antique furniture placed sparsely in an arrangement that seems to invite a rather stiff form of socializing––has hardly changed at all since the 1950s. “This room probably has much the same feel as when the Radcliffe girls were here,” Harrington says. The room is conspicuously empty, and as a result has a slightly eerie, forgotten atmosphere. “I think it’s a bit on the down and out,” Harrington comments. “We’re actually about to renovate it because I think it’s a little bit sad.”
Yet with renovation comes loss, and negotiating the the inevitability of this loss is not always easy. Walking into Lowell’s Junior Common Room, the first thing that stands out is the room’s vivid historic wallpaper, which depicts scenes from early American history, including George Washington crossing the Delaware. The wallpaper has been in Lowell since 1930. “People say, ‘Why don’t you paint over it and put some student artwork up?’” she [WHO] says. “But really the only other place you’ll see this is in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.”
The danger of losing this sense of history is especially great in spaces that were formerly part of Radcliffe. The cold, grey, tunnel-like hallways of Pfoho’s basement do not at first appear likely to hold much historical significance. Yet Harrington has taken us down here for a reason. She pushes back a door inscribed with the words “On Harvard Time” to reveal a large, dusty room framed by shelves heaving with cascading books. Rows of studio lights hang from the ceiling, and the windows are covered with blackout blinds; the room is poised for filming.


Yet years before this room served as the “On Harvard Time” studio, it was the home of the Harvard-Radcliffe Film Workshop. The workshop, which ran for a two-year period in the mid-1970s, was created by Bob Doyle, then a research fellow in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department. “You can see multiple layers of history here,” Harrington explains. “In the ’60s, it was the Moors Music Library, and it was full of records.” We walk through the room, and Harrington points out a set of sound booths built into the wall. “Back in the day, people would go in there with their records and listen with headphones for the music classes they were taking.” The image this conjures––of a much slower-paced, deliberate way of studying––contrasts sharply with the the current reality of rows of students glued to their laptops in Lamont.
Looking up at the lights hanging from the ceiling, Harrington remarks, “These are artifacts from what was I think in Radcliffe’s history the nerve center of music and broadcasting.” Yet despite that fact, the room is about to be gutted. “We’re going to turn it into a social space, a dedicated party room, and a lot of this––the bookshelves––will go. It’s sort of sad, but on the other hand…it’s a generously sized space, and we have a need for that.”
THE RADCLIFFE PERSPECTIVE
 
A copy of The New Yorker and a couple of cocktail napkins rest atop the coffee table in front of the Khuranas. Underneath the table lie partially obscured artifacts from the Radcliffe days—a couple of plates, a book with pictures of old common rooms, a Radcliffe pennant. Rakesh pulls out one in particular: a black and white sketched poster of a woman with a tired but unrelenting face. The caption reads, “She will die, but she will never give up.” The woman is Alice Paul, author of the original Equal Rights Amendment, and the quote is from the psychiatrist who evaluated her while she was on hunger strike and in prison for her work in support of women’s suffrage.
{pullquote text="\"I quite like our feisty history. It’s a non-pretentious history, it’s a history of rising from a place of somewhat marginalized status to one of full integration, and I think that’s a worthy history,\" Anne Harrington, one of Pforzheimer's Masters, says."
Khurana sees the poster as emblematic of the type of complex relationship between Harvard and women that runs through Cabot’s history as a former part of Radcliffe. “The idea of even women being educated on par with men was a revolutionary idea…. Social change begins here,” he says. The co-Masters use the artifacts that fill the their home—from posters and yearbooks to pictures of Radcliffe alumnae Eleanor Roosevelt ’41 and Benazir Bhutto ’73—to tie them to the revolutionary spirit of Radcliffe and to encourage them to look critically at the Harvard of today. “I think this value of pushing the boundaries, this pioneering, looking for social change, I think that that’s something we try to foster,” Stephanie Khurana says.
For the future dean and his wife, artifacts have the potential to reinvigorate this spirit and to evaluate whether or not  how we act today does justice to the goals and struggles of those who came before us. As an example, they both reference Helen Keller and her struggle for inclusive education. “What was the project that people here were trying to get done, and have we done it?” Khurana asks. “If the idea was to create an inclusive learning community where everyone felt that they had a place here and that they were coming at it in a way that each of their contributions and gifts and biographies were recognized as valid and valuable, I don’t think we’re there yet.”
STORIED OBJECTS
The Khuranas project the same sense of energy and hope for change that they see in the Radcliffe artifacts. Both have something to add to the others’ answer for almost every question. They discuss empowering students, fostering diversity, and finding ways to refresh how they see the world. Eck is equally welcoming, greeting us at the door with a smile and immediately ushering us to the nearest artifact—a bust of Abbott Lawrence Lowell’s dog, Phantom, which sits like a real cocker spaniel under the piano in the foyer. Eck, who has served as Lowell’s master for three times as long as the others put together, carries with her a sense of history and tradition. As we walk through the Masters’ residence and Lowell, she is keen to tell everyone we pass that she is showing us “the Harvard properties.” The difference between her and the Cabot House Masters seems to well analogize the difference between the artifacts they each highlight.
While the Cabot artifacts we discussed are mostly posters and pictures that speak to the spirit of Radcliffe, the Lowell artifacts carry a sense of the wealth and culture that is synonymous with a more conventional conception of Harvard. Eck takes us past portraits of Lowell after Lowell, a trousseau chest, a checkerboard, and various other antiques, and portraits of Lowell after Lowell.
Eck has a story for nearly every artifact we pass. The grandfather clock in her foyer is an 1819 gift from Robert Gay Hooke. “It’s an old Tiffany clock,” she says, pointing for evidence to the “Tiffany & Co.” inscribed on its face. The clock is dark, slender, and imposing, the painted human face atop its clock face drawing one’s gaze to the corner in which it stands. Until the early 2000s, the clock used to be tended by Harvard’s keeper of the clocks. “It’s a particular task that this really eccentric old man fulfilled for a while,” Eck says. His name was Charles Ditmas, and according to an article in The New York Times, he had a penchant for checkered suits, interrupting meetings, and behaving as if nothing mattered more than time. “After we moved in, he came and knocked at the door one day, and we asked, ‘Well, who would you be?’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m the keeper of the clocks,’” Eck says. After informing them that their clock had spent 25 years without the appropriate attention, he was quick to cart it off. It is unclear whether he interviewed the House Masters, as The New York Times noted he had a habit of doing, to see if they were deserving of the clock they had, and therefore of his services. He did, however, return the clock restored to working order.
LEARNING FROM THE PAST 
 
It is dinner time, and Lowell Dining Hall is bustling with students. Eck, weaving her way between them, tells us the stories of the various Lowells on the walls: Percival, the astronomer who discovered “the late, great planet Pluto”; Abbott Lawrence Lowell, the University president who was “a bit of an anti-Semite”; Amy Lowell, his sister who “smoked cigars and…was a lesbian.” As she tells the story of each, the portraits change. They become monuments to history rather than mere pictures of long-dead and rather pale-looking people. As Eck puts it, “It’s important to have that sense of history. Harvard is built on history and tradition and, of course, change.” In a way, [the portraits] add to the sense of what Harvard was, what it stands for, and what it is.
Later on, Harrington echoes this as we stride through Pfoho. “I quite like our feisty history. It’s a non-pretentious history, it’s a history of rising from a place of somewhat marginalized status to one of full integration, and I think that’s a worthy history,” she says.
This brings up the question, then, of having characters like President Lowell in the dining hall or the Masters’ residence. “He’s one of the people who lobbied to have a Jewish quota in the ’20s...and he was one of the people who presided over...well not he himself, but his dean—over the Secret Court that expelled homosexuals.” When asked whether it was a problem to have someone who did such things hanging above students who must eat in his company three times a day, Eck replies, “Absolutely…. If he weren’t there, we wouldn’t get to talk about him. And if we took down all the portraits of all the people we disagreed with, then most of the portraits in the university would be gone.” 
While Eck speaks about the value of such artifacts’ ability to inspire conversation about the mistakes we have made in the past, it remains a question whether keeping such portraits in their place serves as more of a reminder to examine our faults or a memorial to the people within the golden frames. “People should know…who they’re eating with and what their story is,” Eck says. Perhaps, then, part of what the House Masters are entrusted with is to serve as living interpreters of these artifacts, to keep the history of each House alive not only by holding or curating its properties but also by knowing and sharing their stories. If they do not, can the portraits, pictures, busts, and posters serve their purpose?
MIRROR MIRROR
Towards the end of our tour of Pfoho, Harrington steps into the role of living interpreter when she  pauses by an elevator, where Chelsea C. Grant ’15 is waiting to return to her dorm.
“Do you have any mirrors upstairs?” Harrington asks.
“Yes,” Grant replies. 
“Do you know why they’re there?”
“I have no idea.”
“Because back when this was a Radcliffe dorm, it was so the girls could make sure they looked good before they met their boyfriends in the parlor downstairs. And some rooms have hooks [to prop open the doors], because when you entertained visitors in your room you had to have the hook up so nothing would happen.”
Grant laughs incredulously. “Really? Are you serious? How do you know this stuff?”
“Well, because I’m the House master.”

In many ways, art cannot be separated from the political environment of its time. As discussed in previous columns, artwork is used as a vehicle for protest everywhere—from Ai Weiwei’s “S.A.C.R.E.D,” to Barbara Kruger’s untitled photograph that states, “Your body is a battleground.” However, an important question remains unanswered: how exactly did art begin to be considered as a platform for opposition? In this final column, I want to discuss Édouard Manet’s “Olympia” as the origin of modern, political art—one that took Paris so off guard that Antonin Proust remarked, “If the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration [of the 1865 Paris Salon].”
 
Before discussing “Olympia,” it is important to define the types of acceptable artworks in Manet’s time. Artists were encouraged to paint in the most naturalistic way possible—that is, with three-dimensional depth, careful modeling, and precise forms. In addition to the compositional requirements, the different genres of paintings were hierarchized. Paintings with historical and mythological themes were considered the best, followed by landscape paintings, and on the bottom, still life paintings. Nudes were accepted as a part of mythological paintings such as Titian’s masterwork “Venus of Urbino.” In this painting, Venus lies down on the bed, gazing at the viewer sensuously. Her left arm grasps gently at her pubic region, and she holds flowers with her right hand. A puppy naps on the bottom of the bed. The painting is treated with gradual tonal modeling, indicating spatial relief. 
 
Manet takes Titian’s “Venus of Urbino” and transgresses its paradigms to produce “Olympia.” The similarities between the two are unmistakable. Olympia reclines in the exact same position as Titian’s Venus—her left hand covers her genitals, and the angle at which her right arm bends is the same as Venus’s. In place of a puppy napping, a black cat meows, its tail straightened in hostility. While the paintings share a basic structure, Manet’s breaches the canons of the accepted mythical nude figure. Its harsh, syncopated modeling between light and dark evades perfected illusionism. The subject is nude, but she is not mythological figure—critics widely accept that she is instead a prostitute. Perhaps most startlingly, the figure stares directly at the viewer, confrontational. Through his reshaping of “Venus of Urbino,” Manet seems to defy the strict classification of women and their sexuality, something for which he received great criticism when the painting was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon.
 
The categorization of women is further frustrated as Manet doesn’t use the idealizing conventions of portraiture in portraying her femininity. Olympia’s hair is pulled taut, giving her rectangular face a severe outlining. Olympia’s breasts, while voluptuous, are painted so brightly that her nipples are not clearly visible. Soft black brushstrokes appear under her armpit, suggesting that Olympia has armpit hair, unlike contemporaneous paintings that showed women without armpit hair. Her left hand covers her pubic region, denying viewers a clear reference to her gender, and seems to be tense, almost as if Olympia is betraying a sense of anxiety with her sexuality. All of this works together to deny the viewer a portrayal of the ideal nude with a full set of feminine features.
 
But perhaps most importantly, Manet rebuffs the viewers from envisioning the painting as realistic and getting lost in a simple enjoyment of the nude. “Olympia” is rendered in stark contrasts of white and dark. Gone are the careful, subtle shadows that indicate depth in Titian’s “Venus of Urbino.” Instead, “Olympia” is surprisingly flat—it denies the viewer from entering the imaginary field of the perfected nude. Instead of the ideal nude, real sexuality—in which strict categorization cannot apply—stands in its place. 
 
At first, Manet’s “Olympia” doesn’t seem so revolutionary, except for the stylistic differences from the paintings of the French Academy. However, by replacing the mythological nude with a prostitute and not yielding to the conventional contemporaneous stylizations of women, Manet seems to have used “Olympia” to protest against the categorical portrayal of women in art. By replicating the image of “Venus of Urbino,” Manet acknowledges the past and uses tradition to rebel against it. And he appears to have been ultimately successful—after “Olympia,” the mythical nude never recovered its hallowed position. Manet had started modernism and its inextricable relationship to protest.

Until that day in early July, I had always underestimated Collin’s intelligence, the importance of binoculars, and the usefulness of rocks. The morning began on a glum note as the buzzing of chainsaws reverberated through the forest. Collin stared out into the bright Sierra day from the cabin’s living room window, a large screen sheet nailed within a rectangular cut-out in the lumber walls. I buried my nose further in summer reading.
Dad sat on the couch beside me, holding an open novel, though his gaze continued to wander between Collin’s countenance and mine. “Come on guys,” he finally said. “It’s too hot to be inside. Let’s go swimming or something.”
I looked at Collin, hopeful. The icy water of the mountain creeks, fed by melting snow, would be a welcome change from the stuffy living room.
“I just hate that sound,” Collin finally said.
The loggers had just begun the work of cutting the trees with circumferences under 20 inches, a tree size which was apparently conducive to the spread of flames in the event of a forest fire. Dad, in his capacity as a forest ranger, had finished the project of measuring and marking the trees in the overgrown sections of forest on our property and on the surrounding government land. Collin had become increasingly convinced that Dad had measured too carelessly, marking trees that were larger than the specifications. I worried that Collin would never forgive him once the trees in question were logged.
The oppressive buzzing continued throughout the day and into the afternoon when Dad left for work and Collin agreed to venture outside the sweltering cabin. He led the way as the two of us began to hike, crossing the brook behind Foxglove and working our way up a shady slope. We hiked through a grove of sticky manzanita shrubs and up to a small granite outcrop surrounded on all sides by mountains. From the route we were taking, I could tell that Collin was headed to one of the forest groves that Dad had recently measured and marked.
“What are we doing?” I said. “I can tell where we’re headed.”
He smiled. “You’ll see.”
“Dad’s worked on areas much closer to the house,” I said.
“Yeah, but I don’t want to run into any loggers,” he said. “I’m sure they won’t make it this far today.”
I followed him nervously. “What’s gotten into you?”
“Hearing the loggers today just got me mad,” he said. “But it also got me thinking.”
“And?” I said.
“And you know, last night I was sitting on the porch. And I could have sworn there are more owls this year than ever,” he said. “Or maybe I’m just noticing them for the first time ’cause of Button. But I just…” he trailed off.
The grove was dense and mosquito-filled. I noticed the logging road that looped around its outer edge and worried that one of the loggers might be parked out of sight. Collin removed a pair of binoculars from the pocket of his cargo shorts. He scanned the landscape, surveying ever higher portions of the forest. His wordlessness was wearing on me.
“There are so many bugs,” I said.  “Let’s go.”
“Let’s just stay another few minutes,” he urged. I followed him through the crunchy brush to one of the larger oaks that was marked with Dad’s red spray paint. I had to agree that it appeared somewhat larger than 20 inches in circumference.
Looking through the binoculars, Collin swept his eyes up the trunk. His lens lingered as he looked at a spot partway up the tree.
“Take a look,” he said, offering me the binoculars after a few minutes.
“You’re acting smug,” I said but took them anyway. As I scanned the tree, Collin began to collect small rocks from the forest floor.
“What are we doing?” I asked for the second time. I didn’t see anything particularly interesting as I looked through the scratched lenses.
“Look for a cluster of twigs and things,” he urged. “Also, watch out.”
I looked up and down the tree, and Collin began to hurl his stones up towards the spot he had examined. I trained my binoculars on the area, and watched as rocks sailed past my field of vision, framed in the black circles of the binoculars.
I finally managed to locate the cluster that Collin had described. “Is that a nest?” I asked.
“Yup,” Collin said, too self-satisfied.
He rained rocks on the area and, as one of them hit it squarely, I could hear a shuffle above me. Through the lens, I watched as a magnificent owl emerged and peeked its head out. Collin ceased fire, and the bird, likely startled from slumber by Collin’s rocks, began to beat its wings. It turned its head left and right, momentarily shook its spotted body, and sailed away.

Just over a week ago, Mayor Walsh announced a search for Boston’s next poet laureate. A few days after the announcement, BDCwire published an article calling for a spoken word poet, Simone Beaubien, to be named the next Poet Laureate of Boston. My first reaction to the article was a resounding YES. I’ve seen Simone perform and can affirm that she is an incredible artist and is also incredibly dedicated to making spoken word vibrant in the city—she has directed two of the past National Poetry Slams held in Boston. However, the article caught me a bit off-guard because I had not thought that a spoken word artist could fulfill the duties of a poet laureate. But then again, I was not even sure what a poet laureate is supposed to do.
As it turns out, the contemporary American role of “poet laureate” is a purposefully vague title. The tradition of appointing a poet laureate can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when bards were chosen specifically to wax rhapsodic about their king or earl. Geoffrey Chaucer, John Dryden, and William Wordsworth have all been Poet Laureates of England, but the United States did not assign the role to one of its own poets until 1937. And even then they held off on titling the role “poet laureate” until 1985, first labeling it as “The Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress”. I suspect this had something to do with the American avoidance of praising aristocracy—expounding the glory of a king is not really in the American color wheel.
So when the title was adopted into the American literary scene, specific roles were never outlined. The poets receive the title and then becomes as involved or not involved in the poetry scene as they choose. According to the Library of Congress’s website, the poet laureate is meant to be “the nation's official lightning rod for the poetic impulse of Americans.” The irony here is almost palpable; the Library of Congress is using a metaphor to disguise an already vague definition of poet laureate. Regardless of the questionable poetic rhetoric of the government, the takeaway point is that the title of poet laureate is what you make of it.
This same flexibility applies for the lower laureates around the country: most states have their own poet laureate, as do many cities. Laureates take on a poetic role in the community in whatever way they see fit. The first and only Poet Laureate of Boston, Sam Cornish, assumed his title in 2008 and has since brought poetry readings and workshops to public organizations around the city.
Much of the work laureates have done in the past focuses on invigorating reading, writing, and literary appreciation in public life. Former United States Poet Laureate Billy Collins, who held the title from 2001 to 2003, started a program to bring poems into public schools and worked to make public transportation more poetic by encouraging buses and trains to post poems inside their cars. The current poet laureate, Natasha Tretheway, has a new project called “Where Poetry Lives” focused on finding communities who use poetry to better their lives. Her partnership with “PBS Newshour” has covered teens in Detroit who write about their experiences, doctors who use poetry to create empathy with their patients, and residents of detention centers who find release through poetry. Laureates can do a lot of good with their title—the possibility for positive work depends on making the right choice about who to appoint.
 
So who should Boston pick next? Simone Beaubien is an excellent option, and Boston is swimming with other spoken word poets who could also make the most of the title. Janae Johnson holds it down at the Lizard Lounge and would be an incredibly powerful voice for the city, and Porsha Olayiwola would equally rock the greater Boston area. 
When you think about the history of the title and the vibrancy of the city, it makes sense that the next Poet Laureate of Boston should be a spoken word artist. After all, spoken word artists seek to alter the world they write about with their words. If the words and performance do not move language and push for change, then the poem will not stand well in front of an audience. A spoken word poet's art is all about transformation. In a city as young, active, and diverse as Boston, the poet laureate title should expand to encompass artists whose words fit just as well in sound waves as on paper. This city is ready for spoken words to shake our cobbled streets—Massachusetts has sheltered Dickinson, Bishop, and Lowell, and now it’s time to find a similarly lively poet to fill our local voice. The fact is, if a poet laureate’s job is to bring life to literature, Boston’s best option is a poet who uses their voice to make art and empower other members of the community.

Vonnegut, Fuentes, and now García Márquez. All three departed the world during spring, and I can remember each sharp sadness fully. When you fall in love with a living author’s work, it’s as if there is a tacit companionship—a lighted tunnel between the two of you. But then the brief candle flickers out.
Whether it’s for sanity, serenity, or mere serendipity, novels compel us. They recount the permutations of human experience—love, loneliness, death, desire, and nostalgia—in an espresso-like concentration of vicarious thrill. They are the autodidact’s ambrosia.
Vonnegut lampooned the world’s absurdity for me, Fuentes laid the sometimes-sordid foundations of power bare to me, but Gabriel García Márquez taught me how to dream.
It was love at first line.
“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember the distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.”
Who can read that opening of his greatest work “One Hundred Years of Solitude” without the exhilaration of wonderment—a momentary relapse into dreamy childhood where you can just stroll through the immaculate scenery of García Márquez’s mind.
I spent many months here, ambulating through the supernatural writing, lost in the optics: the clouds of yellow butterflies that hover around Mauricio Babilonia, Father Nicanor’s levitation after drinking a cup of hot chocolate, Juvenal Urbino’s fateful ladder fall while rescuing his pet parrot from the mango tree, and the haunting tableau of the palace of the unspeakably powerful patriarch, overrun with cows after his death.
I never knew you were allowed to write like that. And I devoured as much as I could.
I didn’t know that writing about the supernatural with journalistic precision and matter-of-factness could so beautifully neutralize the effect, the way that the people shrug at the very old man with enormous wings once another circus trick comes to town. 
“If you say that there are elephants flying in the sky, people are not going to believe you. But if you say that there are four hundred and twenty-five elephants flying in the sky, people will probably believe you,” García Márquez once remarked. 
When you destabilize the magic of the impossible, the stuff that’s real becomes all the more wondrous. A first introduction to ice stays memorable 16 years later.
But these were never just pretty stories. “One Hundred Years of Solitude” reads like a phantasmic Book of Genesis with generation after generation suffering the same story—Macondo is a place where time circles on itself rather than pass, linking the archaic origin story with the political strife of later days. The 32 insurrections led by Colonel Buendía and the 3,000 banana plantation workers massacred allude too much to the political discord of the last century in Latin America for the novel to be a self-contained, solipsistic unit.
“We have to do more things in our culture than American writers do in theirs. They can have more time for themselves and for their writing, whereas we have social demands,” Carlos Fuentes once said.
He explained: “Pablo Neruda used to say that every Latin American writer goes around dragging a heavy body, the body of his people, of his past, of his national history. We have to assimilate the enormous weight of our past so we will not forget what gives us life. If you forget your past, you die.”
That duty is apparent in García Márquez's novel “The Autumn of the Patriarch,” which he described as a “poem on the solitude of power.” It is made up of the breathless and desperate sentences of a fictional ruthless Latin American dictator who goes unnamed, who nonetheless conjures forth many names: Pinilla, Trujillio, Franco, and too many more.
The abject loneliness of the cruel general, like the deathbed narrations of Fuentes’s Artemio Cruz or the aloofness of Mahfouz’s Gebelawi, captures the emptiness of the internecine dictatorships that plagued his home during his lifetime. It’s a plague that unfortunately survived him.
I’m nowhere near the wordsmith García Márquez was, so I will close with my favorite sentences of his:
“In the shattered schoolhouse where for the first time he had felt the security of power, a few feet from the room where he had come to know the uncertainty of love, Arcadio found the formality of death ridiculous. Death really did not matter to him, but life did, and therefore the sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia.”
For the man revered by millions as Gabo, life was what mattered, and I hope that his last thoughts were nostalgic and not fearful. But I will still miss him.

In 1866, a Yazoo Delta planter said, “I think God intended the n—— to be slaves. Now since man has deranged God’s plan, I think the best we can do is keep ’em near to a state of bondage as possible.”
One hundred and forty-eight years later, his ghastly words echo in America’s incarceration epidemic, evidenced by the systematic imprisonment of African Americans. A new form of slavery exists today in the U.S., targeting the same population it did hundreds of years ago, only shrouded under the veil of the prison system. As Tupac put it, “The penitentiary is packed, and it’s filled with blacks.”
I will not equate the injustices of slavery with that of current prisons—doing so trivializes and understates the horrors of the slavery system. It is important, however, to acknowledge the weight that slavery held in shaping the current mass incarceration. Moreover, it is important to recognize the parallels between America’s past systematic oppression of African Americans and its present one.
When my teachers discussed the post-emancipation period, they highlighted the Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. But I never learned about the imprisonment system that the South established in a desperate attempt to clutch onto their white supremacy, called “convict leasing.” In fact, our Constitution, our beloved 13th Amendment, substantiated the creation of that system. The 13th Amendment reads, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.” I never paid mind to the clause stating that slavery is legal in the U.S. as long as it is a penalty for a crime.
  
As David Oshinsky expounds in his book, “Worse Than Slavery,” convict leasing was worse than slavery itself in many aspects. After the ratification of 13th amendment, Southern plantation and company owners desperately needed a source of cheap or free labor to maintain their profit. So the South set up a series of vagrancy laws, arresting newly freed slaves for petty offenses—for example, legislation required black men to have jobs or else be considered “vagrants” and sent to jail. With almost no employment opportunities, many were convicted and sent to private plantation owners and corporations as punishment. There, they were to labor for the owners’ benefit. Having made little to no monetary investment in the convicts they leased, and with replacement labor readily available upon the death of a worker, plantation owners had no incentive to preserve their “property” as slave owners had in the past. Consequently, a higher rate of African Americans died under the convict-leasing system than under slavery.
The same post-emancipation desire to subjugate black Americans that birthed convict leasing continues today: Our justice system is perpetuating racial inequality. Many African Americans grow up in areas of concentrated disadvantage, where crime runs rampant due to economic and social isolation. Members of this population, often marginalized and punished for their actions at a harsher degree than white Americans, are not afforded equal opportunities for upward social mobility. When African Americans make up nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million incarcerated people in America, when black American are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Americans, and when one in 15 black males is incarcerated compared to one in 106 white males, the issue goes beyond social or economic disadvantages—this is a trend of systematic targeting and institutionalized racism in our legal system.
The same spirit of persecution and profit that gave life to slavery is salient in the prison industry. In fact, there are greater racial disparities in private prisons than in publicly run prisons, according to a recent study by Christopher Petrella. What’s more, there is a higher proportion of black men in for-profit prisons than in state-run prisons, and the reason is alarming: Private prison companies strategically house younger, healthier inmates in order to avoid high medical costs. And although this disparity is caused by financial incentive rather racial motivation, there is no denying that overarching social and political measures—such as the war on drugs that disproportionately targets poor communities of color—play a crucial role in sending these younger males to private prisons. Prisoners have become commodities to private, for-profit companies such as the Corrections Corporation of America, which benefit from the subjugation of others. This is almost the definition of modern-day slavery.
Before we can discuss prison reform, we must first reflect on how we think about prisoners or inmates. We see them as the “other”—independent from us. When we start viewing them as evildoers or sinners or degenerates whom we want off of our streets, we begin to see them as less than what they are: humans. We are more concerned with punishing those who break a law than we are with the injustice of corporations profiting off of the imprisonment of humans. We are more fixated on sending these people to prison than we are in enacting social change that will prevent them from ending up there to begin with. Before we can begin to address issues surrounding “post-racial” America, we must first work toward a post-slavery America.

In the aftermath of the Marathon Bombings last year, commentators, politicians and regular Bostonians were quick to paint a portrait of a gruff, gritty, no-nonsense town. 
“Tough and resilient,” was how President Obama described the Hub on the day of the attack, claiming it would “move forward as one proud city.” At an interfaith Seder the following day, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 repeated the “proud” descriptor. And at the same service, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino—in his gravelly, garbled, yet convictional voice—shouted, “No challenge, nothing, can tear down the heart of this city and its people.”
On the Internet, the same message proliferated, though the rhetoric was rougher. A meme with Boston’s four major sports mascots and the words, “You fucked with the wrong city,” went viral on Facebook. The now omnipresent “Boston Strong” phrase quickly became commonplace, often transposed on stills from “The Boondock Saints”—the most violent, brutal film of the Beantown crime canon. Even the mainstream media took up the tough town narrative: An editorial in the Guardian referred to Boston’s “resilience,” and the Christian Science Monitor described the city as “gruff and stoic” on the bombing’s anniversary.
This narrative is to be expected to some degree: No politician or pundit would call a city soft in the face of a terror attack, regardless of how it responded. 
But that’s not the only reason this flinty narrative emerged. Rather, it was also reflective of Boston’s peculiar self-identity, one rooted in its tumultuous, at times violent, past. It’s a city, the narrative goes, of ethnically proud Irishmen and Italians—historically resistant to change, and historically resistant to each other. It’s a city of tough, provincial neighborhoods—Southie, Eastie, Charlestown—all tight-knit and all working class. It’s a city where people drink beer, not wine, where the winters are harsh, and where the brother of a mass murderer can rise to the top of the state senate. 
Of course, some of this Boston is a relic of the past, even if we don’t want to admit it. Whitey Bulger is feeble and imprisoned, and the Winter Hill Gang is dead. Most of us won’t be able to afford a decent place in South Boston when we graduate, much less the trendy Charlestown. 
Yet, I’d contend that there remains a gruff, no-nonsense vibe to the place even if the conditions that bred this vibe are drifting into the past. As hometown writer Dennis Lehane wrote in the New York Times last year, “Bostonians don’t love easy things, they love hard things—blizzards, the bleachers in Fenway Park, a good brawl over a contested parking space.” We’re not quick to abandon tradition, and we rarely let passion overpower reason. And if we’re not stoic, there’s at least a frank Yankee pragmatism that guides the city and its residents—often interpreted as rudeness by outsiders.
It’s because of my qualified belief in this self-image that I was surprised by how Boston, as a political community, reacted in the days following the bombing. For when I found myself sequestered in my dorm in Cambridge while the police shut down an entire metro area in pursuit of two villains, I felt anything but resilient or tough or pragmatic.
Rather, I felt irrational, and, in fact, a bit lame.
To be sure, what Dhzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev did last April was beyond heinous. They took away both human life and a day of civic pride, and enjoyed doing so. But it was us that gave them two days of public fear and cowering of the kind that that two sadistic thugs might envision, hope for, and relish. Watertown, Somerville, Medford, Cambridge, and much of Boston huddled inside, peering sheepishly out windows for 48 hours. Driving from A to B was considered foolhardy, as if the danger from these two amateur criminals had turned Boston into Kabul. I was admonished for leaving my dorm in the morning, and was forced to curtail a trip to Connecticut, as if leaving Cambridge were a 3:10-to-Yuma-like feat. In other words, for two days, we, as a city, acquiesced to a pair of murderers.
I’d understand it all if these tactics were an effective strategy for rounding up the brothers. But in the law enforcement hero worship that has followed the bombings, we forget the narrative of the Tsarnaevs’ capture: The police, after riddling a Watertown neighborhood with bullets and killing Tamerlan, cordoned off a 20-block area, shut down half a metro and found nothing. Only when civilians were allowed to come out of their homes was Dhzokhar spotted—by a man looking inside his boat in his backyard. A police helicopter brought out an infrared detector, and iconic images of the culprit being cuffed were circulated. But neither of the suspects were subdued during the curfew, and it was not the FBI or HUPD or BPD or CPD that found Tamerlan, but one of Metro Boston’s 4.5 million decent-hearted civilians.
This isn’t to say that the police didn’t exhibit bravery; they did. But it is to say that we needn’t cower in the wake of terror, even when we lack badges. We’re all brave, and we’re all too pragmatic and all too tough to let our lives be controlled by two deranged criminals.
At least that’s my understanding of what it means to be “Boston Strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: April 22, 2014, at 8:35 p.m.
African-American children in the South now have a 12 percent likelihood of attending an “apartheid school”—a school where white students make up fewer than 1 percent of attendees. Recent reporting from The Atlantic and ProPublica reveals that American schools districts now face the problem of resegregation, as federal judges lift desegregation mandates instituted to integrate black and white schools. From Tuscaloosa, Ala., to New York City, public schools are increasingly racially and socioeconomically homogenous. A Stanford study found that even within 10 years of lifted mandates, school districts had undone much of the integration achieved under court order. Although segregation is no longer the law of the land, the United States is once again plunged into the midst of a civil rights issue thought to be solved just a generation ago.
The current trend toward segregated school demographics and the emerging judicial behavior have left the Department of Justice powerless to hold school districts accountable for policies that reinforce segregation. The Warren Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling struck institutionalized segregation at its core, stating explicitly that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” But 60 years later, many schools look as though Brown v. Board never occurred.
The Supreme Court abrogated efforts to promote racial integration in its 2007 “Parents Involved” decision. In a landmark ruling that ushered in the modern era of judicial neglect for segregation issues, the divided court barred school districts in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., from considering individual students’ racial identities in school assignment, a practice used to promote diverse classrooms and to hinder resegregation. The plurality, led by Chief Justice Roberts, invalidated consideration of race aimed at “racial balancing”—enrollment criteria aimed at a range of demographic percentages. In defense of integration efforts, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his harsh dissent, “No Member of the Court that I joined in 1975 would have agreed with today’s decision.” The deciding vote, Justice Kennedy, conceded that a diverse student body is a compelling state interest, but that the means employed by Brown v. Board are too mechanical to ameliorate de facto segregation.
However, proponents of integration point to government practices that reinforce de jure resegregation. In Tuscaloosa, for example, white neighborhoods near “apartheid schools” have been gerrymandered into the zones of schools with primarily white enrollees. Class issues have emerged, revealing that apartheid schools are increasingly homogenized in terms of socioeconomic status, rather than just race. Perhaps Brown v. Board is unable to tackle the modern issue, which emerges from a mixture of government practices and social phenomena, rather than from the clearly discriminatory laws of the 1960s. In any case, segregation, institutionalized or not, should not be ignored.
Confronting de facto racial segregation in schools will require an understanding of the issue’s complex causes. The intersectionality of race with other dimensions of social inequality—including localized funding for schools—complicates an already fraught issue. While the government may no longer be directly responsible for segregation, it should be responsible for keeping education integrated.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 22, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Brown v. Board of Education was in 1964. In fact, the case was decided in 1954.

Just more than a year after two deadly explosions disrupted the 2013 Boston Marathon, the only sound that could be heard at the finish line this year was the cheering of nearly one million spectators vocalizing their support for a record 36,000 runners.
Concerns about security lingered amongst marathon attendees, many of whom experienced the fear and chaos of last year’s bombings firsthand. Amid a heightened security presence, however, a sense of pride, remembrance, and resilience prevailed, with the excitement and energy of the crowd only boosted by a landmark victory in the men’s race.
For many, the Boston Marathon, now in its 118th year, has become an annual tradition. But numerous spectators and runners, including more than two dozen participants and many more spectators from the Harvard community, said that the patriotic spirit and determination following last year’s tragedy made the 2014 marathon particularly memorable.
Professors, administrators, and students from across the University made the trek across the river early Monday morning to join thousands of runners at the starting line in Hopkinton, Mass. Many of these Harvard affiliates were returning to the race after their marathon experience was cut short by the bombings last year.
Chinese history professor Michael A. Szonyi, who was only 200 meters away from the end of the course when the 2013 race was halted, said the goal this year was to cross the finish line. 
“I had a moment where I choked up at the spot where I was stopped last year,” Szonyi said.
Szonyi, along with many other members of the Harvard community who were at the race, said that this year’s crowd was particularly enthusiastic.
“I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life and I probably never will again,” said human evolutionary biology department chair Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, who was running in the marathon for the fourth time. “This one was special above all others.”
Anne F. Wenk ’15, who was running the marathon for the first time, was buoyed by spectators as well. Wenk participated in the marathon through the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, an organization through which runners earn a spot in the marathon by fundraising for charities.
“It’s a hard race, it’s a long race, but there was so much cheering and so much support,” Wenk said. “Boston Strong was everywhere.”
Security officials were everywhere, too. Scattered among cheering spectators and runners, local police officers, FBI agents, and even the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson remained present and visible for the duration of the event. Spectators were submitted to bag checks and a second set of physical barriers and law enforcement officers heavily restricted access around the finish line.
Nick Guertin, a senior at Northeastern University who volunteered as a race marshall for the second time, said the new security arrangements complicated the spectator experience in some ways but ensured overall that many attendees felt safe at the marathon site.
“It’s been generally comparable to when I was here three years ago—I think people are more on guard but there’s generally a determined feeling,” Guertin said.
Joseph Robertfonts, who came to the race from Rhode Island, said he felt a mix of emotions in the air. “I feel very happy that people are here supporting the race but I definitely also feel melancholy about what happened last year,” Robertfonts said. “The scar is healing but it’s going to be there.”
The overwhelming feelings of community pride were only heightened by the historic victory of Meb Keflezighi, a 39-year-old living in San Diego who became the first American male to win the Boston Marathon since 1983.
The crowd erupted in cheers and chants of “U-S-A!” as Keflezighi fought off another contender late in the race, setting a personal record time of 2:08:37. He later stood atop the victor’s podium as the American national anthem was played, bringing him and many in the crowd to tears.
Keflezighi’s victory capped off an exciting and significant day, said M’Shell Patterson, a New Yorker who was attending her third marathon as a volunteer. “This year more than ever, it felt like we had to step up and stand for something,” Patterson said. “[Keflezighi’s victory] just put icing on the cake. It’s the right year for an American to win this marathon.”
For Charles A. Scherr ’17, who attended Monday’s race as a spectator, the take-home message was one of inspiration and community spirit.
“I was definitely inspired. As a marathon runner...I felt even more inspired leaving the Boston Marathon than when I ran the New York Marathon,” Scherr said. “Today I feel very proud to go to school in Boston.”

The Harvard Islamic Society launched its Muslim Life Fund campaign last Friday and hopes to raise $30,000 in 2014. According to HIS Director of Development Hassaan Shahawy ’16, the Muslim Life Fund is meant to bolster what students call a lack of resources for a growing Muslim student community, particularly by securing a part-time campus chaplain for 2015.
Members of HIS began to work on the funding initiative last fall after examining the results of a survey regarding Muslim student life on campus. The survey indicated that about half of student respondents felt dissatisfied with Muslim life at Harvard and 83 percent wanted an official chaplain on campus.
 
Nuri Friedlander, a teaching fellow in the study of religion, currently serves as a volunteer chaplain for the community. Given his multiple commitments, however, he said that his availability for students is limited.
“There are limitations on what I’m able to do and what I end up doing will often fluctuate from one year to the next depending on my schedule,” Friedlander said. “Conceptually, knowing that there is someone who is there, dedicated to meeting your needs, will create a big difference psychologically in the lives of Muslim students on campus.”
The Harvard University Muslim Alumni organization is collaborating with HIS by providing both organizational and financial support for the fundraising campaign. HUMA President Khalid M. Yasin ’07, who was HIS president in 2005, said he sympathized with the current concerns of Muslim students given his own past experiences.
During his undergraduate years, Yasin said that students relied on each other for support and dialogue. 
“For myself and a lot of my friends, there were lots of discussions about, ‘What did we grow up with?’ versus ‘What are actually our own thoughts?’” he said, adding that he felt a chaplain might have facilitated these conversations.
HIS President Yacine Fares ’15 said that guidance and mentorship is particularly important as undergraduates grapple with these questions. 
“In the formative years of college, and within academic life in general, people want someone who understands their background and their belief system,” Fares said. He added that a chaplain familiar “with the context people are coming from” would be better-equipped to handle student questions related not just to religious beliefs but also academics and career choices.
HIS members said that a chaplain would also help foster increased connections between graduates and undergraduates in the Muslim community while serving as an advocate within the school administration.
“[A dedicated chaplain] would take the burden off of undergraduates for trying to coordinate the programming that addresses the religious necessities of community members,” Shahawy said.
 HIS’ existing resources are no longer sufficient to support growing interest in its events, Shahawy said. He referenced as an example the weekly jumu’ah prayers, held on Fridays in Lowell Lecture Hall, which have recently attracted more than 200 community members.

Harvard Management Company, the in-house management firm that oversees the University’s $32.7 billion endowment, has continued its strategy of investing in natural resources by purchasing millions of dollars' worth of vineyard land in central California, according to University tax filings and recent reports of purchases in the region.
Brodiaea, a Delaware-based corporation that is entirely owned by the University, paid $10.1 million in February for more than 7,500 acres in Santa Barbara County, according to a report last month by the Farmland Investor Center, a market research firm. David Hamel, an appraiser quoted in the report, estimated that the University, through Brodiaea, has so far paid $61 million for more than 10,000 acres in the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties.
Kevin Galvin, a spokesperson for the University, confirmed that HMC owns the land described in the reports. Galvin declined to comment on how much was paid for the acres.
HMC’s new holdings come in a region where the quality of land and grapes is rising, according to Michael Fritz, the author of the story which first reported the purchases.


“If you can get in in the early days before the land prices skyrocket, you’re better able to harvest returns as time passes,” Fritz said in an interview with The Crimson.
The purchases reflect the continuation of HMC’s long-established strategy of investing in natural resources. Jane L. Mendillo, president and CEO of HMC, wrote in the organization’s 2013 annual report that impressive historical performance of natural resource holdings “demonstrat[es] the continued potential of this investment area.”
HMC’s natural resource holdings have generally performed well in the last ten years, generating an average return of 12.2 percent annually, though last year the holdings returned just 5.1 percent.
But HMC has faced criticism, especially recently, over the way it manages some of these holdings.
In February, HMC put most of its holdings of Romanian timberland up for sale after a former University contractor in the region was arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.
The University has also faced allegations of mismanagement of its two timber plantations in Argentina. The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, a group of students, professors, and other community members, has claimed that under HMC’s watch, the University-owned plantations in Corrientes, Argentina have led to a degradation of local wetlands and a general decline in quality of life for surrounding inhabitants.
Andrew G. Wiltshire, who manages alternative assets for HMC, vehemently denied the central charges of the coalition in an op-ed published in The Crimson last Wednesday.

A new Showtime series entitled “Years of Living Dangerously” debuted at Harvard Business School Monday afternoon, kicking off Earth Week and offering a look at how humans have exacerbated climate change around the world.
“At some level we have an impoverished debate in this country on this issue,” said Daniel R. Abbasi ’86, who co-produced the series. “One of the goals of this series is to ignite a public conversation.”
The documentary series will include nine episodes total. The first, which was screened at the Business School Monday, highlighted the impact of human activity on climate change. It included appearances by actors Harrison Ford and Don Cheadle, as well as New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman—each of whom traveled to a different location to investigate the effects of climate change.
Ford went to Indonesia, where he encountered forest burning, an illegal activity that clears space to cultivate palm trees. Palm oil, a product of the trees, has recently experienced a spike in demand, according to the series. The burning of the trees, however, releases high quantities of carbon into the air. 
 
The episode also follows Cheadle on a trip to the small town of Plainview, Texas, where he observed the plight of workers laid off from their jobs at a meatpacking factory. Their company went out of business due to a prolonged drought. Cheadle highlighted how difficult it can be to convince deeply religious communities, such as those located in the panhandle of Texas, that climate change actually exists.
 
Friedman traveled to Syria for his segment of the episode, where he met with Syrian rebels who described how another drought, which took place from 2006 to 2010, had influenced the revolution.
 
Abbasi noted that celebrities and public figures featured throughout the series may help increase viewership.
 
“We were very selective on the [celebrities] we chose,”Abbasi said. “These were fiercely intelligent people who are really students of human nature, among them Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Olivia Munn, Harrison Ford. And that comes through.”
Abbasi also noted that the series stands apart from previous climate change documentaries, such as “An Inconvenient Truth.”
“We wanted to do something different,” Abbasi said. “We didn’t want to make a documentary film. We wanted to make a mainstream vehicle for television; we wanted to have a sustained amount of coverage.”
Rebecca M. Henderson, co-director of the Business and Environment Initiative at the Business School, commended the way the series has addressed climate change. 
 “At a time when so many of us who care about these issues are so deeply frustrated at our seeming inability to make any progress at all, it is deeply exciting to have the ‘Years of Living Dangerously’ on public TV with so much favorable media attention,” she said.

Sharon L. Howell, the longtime Adams House resident dean who spoke up in support of her colleagues during a controversy over administrative action last spring, will depart Harvard this summer to serve as the associate head of school at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Gill, Mass.
Howell has been Adams’s resident dean since 2006, and prior to that, she and her husband were Adams House tutors. After Adams House Masters Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and Sean Palfrey ’67 announced her departure in an email to students Monday, Adams residents characterized Howell as a trusted mentor and beloved dean who raised her family in the House.
“Sharon is an institution in Adams,” Sean Palfrey said.
Beyond her role within Adams, Howell served as the College’s senior resident dean for three years, until she went on a semester-long sabbatical this past fall, making her the highest-ranking resident dean during those years. Howell, a lecturer on History and Literature with a focus on American poetry, also currently sits on the Faculty Council and the Academic Integrity Committee.
Howell’s last academic year as senior resident dean, in 2012-2013, was a tumultuous one for the College. Over the course of just a few months, Harvard saw the adjudication of its largest cheating scandal in recent memory and controversy over revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans after internal Administrative Board communications appeared in the media.
After news broke of the searches, Howell was the first resident dean to speak out publicly about administrators’ handling of the searches. In a letter to University President Drew G. Faust, Howell called for a “conversation about integrity at Harvard” among both faculty and students and addressed resident deans’ “dismay” in reaction to the secret searches. Palfrey said that her choice to speak out on the issue demonstrated her strength and commitment.
The controversy over the searches reignited a years-long conversation about the resident deans’ role at the College, which has since continued in the form of an administrative review of the position.
“I have seen my role as representing this cohort of dedicated people and really trying to articulate and discuss the place that we occupy in the College and affirm its importance,” Howell said in an interview in her Adams residence Monday evening. She called the resident dean position a “critical role in the College.”
On Monday, Adams students praised Howell for her influence on their House, suggesting that she has set an example for others in the resident dean position. Ben J. Lamont ’14 called her family a “really strong addition to Adams House,” and Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 said that Howell is trustworthy and cares “very deeply” for students.
“Every resident dean should be like Sharon,” Coughlon said. “Every administrator should be like Sharon.”
Howell, for her part, said that she has “really tried to bring compassion and accountability to students’ lives,” adding that she has also tried to be an “intellectual presence” in Adams.
As Howell will depart the House this summer, Palfrey said administrators plan to find her replacement before next fall. Howell called Northfield Mount Hermon, a secondary boarding school, “excellent” and said she is “very excited” about working there.

During a book talk at the Harvard Book Store Monday evening, Stanford professor of history and Classics Ian Morris argued that wars force society to become stronger and less violent.
Morris outlines his theory in a new book entitled “War! What Is it Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots,” which was released earlier this month.
Morris grounds his analysis in three major historical periods—the stone age, the medieval period, and the modern era. According to Morris, the incidence of violence declined after the stone age and during the modern era but rose during the medieval period. Overall, he notes, death rates worldwide fell 90 percent from the stone age to the twentieth century.


 
“By fighting wars, people have created bigger societies that are more organized and reduced the risk that people have died violently,” he said. 
 
Morris said his book stands apart from the body of previous scholarly work because it looks at a broader historical spectrum. 
“I tell a continuous story,” Morris said. “You don’t need as many variables as many of these other scholars suspected—war drives the whole story along.”
 
Morris also noted that his book reveals some troubling implications for the future. The world now needs a “globo-cop” to police trade and make other nations wealthier, but such superpowers are bound to create rivals, Morris said, just as the United States has done with China. If the trend of international competition continues, the next 40 years could be extremely dangerous because of new nuclear weapons and resurgent global instability.
More than 30 listeners from the Cambridge area, as well as a C-SPAN news crew, crammed into the Harvard Book Store to hear Morris discuss his book.
Although few attendees said they had had the chance to read the book beforehand, the talk prompted many purchase it at the store.
“[The talk] was really interesting and thought-provoking,” attendee Randal Wendell said after buying a copy. “I’m definitely excited to read [the book].”

In one of its most important games of the season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team survived a tough challenge from one of the Ivy League’s bottom dwellers to clinch a spot in this year’s Ivy League Tournament for the third time in the program’s history.
In a game which saw four lead change and five ties, the Crimson (9-5, 4-2 Ivy) defeated Ancient Eight rival Columbia (3-9, 0-6 Ivy), 12-10, at the Robert K. Kraft Field to obtain its spot in the tournament and send the Lions to their sixth straight Ivy League defeat.
Harvard used a balanced offense versus Columbia, as sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd and freshman midfielder Megan Hennessey  scored three goals apiece to lead the Crimson.
Freshman attacker Marisa Romeo, junior attacker Sophia Capone and sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia contributed two goals each to complete the Harvard attack. Nicolia also collected five ground balls for the Crimson, who held a 23-18 advantage in the ground game.
“It was a great team effort,” coach Lisa Miller said. “So many teams are concentrating on Audrey and Marisa, setting early doubles. It’s become critical that everybody chips in.”
The match saw Columbia get out to a fast start, as it scored the opening goal two minutes into the match to put pressure on sophomore goalkeeper Kelly Weis and the Harvard defense.
The Crimson would strike back quickly, as Hennessey would equalize the game at one a mere 40 seconds later on an unassisted play. Capone then gave Harvard its first lead of the day on a free position shot.
Columbia would strike back with a pair of goals by freshman midfielder Quinn Taylor and junior midfielder Katie Angulo to take back the lead. But senior Ashley Rinere would soon see yellow, as the referee gave her a yellow card for an illegal foul on Weis.
The woman-up situation saw Harvard level the game at three, as Romeo would score from a free position shot, before Todd would recover the lead for the Crimson with yet another free position attempt.
The match continued in a similar fashion throughout the first period, as Todd and Hennessey each got the ball in the back of the net for the second time to give Harvard a 6-5 lead at the break, with Taylor and freshman defender Caroline Joy keeping the Lions close and making the game difficult for the Crimson.
“It was a tough game,” Miller said. “I though Columbia played very well. They were scrappy, they were tough, and they really went after the ground balls. They had nothing to lose.”
Though Columbia would come out of the half with Taylor scoring the third goal of the match to level the score at six, the Crimson would go on 5-1 run in the span of 15 minutes to go up by four on the Lions.
The free position shot continued to be a valuable weapon for Harvard throughout this run as three of its five goals in this span came from this shot. The run also served to further illustrate the balance of the Crimson attack, as four different players scored.
Columbia would make things interesting near the end of the match, as Taylor led the Lions on a 3-1 run near the end of the second stanza, but it ultimately proved to be too late for Columbia, as Harvard claimed its fourth Ivy League victory of the season.
In addition to demonstrating a balanced offense, the Crimson victory demonstrate one of its most potent assets this year: the youth of the team. According to Miller, the youth of the team has added to the impressiveness of its performance throughout the season.
“I’m really happy with the position we’re in,” Miller said. “We’re starting 10 freshmen and sophomores, and everyone else on the bench is helping out. At the beginning of the year we knew we were going to start [many] young players and we’ve worked really hard throughout the year.”
The attack has particularly shown the importance of youth, as a freshman has led the team in scoring in 12 of the 14 matches of the year, led by freshman Romeo.
The Syracuse, N.Y. native leads the team with 44 goals and 50 points on the season and has had a point in every match so far this year. Fellow freshman Hennessey has chipped in 27 points, while sophomores Alexis Nicolia and Audrey Todd have also contributed over 25 points.
The victory keeps Harvard tied for third in the Ancient Eight with Cornell with one game left to play in the league schedule.  The Crimson sit half a game behind Penn for second place and a home seed in the first round; two Penn losses and a Harvard victory in its regular season finale versus Dartmouth would give the Crimson the second seed.
Before that however, Miller claimed the team looks forward to getting some rest after a long stretch which saw them achieve their goal.
“It was a tough stretch,” Miller said. “We played six games over the last couple of weeks and we’re tired. We just finished a long road stretch; to come out 5-1 and in the position that we’re in, it’s pretty [good].”

After coming off of a rocky series against Yale, the Harvard baseball team (11-24, 5-11 Ivy) secured the Beanpot Championship against UMass (8-23, 6-9 Atlantic 10) for the first time in nine years.
The Crimson shut out the Minutemen at Northeastern’s Friedman Diamond on Monday afternoon, 3-0.
“It feels awesome to get a win after a tough weekend at Yale,” co-captain utilityman Carlton Bailey said. “I feel the win shows how we, as a team, can bounce back after playing 45 innings the past three days.”
The game was not a contest in which offense was strong, with Harvard and UMass only registering eight and five hits, respectively.  Despite recording a double and a triple amongs their five hits on the day, the Minutemen failed to send a player across home plate.
“I think our biggest strength today was solid defense,” freshman pitcher Greg Coman said. “I trusted the guys behind me to make all the plays, and that’s exactly what they did. In the fourth inning, Carlton Bailey made a great catch that led to an inning ending double play. That got the team pumped up and we scored a run in the bottom of that inning.”
Bailey helped reel in a couple double plays for the Crimson while playing second base. Notably, the senior played in the infield for teammate and senior second baseman Kyle Larrow.
Larrow, who holds a .296 batting average on the season, missed the contest to run in the Boston Marathon. Going 2-for-3 for the day, Bailey also contributed at the plate to help out the offense.
Sophomore infielder Mitch Klug also pegged a significant batting performance against UMass. Klug went 3-for-4 and registered a double, which sent freshman Matt Hink across home plate for a run after the ball bounced over the wall. The double put the team on the board, 1-0.
The sophomore also scored the team’s third run off of a wild pitch at the bottom of the sixth inning. Junior outfielder Mike Martin and Hink both stole bases to send Harvard around the bags.
“I think Mitch Klug, T.J. Laurisch and Carlton bailey all had big games for us today,” Coman said. “Klug was seeing the ball really well…TJ came in relief for me and threw 4 scoreless innings.”
Coman (1-1) was attributed the win on the mound in his first start for the Crimson, pitching the opening five innings and allowing only two Minuteman hits. The freshman also secured four strikeouts.
Beginning in the sixth inning, sophomore pitcher T.J. Laurisch relieved Coman and was credited with the save. Laurisch tossed the final four innings and was effective, sending four UMass players down swinging.
Coman stepped up and carried Harvard in a game with major implications, and was able to keep calm despite it being his first start, according to him.
“I acted like it was just any other game, which is why I think I pitched well,” Coman said. “I just focused on hitting my spots and getting outs. It’s a great feeling to get a win, especially since it was the Beanpot. Holding that trophy after the game was definitely a sweet feeling.”
Bailey also credited the pitching and defense for doing its job and allowing the offense to do its part to win the game.
“Our pitching was outstanding along with solid defense for nine full innings,” Bailey said. “Our consistency through the game gave us the chance to take the win.”
Neither team committed any errors throughout the contest, as both teams were able to turn double plays.
The relatively clean fielding, along with the strong pitching from the Crimson, ensured that it was a low-scoring contest.
“I really didn’t think we had any weaknesses today,” Coman said. “Our situational hitting could’ve been better, but you could say that for every game. A few times we left guys on base without scoring, but when it mattered most we got the clutch hits we needed.”
But while Harvard missed opportunities, leaving ten players on base overall, sending three men across home plate was enough for the Crimson to seal the win and claim the Beanpot Championship.
The win marks Harvard’s third Beanpot victory in program history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
100-meter hurdles. High jump. Shot put. 200-meter dash. Long jump. Javelin. 800-meter run.
When one competes in track and field, she usually competes in one of these events. She trains day in and day out for that single event, mastering her technique.
But sophomore Madison Hansen must train in all of these events in order to succeed in the heptathlon, which is a multi-day event encompassing all seven of these events.
“It’s pretty strenuous. It can be pretty taxing, because obviously you have to prepare for seven events,” said Harvard associate head coach and heptathlon coach Kebba Tolbert. “It’s more challenging because you’ve got to switch gears more than other athletes that might not have to do that.”
This past weekend, Hansen competed at the LSU Alumni Gold meet in the heptathlon. After two days of competition, the Plano, Texas native topped the podium and represented one of several record-breaking performances for Crimson runners in the national meet.
With a final score of 5152 points, Hansen beat out unattached competitor Amber Metoyer, who had 5060 points, in order to claim the title as the top heptathlete in the meet. This was a personal best for Hansen and was good enough for the number two spot in the Harvard record books.
Prior to this weekend, Hansen held the second-best performance by a Crimson heptathlete, but improved her mark at LSU.
Last season at the Heptagonal meet on May 4th, 2013, she scored 5011 points. Mary Hirst ’13 currently holds the number one spot with 5359 points at the same Heptagonal meet last year.
Hansen was coming off of a fourth-place performance in the 100m hurdles against Yale last weekend. In that meet, she finished in 14.45 seconds.
Despite not competing in the heptathlon last weekend, the meet was still beneficial in creating momentum for this weekend’s competition, according to her.
“Competing alongside all of our teammates was really encouraging and inspiring,” Hansen said. “I think we took that inspiration into our meet this weekend at LSU.”
The first event of the heptathlon was the 100-meter hurdles, something Hansen typically considers a strong suit in her repertoire of events. But she struggled a bit starting off, and had to come back in the later events.
Hansen’s time of 14.86 seconds left her in sixth place following the first event, giving her 860 points and putting her 173 points behind the leader right off the bat. Her mark was also four-tenths of a second slower than at the meet against the Bulldogs.
“Hurdles are the first event and usually one of my stronger events. However, I didn’t run the time I wanted to,” Hansen said. “It was really hard to start out on such a low note, but I just refocused and tried to keep my spirits up knowing I had six other events to accomplish.”
And things certainly took a turn for the better for Hansen, as she tied for the top spot in the second event of the heptathlon, leaping 1.62 meters in the high jump.
“Obviously it’s disappointing to not have a great first event, but the key is to look at the whole thing as one event and not get too up or too down,” Tolbert said. “If you get too up after one [event] you can’t focus on the next one, and if you get too down you can’t focus, so the key is to maintain kind of a neutral focus."
Hansen also had a strong performance in the 800-meter run, which she completed in 2 minutes, 17 seconds. Her mark was good enough for second place, just behind Therese Jernbeck of LSU.
Since it was the last event and Metoyer, Hansen’s closest competitor, crossed the line sixth, Hansen was able to capture the overall title with her second-place finish in the 800.
“The 800 was something we’ve been talking about for a while—about having the potential there to do very well,” Tolbert said. “It finally came together.”
Hansen also took third in the shot put with a throw of 11.43 meters. She placed fourth in the 200-meter dash with a time of 26.04 seconds, and took third position in the javelin with a throw of 32.20 meters. She also had a collegiate personal best that earned her third in the long jump with a distance of 5.62 meters.
When she’s not competing in the heptathlon, Hansen competes in individual events such as the 100-meter hurdles and the sprint medley relay. Along with teammates Christi Scott, Gabrielle Scott, and Molly Renfer, she was a member of the record-setting medley relay team that finished in a time of 3:41.85 at the Florida Relays on Apr. 5th.
She will compete in the heptathlon next at the Ivy League Championships on May 10th and 11th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard coed sailing team split up once again this weekend to compete in four regattas along the northern Atlantic Coast in one of the last competitions of the 2013-2014 season.
10TH ANNUAL GEORGE MORRIS TROPHY
The Crimson's best finish this weekend was third place at the George Morris Trophy, hosted by Boston University. This intersectional regatta featured FJ sailing, and nine teams came out to compete.
“The conditions were difficult Saturday opposed to Sunday,” senior Luke O’Connor said. “The wind and water was extremely volatile and shifty.”
O’Connor was joined by junior Rebecca Frankel in A division and finished in second place. In the B division were senior Ben Lamont and freshman Priscilla Russo, who finished in 10th.
The O’Connor and Frankel combination had a strong start and finish, coming in first and second place in the first two and last two rotations. This pair has been racing together for quite some time, but they won’t be sharing a boat for much longer.
“Rebecca and I got nervous at the start when we realized this was the last time we were going to be racing together,” O’Connor said. “This was our last regatta on a course we’ve sailed before. It was important for us to just focus on how we were comfortable on this water.”
79TH BOSTON DINGHY CUP
Harvard’s second top finish this weekend was at the Boston Dinghy Cup, held on the Charles and hosted by its neighbor, MIT. Similar to the Morris Trophy, the conditions were choppy on Saturday but evened out on Sunday.
Of the 17 schools that came out to compete in this intersectional regatta, the Crimson didn’t finish worse than seventh place. Junior Brian Drumm and sophomore Jacob Bradt took third in the A division, Brian’s twin, Michael and senior Isabel Ruane finished seventh in the B division and junior Gram Slattery paired up with freshman Olivia Kjorlien for sixth place in the C division.
There were two types of boats being used, FJs and NC Fireflies.
ADMIRAL’S CUP
Despite finishing in 12th place in the Admiral’s Cup down at King’s point this weekend, the Crimson’s Juan Permero, a rookie, finished in first in a standout performance in the C division.
“The greatest strengths for me this regatta was a combination of my speed down wind and my boat handling,” Permero said. “Overall, I think my boat handling was pretty good.”
Of the 14 match-ups, Permero finished in first place for eight.
The boats being used were 420s and this was an intersectional regatta. The league is less than a week away from qualifiers to nationals.
“I feel like the team’s improvement is progressing,” Permero said. “With the nicer weather, we’re getting a lot more time on the water and are able to practice real-time performances.”
REED TROPHY / NEISA WOMEN’S CHAMPIONSHIP
The women of Harvard sailing headed down to the Coast Gaurd this weekend for their conference championship regatta. 17 teams competed in 420s and the Crimson finished in 13th place.
Sailing three seniors and one junior over two divisions, the Yale sailing team came out in first place with 155 points. Boston College followed with 173 and Dartmouth came in third with 202.
Sailing for Harvard in the A division were senior Caitlin Watson and sophomore Kristina Jakobson. Junior Ashleigh Inglis and freshman Julia Lord rode in the B division.
Saturday’s conditions were perfect for racing, but there was a lack of wind on Sunday which made things complicated.
With this weekend behind them, the men and women of the Crimson sailing team are getting ready for the final qualifiers of the spring season taking place next weekend.
“Everybody is very focused and ready for next weekend,” Permero said.

Attention eager prefrosh: Visitas weekend is a great opportunity for you to impress your new friends by navigating your way to all the midnight pizza parties with ease. Go the extra mile by saying the names of the buildings right, and people might even believe you already go here! Hooked On Phonics was a long time ago for most of us, and to be honest there are a few people and places that even current Harvard students can’t pronounce. Luckily, you have this guide to help you navigate the perils of phonetics:
Agassiz House - “AG-ah-see.” Not “Ah-GAH-see” or “AH-GAH-sees.” Named after Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz, significant contributor in the early years of Radcliffe College, Agassiz House in Radcliffe Yard is home to the Harvard College Admissions Office and the historic Agassiz Theatre, a room of impressive gilded chandeliers and uncomfortably hard seats.
CGIS - “SEE-jiss.” Not “C. G. I. S.” For those who have never taken a class in politics or international studies, it might be confusing to hear about the mysterious Seejis building. The Center for Government and International Studies is comprised of two buildings on Cambridge Street, respectively christened South and Knafel—a name that presents its own pronunciation difficulties (see below).
Dean Pfister, Interim Dean of the College - “FEAST-er.” Not “FIST-er” or “puh-FIST-er.” We hope that you had a Happy Pfister Sunday, because otherwise that’s just awkward.
Hemenway Gym - “HEH-men-way.” Not “Hemingway.” While it may or may not be true that the Harvard Law School Gym inspired “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” the gym was named after Augustus Hemenway '1875, a philanthropist and Harvard alumnus, who would appreciate if you pronounced his name correctly.
Knafel Center - “kuh-NAH-ful.” Not “NAY-ful” or “Nah-ful.” Formerly the Radcliffe Gymnasium, this building in Radcliffe Yard is now home to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. What was once a big swimming pool has been transformed into a large hall to host symposiums and fancy fundraising dinners headlined by Drew Faust.
 
Loeb - “LOBE.” Not “LOW-eb” or “LEEB.” The Loeb surname graces the Loeb Drama Center on Brattle Street, the Loeb House next to Lamont Library, and the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library. Exciting as it may look in between two consonants, the ‘oe’ actually doesn’t do anything funky.
Longy School of Music - “LON-jee.” Not “LUN-ghee.” Though technically not part of Harvard, this music conservatory affiliated with Bard College provides nice scenery on the walk down Garden Street to the Quad.
 
Mallinckrodt Laboratory - “MAL-in-krot.” When asked for clarification on how to pronounce the name of this chemistry laboratory on Oxford Street, one of the desk staff at the Harvard Information Center replied, “I’ve never seen this word before in my life.”
 
Maxwell Dworkin - “DWOR-kin.” Sound it out, people. Then again, if you’re not an engineering student, you may never have to visit this building.
Pforzheimer House - “FOR-tsahy-muhr.” Not “puh-FOR-tsahy-muhr.” Though many non-Quadlings may need to take the first step of learning how to spell ‘Pforzheimer,’ sooner or later it might be good to learn how to say it as well. Break out those German vowel rules, everyone.
Pusey Library - “PYOO-zee.” Not “PUH-see.” It’s still unknown whether Pusey is a library in its own right, or just the place you can get to by walking through the creepy tunnels in Widener.
Sever Hall - “SEE-ver.” Not “SEH-ver.” We heard a rumor that Ann Sever, the 19th century donor of this lecture hall in the Yard, actually pronounced her name to rhyme with the word “lever” (pronounced the American way). However, if you pronounce it that way to most people, they will just look at you weirdly, so be a conformist and make it a hard ‘e.’
 
Tercentenary Theatre - “TER-sen-TEN-er-ee.” Not “Tekjhfkjdfh” or “That place that’s in the Yard sort of.” Next to “Sesquicentennial Square,” this is probably the least descriptive, hardest-to-pronounce name that could have been chosen to commemorate an important anniversary year of Harvard’s founding. In 2036, will we rename a new grassy area the “Quatercentenary Quad”?
 
The SOCH - Usually rhymes with “gauche,” or pronounced as a homonym for “sock.” The Student Organization Center at Hilles is known for being the best place on campus that nobody ever uses except for maybe a career fair now and again. The jury is still out on the definitive pronunciation, so it’s up to you to decide.

 It turns out this crazy blue marble we’re perched upon isn’t just a wasteland of our froyo containers and cracked iPhones (or the blue eye of a giant). In celebration of Earth Day, here are some insane facts and phenomena that you might not know about this beautiful planet of ours!
 1. We’re currently hurtling through space at a brisk pace of 67,000 miles per hour. That’s faster than a speeding bullet. Basically we’re all like Dash from The Incredibles.
2. The North Pole is migrating northward at 10 miles per year. How can something that defines where north is move even more north? No idea—must have something to do with the magical elves that live there.
3. There’s 13 billionths of a gram of gold in every liter of sea water. If we made an 1849 Gold Rush effort to collect all of the gold in the ocean, it would add up to 20 million tons, or about nine pounds per person. Go get your pan sifter!
4. We've seen our planet from 3.7 billion miles away. In 1990 a satellite traveling to the boundary of the solar system was instructed to turn around to take a selfie of the Earth. This image is known as the “Pale Blue Dot,” which depicts the entirety of humanity (and some extraterrestrials) as a fraction of a pixel. Crazy, man.
5. It’s postulated that we used to have a twin planet called Theia that shared our orbit. The two planets eventually collided, which supposedly created the moon. This is one of those “from destruction comes life” learning moments, where “life” is a barren, cratered, white thing that we think is made of cheese. Still cool though.
6. Ever wondered what Earth looked like from other planets? To us, Mars is red and Venus is the brightest, but to them (them being aliens), Earth is actually the brightest. This is due to all the water (71% of our surface area) on our surface which is perfect for reflection (and drinking, fishing, sailing...).
7. The earth is smooth as hell. Yes, we have Mount Everest and the Challenger Deep, but if shrunk down to the size of a billiard ball, it would actually be smoother than billiard balls we use now! Whatttttt.
This planet of ours may seem indestructible and enormous, but it’s important to remember, especially on Earth Day, to do everything you can to preserve its beauty. This is (assumedly) the only home planet we get, so let’s keep it as insanely amazing as it is! Word to your Mother (Earth).

Hundreds of high school prefrosh will be coming to campus this weekend, phones in hand, thumbs at the ready. In high school, texting was all about the abbreviations and acronyms. Cool texters were the ones who could throw around g2g, LOL, and idk without a second thought. Now, though, these prefrosh are at Harvard, and at Harvard, it's punctuation that matters. That means that these prefrosh have got some stuff to learn. Don’t worry though, we're here to help. Here is a definitive list of how to de-code those texts.
 1. The Space-Exclamation-Point 
The space-exclamation-point is used when you want someone to know you like them/are genuinely excited but you don't want to appear needy and annoying. The space-exclamation-point is usually used on friend-crushes (people who you want to be your future friend), possible hookups, or ex-boy/girlfriends. Think about it—how much cooler do you sound when you are "happy to have hung out !" than when you are "happy to have hung out!" I'm telling you, the space makes all the difference.
 2. The Ellipsis The ellipsis is used when a situation is so outrageous/funny/embarrassing/confusing and you are so close with the person receiving the text that you don't even need to explain to them what you are thinking. Instead of using a text to communicate actual words, you're basically asking the other person read your mind. You might shoot your friend an ellipsis when your ex casually hooks up with another person in front of you or when your professor assigns an essay over spring break. Alternately, the ellipsis can be used to convey passive aggressive anger when the text receiver knows he/she has done something wrong. You do NOT want to receive an ellipsis after being half an hour late to pick someone up.
 3. The K-Period. 
While older generations often misinterpret The K-Period as a simple attempt at correct grammar on the part of the texter, anyone born after 1990 knows that The K-Period is used if, and only if, one wants to convey a sense of utter anger and hostility. In fact, the K-Period is so negative that it implies the exact opposite of plain old “K”. For example, responding “K.” to the text “I’m on my way sorry!!” may seem harmless and easy going, but it really means “I cannot believe how long you made me wait. This is SO NOT OK.” The K-Period means that the text receiver is so pissed that he or she cannot be reached emotionally over text. Thus, it is advised that in-person communication be sought. If, for example, one receives a K-period after sending a long apology text to a friend, to maintain the friendship one should immediately buy flowers, find chocolate, and find said text receiver ASAP.
 4. The Name Exclamation Point 
The name explanation point is often used to convey a sense of excitement on the part of the text receiver upon receiving a text from the texter. The Name Exclamation Point is a good way to signal to someone that you’re excited to talk to them without seeming too over the top in the rest of your text. The Name Exclamation Point Should not be confused with the very different Word Exclamation Point, which is merely used to convey excitement in general and cannot be taken as an indication that the texter has any particular interest in the text receiver.
 5. The ALL CAPS
All Caps Texting is generally reserved for moments of extreme excitement. The difficulty of producing an All Caps text on most phones (read, iPhones) means that they are not taken lightly by the receiver. That being said, typically, All Caps Texting is more common among the female population, often to convey a sense of deep and sincere friendship. One girl might text another that she is “SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU OMG.” All Caps is also as an alert that one has just had an unusual/interesting/amazing/unbelievable experience that she is about to communicated in a coming text: “YOU’LL NEVER BELIEVE THIS.” While All Caps can be a great emotive tool, it also has the unwanted consequence of literally seeming like you are shouting in the receiver’s ear, and you have to be careful not to overdo it.
 6. The Question mark-less Question
Questions are annoying, and Text Questions are even more obnoxious. You never want to be that person who only sends texts to pester someone about “What’s going on tonight?” or “Do you want to go to dinner?” or “Have you started the p-set?” Generally, its best to avoid these texts all together. But, lets face it, sometimes you just have to know and you’ve gotta ask. The solution? One way to lessen the blow is by going Questionmarkless. Somehow “What’s the homework” seems so much less intrusive than “What’s the homework???” That one little extra squiggle of punctuation just seems to make all the difference.
“So, what do you think Stanford has over Harvard, besides location and the fact that they are in the heart of Silicon Valley?” a registered member of College Confidential asked on the online forum, stirring up the debate between which school is better. Even if it isn’t the weather, make out parties, or chances of becoming a reality TV star that is drawing students to the west coast school, something about Stanford’s popularity is definitely on the rise.
This year, Stanford recorded their lowest admission rate ever, accepting 2,138 of 42,167 students, or a mere 5.07% of their applications. And it isn’t just Stanford accepting fewer and fewer applications—Princeton, Penn, and Columbia all recorded lower admit rates than years past, compared to Harvard which saw a slight increase in admission rates. Perhaps this is a result of Forbes’s ranking Stanford as the top college in the United States, followed by Pomona, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Swarthmore, and the United States Military Academy. Harvard ranked sixth place.
This year, both parents and students in The Princeton Review’s “College Hopes & Worries Survey,” said they would pick Stanford over Harvard, Princeton, and Yale if they could go to any school, regardless of cost. However, the costs of an ivy league college are quite hefty. This year, Harvard’s tuition is $57,050, just slightly below Stanford’s $58,846 tuition, Yale’s $59,320 tuition, and Columbia’s $61,540 tuition—and these are only the direct costs, not counting printing, travel, laundry and extra expenses. 88% of parents say they will need financial aid to cover the hefty prices of a college education.
So what does not being the most selective university mean for Harvard this year? Harvard’s commitment to providing financial aid so that “ninety percent of American families would pay the same or less to send their children to Harvard as they would a state school” might make it a realistic, desirable option for students, but that doesn’t erase the fact that Stanford is ranking as the most desired school. Stanford’s prominent place on top of multiple lists suggests that as Stanford’s aid opportunity increases (funding for aid has doubled since 2007, by the way), more and more parents and students might start looking westward come time for application processes in the fall.
But like most high school seniors, we will have to wait until May 1 to really know what Stanford’s rise may mean for Harvard. Since it is the people who make this university so special, it would seem that yield rates (i.e. how many students accepted by Harvard actually choose to go here) will be the best determinant of Harvard’s competitiveness. We just hope that Kwasi Enin, who has gained fame for being accepted to all 8 ivy’s and has expressed an interest in Yale, knows how much more fun it is to be wearing Crimson than any other color when The Game rolls around in November.
