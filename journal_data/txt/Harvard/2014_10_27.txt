After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Democratic candidate for Senate in Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, won’t admit that she voted for President Obama in 2012. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis of Texas is taking heat for an attack ad that referenced to her opponent’s disability. Florida’s gubernatorial race was overtaken by “fangate.”
Yes, it has been one of those elections. Dark money. Negative ads. Fans. And, above all, a paucity of ideas.
Newt Gingrich underscored this intellectual deficit, likely without meaning to do so, when he recently penned a short op-ed celebrating the 20th anniversary of his Contract with America, the 1994 document of legislative proposals that helped catapult Republicans to a House majority.
A document like the contract is exactly what this year’s election lacks. As David Brooks wrote about this year’s midterms, “There’s not even a Contract with America, nor many policy suggestions of any sort.” That hole is why this election feels so unfulfilling – and one of the key reasons why it is unlikely to create real change.
Historic elections are often ones with serious ideas on the table. Take, for instance, the United Kingdom’s 1945 election, when the Labour Party under Clement Attlee ousted Winston Churchill’s Conservatives and set about turning Britain into a modern welfare state. Labour’s manifesto was bold, articulating the moral case for left-of-center policies, and offering clear proposals for implementation. In Attlee’s immortal phrase, it aimed to create “free citizens of a great country.”
Some such major elections do not have ideas so front and center, but they are often percolating beneath the surface. During the 1932 U.S. presidential election, the “New Deal” was still a relatively amorphous concept, but its general intellectual provenance was clear, and Roosevelt suggested on several occasions that he wished to preside over a robust expansion of the federal government.
Barack Obama’s election in 2008 might fall into a somewhat similar category. As in 1932, a clear contrast existed between how the two major candidates intended to handle an economic crisis, and how they viewed the role of government in providing services like healthcare. Then-Senator Obama’s bolder ideas, though vague, won the day, and, despite his stumbles, the President has undertaken credible reforms.
Of course, demanding more ideas in an election does not necessarily result in good policies. The Contract with America contained many ideas that were simply bizarre, like the push for a so-called “effective death penalty.” Its welfare reform proposals had disastrous effects during the recession. But ultimately voters responded to it, largely because it offered a blueprint for action, rather than merely a trite collection of slogans. The Contract may have included mostly bad ideas, but ideas they were – clear and actionable, tailored to the times, and ideologically coherent.
Do today’s parties have such serious policy proposals? It depends on the definition of serious, but a quick glance at the travails of their respective congressional caucuses and think tanks suggests they do. After all, Representative Paul Ryan continues to produce budget proposals year after year – though the American public may have hinted at their true feelings about the “Ryan budget” in the 2012 election.
Even more intriguing than the Ryan budget is that of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which The Economist compared favorably to the Wisconsin Congressman’s in 2011. The most recent iteration of the Progressive Caucus budget, the “Better Off Budget,” is less ambitious in terms of deficit reduction, but retains core features of previous years like cuts in defense spending, increases in public investment, and additional, higher marginal tax rates for high-earners.
Neither the Ryan plan nor the Progressive Caucus budget will become law, but the extent to which members of both parties are running away from such clear articulations of policy is striking. To take two high-profile examples, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky thinks he can repeal the Affordable Care Act completely and still preserve all its benefits for his constituents; his opponent, the same one who won’t say which Presidential candidate she voted for in 2012, is so afraid of the law that she does not have a “healthcare” section of her issues page.
Both these stances represent the hope that voters, acting viscerally, will make their choice based on instinct and little else. And for now, they will. But if any party wants to implement its vision and end the current status quo of bipartisan misrule, it will have to start telling voters what that vision is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an endowment valued at $36.4 billion, Harvard is far and away the richest educational institution in the world. We receive revenue from a diverse variety of sources—investments, government and private grants, generous donations. In light of the University’s wealth and stated commitment to socioeconomic accessibility, it is somewhat puzzling that Harvard continues to raise undergraduate tuition fees at a rate that outpaces inflation. From both a moral and a financial standpoint, it may be in Harvard’s best interest to abolish undergraduate tuition entirely.
For context, many of the world’s most highly ranked institutions already offer a free or almost-free education. The Technical Institute of Munich, the most prestigious university in Germany, voted to abolish tuition in 2013, opting to charge only a nominal student union fee. France’s École Polytechnique—along with all other public universities in France—offers a similar pay structure for domestic students. In Latin America, too, Brazil’s University of Sao Paulo (the highest ranked university in the region), is free for non-international students. Affordability is directly correlated with prestige, and there is a significant stigma attached to students who must “buy their degrees” because they are unable to earn a place in the top schools.
From an ethical standpoint, going tuition-free would remove an important barrier that stands between low-income students and a top-notch education. While Harvard already promises deep discounts to lower income students, it is often difficult for students to learn about these discounts and navigate the complicated system of financial aid—especially if they are in the first generation of their family to go to college or if they attend high schools with poor college preparation resources.
Overwhelming research suggests that lack of information and difficulties navigating complex financial aid applications dissuade many low-income students from considering schools that have high sticker prices. A recent survey of applicant behavior found that a majority of families rule colleges out based on sticker price alone. Eliminating tuition would remove this barrier and help to even the playing field.
Middle-class families would also see a significant improvement in their financial wellbeing. Harvard currently charges middle-class families “as much as they are able to pay,” which in practice means that most families put about a tenth of their incomes toward educating their children. In many cases, meeting this financial burden requires families to reduce their standard of living significantly while their children are in college, and in some cases delay retirement. From an economic perspective, financial aid incentivizes parents to avoid career moves that would increase their income bracket and thus expose them to paying higher prices. Abolishing tuition would thus increase social mobility and prosperity for low- and middle-income families.
The most obvious argument against abolishing tuition at Harvard is a financial one. If we eliminate this source of revenue, how will we maintain high quality? Fortunately, data from the University’s most recent report suggests that—all other factors held equal—eliminating undergraduate tuition would have a minimal effect on the school’s wealth. According to last year’s financial report, Harvard collected $270 million from undergraduates while its net assets reached $38.6 billion. Phrased differently, last year’s undergraduate tuition increased the school’s total wealth by less than 1 percent. Even compared to the school’s yearly operating expenses of 4.2 billion, tuition fees only cover about 6 percent. Considering the school’s vast resources, it could easily abolish tuition fees. With the endowment’s current growth rate at more than 15 percent, the value lost by eliminating tuition would be recouped within just a few months.
In the long run, abolishing tuition may actually lead to increased revenues in the form of alumni donations. While Harvard and other Ivy League schools have consistently enjoyed better than average alumni participation, Harvard's alumni giving participation rate has significantly declined over the past decade from a peak of 48 percent in 2001 to 36 percent according to this years' U.S. News and World Report. It may be that alumni are choosing to abstain because of the high cost of college. After shelling out up to $50,000 for their degrees, many alumni are loath to give even more money to their alma maters, especially when they graduated from schools that are already perceived as rich. Removing tuition would strengthen alumni connections to the school, and motivate graduates to pay back the school’s generosity once their careers were established. Thus, while it would result in a minor decline in immediate revenues, abolishing tuition could result in greater returns over time.
A tuition-free Harvard would be a far more welcoming place to all students and especially to students from low-income backgrounds. By treating its students as an investment rather than a revenue source, Harvard would see greater alumni loyalty and support and greater returns in the long run. Most importantly, abolishing tuition would help to weaken Harvard’s reputation as the preserve of the wealthy and well connected and build its credentials as a place that values merit and hard work over wealth. It would put the University in a league of its own among Ivy League schools and put pressure on other wealthy schools to follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You’re a threat to his culture.”
“My mama would kill me.”
“Your kids will look gorgeous!”
“Wait…aren’t you from Georgia?”
“How big is his…you know…”
“How mad are your parents?”
“You date black guys?! You didn’t strike me as that type of girl…”
No, these are not comments from people in my hometown of Savannah, Georgia, but comments from students at Harvard in response to the fact that my boyfriend is black. Harvard students have a reputation for being open-minded, but I have experienced countless microaggressions from my peers for being in an interracial relationship. (This comment itself makes people bristle as if it is impossible for a white woman to experience microaggressions in the first place.)
Too many of my friends here—even after recent developments in racial discourse on campus like the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign—seem comfortable being vocally critical of my decision of whom to love.
I will never forget sitting in the Quincy dining hall with two of my (nonwhite) friends who spent about 10 minutes picking and choosing which features from my boyfriend and I would create the “perfect baby.” I remember sitting there, feeling extremely uncomfortable, because although the comments of “Your eyes, your hair” and “his lips” were meant as compliments, I was hurting. I would love it if our children had his hair, or his eyes, not because they are “black features,” but because when I would look at their faces, I would see their father.
I would like to see a Harvard that recognizes that, even though we have checked the legal box of interracial marriage, there is still much to be done. In the same way Lowell’s House Masters are a breath of fresh air for gay couples on campus, seeing Harvard acknowledging the beauty of more racially blended families would be a source of comfort and inspiration for students in interracial relationships.
Between the white anxieties of being viewed as rebellious or being “washed out” genetically by giving birth to black children and the pain thrown at me from black people who understandably have reasons to be angry—but not at me—I do not have the energy to defend my life choices on the same campus that attempts to address inclusivity.
I am already frustrated that when my friends hold hands in Harvard Yard, they’re viewed as just cute couples. When my boyfriend and I hold hands we are never “just a couple”. We are a brochure. A political statement. A category of porn. A fetish. Something that triggers pain and fear, despite the fact that at the end of the day, we are two college students who love each other very much.
The result is me, a white descendant of slave owners and Robert E. Lee, standing virtually alone on my supposedly progressive campus, trying to dispel stereotypes of what a “southern, Christian, white girl” is. I’m not trying to prove a political point. I just happened to meet someone with skin of higher melanin content and fall in love with him.
I want to challenge Harvard’s student body to do better, and to practice what they preach. I did not choose to be born with white skin. I have no control over the choices of my ancestors. I did not choose for my face to be a source of irritation, discomfort, or pain for the peers in my classes.
I did not choose to date my boyfriend to be provocative or to make a statement. I chose to date him for the same reasons I’ve dated my past boyfriends. We laugh at the same jokes. We share the same faith, and we enjoy spending time together. I am willing to fight for my right to love whomever I love, but I shouldn’t have to fight here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, details of a massive case of academic dishonesty were revealed at the University of North Carolina—over 3,100 students, many of them athletes, have taken fake classes, often with the goal of maintaining eligibility on UNC’s athletic teams. The scandal showcases not only UNC’s failings, but also those of the country’s culture of college athletics.
This scandal is fundamentally about UNC failing its students. A renowned research university has a responsibility to provide students with a quality education. It should either admit only those students capable of handling its regular curricula, or—if it feels it has an interest in admitting students not at that level—it should provide extensive academic support to help students meet standards.
UNC failed on both accounts. Regardless of who at the university was responsible, fake classes were tolerated and students were allowed to play on athletic teams, then graduate, without having received an education consistent with UNC’s academic standards. According to a report by the former federal prosecutor who was hired by UNC to investigate the controversy, the classes did not mandate attendance. The only coursework was a single, unserious paper, and wanton plagiarism was condoned.
Debby Crowder, one of the administrators behind the “shadow curriculum,” stated that she was motivated by sympathy for student-athletes. Both she and the members of the University that allowed the practice to flourish for so many years, however, could have shown more sympathy by working to ensure that the students received a quality education. They did the students no good—in fact, they did great harm—by allowing some to graduate being barely able to read.
Meanwhile, UNC athletics expected over $200,000 in profit in 2011-2012. The University should be regarded as an exploitative institution that willfully harmed student-athletes in order to make money from their skill.
National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations directly foster this exploitative culture, according to the College Sport Research Institute. Disproportionate numbers of college athletes come from “lower socioeconomic backgrounds.” While making large amounts of money from these students’ skills, universities and the NCAA often fail to give them “necessary college preparation to succeed academically.” A University of Pennsylvania study showed that black male athletes are less likely to graduate on time than the average student, the average white athlete, and even the average black non-athlete.
Rather than helping young students, schools and the NCAA seem more interested in taking advantage of their lucrative athletic prowess. One would hope that these student-athletes would at least be able to recoup their losses by receiving an education consistent with the universities they attend. At UNC, this was not the case.
UNC and the NCAA acted as predatory institutions, flagrantly disregarding students’ education and future. They owe those students an apology, a massive change of culture, and probably reparations.

Alumni who studied Comparative Religion as undergraduates returned to celebrate the 40th year of the concentration this weekend. Festivities included receptions and a series of roundtable discussions that focused on careers and professional life.
The two-day celebration was designed to show undergraduates how the study of religion opened doors to careers in a wide range of industries, such as law, politics, the arts, and academia, according to professor of Comparative Religion Diana L. Eck, who also serves as the co-master of Lowell House. It included a series of roundtable discussions with faculty members and alumni.
“I think this will be a great affirmation of the Humanities in a time when there is so much dispirited whining about the Humanities under siege,” wrote in an email.
Alumni said that they believed that the study of religion had greatly impacted the way they view the world.
“[The study of Comparative Religion] is like a cosmology, in a sense. It is a whole drama set of good and evil, of right and wrong, and of power,” said Eugenie S. Dieck ’77. “If you can understand how someone thinks about those things and respect that, you can have a really meaningful relationship with them.”
Dieck, now a consultant, said that the skills she gained as a comparative religion concentrator have been very useful in both her personal and professional life.
Before the concentration’s inception 40 years ago, students had to propose the study of religion as a special concentration, leaving undergraduates without a formal avenue to learn about the field. Though the cap of ten concentrators has been eliminated, the concentration remains small and tight-knit, according to Eck.
Alumni praised the intimate environment that the concentration fostered.
“It was a comfortable and caring place, in a place that did not have a lot of comfortable and caring places,” said Erik Berg ’89, as he reflected about his experience as an undergraduate.
In this intimate setting, alumni said, undergraduate, graduate, and Divinity School students can freely exchange ideas.
“People say the problem with Harvard is you get taught by graduate students, well Diana Eck was a graduate student when I first had a class with her,” Andrew McCord ’79 said.

Holding signs reading ‘Healthcare not warfare’ and ‘Insurers deny, people die,' more than 100 activists rallied at Boston Common Sunday to promote a single-payer healthcare system and an emergency global health fund.
The participants—including a Harvard contingent of around a dozen students and affiliates—marched the perimeter of the Common before arriving at the Parkman Bandstand, where they listened to several speakers describe the scale and severity of the global health crisis, in part due to the inequity of treatment.
Donald M. Berwick ’68, a health care policy lecturer at the Medical School who unsuccesfully ran for his party's nomination in the ongoing Massachusetts gubernatorial race, compared the magnitude of the health care campaign to the feminist and civil rights movements.
“A fight for a rational, humane, universal, sensible health care system which makes health care a human right—not just here, but anywhere—is a fight of that dimension,” he said. “We need to engage it.”
The Boston Rally for the Right to Health was one of many similar events taking place in 63 countries this weekend as part of the Article 25 “Global Day of Action” campaign, named for the section in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights that declares health as an inalienable right.
The activists gathered signatures to petition gubernatorial candidates Martha Coakley and Charles D. Baker ’79 to support a state-run, single-payer healthcare system in Massachusetts. A single-payer system would provide all citizens with comprehensive health care under a single, publicly-financed insurance plan.
“As cynical as it is, a lot of times it takes generational change for these kinds of ideas to become more ingrained,” said Frances Ding ’17, a member of Harvard Partners in Health, who attended the rally. “More and more people are looking to other countries and thinking, ‘why are they significantly happier with their health insurance?’ while we still can’t ensure health insurance for millions of Americans.”
Brook K. Baker, a law professor at Northeastern University who spoke at the rally, said that single-payer health care represents a more cost-efficient and equitable alternative to the current market-run system. Citing discriminatory insurance policies and pharmaceutical interests as tantamount to health rationing, he urged the protesters to pressure their representatives to invest in universal care.
On a global scale, the protesters advocated for a $20 billion Global Health Emergency Fund to combat epidemics like Ebola and strengthen medical systems in every nation.
“If those countries had access to healthcare to begin with, we wouldn’t be seeing this massive epidemic,” said Joia Mukherjee, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who spoke on the Ebola crisis. “There is not healthcare anywhere until there’s healthcare everywhere.”

Harvard's travel restrictions to areas of West Africa, announced last weekend, will help ensure safety without stifling the efforts of University affiliates to combat the Ebola epidemic on the ground, those familiar with the subject said late last week.
New guidelines released by the University in mid-October require Harvard affiliates to first obtain the approval of University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and their school dean before they can obtain University sponsorship to travel to affected areas. The protocols also stressed that affiliates must be conducting “essential business” for Harvard to sanction their work. Anyone who travels to the affected regions will also receive a health screening upon return.
Michael J. VanRooyen, professor at the School of Public Health and the Medical School, said he believes those measures are prudent given the “highly-charged” public debate in the U.S. over the Ebola epidemic.
“The travel restrictions probably make sense right now, given the uncertain nature of border controls and public scrutiny of patients returning from West Africa,” he said.
Barry R. Bloom, former dean of the School of Public Health, called the new policy “thoughtful” and noted that it is unlikely to impede critical health work by Harvard affiliates.
“[The policy] will not inhibit anyone who urgently needs to go…but it will also discourage people who don’t urgently need to go,” Bloom said. “If, however, you’re a physician at a hospital, and you have a good idea of the what the risks are, and you want to go in a humanitarian way, why would we stop that person? That is what’s desperately needed.”
Several Harvard affiliates are leading the effort to combat Ebola, both in labs and on the ground. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, for example, has worked to sequence the virus’s genome. The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering has developed a device that could potentially treat Ebola.
Several groups, including Harvard-related Partners in Health and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, have stated that the new restrictions are unlikely to impede their efforts to combat Ebola.
Partners in Health, a non-profit healthcare organization with close ties to Harvard, has been working to control the Ebola outbreak and to strengthen healthcare infrastructure in the West African countries ravaged by the disease. Although many of its members are Harvard affiliates, the standards will have minimal impact on Partners in Health, said Joia Mukherjee, the organization's chief medical officer. She added that Partners in Health will not be altering its own protocols in the wake of Harvard’s new restrictions.
Mukherjee, who also serves as an associate professor at the Medical School, said she understands why the University had to implement the travel restrictions.
“As an academic institution, we need to take care of our students, and I think it’s a very reasonable approach to ban travel unless they receive permission,” she said.
Mukherjee added, however, that the Medical School has worked to support Harvard affiliates who wish to join the efforts combating Ebola in West Africa. According to Mukherjee, Partners in Health affiliates, including some students, have already been granted special permission to work in the region.
The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative is similarly providing logistical and technological assistance to organizations like Doctors Without Borders. According to VanRooyen, the Initiative's director, Harvard’s travel restrictions will not impact the initiative’s work.
“The kind of medical screening that Harvard is asking for is now more-or-less the standard medical screening,” Mukherjee said. “We are in compliance, if not slightly more conservative, than what Harvard is asking—so hopefully that will give these institutions the confidence to deploy people,” she said.
Mukherjee also urged for more engagement from Harvard, and said that the University andits peer institutions can “innovate and generate new knowledge to solve this problem,” she added.

Several members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment discussed the science behind climate change on Sunday evening and continued to urge University officials to divest Harvard’s endowment from fossil fuel companies, arguing that doing so would galvanize “political will” needed to change energy production and consumption.
Presenter Stephen A. Marglin ’59, an Economics professor, said that Harvard’s divestiture would not cause fossil fuel companies to collapse, but could set an example for other institutions that might be waiting to follow Harvard’s lead.
This, he and the other presenters said, could provoke civil action and political response to match the economic and political forces of fossil fuel companies.
Marglin was joined in presenting by Chemistry professor James G. Anderson and English professor James T. Engell ’73. The three are among the 164 signatories of an open letter published last spring and addressed to University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation, calling on them to divest from fossil fuels.
In subsequent correspondence, Faust has restated that the University will not divest, arguing that such a move would undesirably politicize the endowment and that Harvard can best address climate change by promoting research and education.
At Sunday’s event in Fong Auditorium, Engell addressed this point, saying that fossil fuel companies propagate “anti-science” and “misinformation” about climate change, often attempting to discredit the research done in higher education.
Anderson presented first, opening by commending Divest Harvard students who held a fast last week to raise awareness for their cause. About 160 individuals reportedly signed up for Divest Harvard’s fast last week, with each participant choosing how long to fast, up to 72 hours.
“I haven’t seen a reaction with this intensity since the Vietnam War,” Anderson said.
Yet, during the question and answer period, journalist and divestment activist Wen Stephenson ’90 said that the movement is not widespread enough, as Harvard’s campus seems to have “a resistance—deep-seated—to resistance.”
One of principal authors of the Faculty for Divestment letter assistant professor of Psychiatry James M. Recht, although not presenting at the event, agreed with Stephenson.
“What I admire about what the students are doing is their courage, their rebelliousness, and I just think we need more of it,” Recht said.
Stephenson wrote an open letter to Faust last week, reporting that he had been asked to leave an alumni event in Sanders Theatre last spring after he and two fellow alumni held a banner that said “Harvard Alumni for Divestment” while Faust was speaking.
After retreating to the foyer, a Harvard University Police Department officer reportedly told Stephenson that while he would not be arrested that day, he would be arrested if he returned to campus.
In his letter, Stephenson said that he would return to campus for Sunday’s event, regardless of the ban placed on him.
But on Saturday, HUPD Deputy Chief Michael D. Giacoppo emailed Engell, Anderson, and Marglin, saying that “Mr. Stephenson is welcome to attend this or any other event on campus at this time,” according to a copy of the email Stephenson shared with The Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of alumni returned to campus this weekend to engage in a series of planned conversations and build connections with fellow alumni and affiliates during the second Harvard Asian Alumni Summit, the first such meeting since 2010.
The summit, which featured prominent speakers and panelists of Asian descent affiliated with the University, was organized by the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance.
Jim Y. Kim, president of the World Bank and an alumnus of the Medical School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, opened the summit with an address that received a standing ovation. He recounted the experience of growing up as a Korean-American,  being elected the president of Dartmouth College, and subsequently heading the World Bank.
“There is no question that my friendships here, the classes I took here, and the people I met here had an absolutely unequivocal impact on my thinking that there’s nothing that I or a team of us couldn’t do,” Kim  said, referring to his years at Harvard.
Kim also urged the U.S. government to devote more resources to improving the quality of the educational  system and learn from Asian countries such as South Korea.
“Of all the countries I’ve visited, we are not at the top ranks in terms of being serious and reflective about what our education system is producing,” he said. “The countries that get health care and education right will have a huge advantage in the future.”
During a separate address on Saturday, Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72 remarked on how diversity at Harvard has increased dramatically since the University’s founding.
“I’m quite sure that the Puritans who organized the Harvard Corporation back then didn’t [foresee] the little Chinese Senior Fellow who is shorter that the woman President,” Lee said.  “But that’s what we have today. It’s sign of great progress.”
Lee also highlighted the significance of the $350 million gift from alumnus Gerald L. Chan to the School of Public Health that was announced in September.  He added that, during the ceremony celebrating the donation, his mother and Chan’s connected for the first time and found out that they, “grew up on the same street in Shanghai.”
The summit also featured two best-selling authors, Sheryl WuDunn, an alumna of the Business School, and Amy L. Chua ’84. The former shared insights on social inequality and the latter on achievement and success as applied to immigrant families.
Some Asian American alumni on hand—especially those whose children are currently attending Harvard—expressed disappointment with the administration’s response to a recent death threat that was emailed to several hundred affiliates, many of whom were women of Asian descent. The email included seemingly racist language, referring to its intended recipients as “slit-eyes.” An email sent by H4A leaders to the organization’s mailing list said some alumni parents characterized the reaction with  “a lack of urgency and sensitivity.”
“We urge University officials to strongly condemn these racist attacks, to explain what their investigation has shown and why the threats are not credible, and to take action to bring the perpetrator to justice,” the email read.
The weekend-long summit comes two weeks after the Harvard Black Alumni Society and Harvard Alumni Association hosted a similar summit for black alumni.

Robert “Bob” P. Moses was honored at the Phillip Brooks House Association’s eighth annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Lecture and Award Ceremony for what the organization called his lifelong commitment to empower disenfranchised African Americans last Friday.
“The lecture brings a prominent leader in public service to Harvard to inform the community about important social issues as well as to inspire interest in social justice,” said Jose Magana ’15, president of PBHA.
Moses was honored for his extensive work as the leader of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, an organization formed during the height of the American civil rights movement that planned sit-ins and freedom rides throughout the south. He also promoted minority voter registration as a founding member of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
“He has captivated through all of the long years, not just by preaching about a beloved community, but by building a beloved community,” said Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, former mayor of Cambridge.
During his address, Moses covered stories that touched upon themes such as the slave trade, emancipation, civil rights and racism.  He emphasized the importance of expanding the reach of political agency.
“I take the preamble to the Constitution very seriously; it does not begin ‘We the President’ or ‘We the Congress’,” said Moses. “It begins with ‘We the people’, and we have spent the last two and a quarter centuries trying to expand the reach of ‘We the people’ to include a wider and more inclusive group of people.”
In keeping with the event’s theme, fellow speakers used Moses’s framework to encourage community action.
“Being liberally educated, knowing what goes on in the world is not about freeing ourselves from the occupations we have to our fellow citizens, but instead to be liberated is to be committed to be part of something larger,” said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
The award itself was created in homage of Dr. Robert Coles ’50,  professor of psychiatry, to honor those who have dedicated themselves to serving others.
“Dr. Coles has been a guide, board member, advisor, teacher, and counselor with the PBHA for more than half of the 110 years [of its existence],” said Maria J. Dominguez Gray ’94, PBHA's executive director.  “Coles has made a career out of listening to people that nobody bothers to.”
In his closing remarks, Moses commented on what “Call of Service” means to him: “Generosity of spirit assumes the best, not the worst, in humans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council detailed the timeline for presidential elections and the referenda procedure in its general meeting Sunday.
Sunday marked the first day in which potential candidates were able to submit declaration forms. Candidates will have until the following Monday to garner the 150 requisite student signatures in order to be placed on the ballot. The campaigning period will begin on Nov. 11, and voting will run from Nov. 17 to Nov. 20 at noon.
The UC Election Commission, independent of the Council, oversees all elections and has the authority to level sanctions against candidates.
Matthew C. Estes '18, chair of that commission, which consists of four other undergraduates, outlined a long list of election rules at the meeting. Few changes were made to the rules this year, but Estes did modify a restriction prohibiting the solicitation of candidate signatures via Facebook.
“[The rule] doesn't seem like it’s very reasonable,” Estes said before the UC approved the change on Sunday.
In an interview Saturday, Estes assured that there would not be any errors with the voting system this year. Last year, the Election Commission had originally rolled out voting without a Hare-Clark ranking system —required by the Council’s constitution—and switched to the method after thousands of votes had already been cast.
Estes said that he also plans to require that candidates sign a contract during the election process, indicating that they are aware of the rules and possible sanctions.
“We’re going to be as judicious as possible in campaign stays and punishments in the form of loss of funding,” Estes noted.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who won the election on a joke ticket last year with Samuel B.Clark ’15, openly encouraged all Council representatives and undergraduates to consider running for the presidency.
“I encourage everyone in this room and everyone not in this room to run,” Mayopoulos said. He added that he hoped UC representatives could keep any “divisiveness” or competition in the election outside of the Council’s general meetings.
Council members also formally passed funding for club sports this semester, allocating about 50 percent more money to those groups at the same time that they alleged the Athletics Department has cut funding.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday was Senior Day at Blodgett Pool as the Harvard men’s water polo team picked up two convincing victories in co-captain Max Murphy’s final pair of home contests.
The No. 18 Crimson (17-6, 4-3 CWPA) defeated conference foes MIT and Connecticut College in the team’s first doubleheader-sweep since Oct. 4.
HARVARD 19, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 8
Energized by a strong first quarter, the Crimson jumped out to a big lead against Connecticut College (3-12, 0-4) and never looked back. Harvard came out strong after its win over MIT and cruised to a 19-8 victory over the Camels.
This was the Crimson’s third victory over Connecticut College this season, following wins on Sept. 14 and Oct. 11. The Crimson dominated early, taking a quick 7-3 lead, capped off by junior attacker Blake Lee’s buzzer-beating shot from deep to end the first quarter.
“We really kind of settled down this game coming off a good game with MIT,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We played well on the defensive end and I think that was the main thing we wanted to work on.”
Junior co-captain Ben Zepfel and sophomore attacker Viktor Wrobel combined to score nine of Harvard’s goals. Murphy, freshman utility Harry Tafur, sophomore 2-meter defender Dan Stevens, and freshman utility Colin Chiapello each tallied two goals, while Austin Lee and Blake Lee had a goal apiece.
HARVARD 12, MIT 7
Harvard needed a strong second half to get past MIT (11-11, 3-4) in the team’s first game of the day, as the Engineers controlled the pace of play early while the Crimson struggled to create offensive opportunities.
When Harvard fell behind late in the second quarter, Minnis was forced to call a timeout to try to stem the tide. The Crimson responded right away, scoring three goals before the half to take a 4-3 lead entering intermission.
“I think at the four-minute mark in the second we kind of settled down and started attacking the way we talked about attacking,” Minnis said. “It started on the defensive end and [then we] went through our progressions on the offensive end.”
Harvard then exploded for eight second half goals to sink MIT, 12-7.
Lee led the way for the Crimson with four goals, including three in the second half. Zepfel, Harvard’s leading goal scorer on the season, added three tallies as the Crimson took a 5-4 lead early in the second half and never looked back. Joey Colton, Chiapello, Tafur, and Stevens also scored for Harvard.
“In the beginning of the game, we came out a little frantic,” Zepfel said. “We were rushing our shots, rushing our offense. A timeout was called, we all told each other just to calm down and run our offense the way we knew how to do it.”
The Crimson moved to 2-0 on the season against its crosstown foe after defeating the Engineers, 12-10, on Oct. 15.
Murphy’s two goals in the second game were a fitting conclusion to his Harvard career. The lone senior on the team has tallied 75 goals, 52 assists, and 61 steals in his four years playing for the Crimson. The San Mateo, Calif. native is the only squad on the team who has been with Minnis every year that the coach has held the reins at Harvard.
“It was really exciting—it’s kind of a bittersweet moment,” Murphy said. “I’m excited to have brought the team this far. Looking back on it, it’s been an amazing four years, but it’s kind of sad to no longer say I play at Blodgett. But I’m looking forward to finishing off the season strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard women’s rugby team’s final tuneup before the Ivy League Championships, the Crimson suffered a 10-5 loss in a defensive affair against Navy.
Although Harvard (3-3, 3-2 Ivy) rallied from behind to halve the Midshipmen’s (2-5) lead late in the second half, the Crimson could not score the equalizer before the whistle blew.
“Navy came out really hard,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “They definitely wanted to win. We were able to match their aggressiveness in the second half, but didn’t match it in the first half, which is where we fell short.”
Midway through the first period, the Midshipmen put together a drive to score the first try of the game and take an early 5-0 lead. Harvard failed to convert several scoring opportunities, and the Crimson entered halftime trailing by a try.
Pre-match rainy conditions slowed the pace of the game and made it difficult for either side to use its speed to generate offense.
“One of our weapons is our speed, so when it’s a real muddy field like that, it’s tougher for us because we can’t run quite as fast,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “Also, because our forwards tend to be physically smaller than opposing forwards, it makes it even more difficult in the scrum to get good footing...and leverage strength against the larger players.”
The Crimson came out with energy in the second half. Harvard gained possession and brought the ball deep into the Midshipmen’s zone. But despite the field position, the Crimson could not get the ball across the try-line and remained scoreless.
Within 10 minutes, Navy broke Harvard’s defensive line and scored its second try of the game to gain the 10-0 advantage.
Parker led the Midshipmen from 2002 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013, leading Navy to the Final Four of the 2013 National Championships just months before taking over at the helm of the Crimson.
“[Navy] played exactly how I expected them to play, which was putting everything on the line, fighting tooth and nail for every ball in every possible situation, and showing absolutely no mercy for us on the field,” Parker said. “So I was happy for them that they are continuing to play in that fashion, and I think it was exactly the kind of opponent I wanted us to face today in our final tuneup for the Ivy League Championship.”
Harvard continued to threaten the Midshipmen despite a 10-point deficit. After Crimson junior co-captain Hope Schwartz scored a try to pull Harvard within five, the team maintained its offensive pressure on Navy in the closing minutes of the game.
Although Harvard brought the ball within yards of the try-zone in its final drive of the contest, the team could not push the ball across the line and eventually fell, 10-5.
“We need much more aggressiveness at the point of contact,” Kantor said. “It’s about wanting the ball and wanting to win more than the other team.”
The Crimson will need to bring this mentality to Hanover, N.H. next weekend for the Ivy League Championships. Harvard looks to improve its fourth-place regular season standing in an effort to defend its 2013 Ivy title. The team faces an uphill battle, as its opening semifinal game is against an undefeated Brown squad. The Bears have outscored opponents, 345-58, this year, and beat the Crimson, 24-15, in the season’s Ivy opener.
In last year’s Ivy Championships, Harvard defeated Brown in the semifinal and then spoiled Dartmouth’s undefeated season to win the title. This year, the Crimson will look to repeat what it accomplished last year by ending the Bears’ perfect season to advance to the championship game against the Big Green or Princeton.
“This week we are coming to practice with the mentality—with the focus—that we are going to come to Ivies as a contender to be reckoned with,” Kantor said. “No one is going to take that championship away from us easily. They are going to have to earn it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A furious comeback attempt fell short for the Harvard men’s soccer team (8-4-1, 2-1-1 Ivy) on Saturday in its 3-2 loss to the host Princeton Tigers (7-3-3, 2-1-1). It was the team’s first loss since a Sept. 13 defeat at the hands of St. John’s, 2-1, and ended the Crimson’s nine-game unbeaten streak.
“All credit to Princeton, they did a really good job,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “They were able to exploit our defense a lot, and ended up finishing quite a few.”
The Crimson was shut out for the first sixty minutes of action as the Tigers sprinted out to a 3-0 lead, the first time this season Harvard faced a deficit that large. Princeton struggled to generate chances early before a penalty in the Crimson’s third gave Brendan McSherry a free kick opportunity. McSherry knocked in a laser from just outside the box.
Three minutes later, the Tigers went down a man when Thomas Sanner was given a red card. But Princeton pressed forward, undeterred.
Set pieces proved to be Harvard’s undoing again just before the half, when the team committed a penalty in the box to set the Tigers up with a penalty kick opportunity. Cameron Porter converted to set the hosts up 2-0 heading into halftime.
“After they made the PK and the free kick—both good goals—we were behind a bit,” coach Pieter Lehrer said. “A couple of the goals were terrific efforts on their part.”
Porter extended its lead to three goals just four minutes after the break, taking advantage of a failed Harvard clear. The Crimson suffocated the Tiger offense from that point forward—Princeton had just one shot on goal—but the damage had been done.
“They had too many chances in the first half of the game,” co-captain Kyle Henderson said. “It was a game where they finished their chances and we left some on the table.”
Down 3-0, the Crimson offense woke up. Harvard fired off three shots in quick succession starting in the 55th minute. On the fourth it cut the deficit to two, with freshman Christian Sady taking a pass from streaking sophomore Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu and beating Princeton keeper Ben Hummel for his first goal of the season.
Harvard would control the game from that point forward, but struggled to get the two goals it needed. Two offside penalties in three minutes halted the momentum, and the Crimson was unable to generate a shot for 15 consecutive minutes in the middle of the frame. It wasn’t until the 80th minute, when junior forward Tim Schmoll drew a foul in the box—a yellow card on Greg Seifert—and netted the ensuing kick, that Harvard drew within a goal.
“We were in a tough spot and had to fight back and had some phenomenal chances to tie it,” Lehrer said. “They guys fought hard but we didn’t convert it.”
The last ten minutes of the game were frantic, with a Harvard squad up a man and seeking the equalizing goal. The importance of the game—with the win, Princeton knocked Harvard from its perch atop the Ivy League to a tie with the Tigers for second—weighed on the outcome.
The Crimson fired off three shots in the final minutes, but could not convert. Sady had two shots ninety seconds apart with three minutes to go, but Hummel knocked both away.
Afterwards, Lehrer rued the missed chances, confident that the team could have completed the comeback if it had been able to finish one of its final chances.
“We kept creating chances and had a lot of chances to tie and go ahead,” Lehrer said. “The guys fought hard but we didn’t convert it. Had we scored that tying goal, I think we win that game.”

With the score knotted at 4-4 in the 81st minute, sophomore forward Midge Purce converted a penalty kick for what ultimately proved the winning goal as the women’s soccer team outlasted Princeton, 5-4, in a wild back-and-forth game on Saturday at Stevenson Field.
The victory keeps Harvard (9-3-2, 4-0-1) atop the conference standings and extends the Crimson’s Ivy League unbeaten streak to 13 games.
The Tigers (5-5-3, 2-2-1) appeared poised from the opening whistle to hand the Crimson its first league loss since 2012. Sophomore forward Tyler Lussi scored on the first shot of the contest just over a minute in to put Princeton ahead.
The tally put Harvard in an unfamiliar position, as it marked the first goal surrendered by the Crimson in Ivy League play this year.
For most of the half, Princeton clamped down and Harvard could not produce an equalizer against the physical Tiger defense. Princeton harassed the Harvard forwards and midfielders, specifically targeting Purce. The Crimson drew eight fouls in the period, and it was the final one of the frame that ended up getting Harvard back in the contest. Freshman midfielder Dani Stollar put home the free kick from senior Bethany Kanten with just three seconds left in the half to tie the game, 1-1.
“We played quite poorly in the first half,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We just weren’t matching the intensity of Princeton, weren’t first to any balls. We were just kinda hanging on, and just getting that goal with three seconds left in the half really changed everything.
Kanten, a former full-time goalkeeper who started one game in cage this season while also transitioning to midfield, had a career game for the Crimson. Less than three minutes into the second half, she found the back of the net on a free kick from 25 yards out to give Harvard a 2-1 lead and start an offensive flurry that saw both teams combine for five goals in 17 minutes.
“[Kanten] just needed more experience and more opportunities, and that’s what she’s gotten this year,” Leone said. “[Saturday] was a special day for her, because we were struggling and we were just looking for a spark. The combination of the fouls and her specialty of being an incredible set-play taker, it was a good combination for us.”
After Kanten’s tally, Princeton responded with a run of its own as Lussi scored her second goal of the game in the 53rd minute to even the score again. Just eight minutes later, Lussi completed her hat trick as the Tigers regained the lead.
While it took the Crimson almost an entire half to equalize after Princeton’s opening goal, the Crimson needed just 32 seconds after the Tigers’ third marker to knot the score at 3-3 on a tally by sophomore forward Joan Fleischman.
Harvard took its first lead of the second half on the second goal of the game for Kanten, this one a corner kick that curled into the net to put the Crimson ahead, 4-3.
After a deflected Princeton corner kick found goal to tie the game at four, the two squads entered the final ten minutes of the game with first place in the Ivy League still in the balance.
In keeping with the major theme of the game, the outcome was ultimately decided by a Tigers’ foul. The foul occurred in the box, resulting in the penalty kick by Purce that gave the Crimson the win.
Ultimately, Princeton’s strategy of limiting Purce and the rest of the Harvard offense through physicality seemed to backfire, as three of the Crimson’s goal came directly off free kicks and penalty kicks.
“Princeton definitely played physical, but we expected that just because every Ivy League game is a battle and we were ready for it.” Harvard co-captain Marie Margolius said. “We just tried not to let it rattle us and no matter what happened, we continued to play our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New England may have the NFL’s most successful team of the past decade, but if professional football’s return to Boston demonstrated anything Friday night, there is a long way for it to go inside the city limits.
In the first professional football game at Harvard Stadium since 1970, the Boston Brawlers—a new Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL) franchise—emerged victorious, 28-10, over the visiting Blacktips in front of a reported crowd of 3,265. The actual attendance did not appear to come close to that figure.
The FXFL, which debuted earlier in October, aims to become a feeder system for the National Football League. Unlike its companion leagues, the NFL has historically had no minor league akin to the NBA’s D-League or baseball’s affiliate system, leaving a tight bottleneck for players exiting the college ranks and looking for professional employment.
The most illustrious name to fall through the cracks Friday was Brawlers quarterback Tajh Boyd. The former Clemson star, who won the Orange Bowl nine months ago, played less than a quarter in the first half, throwing a 54-yard back shoulder fade to Jasper Collins for the team’s only touchdown of the half. Boyd added three more touchdowns in the second half, with former Florida running back Emmanuel Moody contributing 225 total yards, to break the game wide open.
Boyd was the highlight of a game that was otherwise sloppy, with numerous dropped balls and holding penalties delaying play throughout the first half. Blacktip quarterback Joe Clancy had perhaps the most difficult night of all, completing only 12 of 31 passes for 114 yards, with one touchdown, one interception, and nine dropped balls.
Boston moved to 1-2 with the victory, while the Blacktips fell to 0-2. The Brawlers will conclude its home season the following week against Brooklyn on October 31. The Blacktips are currently a traveling team with no home games scheduled.

If you’ve ever wandered through the Yard on Thursday afternoons, you’ve probably wondered why a bunch of Harvard students are out in front of Matthews digging away at a giant hole in the scorching sun gross misty rain. The answer to that question, simply put, is Anthropology 1130: Archaeology of Harvard Yard. But dig a little bit deeper and the story gets all the more intriguing.
Though the course description claims that the dig provides a “richer and more nuanced view of the 17th through 19th century lives of students and faculty,” another theory has been swirling around the yard. Have you ever speculated about what happened to that one guy who thought it’d be funny to jump off Weeks Bridge in broad daylight in plain view of a couple HUPD officers? Or maybe you’ve wondered about that suite in your entryway that was ad-boarded, but with seemingly no punishment? Here is where a stroll through the yard on Thursday afternoons is the answer. This is Anthropology 1130.
Ask a couple of students why they’re enrolled in the class, and you might hear some seemingly thoughtful responses.“It has a through the roof Q-Score!,” “It’s a concentration requirement,” but be skeptical, because once comments become anonymous, the truth comes out—and the Q never lies:
“You form strong bonds with other students through weekly physical labor!”Because there’s really no other way to do that. Right?
“Be ready to dig... a lot”And if you find something of interest to the Professor, do you get the next class off? Some secrets are too big to keep hidden.
“If you think worms are, like, totally gross, don't take this class”And if you find digging like, you know, totally annoying, and like gross, don’t take this class.
Unfortunately, Stanley Yelnats and Zero could not be reached for an interview. The Warden also declined to comment. Though the students may come from many backgrounds, their sentence remains the same: one shovel, one semester, and one giant hole.

What’s Halloween without a few spooky movies and TV shows to enjoy with friends? Here are a few Halloween classics to help you embrace the spirit of the season and procrastinate while studying:
The Twilight ZoneThis show is proof that American Horror Story didn’t invent scary TV. The Twilight Zone terrified our parents when it first aired in 1959, and now it’s our turn. For some creepy classics, try “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” (starring William Shatner) or “Eye of the Beholder.” All five seasons are available on Netflix, so the Zone is officially open to visitors.
Young FrankensteinOK, so this one might not be all that scary, per se. But scream junkies will be sufficiently weirded out by Gene Wilder’s hair and Marty Feldman’s eyes, while the rest of us enjoy the nonstop Mel Brooks comedy. Frau Blücher!
The Nightmare Before ChristmasTo all jaded souls out there, no one is too old to enjoy Tim Burton’s creepy-cute masterpiece. For full nostalgic effect, we recommend grabbing a cadre of friends and singing (or wailing) along.
Addams Family ValuesFor those of us who live further away and won’t be making the trip home for Thanksgiving, The Addams Family reminds us how quickly family gatherings can go south—especially when your nanny is a gold-digging serial killer, your baby has a moustache, and your cousin is a walking mass of hair.
GhostbustersWith rumors of a remake with an all-female cast flying around like slimy ghosts, now is the time to revisit this classic horror-comedy. Poltergeists, angry marshmallow gentlemen, and the catchiest theme song in modern memory make Ghostbusters a must-see for any Halloween movie night. Plus, even the best zombies have got nothing on Bill Murray’s deadpan stare.
Cabin in the WoodsWe recommend watching this one last. This is the horror movie that will forever change the way you watch horror movies. The premise: five college friends arrive for the weekend at a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. Just like every other slasher/zombie/mutant werewolf flick you’ve sweated through, right? We won’t spoil anything, but prepare to be surprised—and terrified.

Happy Monday, Harvard! If there’s anything that could cure the season’s unending midterm blues (besides Taylor Swift’s new album), it’s today’s gorgeous weather. The problem with fall days like these is that we always convince ourselves it’s the last one of the season—and end up spending it all outside and neglecting everything else. But let’s be real, is that really a bad thing? The papers and meetings can wait, but the sun definitely isn’t going to—a month from now, it’ll be dark outside by 4 p.m. Why not enjoy it for all the time it’s here? Give yourself a little extra time to walk to class in the morning to soak in some Vitamin D, or be a tourist/freshman during Opening Days and grab a seat on the chairs in the Yard or the steps of Widener as you check your email. Guitars/ukuleles an optional garnish. Live that college brochure dream, guys, today’s the day. Who knows when the next one will be?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
As mentioned above, today’s going to be absolutely gorgeous, with a high of sixty degrees and a forecast of sunshine, with 0% chance of rain all day! No excuse for the Monday blues.IN THE D-HALLS
