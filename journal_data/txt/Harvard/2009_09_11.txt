After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In order to hit the ground running after a nice, long summer, let’s consider a hypothetical. A group of representatives from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) walk into an advertising agency—say the firm from “Mad Men.” John Hamm’s character sits staring across the table, trying to act like he doesn’t want a cigarette, and he says to PETA, “Now tell me, who exactly would you like your ads to target? Because as of now, it seems to me you’re alienating some people.” The PETA people look to their point man. Their point man takes his glasses off. “That’s not our goal at all, “ he says. “We want to alienate everyone.” However ridiculous as this imagined scene may sound, it is the only way I am able to reconcile the classist content of PETA’s recent ad campaigns. PETA, whose Wikipedia page has probably been flagged for bias as often as the one on Scientology, is no stranger to controversy and the absurd. In their fight to protect animals, they have done everything from hurling paint on old women wearing fur to distastefully comparing chicken farming to Nazism and the Holocaust.With the rise of ubiquitous internet media though, PETA has refocused their attack on the mediums with the highest hit count: pornography and viral videos.Whether the cause be “Don’t Wear Fur” or “Don’t Eat Meat,” PETA has decided that one way they can get people’s attention is by showing pictures of naked women. One particularly fun one shows a nude Charlotte Ross of “NYPD Blue,” holding a rabbit, along with the slogan, “I’d rather show my buns than wear fur.” Or take their un-aired Super Bowl commercial from this year, which featured women essentially having sex with vegetables.Why does PETA want to exploit women for the sake of animals?“Save the Whales.” It may sound like a logical animal protection slogan that most people would agree with, right? WRONG! It was actually written on a billboard in Jacksonville, Florida accompanied by a picture of an overweight woman in a bikini and the words, “Lose the Blubber; Go Vegetarian.” I’m glad to see that PETA has now been able to not only publicly humiliate fat people into becoming vegetarians, but also to really take their objectifying sexism to the next level. Not to mention, the whole advertisement doesn’t really make logical sense. Together with this kind of degradation of women and whales, PETA has also begun creating it’s own viral videos. One of these, posted on FunnyorDie.com, is an interview starring Andy Dick as a cracked out version of Ronald McDonald. Though the primary target of the video is the fast food chain, there is still misplaced aggression toward innocent people--at one point comparing poultry factory workers to Oompa-Loompas followed by the line: “There are people who are obese, and they need their food.” Propaganda like this with its misplaced blame—shaming the individuals who eat fast food rather than just those who produce it—ultimately fails. There aren’t many people left in the world that think fast food is healthy, and I’m not going to argue that it is. However, there are many people for whom, because of lack of time or money, fast food is at times a necessity. Though it may not be the most economic decision for low-income families, McDonalds is a relatively cheap and easy way to eat. Instead of attacking the people who eat the fattening food, they could focus their attention on the factors that drive people to fast food in the first place—food labeling, false advertising, a government in the hands of a strong agriculture lobby, or the heads of big livestock and produce operations, who endanger consumers with genetically modified and hormone-enhanced products.If PETA were really smart, they would attack the system that forces the impoverished to choose fast food. They attack the livestock industry by portraying the working-class employees as bloodthirsty psychopaths, while ignoring the larger, more systematic problems with the status quo.I love animals, don’t get me wrong. My best friend is named Tuck; he’s my cat. I am also bothered as much as the next person by the thought or sight of animals being mistreated. But to ignore, objectify, or blame the six billion HUMANS on the planet—many of whom are suffering whether from poverty, malnutrition, starvation, obesity, or any number of other things—is simply unforgivable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does it take to steal a Rembrandt? Surely one must divert the museum guard’s attention, disable alarms, twist through zigzagging lasers and plan a smooth escape. At least so it would seem from art heist films like “The Thomas Crown Affair.” But, according to the infamous art thief Myles J. Connor, Jr., all you really need is the audacity to stride into a museum during open hours, grab a painting, and run like hell. 
He should know. He’s done it himself.	
“There was the romance of that kind of theft,” Connor says. 	
At various points in his life Connor has been a musician, a bank robber, and a cat burglar. He’s gotten into violent vendettas against Boston police, been put in jail, and broken out armed only with a gun carved out of soap. He even owned a pet cougar. But Connor is most notorious as a master of the art heist—so notorious that he was suspected of the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum while incarcerated. 
Connor—who estimates that he has pulled off 30 heists in his lifetime—enjoyed figuring out how to infiltrate museums. “There was the challenge of getting into these places,” he says. 
But in describing his adventures, he makes the “challenge” seem almost negligible. His memoirs, recounted in the new book “The Art of the Heist,” are thus vastly impressive despite their troubling implications. Connor’s anecdotes speak to the vulnerability of some of the most prominent galleries in the country—Harvard museums included—whose efforts to balance visitor safety with property protection do not always guarantee the security of the artwork.
“In reality,” Connor says, “there’s no museum in the country that couldn’t be taken down.”

MEETING THE MASTER
Connor is the son of a policeman and the great-nephew of a Hudson Valley painter. His family collected antiques, and he recalls learning about both them and art as a child. This early aesthetic education had more than practical importance. “I was brought up with the items and appreciated them,” he says. 
Connor’s background doesn’t bring to mind that of a master criminal. He was born and raised in Milton, an affluent Boston suburb, and is a personable, articulate, and intelligent man. “Are you aware of my SAT scores?” he jokes. “They’re very high.” Given a second chance, he claims he would have chosen a different career path. “I imagine that I would have been a good doctor,” he says. “I would have enjoyed being the curator of a museum.”
But Connor’s downfall was his rebellious streak. His teenage activities were disobedient but relatively harmless, involving the purchase of a Harley against his father’s will and running around with his rock band, Myles and the Wild Ones. 
Still, not all was innocent; the band did indirectly lead Connor into the circles of Italian mobsters, and he soon became involved in small-scale crime. “It wasn’t until my first successful museum robbery in 1965 that I began to think of myself as an actual criminal,” he writes. From then on, Connor traveled down a slippery slope to more heists and bank robberies. 
In several ways, Connor’s attractive personality served him well in art theft. The joint author of his book, Jenny Siler, reports that when she interviewed his partners in crime none of them would speak ill of him. “I have never in my life met someone who could engender such incredible loyalty,” Siler says. His sharp-eyed intelligence must have been another asset when it came to eluding security measures. “He thinks of things that other people wouldn’t think of,” Siler says, a quality that serves him well as both author and thief. Her other impressions of him as a co-author similarly summarize his attributes as an art thief: “He was very helpful, very pleasant. Smart. Capable.”
NOT THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR

Most of Connor’s art heist stories don’t sound like the movies. Rather, their main appeal lies in the amazingly low-tech and comical measures Connor used to break into museums.
The first heist Connor undertook, at the Forbes Museum, he accomplished on his own. After repeated visits to the place, he realized that the young night watchman consistently left the museum for hours at a time. “I waited until he went out,” he says. Connor further writes in his memoirs that he simply pried open a basement window and carried off what he wanted. He was 20-years-old and had no prior experience of heist.
Most of his other robberies also went smoothly, without tripping over security measures. “They could always be circumvented,” Connor says. He worked sometimes with associates and sometimes without, sometimes armed and sometimes unarmed. But with just a little research, a plan and—especially once he became notorious—a disguise, no museum ever undid him. “Every one I ever targeted I took down,” says Connor, who laughs at the idea of being caught.
Probably his most fascinating—and simplest—story is that of the Rembrandt. After robbing the Woolworth family estate in Maine, Connor found himself in trouble. A friend, John Regan of the Massachusetts State Police, made a throwaway quip that Connor took a little too seriously. “John said to me ‘Myles, to get you out of this situation, it’ll take a Rembrandt,’” Connor recalls.
Connor accepted the challenge. On April 14, 1975, he bought a ticket to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and walked in as a visitor. He was armed, disguised as a chaffeur and accompanied by one friend—although six more were in on the plan. With a getaway car waiting, Connor snatched a million-dollar Rembrandt portrait off the walls and ran out of the building. Having eluded capture, Connor then negotiated the return of the portrait for a lightening of a previous sentence.
Overall, Connor’s heists were well-planned and successful, but they were not ideological. He has nothing against museums in general and his vast knowledge of Japanese art once earned him an offer—while under the alias of Dr. Michael Joseph—of a curatorial position in the Asiatic art department of a gallery that he declined to name. He took a liking to the staff and decided against stealing any art from it. “They were personally attracted to the stuff and they were emotionally attached to it,” Connor says.
Moreover, Connor says that his museum heists were not malicious. “Anytime I took something major from the museum it was with the intent of giving it back,” he says—albeit at a profit to himself. Still, he does admit to keeping and selling many of the pieces that he stole. 

PITFALLS OF PROTECTIVE SECURITY
With such vast experience in art robbery, Connor has become well-versed in museum security. For example, he is keenly aware of the psychological importance of disguise. “People pay attention to outfits,” he says. “If you have a suit and a tie and you look like a professor, they treat you like a professor.” 
Connor also finds that American museums in particular lack important security measures. In various foreign countries, like Turkey, he claims that protection is better. “You have armed guards and then you have state-of-the-art alarms, and it would be very difficult to take down a museum like that,” he says. “They don’t have that in the U.S.” 
Without such measures, Connor avows that very few U.S. museums are safe from grab-and-run heists like his own at the MFA. “The only way they could prevent something like that from happening is if they had a security system—if you hit a button and the door would lock. Short of that, almost any museum in the country could be taken down in that fashion, as long as the stuff was accessible to the road.” He cites the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as one such vulnerable place.
Steven P. Layne, a member of the Museum, Library & Cultural Properties Council of the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS), corroborates his theory. “Basically if somebody’s going to grab something and run and they are strong-armed, most security officers in most applications—not just museums—are not prepared to deal with that.”
Moreover, Layne adds, all automatically locking doors of the sort Connor mentioned can be overridden by fire alarms.
In Connor’s opinion, museum security guards are also underpaid, unmotivated, and generally lack the sort of sentimental attachment that deterred him from stealing from the previously-mentioned gallery. He doubts that many guards would risk injury or death to protect the art within their galleries. “I think there are some that are foolish enough,” Connor says. “I mean, obviously, one pursued me down the steps of the MFA, but it depends on the individual.”
Siler likewise has little confidence in the security of valuable art kept in galleries. “The way that museums are portrayed in the movies as having this high-tech security, you know, really—laser beams, and metal doors that come down—for the most part that’s not true,” she explains, and she believes that an intelligent thief like Connor could do it all again. “There’s a lot of art that is still not protected.” 

THE FRAGILE HARVARD BUBBLE
Does Harvard do enough to protect the art throughout campus? 
The university boasts an impressive art collection of over 250,000 pieces, mainly kept within the walls of Harvard Art Museum, an organization that comprises the Arthur M. Sackler, Fogg and Busch-Reisinger Museums. The latter two buildings are currently closed for renovation and thus much of Harvard’s collection is presently in storage. 
According to one security guard at the Sackler who wished to remain anonymous because the museum has a strict policy against discussing security measures with the media, these stored pieces are well-secured with deadlocks on vaults keeping potential thieves out. This seems wise; Connor, for instance, has stolen much from storage rooms in his lifetime. “One of the rarest items and the most valuable items that I took was a Renoir,” he says. “That was from storage [and] was never reported missing.”
Museum spokesman Daron Manoogian says that beyond vaults or deadlocks, stored pieces are protected by other security systems as well, though he declined to name them, citing a policy not to comment on specific security measures. “A critical aspect of maintaining proper security for any museum is to keep all such measures strictly confidential,” he said in a statement.
The pieces on view in the Sackler, however, may be at greater risk considering they are—to use Connor’s own phrase—accessible to the road. According to the same guard, none of the security staff within the museum, including his own supervisor, is armed, though they have a direct line to the Harvard University Police Department. “If there is a problem that might entail violence we’re supposed to use our radio and say, ‘Hey, let’s get the HUPD over here,’” he explains. 
Security guards may not be chosen for their experience with art or security; another Sackler guard who also wished to remain unnamed because of the Museum’s press policy said they did not have any prior experience in security. The guard mentioned that all the Sackler security guards were given a day’s worth of training specifically focused on the protection of cultural items, but admits, “I kind of forgot what happened in the training.” Manoogian says that in addition to that training session, guards go through multiple other seminars over the course of a given year.
Instead of primary protectors of the art, the officers say they see themselves as guardians of visitors’ safety and sources of edifying information. “We’re sort of glorified ushers,” the first guard says. 
Thus the guards themselves—six for the entire Sackler—act as little more than a deterrent to art heist. Their training includes a little self-defense, but the guards interviewed say they could not stop an armed robbery. “Primarily it’s just being here as a presence to discourage theft,” the first guard says. “If they came in with arms, we would let them take it [the targeted piece] and call the authorities.”
Other security measures in the Sackler include surveillance cameras, silent alarms that are tripped by proximity to the art, and alarmed doors. Apparently, there are no remote operations of any of these doors; the guards suppose that they could be closed with a key in the case of an attempted theft and escape.
Finally, the artwork is firmly affixed to the walls to prevent grab-and-run heists. But without armed guards or remotely operable doors, would these measures be enough to deter a thief like Connor?
By ASIS’ standards, Harvard’s security measures are appropriate. Layne would not recommend that museums arm their guards or install doors that could be locked remotely. “There is very little need for a museum to have an armed guard,” he says. “You don’t want a gunfight in a museum.” And as for lockdown doors, “There are some legalities involved. You can’t trap someone in a place.” 
Fortunately, Harvard Art Museum—which according to Manoogian has a system of security measures in place that meets recommended practices for museum security—has never faced the embarrassment of a successful heist. Still, a few crimes have been attempted, according to one Sackler guard. One Degas showed subtle signs of being cut out of the frame, although the culprit was never caught in the act and disappeared among the crowd. 
The art that adorns other campus buildings like Memorial Hall and the upperclassman houses is less heavily protected.
According to Jade C. Gardner, a Memorial Hall staff member, the building is alarmed and under constant patrol surveillance. “Security does patrol this area during the day and during the night,” she says. Like the others, she cites the direct line to HUPD as a security asset. “We call them, they come right away,” she says. Still, Annenberg is filled with sculptures and paintings but appears to lack high-security doors; Gardner was also unsure as to whether or not the security guards were armed.
One Eliot House security guard, Muhammad R. Shams, avowed that no security guards he knew of carried weapons, including himself and all the other House guards. The upperclassman Houses do not have official security staff on duty during daylight hours, he says. They are watched only from 4 p.m. until 8 a.m., and in the interim, only building management and superintendents are present. 
If somebody did attempt to rob the House, the guard on duty may not be able to do all that much. “If I see it, I can stop it,” says Shams, who is more concerned with student protection than the portraits in the dining hall. The police would have to file a report and investigate themselves. “Those are the boundaries, the line between their job and our job,” Shams explains. Layne agrees: “It’s a job for the police, not the security to handle.” 
However, more localized attention might be worthwhile. Many of the Houses are only accessible through Harvard I.D. card swipe access, but some—like Kirkland House—are effectively open to the public during the day. In light of Connor’s comments, Harvard may essentially be vulnerable to heist. The proper protection of our art, as per Connor’s requirements, would require the installation of better technology. But perhaps museums, supposedly welcoming forums for public enjoyment of art, should not be threatening places with armed guards and heavy surveillance; movie-style defenses could avalanche into situations with less-than-picturesque consequences. Says one guard: “Our boss has... said he would not want anybody hurt over a piece of art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Times are changing at Harvard University. Last Thursday, the once pristine Harvard Yard, that manicured display of Ivy League tidiness and efficiency, transformed into a bona fide outdoor disco, fit for half-naked men in sheaths of glitter and metallic booty shorts. No, this wasn’t the unveiling of a new Harvard clothing line; it was the inaugural presentation of the Common Spaces initiative, featuring the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) latest theatrical extravaganza, “The Donkey Show,” a spin-off of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”“The Donkey Show” marks the first of many lunch-hour performances that will take place over the next two months as part of the initiative, which has been designed to provide more opportunities on campus for members of the Harvard community to connect; all members of the Harvard community are invited to sign up for a performance. Leading the effort is University President Drew Faust, who began working with the director of the University’s Planning Office, Tanya Latridis, soon after she became president; another project of Faust’s, the Arts Task Force, is working to integrate the arts more fully into the Harvard community. “The arts are a kind of common space, so I see those two different task forces as having a lot in common,” Faust said at the event. Both Common Spaces and its arts component are meant to foster communal interaction. “How do we share this community with one another in ways that bring us out of ourselves to connect? Physically, we haven’t done enough, but when you see those chairs and the way that people have started using them that says a lot, but we just have to provide the opportunity.”To work on this issue, Faust—the “coolest, baddest, hippest president in town,” according to the performers in “The Donkey Show”—created the Common Spaces Steering Committee, co-chaired by History Professor Lizabeth Cohen and Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi. The committee then delved into research and focus groups, polling students on the need for more spaces to facilitate social interaction.“In the focus groups, over and over again, people would say that the message they get when they walk through campus is ‘Keep moving. Don’t stop. Don’t talk to anybody,’” Cohen says. “I remember in one of the focus groups that a graduate student said something really poignant and sad. He said he knew Lamont is supposed to be for undergraduates, but it’s one of the only places he felt he could go and feel part of a university community.”The co-chairs’ first step toward solving this lack of communal space were the colorful chairs now placed throughout the Yard. According to Latridis, the minute the chairs were installed, people began flocking to them. “This is because there is a thirst for sitting and belonging,” Latridis says. “You don’t have to build a new building. You just put chairs out.”To celebrate the institution of these chairs, A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane Paulus ’87 suggested that the performers of “The Donkey Show”—the show she is currently co-directing with Randy Weiner—serve as hosts at the kick-off event. Both Faust and Paulus have been integral in highlighting the arts on the Harvard campus, and the problem of scarce common social spaces may be addressed in a way that could potentially benefit both initiatives.“You always see people just walking through the Yard. Now it becomes a place where people can stop. It really changes the dynamic, to be able to have the energy of the artists here, and Diane Paulus and the A.R.T. are such a big part of this,” says Lori Gross, Associate Provost for Arts.­The energetic cast of “The Donkey Show” certainly helped attract attention to the project. As they grooved and sang such classics as “We are Family,” a spontaneous dance party sprung up in the middle of the Yard, with participants ranging from toddlers to senior citizens.Included in the crowd of wide-eyed spectators was Paul McLaughlin, Assistant Dean at the College. “Faust is definitely kicking Common Spaces off with a very fun first day. I think it’s a great way to make people come out—look how many chairs are full. I’ve run into 15 colleagues already, and I’ve only been out here for 20 minutes,” he said. While walking by the dance party, Elizabeth G. Shields ’10 attempted to get the attention of her friend, who was taking part in it. “Let’s discuss our lives,” Shields called out. “I’m going to five hours of class, and you’re doing the funky chicken in the Yard.” As were many others; looking over at an elderly woman shimmying, wedged between two “Donkey Show” performers wearing black platform boots, red bell-bottomed suits, and giant black afro wigs, President Faust laughed, “Now, there’s a picture for ‘The Crimson.’”According to Paulus, the Common Spaces initiative reflects what she sees as one of the most important purposes of art. “The job of the arts is to wake people up and make them present in their lives,” she says. “You’re eating lunch...and all of a sudden, there’s this ‘happening’ and you’re dancing with people you don’t even know, and you feel alive. Maybe you didn’t a half an hour ago. It’s a fleeting, ephemeral moment, which is what theater is... It makes us recognize things in life and gives us an opportunity to have an exorcism—to laugh at it.” —Staff writer Mia P. Walker can be reached at mpwalker@fas.harvard.edu.

This year, the VES department welcomes 11 visiting faculty members, hailing from across the U.S., as well as Germany, Portugal, and Sweden. The Harvard Crimson spoke to three of them to get an idea of what they hope to bring to Harvard.Ted BarronTed Barron, film scholar and critic, was the Senior Programmer of the Harvard Film Archives from 2002-2007. He has served on the juries of film festivals including the Newport International Film Festival and is an editor for “The Straddler,” an interdisciplinary culture journal.The Harvard Crimson: How does it feel to be back at Harvard?Ted Barron: It’s actually kind of strange and very nice to be back in the Carpenter Center after having worked there for so long. I’ll be teaching the “Art of Film” and the “Sound Cinema” course, which I will enjoy very much, because they’re closely related to my work as a programmer. It’s linked to the act of discovery, putting together films that people aren’t always aware of or putting together different films that will change people’s viewing experience.THC: Can you tell us about your current work?TB: I’ve been very busy writing my dissertation; in fact, the paperwork’s going in this week. I’m writing about what I call performative realism in American independent cinema. I particularly focus on post-war realist films that straddle the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, of which Andy Warhol’s films are an example. People acting as themselves in his films often create a sense of uncertainty regarding their role as characters.The reason I call it performative realism is that one of my goals is to shift the focus to the study of performance. There are always acts of performance going on in the documentary process, but they are often veiled.Carlin E. Wing ’02Carlin Wing, who will teach “Introduction to Still Photography” this fall, is currently working at the Open Art Performance Festival in Beijing, bouncing squash balls off Olympic architecture. After graduating from Harvard with a joint degree in VES and Social Anthropology, Wing became a photographer. She currently examines spaces such as elevators or parking lots as sites for play and social interaction and spoke to The Crimson via email.THC: Can you tell us about your artistic developments after graduating from college?Carlin Wing: After college I spent some time playing on the professional squash tour. When I started my graduate studies at CalArts I no longer had time to train and compete, but the sport began to make its way into my artwork as subject matter. THC: What made you participate in the Open Art Performance Festival in Beijing this fall?CW: When I was young, I wanted more than anything to be in the Olympics. Of course squash wasn’t an Olympic sport then and it isn’t now. But it wants to be, and this connection made it possible to create an iteration of “Hitting Walls” (the title of an ongoing series of works around squash) in Beijing with the Olympics as the connecting thread. When I hit squash balls in hallways or elevators or parking lots it is about stretching the definition of the sport—tying its origins in British prisons and alleyways and boarding schools to its current spectacular global form.Michele ZalopanyMichele Zalopany is a returning visiting faculty member and will teach her last term of “Watercolor Painting” this fall. Born in Detroit in 1955, her work centers around the social and political themes of her childhood. Her paintings, done in a photographic style, depict American people and iconography. They are included in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.THC: How has your Detroit background influenced you?Michele Zalopany: Growing up there, I experienced the racial riots. My dad was a union worker with United Auto Workers. He was an idealist, he was probably a child laborer, and that’s why he chose the work that he did. Also, he was Hawaiian and grew up in Hawaii. He was a big influence on me.I look back to things that are really important to me—where I grew up and seeing buildings that were ruined. I would drive through the city, looking at abandoned mansions, and wonder why they were like that or who lived there. And so, originally my work had to do with lamentations of things that were gone—erasures of places.I also had a big epiphany about this whole idea of Detroit as utopia. My work has a lot to do with utopia and dystopia.THC: What new projects are you developing?MZ: On display at the Carpenter Center are three watercolors that were based on depictions of Hawaiian women circa 1860. I was interested in what Hawaiian women looked like before races became mixed in Hawaii, as well as this mythology of the hula girl, which is another paradise, a utopian situation. These pictures are masculine and primitive-looking. I’m also interested in the hegemony of the photographers and filmmakers; they took on the role of imperialists coming into indigenous lands to represent people devoid of a personal or cultural history. I’ve also just had this flash about the Abu Ghraib torture scandal. These guys were hazed and forced to perform sex with each other; the photographs are shocking. And all of a sudden I realized that they’re wearing hula skirts and coconut bras. [The guards are] making this equation with being wild and primitive. It’s a dark side of how white people relate to other cultures.The New Visiting Faculty Exhibition is on display at the Carpenter Center until September 26.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new era of literature began and was buried before the English-speaking world could blink. Roberto Bolaño was the last great visionary of the twentieth century, a scion who fulfilled his destiny in a way that no other writer possibly could. Or at least that’s what the world wants to believe. After Bolaño received the Rómulo Gallegos Prize (Latin American fiction’s most coveted award) for his first major novel, “The Savage Detectives,” in 1999, the Spanish-speaking literary world had already canonized him. It took that book’s release in English in 2007 (translated by Natasha Wimmer for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, four years after Bolaño’s death due to liver failure) and the rumor of his posthumous final masterpiece, “2666,” to do as much in the rest of the world. Those two novels, massive in their respective scope and ambition, are dazzling and formidable to be sure. His was a new language in fiction; a language of the possible, of poetry vibrating in an uncertainty more readily comparable to that of Franz Kafka than Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel García Márquez. A revolutionary and a giant to be sure; but beneath the earth of the legend there was once a man. The latest in a series of impeccable translations by Chris Andrews from New Directions Press, his haunting first book, the crime novel “The Skating Rink,” in turns acknowledges the legend’s humble beginnings and prefigures the heights that he would eventually attain.His career began in earnest in the Mexico City of the early 70s, where he fashioned a small cabal of radical leftist poets called the “infrarealismo,” more memorable for their wild and futile gestures against the popular Latin and South American poets they detested than any of the poetry they actually produced. Among the many enigmas surrounding his life (including penchants for violence and hard drugs, neither encouraged nor disavowed by Bolaño in his lifetime), it was his participation in and imprisonment during the resistance against Generalissimo Augusto Pinochet’s military putsch in the author’s native Chile that attracted a cult-like following. That experience, perhaps more than any other single one in his life, would resonate throughout his fiction. After disbanding the infrarealists, Bolaño drifted into further obscurity in Europe, working odd jobs and writing poetry sporadically into his early 40s. This early period would become the subject matter for “The Savage Detectives,” his first long novel. More sensitive to the need for a more substantial living through literature after the birth of his first son, Bolaño began writing fiction full-time.“The Skating Rink” is only a crime novel in the loosest sense. Like all of his novels, with the exception of “2666,” it begins under the pretense of a conventional plot whose conventions, either totally diminish or, like in Beckett, become so absurd as to be rendered superfluous. The narrative perspective alternates fluidly between its three protagonists: Gaspar Heredia, a Mexican night watchman at a camp ground in the Spanish coastal town of Z; Remo Morán, a Chilean novelist running several businesses in the town; and Enric Rosquelles, a deputy to the mayor of Z. The seemingly tenuous connections between the three men wind progressively tighter around a pair of vagrant women and a beautiful Spanish figure skater. A voracious reader in general and an avid fan of popular cinema and genre fiction, Bolaño punctuates the beginning of a long penchant for the referential with an invocation of detective novels: “Anyway, as Hans Henny Jahn, I think, once wrote: if you find a murder victim, better brace yourself, because the bodies will soon becoming thick and fast…”The centerpiece of “The Skating Rink,” Bolaño’s first novel, is an idiosyncratic narrative structure and style that the novelist would expand upon and perfect in “The Savage Detectives.” Each narrative point of view takes the tone of a one-sided interview, or a stream-of-consciousness deposition. The men in question fill their winding explanation of the events during that summer in Z leading up to the murder (the novel’s supposed central event that, in actuality, is a sort of narrative telos) with a sort of chaotic abandon more befitting of a soliloquy in a surrealist play: “I felt trapped; I should have been at work by then, and Remo’s gaze reared up like ectoplasm and hit me between the eyes, or that’s how it felt, but in fact it was a sleeper’s or a dreamer’s gaze—he didn’t seem to be listening to the suntanned guys, and at the time I thought, Either he’s critically ill or he’s very happy.” It is this obsession with digression that will become Bolaño’s signature, but at this early stage in his career it isn’t yet totally effective; it never transcends its context (as it will as early as his next novel, the highly experimental “Nazi Literature in the Americas”), so much as justifies it. “2666” will comprise context that itself is transcendent, but that masterpiece is still over a decade away.The novel excels in other, albeit minor places. There are moments of startling insight, however distracted it may be—“We all have to die a bit every now and then and usually it’s so gradual that we end up more alive than ever. Infinitely old and infinitely alive.” There are also moments of humor— “It was simply that he didn’t fool me with that world-weary, seen-it-all manner of his. So he’d been through a war. So he’d been on TV a couple times. So his dick was a foot long. God almighty! I’m surrounded by a pack of rabid dogs!” But what makes the novel so exciting in hindsight is its overture—the first and perhaps the only significant one—to “2666.” That overture is its brush with the stuff of the latter’s dark invisible center: namely, terror. Bolaño’s vision of a small Spanish tourist town still firmly in the grip of Francisco Franco’s guardia civil is political in its subtlety; “The Skating Rink” never pushes up against the brutal reality of fascism except in the most banal ways, and only when it serves the perfunctory plot. Bolaño raises his most intense and deeply esoteric criticism, not against the contemptible and defrauding bureaucrat Rosquelles, but against a more sinister and radical system, both bound up in and other from the political: “I remember during my second year in Z, the body of a teenage girl, almost a child, was found in a vacant lot; she’d been killed and raped. The killer was never found. Around that time there was a series of murders, all fitting the same pattern; they began in Tarragona and moved up the coast, leaving a trail of bodies (girls killed and raped, in that order) all the way to Port Bou, as if the killed was a tourist on the way home, but a very leisurely tourist, because a whole summer season elapsed between the first and the last of the crimes.” It’s in murders like these, indiscriminate and sexual crimes against women, magnified a hundredfold and transplanted to a fictionalized Ciudad Juárez, that constitute the heart of “2666.”But “The Skating Rink” falls short—dramatically, unequivocally short—of locking eyes with that heart. In truth, it mirrors more faithfully a story by Guillermo Martínez called “Vast Hell”; a beach community scours the dunes for the bodies of an adulterous couple supposedly murdered by a jealous couple. When body parts discovered in a sequestered part of the dune are revealed to be the traces of a mass grave authored by the region’s secret police, the townspeople quickly and mechanically rebury the remains. “The Skating Rink,” with its project still so modest, can only be that reburial.—Staff writer Ryan J.

If the words “curriculum vitae” set you shuddering with career anxiety, Yoel Hoffmann’s new work goes a long way to remind you of their original meaning—the “course of life.” While the content of Hoffmann’s “Curriculum Vitae” traces the curvature of a rich but not wildly unusual life, the unfettered poetry by which he conveys his experiences buoys the text into the realm of the genuinely distinctive. Hoffmann underscores his intimacy with the story, which closely parallels his own life, by sharing his name with the narrator. The reader enters the narrator’s life during the 1940s. Living in what would become Israel, Hoffmann’s mother dies in the first line while British soldiers mill around the fringes of his memory. As is his wont, the speaker transmits his reactions to the moments that are most eventful by way of the images he recalls alongside them. The memories that tie themselves to his mother’s death, his time in a children’s home, and his father’s remarriage are mostly grim—young, scarred legs and bodily worms abound. But his frankness, perhaps the book’s most noteworthy quality, permits the often-comic process of learning to temper the bleak surroundings he sometimes faces. We watch his evolution through adolescence, transmitted in extremely spare formulations that one hesitates to call prose. It might be a good time to again call attention to the title; Hoffmann offers succinct summations, highlighting the most important images as the narrator perceived them, not in the way that the form of the conventional novel dictates. Each sentence (only one or two of which will ever dwell on the same topic) is marked by innovative precision and great affection for the subject matter. Sometimes Hoffmann is blatantly avant-garde. Titled doodles highlight seemingly random phrases from the text, there are no page numbers to be found, and the speaker adopts the royal “we” for a period (though not without specifying parenthetically each time that what he means is “I”). But the work is so moving not because of these eccentricities but rather because of the artfulness with which Hoffmann articulates the smallest events. “Stairwells make us weep,” he says, “And small kitchens. Sometimes you see a fork and you just want to die. There is no limit to the beauty of things.” What might seem overblown out of context is actually the ardent crescendo at the end of a string of meditations. The lull of this rising and falling of register is at times almost powerful enough to obscure the story. Hoffmann marries, has children, comes to love Japanese culture, and eventually becomes a professor, writing all the while. The different planes of the story—Rabbi Kook Street in Ramat Gan, Japan, Amsterdam—drift hazily into one other. When he halts the waves of meditation for more concrete narrative material, the tongue-in-cheek presentation suggests that dabbling in the realm of standard exposition is another of his little experiments. The University of Haifa, for example, is an index of the expected, so he can be flippant with the details: “People walk about with names like Kaplinksi or Eshtahaul or Bar-Ziva, and girls walk around in various colors, and all enter and exit rooms with the number 526 or 3002,” he writes. But in time, he reveals that a code of some kind underlies his authorial choices. He alludes to the birth of his children, pointing to the bud of the “true” story then placing it deferentially aside. One does not get the sense that the sparseness of the secondary characters is simply a matter of avoiding lawsuits or friendly respect for privacy. It seems that, for Hoffmann, if the truth may also belong to someone else, he cannot presume to offer the definitive version and so will deliberately stray. He is fundamentally concerned with honest communication, and he beautifully distills the small revelations from the events of his particular life. To read “Curriculum Vitae” is to briefly shadow the patterns of a remarkable mind. When Hoffman’s Japanese teacher eventually commits suicide, he next recalls a woman from the Association of Soldiers’ Mothers who drowned while crossing the Jordan. By specifying that fish devoured them both, he illuminates the link between them. Mortality does not leave Hoffmann’s mind for long, but the myriad ways he acknowledges the presence of death give the text sustained gravity without making it oppressive. The book is not suspenseful; lives move in their immutable arcs, but he captures the beautiful intersections of these solitary shapes exquisitely. The temptation to allegorize his story looms as large as the historical-political context contained therein. But Hoffmann’s narrative looks so thoughtfully inward that it seems unjust to dilute the quality of this introspection with politics. Hoffmann creates an impressionistic, hypnotic representation of the content of a human life. His account is marked by a powerful sense of wonder at his surrounding planet, at the karmic electricity that seems to flow through it and, less overtly, at his own capacity for growth. Though humorous and often irreverent, this curious cocktail of recollections is a penetrating piece of wisdom. He takes the opportunity to show the reader something true, even if here or there the details have been changed, and this account brims with compassion. He explains, “If I were able (by means of a deeper covenant than that which exists between author and reader) to fall to people’s necks and say to them ‘Come, let’s sit while the tea is steeping, then drink, and you’ll tell me about your lives and I will tell of mine,’ I’d toss this manuscript into the trash and do precisely that. In such a world the law would forbid the making of fiction.” We should not be so disappointed that such a world does not presently exist.—Staff writer Amanda C. Lynch can be reached at aclynch@fas.harvard.edu.

“Part detective novel, part scientific investigation, and part journalistic exposé with a dark, destructive love story at its center.” It’s a tough marketing description for even the finest author to live up to. Jorge Volpi’s “Season of Ash,” translated from the Spanish by Alfred MacAdam, does indeed offer a unique scientific analysis of human behavior and a character list ample enough to facilitate countless love stories. But while Volpi’s literary conceit is ambitious enough, and his ideas occasionally intriguing, his hackneyed prose and contrived analysis diminish his message.    Volpi’s account of the shocking socio-political events of the late 20th century percolates through the narrative of Yuri Chernishevsky, whose enigmatic past is gradually unmasked, revealing uncanny links to other characters halfway around the world. Yuri is the common thread among three women who form the epicenter of Volpi’s overly complex tale, but its intricacies only flimsily conceal its lack of narrative integrity. While each woman’s personal travails are intertwined with major world events like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the undertaking of the Human Genome Project, nothing except the basic chronology of their situations and Yuri’s periodic involvement connects them. Volpi gives us a preview of a formidable Soviet biologist who loses her loved ones, first to the cruelty of communism and then to the charm of capitalism; a conflicted IMF negotiator who “comport[s] herself like a government bond”; and a dangerously dispassionate Hungarian computer scientist who attracts men easily and abandons them even more effortlessly. All three face the challenge of watching others be engulfed by impulsive greed, betrayed by the very emotional defenses they once sought to construct. The novel’s failure, however, to carefully develop these individual subplots results in a storyline wholly devoid of momentum. Volpi comingles his characters with historical figures that invariably outshine the author’s creations. We are drawn more to Volpi’s sarcastic spin on Stalin and other Cold War stars than to Volpi’s own half-hearted original cast, whose members are clearly little more than vehicles for Volpi’s heavy-handed, utterly sterile critique of greed and the postmodern loss of individual identity. Even if Volpi intended for the storyline to play second fiddle to his socio-political commentary, poor character development renders these auxiliaries distracting and unnecessary at best.The decidedly scientific lens that Volpi employs to dissect human nature, however, partly compensates for the novel’s lack of unique, believable characters; in “Season of Ash,” the unbendable laws of biology and genetics govern emotional decision-making. Volpi’s three women each dismiss emotion as an impractical figment of reality, for “feelings are the lingering misgivings of evolution, a pathology of intelligence, in the best case a self-preservation manual.” The novel frames love in terms of the primitive evolutionary drive to perpetuate genes, an attitude whose approach resonates throughout much of the story. While Volpi’s motif of genes as deterministic prime-movers offers an insightful line or two, his prose otherwise lacks vigor and ingenuity. Volpi draws heavily from a repository of borrowed metaphors and personifications–riding on Conrad’s coattails to describe humans “embarking on a trip into the heart of darkness” is not quite so entrancing the second time around. Especially in light of Volpi’s notable ability to transition rather effortlessly between assuming the colloquialisms of post-Communist Russia and the jargon of American capitalism, one wonders why an author with such a nuanced command of language would resort to clichés so elementary in composition. Volpi rounds out his scattered and unsatisfying account of 20th century history with a flurry of fictional accidents and tragedies that he seems to downplay as simple “proof of the irrationality of the future, the name we humans give to entropy.” Perhaps Volpi diminishes the significance of his character’s individual tragedies for the very purpose of making his point, but his failure to give us any reason to care about the characters who fall victim to tragedy renders his strategy ineffective.  Despite a lackluster descriptive strategy and a mediocre voice, “Season of Ash” provides some striking scientific explanations for the socio-political disasters of the past and takes a faithfully journalistic approach to exposing capitalism gone corrupt. Volpi asks some ambitious questions, but he does not answer them or even presume to–one wonders why he curtailed his analysis and commentary at this cursory level. While this hefty book disappoints in the context of its wandering, subpar storytelling, Volpi’s prolific ideas and occasional bent for powerful language should not preclude him from meeting more success with his next attempt.—Staff writerMonica S.

When an organization can’t raise any money, it renames the campaign and hopes for a miracle. At least, that seems the plan of the UC Capital Campaign, which has split off its fundraising campaign from the UC after a lackluster performance over the summer that generated a paltry $700 for a student center.It’s not surprising that the UC found itself in this unenviable position in the first place: We were skeptical when we heard the campaign’s lofty aspirations last spring and have never expected much from the plan. The Capital Campaign’s goal to raise $6 million to finance the potential purchase and renovation of a property at 45 Mount Auburn Street seemed particularly unrealistic in a cutthroat economic climate unfavorable to raising capital for any venture. When the university itself is struggling to find donations, attempting to solicit millions of dollars for a student center seems foolish.Now the fallout of failure will begin, and the UC can only blame itself. While its plan may have been well intentioned—improving social space on campus is an important issue—the UC was in over its head and now must accept that its credibility will suffer. Now the campaign will continue under the direction of the Student Community Center Foundation, but with an even slimmer possibility of success, facing the same hurdles as before but with less legitimacy. At the same time, the effort implicitly carries the UC’s stamp of approval, involves UC members, and was founded with UC resources, so the ongoing failure of this project will continue to damage the UC’s reputation.And even if this new iteration of the campaign somehow manages to raise money, we are wholly unconvinced that the property at 45 Mount Auburn Street is the solution to Harvard’s social space woes. The UC, and the College at large, should look to more immediate, pragmatic ways to improve social space, such as focusing on house life. Given the financial realities, we have to work with the budget constraints clearly at play.To that extent, we urge students to look at resources already in place, such as Hilles—a space with promising options that gets underutilized because of its Quad location. Looking to the future, the administration should not forget the possibility of transforming the Inn at Harvard—which is owned by the university and may be repossessed by the end of the decade—as a long-term option for a large, comprehensive student center.In the meantime, we can only look at this new twist in the UC Capital Campaign story and say again: This is not working.

On Wednesday night, during the commercial breaks of “So You Think You Can Dance,” I caught a few minutes of U.S. President Barack Obama delivering perhaps the finest speech he’s ever given. The jury is still out on whether his leave-it-to-Congress strategy was the smart way to go about reforming America’s dysfunctional health-care system, but there is little question that in his speech he assumed leadership over the nearly century-long effort to provide health insurance to every American man, woman, and child. Sometime in the very near future, Obama will be able to lay claim to fixing health care. 
Whatever your feelings about his politics, you can’t accuse Obama of shying away from complex or contentious issues in his speech. By contrast to the Republican response, which treated its audience like a bunch of third graders, Obama spoke candidly about the public option, tort reform, and acrimony in Washington. He hit all the right notes when speaking about the proper role of government in America, dropping his Post Office versus FedEx analogy to justify the public option in favor of a comparison that likens the public option to public universities.
And yet, despite how great his speech was, it’s surprising that the most important sound bite wasn’t his own. The line that has been repeated over and over on cable news for the last two days belongs to Joe Wilson. 
Wait, who the f*** is Joe Wilson? 
Wilson is the South Carolina Republican congressman who shrieked out “You lie!” just as the president was chastising Republicans for their venomous partisanship throughout the health-care debate. At the urging of the Republican leadership, though much to the regret of Rush Limbaugh, Wilson apologized to the president almost immediately following the comment. But the damage had been done. For any centrist or fence-sitter watching at home, Wilson’s outburst confirmed that Republicans have nothing else in mind than to kill the health-care bill for purely political reasons. His comment galvanized fiscally conservative Democrats to support the president’s bill and heightened the sense of despondency among those Republican congressmen and senators who BBMed and Tweeted on their BlackBerries throughout the speech. 
But what’s most amazing to me as a young person trying to make sense out of the health-care saga is that, basically overnight, Joe Wilson made himself a central player in the health-care debate. His name may fade from the front pages in a couple of days, but his outburst will have left an indelible mark on the process. 
Why is it so amazing to me that one comment out of left field could have such a strong impact on the health-care debate? Because reforming health care is an extremely complex process that involves vast sums of money and influence peddled by huge industries and massive institutions. It seems unlikely or perhaps incorrect that a marginal individual like Wilson could have such a significant impact on the process. But this is the lesson that the Joe Wilson incident teaches us. The outcome of this plan turns on the actions of just a few individuals. Wilson may never be more than a footnote in the story of how Barack Obama passed health-care reform, but so much of the outcome will be determined by equally unlikely heroes. Who would have imagined that Max Baucus, the fiscally conservative Democratic senator from Montana, would one day be leading Democratic efforts in the upper chamber? Or that Kathleen Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas, would effectively serve as the White House’s health-care czar? Both of those jobs had been more or less reserved for Ted Kennedy ’54-’56  and Tom Daschle respectively, who would have been stronger proponents of a more liberal bill and tougher negotiators with Republicans. How different would the course of health care been under their leadership?
That isn’t to say it all comes down to personalities; once-in-a-generation issues like health care are still shaped by the special-interest groups in question—in this case, the pharmaceutical industry, doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies. But it’s important to recognize that, a year ago, you could never have predicted that many of the political players currently involved would be leading the charge on health care. Who knows exactly what effect this will have on the final outcome. But Wilson, the most prominent Joe since Joe the Plumber, will have left his mark.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our bus rumbled along a dirt road into the village. The earth was brown and parched because rain had not yet come, but the women who were clad in saris came out to greet us, smiling.
The women in this rural village in the Indian state of Gujarat were members of the Self-Employed Women’s Association and are living proof that economic development and women’s empowerment go hand in hand. We were a group of Harvard affiliates in a group called the Alba Collective that hopes to sell products made by SEWA members in western markets. As we sat on the floor of a two-room house, the women told us their stories. 
One woman, named Joomiben, told us that she was born into the untouchable caste and spent the first 20 years of her working life as a migrating day laborer, transporting bricks and mud on her head for about 10 cents a day. When she joined SEWA 10 years ago, she was given the opportunity to do embroidery work for a salary. With her income, she was able to finance the construction of her own house for herself and her family. Because of her ability to make money, her life and the lives of her family members have been completely transformed.
SEWA and similarly focused organizations throughout the developing world are working toward widespread social change through women’s empowerment. Improving the plight of half the world’s population, especially through education and vocational training, is increasingly seen as one of the most effective ways of fighting poverty, disease, and even religious fundamentalism. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a point of visiting women’s organizations and talking with women about their lives during her summer trips to India and Africa. When she addressed members of SEWA in Mumbai in July, she noted, “We simply will not make progress in our world if we leave women behind.” As both Clinton and noted New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof emphasize, the world must pay attention to the well-being of half of the world’s population for society to effectively fight against its fundamental problems. 
In many parts of the world, women are inhibited in all aspects of their lives because of their gender. Sex-selective abortions continue to be a problem in many parts of India and China, and female literacy rates throughout the developing world are markedly lower than those of men. In traditionally patriarchal communities—not only in the Middle East but also in Africa and Asia—women are not permitted to leave their homes or show their faces in public. The United Nations International Labor Organization estimates that over 12 million women are working as sex slaves at any given time. Rather than letting these problems go unacknowledged, increasing focus on liberating women from restrictive environments and educating them even in simple ways, such as basic first aid, will allow a huge percentage of the world’s population to contribute to forming solutions for the world’s greatest challenges. Otherwise, they will continue to be victims of problems such as chronic poverty without being able to effectively take care of themselves.
Raising the status of women in many communities requires a multifaceted approach because gender discrimination is ingrained in so many parts of everyday life. SEWA, for example, provides vocational training in a huge number of different trades so women can earn their own incomes. Reading and writing are essential for even basic things, like reading the numbers on buses and the prices in stores; therefore SEWA started literacy programs and its own university for younger members. It schools women in basic first aid and provides counseling and child support for widows. It has established its own bank because no other banks will cater to poor women and provides them with loans so that they are able to get small entrepreneurial endeavors off the ground. 
There is also much room for outside support in new and innovative ways. SEWA’s commercial branch, the Trade Facilitation Center, employs women to do fine embroidery work on clothing and upholstery products, which are then sold to high-paying markets and the profits are channeled back to the women. The Alba Collective teamed up with this fair-trade endeavor and is now trying to attract high-end, western designers to buy SEWA products. The profits would go directly back to the women artisans.
Ultimately, the best approach is simply to allow women throughout the world to the freedom and ability to help themselves. As Clinton said, “The most reliable forum of economic and social progress is the self.” The more women are able to fight discrimination and think critically, the more they can contribute to solving the world’s problems. All that needs to be done is to tap into the world’s largest population of unused talent.

Though students looking to occupy their January days with classes on writing or foreign languages won’t be able to find them at Harvard College, they will be able to find them elsewhere in Cambridge—at the Harvard Extension School. As part of a pilot program this upcoming January, the Extension School will be offering 14 different courses on topics including Elementary French, Introduction to Food Writing, and The American Revolution in Boston.Each course will last three weeks, beginning January 5 and running until January 22.While students from the College and other schools in the University may enroll in the Extension School’s January courses, students will be responsible for paying their own tuition, and any credits they earn will not count toward their degree.According to Extension School spokeswoman Linda A. Cross, instructors were allowed to submit proposals for courses they would be interested in teaching, and the school selected courses that could be offered in an intensive format.“Courses that involve research papers and projects, for example, wouldn’t work,” Cross wrote in an e-mail.Marlon D. Kuzmick, an Expository Writing preceptor who plans to teach “Multimedia Communication: Principles of Visual Rhetoric” during the January Session, said that he thought that instructors teaching during January have to be particularly attentive to how difficult it might be for students with full-time jobs to take long classes that meet frequently. “That said, I believe that the compressed character of the course will offer students the opportunity to achieve a degree of focus that is simply not possible in a once-weekly class,” Kuzmick wrote in an e-mail.Cross said that the school has previous experience working with intensive classes, such as the four week English-language courses the school has offered in January and early February during recent years.College officials announced last April that the College would not be offering programming for undergrads this upcoming January, and students hoping to stay on campus during January must submit an application before Oct. 15. Interim Dean of Advising Inge-Lise Ameer said that College students hoping to take courses at the Extension School will not be given campus housing in order to enroll.—Staff Writer Lauren Lauren D.

After spending eight weeks at the University of Cambridge, Rui Wang ’11 has fine-tuned a third ear—one she hopes might someday help explain complex human behaviors like the struggle to quit smoking.
“One of the main problems in psychological research is that it is hard for researchers to be unobtrusive observers,” Wang said. “The EAR (short for Electronically Activated Recorder), which looks like a PDA, randomly records audio snippets of your day without your knowing.”
The research team at the Institute of Public Health, where Wang worked this summer, hoped to determine the feasibility of using the device in behavioral health intervention, especially to stop smoking. 
Ten participants—who are regular smokers—consented to wearing the device, which captures two and a half minute clips every hour. Before returning the EAR to the researchers, participants had the option of deleting any recordings they didn’t want heard, Wang said. The audio files were then transcribed and coded to determine any common themes in participants’ conversations, locations, and activities related to smoking.
“We tested the EAR device by wearing it around the lab,” Wang said. “After a few hours, you forget that it is there and go about your day normally.”
The study received ethical approval last year but needed someone to lead the project to get it off the ground, Wang said. She contributed to the various phases of research, including recruiting participants, setting up the devices, and continuing to transcribe the data while at Harvard.
Wang worked in the General Practice and Primary Care Research Unit under the guidance of Director and Professor of Behavioural Science Stephen Sutton and research assistant James Jamison.
Jamison, whose research involves the use of text messages in preventing smoking, led a second part to the study. By sending participants motivational and informational text messages at the beginning of each recording period, he said, the researchers could use the EAR to hear initial reactions and feedback.
Future studies may involve introducing a non-smoker group, and comparing their audio snippets with those of the smoker population, said Wang.
“This is very valuable research, and Rui has been a great asset to us this summer,” said Jamison.  “We anticipate recording our findings and submitting the results to some journals.”
“I’m very interested in behavioral economics and public health,” said Wang, who has been involved with social science research since high school and hopes to attend medical school after graduating. “I was looking to do clinical work, and go abroad. This internship combined both.”

When Francisco N. Alvarez ’11 decided to work at a Miami hospital the summer after his freshman year, he had no idea that a year later, he would be present at Spain’s first cardiac transplant employing the Berlin Heart device, a German-made artificial heart. The transplant took place at El Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon in Madrid, where Alvarez spent this past summer working as a clinical intern. “We put [the Berlin Heart] into one of my patients—by one of my patients, I mean a guy who I had seen from the day he came into the hospital,” Alvarez said. “The transplant worked...[but] it ended really sadly. He died of complications.” The experience was one of many that Alvarez said made him realize how much he valued clinical medicine. “I love the patient interaction,” he said. During the previous summer in Miami, Alvarez met Valentin Fuster, the acclaimed Spanish cardiologist. And through Fuster, he landed the internship in Spain. “I was a strange creature because in Spain it’s not really common for undergrads to do observerships or shadowing or anything like that,” Alvarez said. “At the end of the day many of the nurses would just call me ‘Doctor.’” Alvarez said he had much more opportunity to be involved in medical procedures in Madrid than in his previous internship in the United States. “I was basically a sub-resident in that I didn’t have all the knowledge but I was really hands-on with the patients and going behind the scenes,” he said. Among the techniques that Alvarez learned were how to perform a complete cardiac check-up and how to read an electrocardiogram, which shows electrical activity in the heart. He also worked with a preventative health program. But apart from practical knowledge, Alvarez said that the most meaningful aspect of his experience was interacting with patients. “I was in the post-op ward a day or two before I left and [one of my patients] said, ‘One of these days you have to come visit me...’” Alvarez said. “He told me he’ll remember me.” Alvarez said he is still deciding whether to pursue clinical medicine or focus on research. The internship was funded by the Weissman International Internship Program through the Office of Career Services, which the OCS Web site says is designed “to help foster Harvard College students’ understanding of the global community.” —Staff writer Anita B.

In Peru, they learned that splashing urine in ears promotes wellness. In China, they went on a tour of a hospital devoted entirely to traditional medicine, where Chinese doctors prescribe herbs in lieu of pills.
But that was never the plan.
By mid-April, Michael T. Henderson ’11 and Tom Z. Wang ’11 appeared to be headed for every Harvard student’s nightmare: a summer unmarked by resume-building activities.
For months, they had planned to attend an exchange program at Oxford, and were banking on Harvard funding to help foot the $10,000 bill.
Then their funding request was rejected. Coming up with the cash was out of the question—and their plans went bust.
But Henderson wasn’t ready to resign himself to a mall job.
He walked down Mt. Auburn Street one afternoon, en route to his job at Mass. General, but detoured into STA Travel on a whim, rattling off a list of countries to a travel agent, and asking how much it would cost to get him to each one.
He learned that he could finance a trip to five continents at about half the cost of the Oxford program, and immediately called Wang to ask if he was interested in a world tour.
The two would go on to visit Peru, London, Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Egypt, Greece, and three cities in China in a span of two months.
To validate the trip—and in a move inspired by the Societies of the World 25: “Health, Culture and Community: Case Studies in Global Health” class—Henderson and Wang conducted a comparative health study of Peru and China, evaluating perceptions of Western and traditional medicine among the local residents.
“We figured if we are going to all these places, we’d do something meaningful,” said Henderson.
The pair conducted 30 interviews in each country—speaking with youths, church members, hospital workers in urban China, peasants, people in hospitals in rural Peru—and found that in both bustling cities and pastoral villages, people were much more likely to use herbal remedies for relatively minor issues, like fevers and colds, but embraced Western medicine for more significant problems, like diabetes and arthritis.
Wang said that in general, traditional medicines are more trusted and that people view traditional medicines as preventative, slow-acting treatments.
“People say, ‘natural herbs that don’t cause side effects,’” he said. “‘The bottle says side effects may include nausea, heart burn, vomiting. This is worse than what I have.’”
Especially in China, Wang said, traditional medicine is believed to pose potential long-term cures, whereas Western medicine is used to cure sudden symptoms and complex medical issues in need of immediate attention, like surgery.
“Doctors saw a distinction, but realized a synthesis of the two is the best way to treat their patients,” Wang said.
Though the two said they had learned many of these lessons in their coursework at Harvard, they agreed that hearing first-hand accounts explaining the rationale behind hundreds of years of traditional medicine was a life-changing experience.
“You have assumptions, you know people use traditional medicine, but you don’t know why,” Wang said. “Being there lets you escape from the Western, imperialistic mindset that our medicines are the best,” he said.

Construction crews at the Allston Science Complex have dismantled the site’s iconic red cranes and begun to pour ground-level concrete—steps that the University says are part of normal phase one construction, but that some residents say are indicative of a veiled intent to cap the project.The confusion comes half a year after Harvard announced that financial constraints were forcing it to slow construction of the much-anticipated Science Complex, which was intended to house the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and be a hub for interdisciplinary research. At the time, Harvard decided to halt procurement of materials for future construction and potentially reduce the number of workers on site. University officials have said they will make a decision about whether to proceed with the project in December.At a Construction Management Sub-Committee meeting Wednesday evening, local resident Joyce Radnor said that some neighbors have become concerned that the pouring of concrete is a signal that Harvard has decided to stop construction. Construction mitigation manager Edward G. LeFlore emphasized that University President Drew G. Faust has not yet decided the fate of the project and promised that he will promptly convey such information to the community when he is notified. “There are no mysterious things going on,” said LeFlore, who added that none of the work has deviated from the initial plan and that the concrete slab is a necessary component of the Complex’s foundation.Philip Coleman, the Turner construction manager for the site, said that 4 or 5 concrete pourings have been completed thus far, and that roughly 15 loads remain. The final concrete slab covering most of the site will be roughly 12 inches thick and will be coated with waterproofing material. LeFlore said that the large red cranes had been dismantled in the summer, but smaller, mobile cranes will continue to be used on site.But Harry Mattison, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force, said that he did not believe the University was being forthright with its construction plans.“The word ‘stopped’ isn’t in Harvard’s vocabulary,” Mattison said. “They use all this funny jargon to describe what is happening.”—Staff writer Michelle L.

Harvard received $602 million in gifts this past fiscal year—an 8 percent decline from last year’s total, University officials announced yesterday.
Adjusted for inflation, that figure falls short of the average amount raised this decade. The University’s highest-ever total of $651 million ($792 million in today’s dollars) came at the end of its last capital campaign in fiscal year 2001.
Citing the economic recession’s impact on Harvard philanthropy, the University’s chief fundraiser Tamara E. Rogers ’74 described the results as “inevitably disappointing, but not surprising.”
After Harvard administrators started planning for a 30 percent drop in its $36.9 billion endowment by the fiscal year’s end, each of the University’s schools—and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in particular—made a conscious push to bring in as many unrestricted gifts as possible. Rogers said that the strategy certainly helped boost fundraising numbers for the year, and Harvard will continue its efforts to raise current use funds.
Of the $188 million FAS raked in this year, $33 million were unrestricted, current use funds—a 38 percent increase from the $24 million donated the previous fiscal year.
Fifteen percent of this year’s gifts will fund financial aid programs across the University, which Rogers said have received enthusiastic support from alumni, including those who were financial aid recipients themselves.
Despite continued support from alumni, Rogers said that it is too early to set a tentative launch date for the University’s long-derailed capital campaign but that Harvard will continue to plan.
After Harvard’s last capital campaign, which raised a record-breaking $2.6 billion ($3.4 billion in today’s dollars)—then the largest in the history of higher education—the University had intended to gear up for another campaign in 2006 or 2007. But the 2006 resignation of then-University President Lawrence H. Summers effectively put those plans on hold.
The campaign was further delayed as University President Drew G. Faust entered Mass. Hall with several school leadership positions vacant, which University officials said complicated an immediate start to campaign planning, as they wanted top administrators in place to provide input on long-term strategic initiatives.
Faust has since filled nearly all leadership positions across the University, including deanships at FAS, the Medical School, and the Law School, and most recently, the executive vice president post.
Citing economic uncertainties this winter, the University once again pushed back capital campaign plans, which had called for a tentative 2011 launch date, despite relatively stable alumni donations at the time. Gift receipts from December fell just 2 percent relative to the same month in 2007.
But alumni philanthropy, often viewed as a lagging indicator of the current economic conditions, slowed during the spring months, Rogers said.
Spurred by class reunion gift committees, Harvard did see a spike in donations during May and June, contributing to 20 percent of the annual amount, but the increase was still noticeably smaller than last year’s levels, Rogers explained.
This year’s fundraising total was aided by a number of large donations, most notably a $125 million gift over the next five years—the largest in Harvard’s history—from Business School graduate Hansjörg Wyss to fund the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering in Allston. Gifts of over $1 million accounted for over 40 percent of the cash total.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, Tercentenary Theater welcomed a visitor it had not seen in over 200 years—a cow.  The bovine guest was the charge of Harvey G. Cox Jr., Hollis Research Professor of Divinity, who brought her as part of an afternoon-long celebration of his retirement.  In doing so, he revived a practice not observed since Edward Wigglesworth—the first to hold the Hollis professorship in 1722—and his son, who succeeded him, first brought their livestock out to graze. Cox retired this past June after 44 years at the Harvard Divinity School, where his position was the oldest endowed chair in the country, and where he established a reputation as one of the foremost theologians of his time. His first major book, “The Secular City,” sold over a million copies, and his undergraduate course, “Jesus and the Moral Life,” regularly attracted an average enrollment of 800 students in a year, according to Donald R. Cutler, Cox’s agent.  “He is a big deal,” Cutler said.  “He has always been an enormously inventive and perceptive teacher,” said Diana L. Eck, professor of Comparative Religion and Studies, a speaker at the celebration. “But he has never abandoned...his spirit of festivity.” Legend has it that the Hollis Professor of Divinity holds the privileged right to graze his cows—a perk that first came to Cox’s attention when he assumed the post in 2002, and later became the inspiration for yesterday’s ceremony.   “Harvey spoke to [Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Peter J.] Gomes about the Hollis professor’s grazing rights,” said Cutler. “We said, let’s do it.”   As the cow grazed in a patch of grass by Memorial Church, Gomes spoke jokingly about his colleague, once an advisor. “Only my colleague could conceive of such an occasion.” Gomes was followed by Travis Stevens, a divinity student, who gave a Latin oration in honor of the cow. When Cox reached the pedestal, he, too, focused on the bovine visitor. “She’s the real celebrity here today.”  A band of tubas—dubbed “Udderly Tuba” for the occasion—played The Beatles’ “When I’m 64” and the children’s song “Old McDonald” while leading Cox, the cow, and followers to the Divinity School, where Eck and William Martin, a Rice University religion professor, both gave speeches. The evening milking followed.  The celebration, said Eck, was “in keeping with the inventive and delightful way with which Harvey Cox has looked at the religious phenomena of the world and thought about the ways in which we human beings live and experience them.” “It is part of who Harvey is,” she said.  —Staff Writer Madeleine M.

Yale’s endowment fell $1 billion more than expected to $16 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, marking a 30 percent decline in value, Yale University President Richard C. Levin announced yesterday.In an e-mail to faculty, staff, and alumni, Levin wrote that previous projections of a 25 percent endowment drop had not accounted for the continued slide in private equity and real estate holdings even after stock markets began to rebound this spring.The unexpected additional fall in the endowment will lead to a 6.7 percent decrease in endowment payout this year and another 13 percent in fiscal year 2011. The payout will then remain at this level for the next few years, according to Levin’s statement.To close a projected $150 million annual budget deficit from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2014, Yale unveiled a series of budget-slashing measures similar to those that Harvard has announced over the past year, running the gamut from construction slowdowns to reductions in faculty hiring to trimming travel, entertainment, and office expenses.“With the exception of financial aid, no area of expenditure will be immune from close scrutiny,” Levin wrote.Until markets improve or donations are secured, Yale will not embark upon any new construction projects, he wrote. Renovations of two residential colleges and the Yale University Art Gallery will continue as planned, though, as will the design and site clearance for two new residential colleges.Levin also wrote that faculty recruitment in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences would proceed at a much-reduced pace, but he did not specify the number of new professors to be hired in this year except to say that it would be “imprudent” to decrease the overall size of the faculty.Yale will continue to conduct searches for researchers specializing in neuroscience, cancer, and cardiovascular disease since “outstanding laboratory facilities are in place,” but at the same time, the university will cut spending related to these labs by over 25 percent, the letter said.During the past year, two prominent medical researchers departed Harvard for Yale, recruited as part of Yale’s aggressive expansion into cutting-edge fields. Former Harvard Medical School Professor David A. Hafler was appointed chair of Yale’s neurology department, and Thomas J. Lynch, Jr.—former chief of hematology and oncology at the Mass. General Cancer Center—has become director of the Yale Cancer Center.While departments will be asked to cut non-salary spending by 5 percent—on top of a 7.5 percent reduction announced in February—salary-related budget allocations will not be subject to further cuts. In April, Yale administrators said that no more than 100 of the total 9,000 non-faculty employees would be laid off. Harvard has laid off 275 employees, out of a staff of 13,000. The so-called Yale model of endowment management—characterized by significant exposure to nontraditional, illiquid asset classes including private equity—has come under attack in recent years as many university endowments, including Harvard’s, have suffered heavy losses with that strategy in the economic downturn. Yale’s endowment return has averaged 15.9 percent over the last 20 years, excluding fiscal year 2008, according to the 2008 endowment report.Yale is expected to release a full endowment report in the next few weeks, which will contain further details on the performance of the endowment and its impact on budget planning. A Yale spokeperson declined to comment for this article.—Staff writer Athena Y. Jiang can be reached at ajiang@fas.harvard.edu.

The next time you pass out on that toilet bowl throwing up luscious chunks of HUDS popcorn chicken after a long night of regrettable, irresponsible drinking, comfort yourself with one thought: you’re probably not suffering from “drunkorexia.” Or are you?
While not an official medical term, drunkorexia refers to the combination of alcohol abuse and anorexia or bulimia—a medical condition that researchers and therapists say is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially among female college students. (It joins an already absurd eating disorder lexicon that includes words such as “manorexia” and “bigorexia.”) Those afflicted typically starve themselves all day before drinking in order to offset those liquid calories, or dangerously binge and purge food and alcohol.
Now, sure, many a college student has refrained from feasting at dinner in order to ensure that there’s ample room for the beer shotgunning to follow in the evening. And nothing gives that tired screwdriver more kick than an empty stomach—an emptiness that’ll also help you achieve the same comedic stupor with less alcohol.
But despite its familiar premises and rather laughable label, experts say drunkorexia’s growing prevalence—likely caused by emotional stress and societal pressure—needs to be taken seriously. Learn more after the jump.
Amy Armstrong, clinical director for the Boston-based Multiservice Eating Disorders Association, told Flyby that clinicians from her organization working with area colleges, which include Harvard, have definitely noticed a growing number of drunkorexia cases. She didn’t have statistics for drunkorexia and didn't cite Harvard specifically, but noted that in 2009, an estimated one in 12 college students struggled with eating disorders. Of the 24 million people diagnosed with eating disorder cases in the U.S., she said, roughly two-thirds were college students.
The fact that “self-harm behaviors” such as substance abuse and cutting are increasingly correlated with eating disorders shows that “people are under higher levels of stress and [are] not getting help for what they’re needing,” Armstrong said.
For now, Harvard seems to have largely dodged drunkorexia. J.P. Chilazi ’10, president of University Health Services' Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors, said he hasn’t heard of the condition being a problem here and noted that a 2008 campus survey found 96 percent of all Harvard students eating before or while drinking. But as “someone who knows a fair amount about alcohol consumption patterns,” he said he found the condition’s name to be “bizarre” and hoped for a “more technical name” to emerge in the future.
Flyby agrees: it’s tough to ask students to take the condition seriously when those afflicted are called “drunkorexics."

In an article last Friday, The Crimson made a mistake that reveals reporters to be what we are (for the most part) -- more knowledgable about medieval fairytales than about computer science.  In a story about Google's donation of 20 Android cell phones to the notorious introduction to computer science, CS 50, The Crimson quoted instructor David J. Malan '99 praising Google's  "dragon drop programming piece" -- a fanciful typo that should have read, "drag and drop."  Needless to say, Malan  got a kick out of the typo and breathed a bit of fire back at The Crimson.

As you strolled into the Yard  this past week, your books under your arm and your heart on your sleeve,  you may have noticed something amiss: namely the strong smell of feces.
There were no two ways around  it, this week the yard reeked of shit.  We are not talking about  metaphorical shit, like what that kid in your philosophy section spins  when he hasn’t done any of the reading and also he smoked WAY too  much list night.
Fly-by decided not to stand  idly by while our noses were assaulted.  No, we decided to investigate.  Find out why the Yard smells so bad after the jump.
The smell in the yard is part  of the Harvard’s totally organic maintenance of the grounds, according to Harvard Yard Ops. On Tuesday,  Yard Ops made a new organic fertilizer and well…fertilized the yard  with it. This means that the smell, thank goodness, is only temporary  and should be fading soon. Wayne Carbone of Yard Ops said that typically the Yard only has to be fertilized twice a year so the smell should  not be a regular occurrence.
The bottom line: never fear,  soon the Yard will go back to smelling the way it always does—that  rare combination of naiveté, pretension, and the collegiate spirit.

A medical student has gone missing at Yale, Penn has reduced its lectures to 60 seconds, and a retired Yale employee almost shot up the HR office.  Add to that the fact that Harvard and Yale have posted 30 percent endowment losses, and we're left to conclude that the Ivy League might be going mad.  More after the jump.
Yale
Medical student Annie Le went missing on Tuesday—less than a week before her scheduled wedding to her college sweetheart. Authorities still have had no luck in finding out her whereabouts.
Meanwhile, a 61-year-old retired Yale employee  armed with a gun and ammunition, believed to be targeting Yale's HR building, was spotted and arrested on the same block. “We presume that he was headed toward a University building because it’s all University buildings around there,” University Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer told the Yale Daily News.
Anyway, Yale's endowment has fallen $1 billion more than expected, and their provost has shaved off his signature mustache, so we're left to conclude that New Haven might be a bit off kilter.
Penn
The University of Pennsylvania is sponsoring four short outdoor talks each semester, consisting of lectures that are 60 seconds each, to give professors an opportunity to showcase their research. With only a minute to talk, maybe these professors will have to start speaking as fast as high school CX debaters (start at 0:36).
In the meantime, Penn students have been flocking to religious organizations. Maybe they're looking for someone to explain what they should do now that there aren't any more jobs?
Columbia
While Harvard seems to be moving to halt construction in Allston, Columbia officially kicked off construction for their new 17-acre campus in Manhattanville yesterday. Of course, their endowment fell only 16 percent this past year, so they may have a bit more wiggle-room—both in terms of spending and building space.
