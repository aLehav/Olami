After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are no official statistics that document how often the average Harvard student checks his or her inbox, but if three-quarters of U.S. employees surveyed by GFI Software reply within an hour of receiving an email, then the number on our campus is probably even higher. Even as I write this, despite the knowledge that my inbox has not been filled for weeks, I find my eyes drawn toward the tab that keeps it open. And it’s no secret that Harvard has an email-centric culture. In many ways, it makes sense: It’s the fastest and easiest way to reach large groups of people, and it’s the go-to method for correspondence because it lets us avoid the intimacy of phone calls or face-to-face communication.
Moreover, learning to reply to emails quickly is essential to preparing for careers in any field: 95 percent of workers surveyed expect a response within a day, and nearly half expect a reply within an hour, according to a GFI Software survey of 503 employees in U.S. workplaces. Yet as new research has helped reveal, the frequency with which we check our emails could be a significant cause of added stress. Removing the importance of email on campus or in future corporate environments is not a realistic or arguably even beneficial goal. However, re-evaluating the nature with which we approach emails may be worthwhile for its effect on our productivity and mental health.
When we graduate from Harvard, we will enter a world in which 60 percent of professionals spend nearly five hours per weekend just scanning their email. At school, there are no “off” hours. We’re expected to respond at any time. If we as college students live in a culture where more than half of employees surveyed regularly check their email past 11 pm (6% even check when they or their spouses are in labor), what will the culture be like when we enter the workforce?
As Harvard professor Leslie Perlow has found, this greater connectivity does not always correspond to greater productivity: When looking at a team at the Boston Consulting Group, half said they checked their email “continuously” while on vacation. When those hours were restricted, the employees all exhibited lower stress levels, higher satisfaction with their jobs, and a significantly shorter working week without any loss in productivity. The findings were so influential that the policy has been expanded throughout the entire company, yet one does not need to wait for the junior year recruiting season to start learning from those results. Differentiating between compulsive checking and productive necessity is worthwhile because blind usage has consequences that extend beyond just wasted time.
Furthermore, when researchers at the University of British Columbia restricted the number of times participants could check their email to three times a day and compared it to those who had no limit, the constantly monitored inbox was again no more efficient than those who tuned in more rarely. Because the human mind cannot perform two tasks simultaneously, expectations that we do so reduce our mental capabilities, make us worse at accomplishing the tasks that we need to, and limit our abilities to engage in real interaction. As MIT professor and author Sherry Turkle has explained, “Technology doesn’t just do things for us. It does things to us, changing not just what we do but who we are. . . [W]e have learned to put our conversations ‘on pause’ when we send or receive . . . an email. When you get accustomed to a life of stops and starts, you get less accustomed to reflecting on where you are and what you are thinking.”
Although this problem of email culture is one not restricted to Harvard’s campus, the earlier that these habits crystallize, the harder they will likely be to break. In the study described above, those who were instructed to check their email three times a day more often than not reported that they had checked almost five times. Since most of the emails in our inbox are likely reminders from list-servs we mistakenly joined during our freshman fall, the likelihood that what we’re checking is important is even lower. Our phones have made it easier to be “available” at all times. But when the ability to communicate is restricted, not freed, by this constant access, it may be time to reconsider how often that inbox should be refreshed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I walked off the plane and towards the bus, I was greeted by the fireworks all around marking the coming of the new year, and by the familiar scent of Mumbai—the scent that seemed to be created by a mixture of smog, dust, and Indian food. The short bus ride—during which the New Year officially came—took us to the new international terminal at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, truly one of the most beautiful airport terminals on the planet. From there, we collected our luggage and began the two-hour car journey through the early morning New Year’s Day traffic to my relatives’ house in one of Mumbai’s many suburbs.
Mumbai, or Bombay, as most locals refer to it, certainly has the numbers to be one of the world’s great cities. With 18.4 million inhabitants as of the 2011 census, it is India’s largest metropolis, and one of the five largest in the world. It is home to the 14th and 16th largest stock exchanges in the world and is the economic capital of the world’s second most-populous country. And yet, it has always seemed to occupy that perch somewhat uncomfortably. Perhaps it lies in the aspirational nature of the city--one of its nicknames is “the City of Dreams,” and Mumbai does indeed dream. It is building a new metro system to ease congestion on its infamously overcrowded local trains, and it is also rolling out a monorail system alongside it. It is embarking on a tremendous skyscraper building boom, and will soon host the world’s tallest residential building. Indeed, Mumbai seems like a rising city, even as it already has a huge population and undisputed economic hegemony in its country.
But part of what makes Mumbai’s position somewhat shaky lies in its tremendous contrasts—particularly its contrasts between wealth and poverty. True, other large cities such as Shanghai, São Paulo, Mexico City, and even New York City have large income disparities within their city limits. But in few places is the disparity as pronounced as in Mumbai, where well-heeled neighborhoods inhabited by the likes of Bollywood stars and business magnates lie within walking distance from large slum areas, which hold roughly half the city’s population, according to the Times of India. Indeed, Bandra, the suburban neighborhood of Central Mumbai that is home to some of Bollywood’s biggest actors, including Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif, lies less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from Dharavi, one of the world’s largest slums, which achieved a certain fame as the setting of the Academy Award-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. A drive through South and Central Mumbai reveals all socioeconomic spectra—from large slum areas such as Dharavi and crowded commercial areas such as Dadar and Churchgate to affluent, manicured districts such as Marine Drive, Nariman Point, Malabar Hill, and Worli, where real estate prices can rival those of Manhattan’s most expensive precincts.
On top of all of this, Mumbai is also an exciting, if confusing, tourist destination. While Delhi, the capital of India, receives far more attention from international tourists as the home of historic sites such as the Red Fort and Qutb Minar, Mumbai still has plenty of tourist attractions, from iconic colonial-era buildings such as the Gateway of India and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (which could very well be the world’s most beautiful train station) to museums such as the Nehru Centre and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya and historic sites such as the Kanheri Caves (a set of Buddhist monasteries and prayer halls dating from 300 BC to 1100 AD), I have found plenty of touristy things to do there in my four visits to the city. The city also has a thriving arts scene, and friends of mine have told me that it has vibrant nightlife. Mumbai is also a very diverse city—home to migrants from all over India, who speak a wide range of languages, and a large array of religious traditions, with large numbers of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Sikhs, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Buddhists calling the city home, along with followers of other religions. These all combine to make it one of the most interesting cities not only in India, but also in the world.
Another Mumbai nickname that has come into vogue in recent years is “the Maximum City.” Grammar aside, this nickname reveals quite a bit about this city. It has the maximum when it comes to shopping (there are many malls in the city and its suburbs), when it comes to economic power, when it comes to affluence and poverty, and when it comes to culture (with its range of museums and historic attractions). A book I once read on the world’s cities once said “whatever your heart desires, you can probably find it in Mumbai.” While that may not be exactly true (it can be hard to find quiet and order in this dense city), it is still a profound statement about Mumbai. It is a city where one can find everything to the extreme, and yet Mumbai is still not afraid to dream and aspire to more.

The Harvard Pre-Medical Society’s annual Wintersession Public Service Week began on Monday evening with an overnight shift at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
In its third year, the program is partnering with Phillips Brooks House Association Mission Hill After-School Program, the Boston Living Center, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. While primarily geared toward pre-med students, the program is open to anyone and will provide free transportation and meals for student volunteers.
“I feel like at Harvard, people have been a little bubbled,” said P. Cody He ’16, HPS public service director and coordinator of the Wintersession program. “This is a good opportunity to give back without the stress of classes and just interact with the community.”
He participated in the HPS Wintersession program last year and said he is looking forward to his time at the Boston Living Center, a community for people living with HIV, again this year.
Program participants will be volunteering at the PBHA Mission Hill After-School Program on Tuesday and the Boston Living Center on Wednesday and Thursday this week.
He said many of the service locations typically have limits on the number of volunteers at one time, so He expects groups of six for each day’s event, providing an atmosphere in which students can learn from both each other as well as the people they are serving.
“I come from a fairly homogenous high school,” said Catherine Y. Li ’18, who was scheduled to volunteer at the Homeless Shelter Monday night, “and I think it’s really interesting to get all these different diverse perspectives from both Harvard but also from the people at the shelter.”
Li, who is a pre-med student, added that she believes the program will provide her with an opportunity to develop skills related to being a doctor.
“I’m tentatively pre-med, so I want to get some experience listening to stories and talking to people,” said Li. “Over the winter break I did some shadowing and I realized that to be a doctor, you have to really love people and listening to people.”
Maria Brouard ’18, who was also set to volunteer at the Homeless Shelter, said she was excited to engage with and give back to the wider community around Harvard.
“I always wanted to help the homeless around here,” she said, “so it’ll be nice to maybe see a few familiar faces in the Square and say hi every once in a while.”

UPDATED: January 22, 2015, at 3:27 a.m.
Following the U.S. House of Representatives' approval of an amendment that would cut funding for a key Obama administration immigration initiative, University President G. Faust wrote a letter to the Massachusetts House delegation last week critiquing the move.
The amendment, attached to a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, is an effort to roll back the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a measure that President Barack Obama has expanded during his administration. While not paving a path for citizenship, DACA status allows young, undocumented immigrants protection against deportation and a two-year renewable work permit.
The funding bill and amendment, which narrowly passed the House, must win approval in the Senate and avoid a veto from Obama to become law.
“I believe strongly that education and service are the pathways to better neighbors, stronger communities, and economic growth as well as personal satisfaction and happiness,” Faust wrote in a letter to U.S. Rep. Katherine M. Clark that Harvard shared with The Crimson. “Since 2012, the availability of a legal status through DACA has advanced these goals by throwing a lifeline to thousands of students who have known no other home than communities across the United States.”
Referring to Harvard specifically, Faust praised the students that DACA has allowed to enroll.
“At Harvard, DACA has made it possible for talented students to pursue their education, grow their talents, and explore meaningful ways of contributing to our community and economy,” Faust wrote. “Putting them once again at risk by reversing DACA will run counter to these efforts and our larger goals of developing the best and brightest students.”
Harvard is one of few schools in the nation that extends its need-blind admissions policy to all applicants, regardless of legal or national status. Last year, undocumented students at the University entered the national spotlight when Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15, who arrived in the country when he was 2 years old, left to visit his dying mother in Mexico and was unable to return to Harvard for several months until his application for a humanitarian visa was approved.
Faust’s position in the letter, dated Jan. 12, is not new. For years, she has levied the power and prestige of the Harvard presidency and taken on the role of a political actor advocating for certain immigration policies.
In 2009, Faust wrote a letter to congressmen Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, John F. Kerry, and Michael E. Capuano praising the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM), which would offer a path to citizenship for select undocumented immigrants. In 2010, she co-authored an op-ed with Stanford president John L. Hennessy further supporting the DREAM act. In 2010, she co-authored a letter with the presidents of several other Boston schools to Senators John F. Kerry and Scott P. Brown applauding the proposed DREAM act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Canadian pharmaceutical company H&P Labs, Inc., announced earlier this month a partnership with Harvard and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital dedicated to the development of a new drug to fight the Ebola virus.
In 2011, Harvard researchers discovered a protein that, when mutated, inhibits cholesterol transport among cells. Medical School associate professor James M. Cunningham, the project’s head researcher, said the same gene could be used in an anti-viral drug treatment.
“The compound is related to an existing drug currently used as a cholesterol inhibitor,” Cunningham said. “This lends hope to the idea that the anti-Ebola compounds could be made into a useable drug as well.”
But despite the potential for development, Cunningham said H&P Labs is taking a risk by investing into the development of the drug. “There is an 80 percent chance that this compound will never be made into a drug,” Cunningham said.
“It may be many years before the drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration,” Cunningham said. “Yet, given the high societal demand for an Ebola drug, there is a chance that the FDA will accelerate the drug approval process.”
Before the drug can go before the FDA for approval, years of research, development, and trials are required, according to H&P President and Chief Executive Officer John Huss.
And since the drug is still in its very beginning stages of development, Huss emphasized the need to remain cautious.
“It will take approximately two years to finalize the animal tests and ensure the drug can be produced, after which we will be able to start Phase I safety trials in human volunteers,” Huss wrote in an emailed statement. “As the compounds [are] at a very early stage, there is a risk they may not show efficacy or that the side effect profile may not be suited for use in humans.”
But despite possible risks, Huss remains hopeful.
“We are excited about the potential of these inhibitors for development of an oral treatment for Ebola,” Huss wrote in a statement released on the company’s website. “With a shortened regulatory pathway to commercialization, and their ability to be used in combination with other treatments, these compounds have the potential to meet the critical unmet need for an effective anti-EboV therapy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 20, 2015, at 1:42 p.m.
The College’s fifth year of optional winter break programming includes an increased number of organized seminars and discussions geared toward students’ self-reflection after a push from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
New programs for this year’s Wintersession, a week during which the College offers programs to students who come back to campus before the start of the spring semester, include a three-day retreat in Vermont for freshmen and a workshop on “public narratives.” According to Khurana, who has repeatedly and publicly espoused his belief that attending the College should be a “transformative experience” for its students, the programs hope to prompt students to reflect on their experiences at Harvard.
The Wintersession program’s website lists more than 80 activities that will be offered this year. The Undergraduate Council received the same amount of money—$20,000—as it has in the past to fund club-sponsored events throughout the week, according to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. Despite that similarity, Lassonde said this year’s Wintersession will feature a shift in focus that is the “brainchild” of Khurana.
“[Khurana’s] idea is to use Wintersession as an incubating space for giving students a chance to reflect on their experience here,” Lassonde said.
“There are many programs that already do that, but we were intentional about choosing some specific ones that we thought would be important introductions,” Khurana said.
Khurana designated Director for Freshman Programming Katherine W. Steele and former Currier House Dean Laura K. Johnson to develop such events, according to Steele.
“The programming in the past was much more focused on either skill development or things that might be fun,” Steele said.
The week’s programs include a retreat in Vermont for 40 freshmen led by eight upperclassmen this week. A program on creative writing, meanwhile, will include discussions about race and socioeconomic status. Another program—a seminar on “public narratives” led by a senior lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government—attracted about 30 undergraduates last weekend, according to Steele, who has helped develop Wintersession events since the week’s inception.
Meanwhile, the First-Year Enrichment program, which is entering its third year, will run under the “aegis of Dean Khurana’s sponsorship as part of the personally transformative programming,” Brooks Lambert-Sluder, assistant director of the Advising Programs Office and a First-Year Enrichment program facilitator, wrote in an email.
The program’s itinerary will include a session led by Khurana, visits to the Harvard Libraries and Harvard Art Museums, guided reflection, and an introduction to resources such as the Bureau of Study Counsel, according to Lambert-Sluder.
Khurana said the change in Wintersession’s focus was not motivated by a desire to attract more students back to campus before the semester starts. Undergraduate interest in Wintersession has remained relatively steady since programming for all students was first introduced in January 2011, according to Lassonde.
Jennifer H. Chapman, the director of Wintersession, was not available for comment.

In fact, a distinct Wintersession program on creative writing will feature such a discussion, but the retreat in Vermont will focus on other topics.

UPDATED: January 20, 2015, at 1:23 p.m.
"Selma" director Ava DuVernay responded to criticism of her film's depiction of President Lyndon B. Johnson Monday evening at a question and answer session sponsored by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. The discussion, which was hosted by University Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., followed a free screening of the film at the AMC Assembly Row in Somerville.
"If there's anything that I regret about the faux controversy, it's that it's knocked off the front pages and knocked out of the discussion the fact that black lives matter," DuVernay said of her film’s portrayal of Johnson.
Over the past two months, critics have condemned "Selma" for depicting Johnson as an adversary to the 1965 voting rights movement, rather than an advocate. Though the film's Johnson speaks negatively of white Alabama politicians opposed to voting rights, he asks Martin Luther King, Jr. to delay the voting rights effort so that his administration can pursue the war on poverty.
DuVernay dismissed the criticism.
"It might not be motivated by anything except the fact that they're the custodians of a legacy and I am not the custodian of that legacy," she said.
In addition, she said she thinks the film has been controversial because it conflicts with traditional narratives of the Selma marches.
"It's so much about this uncomfortable space of people of color [and] women who are on the margins of being at the center of their own story," she said. "Everything doesn't have to be through one lens."
DuVernay also discussed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' recent Oscar nominations. “Selma” was nominated for best picture, but she was not nominated for the best director Oscar.
Comparing an Oscar to a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae, DuVernay said the film's nomination for the best picture award on Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday made her feel "lovely." She said the Academy's decision not to nominate her as best director did not surprise her.
"I was much more fine with it than Twitter," she said. "[A nomination] wasn't something I expected."
The event’s audience, which filled the theater to capacity, appeared to consist primarily of adults older than college-age. Several professors attended as spectators. Gates said a full video of the talk will appear on The Root, an online magazine.
Throughout the interview, Gates lauded DuVernay's work.
"Let me say, from where I sit, that not only did David Oyelowo deserve best actor award, but Ava DuVernay deserved best director award," he said. The audience applauded.
DuVernay said “Selma” is the first major motion picture with King as its protagonist.
"I don't think that studios have historical dramas with black protagonists at the top of their to-do lists," DuVernay said. "The film is not perfect, but I think it is closer to most people's ideas of what historical cinema might be, something that lives and breathes."

Despite a 5-1 loss at home to St. Lawrence this weekend, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team retained its No. 4 ranking in both the USCHO.com and USA Today/USA Hockey national polls on Monday.
The Crimson (11-3-2, 7-2-2 ECAC) took a big hit in the first place vote column, with only one brave voter (Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold? Donato?) listing the team at No. 1. That’s down from five votes last week and 15/13 votes one week prior. Harvard also fell to No. 6 in the KRACH and No. 7 in the PairWise rankings.
Nevertheless, voters generally gave the Crimson the benefit of the doubt, perhaps given the team’s undermanned lineup and strong performance against Clarkson on Friday.
Harvard’s ranking was also helped by a difficult week for the rest of the nation’s top teams. Six of the USCHO’s top 10 and 11 of the top 20 lost at least one game this week. No. 3/3 Boston University fell to a much-improved No. 19/- Boston College team on Friday, yet BC fell two spots in the rankings thanks to a loss to unranked Maine on Sunday. Minnesota Duluth, UMass-Lowell, Bowling Green, Omaha, and Vermont were the other top 10 teams to drop a game over the weekend.
In ECAC play, No. 13/14 Yale continued its rise with a pair of wins over Brown. No. 20/- Quinnipiac’s stock fell rapidly with a pair of losses to No. 14/15 Merrimack, and Colgate split its Rensselaer-Union road trip, edging the Dutchmen on the back half, to hold relatively steady at No. 15/13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (10-4, 1-0 Ivy) stumbled for the first time in seven games against Boston College Wednesday, falling to 3-4 away from home so far this season. The Crimson will take the road again in its final nonconference matchup of the season Tuesday night against Bryant (8-7, 5-1 Northeast). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on.
Stopping the Bleeding
The Crimson’s back-to-back losses on the road to Virginia and Arizona State earlier this season were a significant anomaly. Harvard has lost back-to-back games only four times since 2009-10, and in that period boasts a 127-39 record that is good for 13th-best in the country. In both of the most recent cases, both losses came on the road, where Harvard has played its biggest games of the Amaker era (Memphis, California, Virginia, etc.). When Harvard travels to the Chase Atlantic Center, look for the proud, veteran-laden Crimson to quash any thought of a second two-game slide early.
Jumpstarting the Offense
Against Bryant, a team Harvard trounced by 18 points last year in a game that was rarely that close, the Crimson will turn to its two best seniors—wing Wesley Saunders and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi—to jumpstart a struggling offense that has put up four sub-20 point halves in its last five road games.
While the two combined for 48 points in last year’s contest against Bryant, they have yet to crack 40 combined points in any contest this year. After an unconscious first month of play, Saunders has faded, shooting just 36 percent and averaging more than three turnovers a game since the team broke for finals. Moundou-Missi’s difficulties have been a constant all season. He has scored in double digits in just three of 14 contests after doing so in 16 of 32 games last year. His shooting has taken a deeper dive to 39.3 percent—nearly 15 percent worse than last year.
Crashing The Other End
Lost in the four losses—just one less than last year’s team had all season—and inconsistent offense has been the growth of arguably the best defense Harvard has ever had. Before senior Kenyatta Smith went down with an injury against Boston College, the Crimson started at least four—and arguably five—plus defenders. Junior wing Agunwa Okolie has a limited offensive game, but has teamed up with Saunders to shut down opposing wings, funneling any traffic inside to Smith and Moundou-Missi—two of the best shot blockers in the country.
Ken Pomeroy rates Harvard’s defense as the sixth best in the country, which is 28 spots better than last year’s ranking. Over the last five years, no team with a defense that good has finished the season ranked outside Pomeroy’s top 50—and three of the five have earned a top-five seed.

Four days after a dispiriting loss to Boston College, the Harvard men’s basketball team (10-4, 1-0 Ivy) scored what may be its biggest win of the season Sunday afternoon with a commitment from high school junior Chris Lewis. The Alpharetta, Ga. native, ESPN’s 44th-ranked recruit in the Class of 2016, is the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to the university. It is the Crimson’s first commitment from the Class of 2016.
“I have been considering [going to Harvard] for a while,” Lewis told future150.com. “My idea was to commit when I went up there [for a visit]. I just had to get a few things answered, while I was up there before I committed.”
Lewis first achieved national recognition as an eighth grader, when he received two Division I offers—from perennial NCAA Tournament teams Memphis and New Mexico—before setting foot on a high school campus.
Since arriving at Milton High School, the hype around Lewis has continued to grow. According to ESPN, he received offers from 15 different Division I schools before committing to the Crimson. Lewis, whose father—Mo Lewis—played 13 years as a linebacker in the NFL for the New York Jets, is averaging 16.1 points a game for his 10-8 squad.
In the interview with futue150.com, Lewis acknowledged that he committed to the Crimson with other potential teammates in mind.
“Harvard is looking at a couple of other prospects that I hope will be able to commit to Harvard along with me,” Lewis said.
Although nothing has been finalized, reports have connected Harvard with Class of 2016 recruits Seth Towns and Quentin Jackson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Putting together three separate streaks of eight or more unanswered points, the Harvard men’s basketball team (11-4, 1-0 Ivy) used a balanced scoring attack to put away Bryant (8-8, 5-1 NEC) late for a 66-57 victory on Tuesday.
The Crimson had three players score in double digits and had 12 assists on 23 made field goals while holding the Bulldogs to just 32.7 percent shooting from the field.
“This is going to be very similar to what our conference is going to be like,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was praising our kids in terms of their composure, making the necessary plays to put us in the position to win against a team that had been first in their league.”
With starting center Kenyatta Smith out due to injury, the Crimson flashed a number of new defensive looks that flummoxed Bryant in the first half. With junior wing Agunwa Okolie and senior wing Wesley Saunders occasionally stepping in as the four in small-ball lineups, Harvard held the Bulldogs to just 26.1 percent shooting in the first half with nearly twice as many turnovers (11) as baskets (six).
The two wings badgered Bryant’s star guard, Dyami Starks, all night long. Starks had 18 points, roughly on par with his season average, but needed 22 shots to get there. After making a layup to tie the game at 55 with 4:50 to go, Starks missed all three of his shots the rest of the way, as the Crimson ended the game on an 11-2 run.
“[Starks] is such an elusive and crafty shooter,” Amaker said. “Any good scorers, when they get one that goes in that’s clean, they heat up real quickly. I thought our perimeter defense with Agunwa and Wesley really tried to hound him because he’s such a dynamic offensive player.”
Early, however, the game closely resembled Harvard’s previous road tilts. In the midst of a difficult sequence that has the Crimson playing 10 of 12 contests on the road, Harvard has recently struggled away from home. Entering the game, the Crimson held a 3-4 record outside of Lavietes Pavilion and had put up four sub-20 point halves in its last five road games.
In Rhode Island Tuesday, neither team broke the five-point mark until nearly six and a half minutes had passed. The rest of the half oscillated like an anchored spring: twice Harvard rattled off nine unanswered points to put itself on the verge of a double-digit lead; twice Bryant battled back and closed the gap.
While the Crimson’s defense kept the Bulldogs at bay in the first half, Bryant came out of the locker room firing—and connecting. The hosts scored on five straight possessions, including two Starks treys, to tie the game at 36. They took their first lead scarcely more than a minute later on a Dan Garvin layup.
A three-point play by senior Jonah Travis put Harvard back in front, but a foul by the upperclassman on the other end gave the lead right back. In came Okolie, contorting in the lane for a layup that took the Bulldogs' final lead away with 12:35 left to play.
But the game remained far from over. Bryant kept the Crimson at arm’s length for the rest of the contest, tying the game on two separate occasions. Harvard's lead never grew larger than six points (51-45) down the stretch until a late 8-0 Crimson run put the game away.
“When two teams are battling, it can go either way,” sophomore Zena Edosomwan said. “It’s all the little plays you can make…. I think we were hungry and wanted to win it, and in order for us to do that, we had to make the winning plays.”
Crucial to staving off the Bulldogs was the play of starting forwards Steve Moundou-Missi and Edosomwan.
Moundou-Missi had his highest scoring output of the season with 15 points while providing his typical back line defense (two steals, two blocks). The co-captain added a critical three-point play to break the final tie of the game with 3:45 remaining and put Harvard up for good.
Edosomwan had 13 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes while making his last five free throws down the stretch.
“For us to be able to outscore them 30-18 in the paint this game was a big key for us to be able to come out with a victory this evening,” Amaker said.
