After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the Supreme Court’s landmark decision Friday that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marriage, several Harvard Law School professors said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who authored the majority opinion, played an extraordinary role in advancing the cause.
“The majority opinion by Justice Kennedy was a triumph of reason and passion alike,” Law School professor and former Supreme Court clerk Laurence H. Tribe ’62 wrote in an email.
Shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this year to hear arguments regarding same-sex marriage, Tribe and several other professors pointed to Kennedy as a potential “swing vote” in the case, predicting the ultimate 5-to-4 vote outcome.
In his majority opinion Friday, Kennedy wrote that states were not permitted to restrict same-sex couples from marriage, establishing a fundamental right to same-sex marriages.
“As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death,” Kennedy wrote in Obergefell v. Hodges. “Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”
Kennedy, whose opinion drew fiery dissents from the four more conservative justices on the bench, “treated opposing arguments with respect but showed them to be ultimately unconvincing,” Tribe wrote on Friday. “And his reliance on the synergy of liberty and equality, centered on the core principle of human dignity, will become a permanent fixture in America’s jurisprudence.”
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman wrote that Friday’s decision “confirms the extraordinary influence” of Kennedy, adding that he believes Kennedy is “the most powerful justice in history.”
Kennedy has authored landmark gay rights decisions in the past. In a similarly divided decision two years ago, Kennedy wrote for the majority in striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. And in 2003, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated state anti-sodomy laws.
Moving forward, professors said they envision little backlash from the public in the political realm.
Klarman wrote that unlike the issues in Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade, “gay marriage does not have the sort of direct effects on opponents that those other rulings do,” adding that the Republican party will ultimately benefit from same-sex marriage being off the table.
“The Court’s taking the issue away from them is one of the best things that could happen to the Republican party going into the 2016 presidential election,” Klarman wrote.
Law School professor Richard H. Fallon agreed that people opposed to same-sex marriage may be angry about the verdict, they are unlikely to act politically, given a shift in public support for same-sex marriage in recent years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The message caught Tyler Moy a little off-guard. Trying to relax at his San Diego home as the clock ticked down on his final year of National Hockey League Entry Draft eligibility, the 19-year-old received a congratulatory text from an old coach. The Nashville Predators then confirmed the news:
With the Predators’ sixth round pick from the BB&T Center draft floor in Sunrise, Fla., Saturday, Moy entered a select fraternity of Crimson players. Moy is the 87th Harvard player to be selected in an NHL entry draft, and only the ninth to be drafted as a rising college junior.
“I am extremely excited to be a part of the Predators organization,” Moy said a little over an hour after his name was called. “It’s a pretty cool feeling.”
As a sophomore in 2014-2015, Moy finished third among Crimson skaters in goals (12) and fourth in points (27) while splitting most of his time between the team’s first and third lines. He centered fellow Predators pick and NCAA-leading goal scorer Jimmy Vesey through the season’s middle-third and played a key role in Harvard’s first ECAC championship since 2006.
The Predators, who drafted Vesey 66th overall in 2012, were particularly impressed by Moy’s versatility and intelligence. Nashville amateur scout Tom Nolan described the 6’1” Moy as “a late bloomer” and “a real smart, two-way, big guy that can skate.”
“We just feel he is ready to take off,” Nolan said Saturday. “He had a great year this year, so we’re just looking for more improvement for him going forward.”
Despite having received interest from multiple teams before the draft, Moy entered Saturday as an underdog. His name did not appear in NHL Central Scouting’s pre-draft rankings and was absent from most mock drafts. As one of the oldest players in the draft and one of the youngest rising juniors in college hockey, he represented a challenging prospect for pro teams to evaluate.
Moy admitted he was a little nervous as he remained undrafted into the day’s penultimate round, but tried to keep things in perspective.
“I still got a lot ahead of me, and if I wasn’t drafted, it wouldn’t have been the end of the world or anything,” Moy said. “But I’m really excited it happened, and I just tried to stay positive. I figured that whatever happens happens, and I control my destiny from there.”
The Predators were not among the teams that had granted Moy a pre-draft interview. The only feedback Moy received from Nashville leading up to the draft was about two weeks ago through Vesey, who indicated in a text that Nashville’s scouts had spoken highly of Moy.
Moy will now prepare to join Vesey at the Predators’ prospect development camp, which will be held July 6-11 in Nashville. Moy says that his paternal grandfather’s family is from the Nashville area, but the camp will be his first trip to the Music City. Although Moy grew up as a Detroit Red Wings fan, he recalls rooting for the Central Division rival Predators as a young child.
“I liked their logo so much,” said Moy, who has developed an appreciation for art and design as a skilled graphite drawer. “I remember having a Nashville t-shirt. That was a cool thing because it had the cool Predator on there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Schuyler Bailar, an incoming College freshman, will become the first openly transgender swimmer in NCAA Division I history when he joins the Harvard men’s swimming team for the upcoming season.
The swimmer’s journey—from a Harvard women’s swimming recruit to an incoming member of the men’s team—is a historic one in the world of college athletics. 
Bailar came out as transgender during his gap year after he graduated from high school a year ago. He had emerged as a top women’s swimming prospect at Georgetown Day School after setting more than 10 team records between 2010 and 2011 with a club in his home state of Virginia. During his senior year, he was part of a team with Olympic gold medalist Katie Ledecky that set a national age group record in the 400 yard relay.
By that time, Bailar had been recruited by Harvard women’s swimming and diving coach Stephanie Morawski, part of a strong Class of 2018. But Bailar did not enroll at Harvard immediately and instead took a year off.
While Bailar has always identified as male, he had not come out as transgender until after graduation. During his gap year he contemplated medically transitioning—something he initially thought might mean quitting the sport he loved.
“Initially the decision was, ‘Do I swim, or do I quit and transition?’” Bailar said. “I really didn’t want to give up swimming, but I also didn’t know how much longer I could do the living as a girl thing.”
He came up with a solution: He would get “top” surgery and swim on the women’s team, he informed a supportive Morawski in November.
While the first of those choices went as planned—the double mastectomy Bailar underwent in March removed his mammary glands and breasts—his thought process changed shortly before the surgery, in late February, when he received a call from his new coach.
Morawski’s words floored him. The coach said she had spoken with counterpart Kevin Tyrell, the coach of the Harvard men’s team: If Bailar wanted, he had the option of swimming on the men’s team.
Bailer’s reaction, he said, was positive: “Wow, OK. Woah. World exploded.”
The phone call ended without a commitment—Bailar’s focus was on the imminent surgery. After the operation, he gave the idea more thought and consideration. He reflected on his feelings when he passed as a man and considered how he would feel on the women’s team, wearing a women’s suit. He had thought about it before in a wishful sense, pondering what would have happened had he been born male, but an offer like this had never been on the table.
By the time he started swimming again in early April, accustoming himself to his new body, Bailar still had not made a decision. At Visitas, the College’s weekend-long visiting program for prospective freshmen, he attended events with both teams before deciding to join the men’s team—a decision he said, in retrospect, part of him already knew.
“My mind knew that’s what I wanted to do,” Bailar said. “The way I put it, I needed my heart to catch up.”
News of the decision reached Cambridge a few weeks later, when Bailar penned an email to the entire men’s team informing its members of his choice. The team had learned about the situation just weeks before, when men’s team co-captains Christian Yeager and Jacob Luna relayed the news they had gotten ahead of time in a private meeting with Tyrell.
The message from the coach had been clear: Make Bailar comfortable and show him that he would be supported on either team. “We wanted to be in a situation where he would come in and say [that] here are two great options,” Yeager said.
Although Yeager feared pushback from the team, he said there was nothing but excitement. By the time of the two teams’ joint mixer Saturday night, the rising freshman “was comfortable with everyone,” Yeager said.
But for Bailar, choosing a team was not only about fit and identity. On the women’s team, Bailar was expected to be among the team’s best in the breaststroke. A self-described fiercely competitive athlete, he had set his sights on training hard, making the league championships, and—eventually—putting his name atop the team’s record board.
On the men’s team, Bailar said, he would have to throw out those goals. The competition in the men’s pool is at a different level; the women’s record holder in the 100 breaststroke—Bailar’s preferred event—would have placed 21st at the men’s Ivy Championships last year. He was realistic with himself early on: Swimming on this team would mean adjusting his expectations significantly.
“I have completely trashed, or thrown out, or gotten rid of, or ignored the possibility of ever achieving any of that,” Bailar said. “I will never be a women’s Ivy League Champ. I will never be on the women’s Harvard record board.... Those are things that were really hard for me to let go of.”
His goals on his new team are “not even close” to as large. In June, Bailar started testosterone therapy, preparing his body to compete against his teammates. But he views his goals in terms of starting at the bottom, with the focus initially on being a good teammate and contributing as best he can. In the pool, he has embraced the uncertainty—he said he will keep his focus only on the next person up the leader board. 
“I’m going to be at the bottom, and I’m going to slowly pick people off,” Bailar said. “It’s not about records, it’s not about Ivies; it’s about bettering myself everyday and seeing where I can go. Because I have no idea where I can go—I could be horrible, it’s possible I could be great. But I have no idea.”
Bailar, whose narrative has attracted national attention, has been open about sharing his story, the first of its kind. The rising freshman, who announced the news to all his friends on Facebook less than two months ago, is documenting his transition on Instagram. He blogs about his experiences online, once reading aloud the letter he wrote his mom before surgery on YouTube.
Bailar has encouraged conversations about his identity since coming out publicly, asking his friends in his initial Facebook post, “If you have questions as to what [my new identity] means, please ask me. I would much rather you ask than let your concerns and questions linger in your head."
But he recognizes that identifying as transgender can still come with a stigma. After asking his friends to come to him with questions, he noted, “I am an open book, not a punching bag…. If you don’t understand, ask. If you don’t agree with my decisions, please at least respect me. I am still a person.”
Through his online writings, Bailar hopes to fight many of the misunderstandings about gender and transitioning. According to the first post on his blog, its mission is “to share my story and transition with you all, through my eyes.”
The support, he said, has been overwhelming. He said friends have contacted him to come out to him privately, telling him that he was their inspiration.
“I really am touched by that,” Bailar said, “because that’s really my point: to let people have that freedom or inspire people to have that freedom.”
Three months since surgery, Bailar has continued to take new steps. He wakes up before dawn every morning to train, determined and ready for what comes.
