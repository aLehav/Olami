After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, students across campus opened their email inboxes to find a message from University President Drew G. Faust, which detailed  Harvard’s recent advances toward greater faculty and non-faculty diversity, along with plans for future improvement. Her final announcement—that Harvard had hired Lisa M. Coleman as its first Chief Diversity Officer—merits our praise. Without the oversight the position provides, the need to ensure diversity may have fallen by the wayside. For the position to reach its full potential, University Hall should endow it with great responsibility.
The CDO will likely help to promote diversity, and the existence of the position demonstrates that Harvard takes this goal seriously. Seeking to increase the number of women and minorities within Harvard’s ranks does not come at the cost of maintaining meritocratic standards in hiring faculty, since the pool of highly qualified individuals remains so large. Furthermore, by ensuring that faculty members bring a vast array of different life experiences to the table, the University furthers the educational capacity of the institution as a whole.
Because of the importance of the CDO to achieving this aim, the job description should be crafted to ensure that other campus diversity initiatives, such as those within the Institute of Politics and the Harvard Foundation, are included under Coleman’s jurisdiction. It is crucial for Coleman’s position to be all-encompassing, so that she can coordinate and organize more effectively. The absence of one overarching leader could otherwise create a lack of accountability, leading to complacency. The ability to coordinate efforts and take advantage of Harvard’s resources will allow Coleman to work toward greater diversity in myriad ways.
One such way that Harvard can move forward entails looking to its junior faculty. According to Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, 46 percent of junior faculty members in the social sciences are women. Harvard has been known to regularly tenure professors outside its junior faculty, but instead should work toward the diversity it seeks by promoting from within, bringing diverse individuals up through its ranks.
Additionally, the officer’s efforts should not be limited to facilitating racial and gender diversity. Diversity is valued, among other reasons, for its ability to provide different perspectives and experiences. In that regard, the University should seek ideological diversity when hiring faculty, in order to broaden perspectives and approaches within an academic field. This responsibility should also fall within the CDO’s job description.
While the CDO is essential to creating diversity, the efforts put forth by a single person are not enough. There also must be more accountability at the departmental level. Faculty diversity should exist within each field, but the necessary steps toward this outcome differ from department to department, and should be addressed locally.
The presence of the CDO is a significant step towards achieving the type of academic community Harvard desires. However, in order to meet the University’s goals, action must continue to occur on a number of fronts. Coleman cannot—and should not—do the job alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked were they thought a typical Harvard student might be on a Friday night, an outsider might guess “the library.” Nevertheless, although it is true that students here work hard, many students have enveloped the old adage of “work hard, play hard”. Yet over the last two years, “play hard” has become “play harder” and that if you were to guess that a typical Harvard student could be found at UHS on a Friday night, you would 43 percent more right than two years ago. The steps Harvard administrators have taken to increase student safety and promote alcohol education have been visible, yet they are completely useless unless accompanied by real consequences for binge drinking on campus.
Despite the steps that Harvard takes to promote safe drinking, the number of students who have been brought in for alcohol-related issues is on the rise for the second year in a row, according to the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
In 2006, Harvard started the Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors program, whose advisors are known as DAPAs, and since the program was started, incoming freshmen are required to attend a meeting on safe drinking. DAPAs also provide grants for alcohol-safe parties on campus. Harvard freshmen also are required to complete AlcoholEDU, and online program that teaches safe drinking habits, before coming to campus.
Nevertheless, the data suggests 43 percent increase in the number of patients since two years ago, and that an “an inordinately high percentage of students that report drinking hard alcohol”—which leads to more hospitalizations. A Crimson article, cites that the number of freshman at Harvard that report taking shots is 39 percent, which is higher than the national average, and more freshmen are identifying themselves as heavy drinkers, more than ever before.
The problem is, however helpful DAPA and AlcoholEDU might be, they will never been able to counteract the real culprit that facilitate binge drinking: Harvard’s amnesty policy. As stated in the Handbook for Students, if someone is brought into University Health Services because of alcohol related issues, he or she would not face disciplinary action from the school for consuming alcohol.  No program condemning binge drinking can ever work without negative ramifications for doing so. It’s the principle of moral hazard: someone who is insulated from risk will behave differently than if they were exposed to a risk. DAPA can preach until they are blue in the face, but if there are no real consequences to binge drinking, then college student will continue to partake.
What students are taking away from DAPA and AlcoholEDU is not that they should adjust their drinking habits so they don’t have to go to UHS, but that they should adjust their attitude to UHS so they don’t have to change their drinking habits. The increase in hospitalizations since the introduction of DAPA might suggest that students are becoming increasingly more concerned for the safety of their classmates. While this is a great step for student health, Harvard should still focus on cracking down on binge drinking altogether.
Binge drinking in college is a huge problem, and the negative ramifications of alcohol are countless. Students are more likely to be arrested, engage in risky sexual activity, and have academic-related problems if they are heavy drinkers. More than 150,000 students will be diagnosed with an alcohol-related health issue each year. What is Harvard doing to stop this? Not enough, and the amnesty policy Harvard has in place is actively hurting the student body. With stricter policies, there might finally be a downward trend in binge drinking, and a happier, healthier student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, the Committee on Student Life decided to end what one of my upperclassman friends called “the best time ever to get bombed and light things on fire.” In other words, there will be no more River Run. The Man has finally put his foot down. But listen, Committee on Student Life. My fellow 2013ers and I are here to tell you that this is an infringement on our God-given rights as students at a highly-selective university that generally gives us what we want. I mean, what am I supposed to do tonight? How will I ever get to know my eighth blockmate, the one whom I agreed to live with because he looks like a total bro in his Facebook profile picture? If we’re going to share a bathroom for the next three years, there is no way we can meet sober!
I learned in APUSH that the 21st Amendment gives me the right to drink when I want—it’s not like there’s any difference between me now and me in two years when I’m actually, technically, legally allowed to drink. Also, my right to demonstrate in public obviously means that I can burn a highly flammable and potentially hazardous boat in the river as a protest against the Quad! Even my grandfather participated in River Run, commissioning one of his servants to erect “an impressive pyre” for the gods. Cancelling River Run is disrespectful and highly offensive to my family—the only reason my parents wrote such generous checks the last 19 years was because they wanted to see me placed in the best House at Harvard. I can’t disappoint them now.
Alleging that there is something “unsafe” about burning a floating celebratory monument in a public water supply is bogus, and the administration knows it. Who is Dean Dingman to stop chemistry from happening by refusing to let water put out fire? Furthermore, it is a blatant violation of students’ rights to station police cordons around the river like we’re animals in a zoo, or convicts in a prison, or irresponsible teenagers who could potentially harm our fellow citizens by lighting things on fire in public spaces.
One more objection: When will I ever get to visit all the upperclass Houses if I can’t take a shot of Rubinoff in front of each one tonight? It’s not like I could walk by on another day, or eat in a friend’s dining hall once we’ve been housed. And it’s too painful to see Mather when you’re sober—all that concrete is bad for the eyes.
But, no matter. When it comes down to it, we freshmen will do what we want. We’re the Class of 2013—we’ve already been admitted to Stillman for alcohol-poisoning more than any other class to date! (Including the post-prohibition class of ’33.) The administration clearly cannot keep us from our self-harming and public-endangering revelry with the meager presence of “scary” state-troopers and a t-shirt slumber party that ends at midnight. If the Grinch stole Christmas, then Dean Dingman and the Committee on Student Life have stolen something far worse: my one shot at hooking up with that hot HoCo chair from Dunster.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Internet freedom means different things to different people. Given the expansion of Internet technology, it is understandable why a state like China, with the world’s largest population of Internet users, would resort to censorship as a means to forestall the Internet’s harms.
Within the framework of personal liberty, the idea that a state would censor to protect is positively Orwellian. The government of China has taken condemnable measures and abused the powers of the Internet for totalitarian gain. They have banned dissent blogs and have hacked into the email accounts of human rights activists and allegedly even Pentagon computers. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was justified in chastising China for its Internet censorship last month in a speech that propelled Internet freedom to the forefront of the United States’ diplomatic agenda.
However, to view the issue of Internet censorship as simply another blatant violation of human rights by the Chinese government is to impose our Western values on a country that considers its heritage and culture of benevolence to be superior to a culture based on property and rights. Such moral universalism is ethnocentric, and, might I add, it is also part of the reason why Google’s move to challenge China’s censorship laws has strained Sino-American relations.
The Chinese government views Google’s decision to challenge China’s censorship laws by threatening to leave the country as yet another instance of Westerners denying China its sovereign right to govern. Furthermore, while some of China’s laws may abridge freedoms considered essential to democracy, their legal weight does not diminish simply because they are the product of a legitimate, albeit authoritarian, regime, instead of the sanctioned handiwork of a puppet government propped up by the United States.
On Dec. 29, China carried out the execution of Akmal Shaikh, a British citizen convicted drug smuggling who became the first European to be executed by China in 58 years. The British government cried foul and protested on the grounds that the man was mentally ill and was not given a proper assessment of his condition during his trial. Many Chinese nationals see this incident and are proud that after half a century, China has finally grown enough of a spine to stand up to the Western imperial powers that defeated them in the Boxer Rebellion and the Opium Wars.
China’s defiance in the face of Google’s threats and Secretary Clinton’s remarks stems from similar sentiments. While the end goal of China’s censorship is probably not as benign as protecting children from molesters and the like, it does serve a purpose within the larger context of effective governing and elevating the quality of life for its massive population. This is no different from United States’ justification of torture in the grander scheme of the “war on terror”. As such, these censorship laws, as well as China’s judicial system, should be conferred some degree of respect and not be immediately delegitimized by the Western standard of human rights.
However, respecting China’s censorship laws does not entail agreeing with them; it simply entails an understanding that China is facing tough challenges as it develops in an era of lightning-fast information flow and is dealing with them through the only means it knows how. I fully support Secretary Clinton’s crusade for greater Internet freedom in countries like China, but I would like to see the process carried out in a more sensitive, less accusatory tone. I admit that it is hard to be neutral when human rights are involved, but employing the rhetoric of human rights so freely is actually counterproductive. By invoking human rights to argue for every policy change that we would like to see from Beijing, we delegitimize the Chinese government by implying that it does not care about the welfare of its citizens. This does not bode well for the future of Sino-American relations.
Dozens of columnists have unofficially hailed 2010 as the start of the Chinese decade. In the Financial Times, Prof. Niall Ferguson, who coined the word “Chimerica” to describe the symbiosis of China and America, lays out a grim prognosis for the Western hegemony, suggesting that this may be “the decade that tilted east.” As a culture, the Chinese do not readily accept praise. Instead of lavishing unrealistically high expectations for China, we should try to view the East through a broader framework than that of our own Western values.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his New York Times column last month, Nicholas D. Kristof ’81-’82 argued that there is a rising trend among socially conservative Christians in realizing that “to be ‘pro-life’ must mean more than opposing abortion.” As proof, Kristof cites the prologue of “The Hole in Our Gospel,” a book by the head of the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision, in which the author describes his encounter in Uganda a decade ago with a thirteen-year-old AIDS orphan raising his two younger brothers on his own. “Where were the followers of Jesus Christ?” the author laments. “How have we missed it so tragically, when even rock stars and Hollywood actors seem to understand?”
As last month’s remake of the song “We Are the World” indicates, internationalism is definitely something that rock stars and Hollywood actors comprehend. The original track, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, was recorded in 1985 by a supergroup of pop artists to benefit famine relief in Africa and became the best-selling single of the 1980s. Twenty-five years later, a planned remake took an unexpected emotional turn when an earthquake hit Haiti and the track once again became a vehicle for collecting humanitarian aid. But a slight lyrical change overlooked by many music critics suggests that these celebrities may be at the forefront of a religious cause in addition to a humanitarian one.
Overall, the remake tended to alienate more critics than it won over. Many, for example, bemoaned the choice of stars to replace the originals: Justin Bieber for Lionel Richie, Miley Cyrus for Dionne Warwick, Nick Jonas for, well, pretty much anybody. The song also came under fire for its auto-tune trifecta, with the computer-assisted voices of Lil’ Wayne, Akon, and T-Pain replacing the natural voices of Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Wonder.
There is, however, a more understated change. In the new version, Lionel Richie changed some of the lyrics to “bring [the song] up to date,” but his rationale is far from obvious. While the second verse originally included the lines “as God has shown us by turning stones to bread/And so we all must lend a helping hand,” the remake tells its listeners that “we can’t let them suffer, no we cannot turn away/Right now, they need a helping hand.” The religious reference, in other words, is conspicuously absent.
One very possible reason he did this is that the original line embarrassingly conflated two different biblical allusions. In the New Testament, Jesus fasts in the desert for forty days following his baptism, and, in Matthew and Luke, Satan tempts Jesus by suggesting that he quell his hunger by turning stones into bread. Apparently, Jackson and Richie confused this story with the story of Jesus feeding the multitudes with a few fish and loaves of bread, which, granted, may have been a more relevant allusion for the famine crisis in Africa than the earthquake in Haiti.
Still, if such great pains were taken by the producers to mimic the original while adding a modern feel, why change these lines? Many other parts of the song—such as the cheesy lead-in music, a Ray Charles interlude (courtesy of Jaime Foxx), and Cyndi Lauper’s ad-libbed arpeggio (courtesy, unfortunately, of Celine Dion)—were all kept more or less intact, save for some sound tweaking. If the producers evidently considered the original to be such a classic, why alter the words? Furthermore, if Richie had changed the lines in order to purge the song of any religious reference, why does Mary J. Blige still croon in the remake that “we are all a part of God’s great big family”?
Rather, it seems that Richie altered this line to create a message that is religiously universal. In the original, if, like many, you do not believe that Jesus is God, its lyrics place a barrier between you and the artists. The newer version, however, keeps the religious angle but broadens it to talk about more than just one religion. Aiding the devastation in Haiti is not just a mission for Christians, the remake tells us—it is the aim of any religious person who believes in the dignity of the human being.
This might not sound like a terribly original message, but it is absolutely essential. In her “Harvard Thinks Big” lecture last month, Harvard Divinity School Professor Diana Eck argued that the increasing complexity of the religious landscape in America necessitated the creation of opportunities for religious pluralism in order to tempter stereotypes, prejudice, and intolerance. Pluralism, Eck explains on her website, is the “active seeking of understanding across lines of difference,” which includes working together on issues upon which different religions can find common ground.
As the edits imply, the aim of the new “We Are the World” is not just to encourage aid in times of crisis, but to reach across religious traditions in order to do so. Perhaps, then, behind T-Pain’s auto-tune and Miley Cyrus’s nasal singing voice, rock stars and Hollywood actors can strengthen our religious outlooks in a more fundamental way than merely instructing us where to send our money.

Massachusetts Supreme Court Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall reflected on how her childhood in apartheid-era South Africa made her more conscious of the influence of the law during a talk last night at Brattle Theatre.
Marshall—the justice who wrote the decision that made same-sex marriage legal in Massachusetts in 2003—said that growing up under apartheid sparked her interest in the law.
“The system I grew up in was a system of injustice,” Marshall said.
Marshall said that because she is white, she could vote, travel freely, and attend an elite school. But she was profoundly aware that many other citizens of South Africa were not afforded these privileges.
When Marshall spent a year of high school in Detroit as a foreign exchange student, she was stunned by the way Americans freely criticized the government, she said.
“When I think about the year I spent in the U.S., I can almost taste the freedom I felt then,” she said.
Marshall said she has watched the way South African justices handle the economic rights afforded by the South African constitution, which include access to water, education, and health care.
“How do judges determine whether or not it is even a judicial decision to close a clinic?” she said. “Perhaps that is a legislative issue.”
Marshall was one of only several girls in her South African high school to pursue a college degree.
She attended college in South Africa before getting a master’s degree in education at Harvard and attending Yale Law School.
Marshall was prohibited from visiting South Africa for decades because she opposed apartheid, she said.
However, she has visited the country frequently since the end of apartheid in the early 1990s.
Last night’s event was part of the Cambridge Center for Adult Education’s Wicked Smart series, which is in its second year.
The center wanted to collaborate with the Commonwealth Journal, a radio program on WUMB 91.9, to help draw on Boston’s intellectual wealth, said Susan Hartnett, the center’s executive director.
“We choose people who we think are ‘wicked smart’: the best and the brightest in the area,” said Janis A. Pryor, the host of Commonwealth Journal, who interviewed Marshall last night. “We wanted to find a way to reinvigorate Harvard Square.”
Wicked Smart is broadcasted over 33 Mass. radio stations to 50,000 to 60,000 listeners, Pryor said.

A glass of wine with dinner might not be a bad idea for your waistline, according to a new study by Harvard researchers, which found that middle-aged and older women who drink moderately experience significantly less weight gain than those who abstain.
This was the first long-term study to follow a large group of women that provides solid evidence for the inverse association between alcohol consumption and weight gain.
Because alcohol is considered to be a substantial source of calories that can contribute to weight gain, these findings can be “counterintuitive,” said Lu Wang, the lead author and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School.
The researchers tracked a group of over 19,000 women aged 38 to 89 and periodically assessed their body mass index, eating habits, and other health indicators. The women were all healthcare professionals who started the study in good health and with a BMI within the normal range.
In the study, light to moderate drinking was defined as consuming an average of two to three alcoholic drinks daily.
At the end of a thirteen-year period, researchers concluded that, overall, the women who drank moderately showed significantly less weight gain than women who did not drink.
“It did surprise us that the association between moderate alcohol consumption and risk of developing obesity was so strong,” said JoAnn E. Manson ’75, a Medical School and School of Public Health professor and one of the study’s authors.
Although the study did not point to any mechanisms to explain this association, the researchers hypothesized that the cause could lie in both the women’s behavior and biology.
Previous studies have shown that women who drink in moderate amounts compensate by consuming fewer non-alcoholic calories and, unlike men, women who drink with meals also tend to reduce their food consumption, Wang explained.
Biological pathways, such as alcohol digestion or fat accumulation in women, may also play a part in this link, Wang said. She added that these areas are potential avenues for future research.
While the study provides a favorable reason for drinking, the researchers emphasized that people should extrapolate from these findings with caution. Manson said that the alcohol amount should be kept moderate, accompanied by healthy eating and regular exercise.
“The key point is that people should definitely not begin drinking for the express purpose of weight control,” Manson said, referencing the host of health problems that have been shown to be associated with alcohol consumption in women.
The study was published Monday in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.

Despite the political stalemates in recent months, young Americans’ approval of President Barack Obama has held steady since November, according to a poll released yesterday by the Institute of Politics.
The online poll, which surveyed 3,117 18 to 29-year-olds during February, found that young Americans are most concerned with the economy and their personal financial situation.
Results showed that 56 percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 approve of Obama’s overall performance, in comparison to a 58 percent approval rating last fall.
However, a majority of young Americans still disapprove of Obama’s handling of specific issues, including health care, the economy, and Afghanistan, with approval ratings ranging from 40 to 46 percent.
“Leading up to and into the 2008 elections, millenials were up in the clouds with their approval of Obama,” said Eric Lu ’12, a leader of the polling committee, referring to the current young adult population. “Millenials were considered an outlier, but recently they seem to be falling into line with mainstream America.”
Nearly half of all four-year undergraduates worry about their ability to stay in school, and 60 percent of those surveyed are concerned about paying their bills, the poll found.
“The decades-old concept that each generation of young people will grow up to be better off than the next one is being questioned,” said IOP Director Bill Purcell.
The poll also found that the slow economy has shifted momentum away from the Democrats in the lead-up to the midterm elections.
Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 said that he has seen this change in the wake of Mass.  Senator Scott P. Brown’s election and the gridlock in healthcare reform.
“But there’s a difference between being enthusiastic and wanting to engage and acting on it,” Berkenfeld said. “At the end of the day, the Democrats are used to turning out college students and getting college students involved.”
The survey also found an increase in the number of young people moving away from the two parties, with 40 percent identifying as independents.
“Even over the last two months, we’ve seen the percentage of independents increase significantly,” said John D. Della Volpe, the IOP’s Director of Polling. “Half of this generation falls pretty neatly within pretty traditional labels.”

Housing Day Eve and its rituals came a day early this year for a few enthusiastic freshmen afraid of incurring the wrath of both the River Gods and the College administration, which had warned the Class of 2013 the police would be monitoring unsafe activity along the river Wednesday night.
Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 sent an e-mail to the freshman class on Friday condemning River Run, a “supposed tradition that involves drinking a lot of alcohol in the courtyard of the Houses along the Charles River.”
Despite the e-mail’s threats, a few freshmen blocking groups decided to take their chances and celebrate River Run a night early.
“We were planning on doing it at some point, but when we got the email we decided to do it tonight,” said one freshman male, who asked to remain anonymous in order to avoid angering the administration whilst pleasing the River Gods.
He added that, along with two of his female blockmates, he looked up safe burning methods online, built a boat out of newspaper, set it on fire, and dropped it into the Charles from Weeks Footbridge, where it “was extinguished quickly.”
The trio then trekked to their seven preferred houses with vodka-filled water bottles to take shots in honor of the River Gods.
One anonymous freshman female said that her blocking group took advantage of what they thought was a loophole in the River Run restrictionsby making a “raft” of sticks and leaves.
A “raft” is “not technically a boat,” she explained.
Her party ultimately decided not to light their floating creation on fire due to safety concerns, though they inscribed it with the names of Houses they feared would claim them—Mather, Dunster, Cabot, and Winthrop—and drew flames around them.
“It’s like the only one of Harvard’s traditions that doesn’t involve public embarassment because youre not running around naked or having sex in the stacks,” she said of her decision to partake in River Run festivities last night.
The College administration moved to crackdown on this year’s River Run after “some members of the Class of 2012 took housing day rituals to an extreme” last year, Dingman wrote in his e-mail.
Last year, some students doused their boats in flammable liquids, such as nail polish, and the Cambridge Fire Department was summoned when onlookers thought the Weld Boathouse was on fire.
“We have so few traditions at Harvard, so to stamp out one we have is disappointing,” the freshman male said. “It would be like trying to stop tailgating at Harvard-Yale.”

Harvard’s on-campus recruiting program, formerly known as e-recruiting, is reflecting signs of stabilization in the financial sector, according to Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities.
Now that the recession is receding, on-campus recruiting has regained some of the banks and consulting firms that fled last year. The total number of interviews conducted through the program increased by 13 percent from last year, with an additional 42 job positions posted and 17 more companies visiting.
“This year, companies feel like the economy is stabilizing,” Mount said. “We definitely see that in the finance sector the work is coming back.”
While on-campus recruiting rates have improved this year, company participation in on-campus recruiting has not yet returned to 2007-2008 levels, according to Mount.
It has also taken employers longer to respond to students with offers this year ,due to increasingly challenging second-round interviews and the snowstorms that recently hit the East Coast, she said.
Mount added she heard from students that second-round interviews were particularly grueling. Employers also told her that students did not perform up to par during round two.
Mount said she believes that employers “upped the ante” because the economic stakes are higher.
Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator Marco Chan ’11 said that although the format of second-round interviews was well-publicized, he found the time crunch between the first and second round to be challenging. For one firm he interviewed with, the first-round interview was on Monday and the next round was on Friday.
“Considering you have to travel for some, the big challenge is dealing with an extra set of activities,” he said.
Harvard’s calendar changes made the recruiting season more condensed this year, according to Deborah Carroll, assistant director of career services for on-campus recruiting and employer relations. But she added that some students found it beneficial to be able to work on applications during J-Term.
Carroll said that OCS is still posting a number of new job offers online. The office will host a workshop on April 1 called “Second Shot at Summer” for students who did not receive funding for summer programs or did not receive offers through on-campus recruiting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II of this story appeared on March 11, 2010.)
Gregory M. Sensing works at the Harvard School of Public Health. He goes to work, he goes home, he decides what to make for dinner and when to do the laundry. But for most of his life, he’s faced a struggle that something internal does not seem quite right.
“I don’t have any sort of debilitating disease or disorder that keeps me from moving through life, but there’s always this underlying static hum every minute of every day, saying that this is not my body.”
Sensing was born female but has been living as a man for six years. Although he is taking sex hormones and plans on getting sex reassignment surgery, not all transgender people approach the process of transition in the same way, and some decide not to make medical changes at all. For many, finding a way to pay for medical treatment is a hindrance in their transition, but the increasing visibility of the transgender community in the United States has brought issues of discrimination, medical care, and compassion into the public eye.
As transgender people struggle to pay the bills and feel comfortable in their own skin, institutions are working to address their needs. In the continuing effort to create an equitable and inclusive campus, Harvard University Health Services modified its insurance policy last fall to cover top surgery for transgender people covered by the University’s Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance.
EXCLUDING EXCLUSIONS
At Harvard’s behest, Blue Cross Blue Shield modified their University-specific policy on transgender services. Employee coverage went into effect on Jan. 1, and student coverage will begin on Aug. 1, 2010.
Blue Cross developed a policy outlining generic medical coverage criteria for both top and bottom surgeries. However, Harvard has decided to remove the exclusion only for top surgeries—that is, breast augmentation and mastectomies—for now, as the possibility of covering genital surgeries is still being investigated.
“One concern they have is with the lack of qualified local providers,” says Noah E. Lewis, staff attorney for the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund and a 2005 graduate of Harvard Law School. “Which, of course, is the result of insurance exclusions in the first place.”
Prior to the modification, Harvard subscribed to a standard plan from Blue Cross that specifically excluded “services and supplies that are related to sex change surgery or to the reversal of a sex change.”
According to Lewis, the UHS exclusion forced transgender people to pay the same insurance premiums as other members of the Harvard community, without receiving equal benefits in return.
“The exclusion for transgender services stuck out like a sore thumb,” he says. “If transgender health care were not explicitly singled out for exclusion, these services would be covered, as would any other medically necessary drug or surgery.”
Lewis says that such insurance exclusions reflect outdated prejudices against transgender people.
The new policy states that “gender reassignment surgery is one treatment option for Gender Identity Disorder, a condition in which a person feels a strong and persistent identification with the opposite gender accompanied by a strong sense of discomfort with their own gender.”
While members of the transgender community dispute the label of a “disorder,” most are hopeful that this is the first step in a more inclusive policy of medical treatment.
FROM POLICY TO PRACTICE
The change in insurance coverage is in keeping with Harvard’s non-discrimination policy, which states that any form of discrimination based on race, religion, sex, political beliefs, and other categories contradicts the principles and policies of the University. This list was modified in July 2006 to include gender identity.
“Putting the insurance policy in line with Harvard’s goals of equity and inclusion goes along with the non-discrimination statement,” says Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, chair of Harvard Transgender Task Force. She says that the University is working to find places where policies or practices may be discriminatory and trying to change those behaviors.
“A lot of people don’t realize that using a bathroom or checking off gender on a form can be stressful to gender nonconforming people,” she says. “Some of the discrimination that goes on is just unconscious or routine rather than in the form of harassment or outright malice.”
While part of the changed insurance policy came from attempts to adhere to the university’s non-discrimination policy, the removal of the exclusion of coverage for the surgery has been years in the making. UHS agreed to cover sex hormones when the new policy was adopted in 2006, but the transgender community continued to fight for other necessary surgeries and cosmetic changes necessary in the process of sexual realignment.
ENSURING COVERAGE
Ultimately, a combination of pressure from within UHS, TTF, and other transgender individuals studying or working at the University contributed to the most recent change.
“TTF is very lucky that there is a core group of mental health professionals and administrators who understand where we’re coming from and act as our allies,” says Morgan L. Haven-Tietze ’10, a member of TTF. “TTF used to have to sift for understanding people in the administration, and now there are people who speak persuasively on our behalf.”
One such spokesperson has been Sara Kimmel, a psychologist at UHS. Kimmel consulted many members of Harvard’s transgender community and advocated against the discriminatory policy. She wrote in an e-mail that a team of medical experts examined the safety and efficacy of the related procedures while deliberating on the policy changes, and determined that top surgeries for gender confirming purposes are often medically necessary for transgender individuals hoping to pursue medical transitioning treatment options.
“For students and employees who have a medical need for the procedures that are now covered, it is an important increase in accessibility to surgeries that significantly improve one’s quality of life and often are necessary for ensuring safety,” she wrote.
Recognizing transgender as a medical need was another reason for removing the exclusion.Many transgender people experience discomfort and depression because of the incongruence between body and mind, a sentiment that is becoming more widely accepted as constituting a medical need and a right to treatment.
In June of 2008, the American Medical Association resolved as an association to “support public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patient’s physician.”
THE BATTLE ISN’T OVER
Students and employees are hopeful that the remaining exclusions will be removed in the near future.
“As further medical technology develops there’ll be further discussion about removing exemptions; I am hopeful they can be removed soon, and I don’t think we should feel content until they are,” says Rosenberg, who says the battle is not over yet.
“Say your insurance covers chemotherapy and you don’t have cancer but someone else does,” she posited. “That’s why it’s called insurance—it’s supposed to cover you for many conditions you never have and some you might have someday.”
Sensing, who is planning on having the surgery within the next few months, uses similar logic.
“I wouldn’t object if I were asked to pay a few cents extra for someone else’s need to have insurance cover something like prenatal care or a prostate exam, or some other procedure not applicable to me,” he says. “If it helps someone in my community have a healthier and saner life, the extra cost is a non-issue. It’s just the right thing to do.”
“There’s still a long list of things that aren’t covered, and it’s unclear to me why some things are covered and some aren’t.” he added. “If you’re going to cover two, why stop there?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to burgeoning student interest over the past few years, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will create a new biomedical engineering concentration, marking the start of the school’s ambitions to expand existing tracks into independent concentrations.
The proposed concentration, passed unanimously by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on March 2, was designed to meet the needs of pre-med students who seek a more quantitative alternative to the life sciences track at the College, several SEAS administrators said.
Members of the Class of 2011 will be the first to graduate with a degree in biomedical engineering instead of the umbrella engineering sciences concentration.
The creation of separate concentrations will allow Harvard to raise its “visibility” in recruiting students interested in engineering, according to Associate Dean for Academic Programs Robert D. Howe.
“We’ll be a full-service engineering school and able to compete with the larger engineering schools,” Howe said.
Efforts to expand the engineering sciences curriculum first began under the leadership of then-Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti.
Creating a separate concentration for biomedical engineering will not require “a vast effort,” Howe said, as SEAS already offers the requisite classes and has faculty members who focus on biomedical engineering.
Howe added that he hopes to see an expansion in course offerings and hire additional faculty members over the next several years to strengthen the school’s foothold in the field.
David J. Mooney, an associate dean for chemical and biological sciences and engineering, stressed that the change will formally recognize the work that students currently pursue under the biomedical engineering track.
“[This change] is going to serve the students really well,” said Mooney, who is spearheading the transition.  “They’ll have a diploma that says ‘Biomedical Engineering’ on it, instead of ‘Engineering Sciences.’”
Mooney added that he expects the new concentration to be popular among undergraduates.
The number of declared concentrators in SEAS has increased by nearly 40 percent since its establishment as a school in 2007.
Several engineering concentrators expressed enthusiasm about the news, though they noted that this change comes relatively late.
“If I were a sophomore and I had a chance to switch, I’d definitely switch,” Shiv M. Gaglani ’10 said. “The fact that Harvard didn’t have its own bioengineering concentration with interdisciplinary courses was kind of outmoded.”
Christopher M. Madl ’11, an engineering sciences concentrator who does not currently plan on switching to biomedical engineering, said that he believes the new concentration will attract pre-med students.
“I won’t be 100 percent sure until I see the course requirements,” Madl said about switching concentrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team looked to continue the momentum it gained from the first win of the season last Saturday, but the Crimson had its hopes dashed by the Springfield Pride.
Despite a close first set, Harvard (1-10) suffered a 3-0 loss to Springfield (12-6) last night at the Malkin Athletic Center. The team had leads early in each of the three games, but could not take advantage of them, giving the win to the Pride.
“We just made too many unforced errors through the match,” coach Brian Baise said. “We couldn’t stop Springfield tonight and they just kept running over us over and over again. And when you play a team that does that, you can’t give them any unforced errors.”
The first game was all about Crimson sophomore Matt Jones. Jones, who had 14 kills in the match, started the set with two kills in a row to give Harvard a 6-2 lead. The Crimson was able to hold that advantage for most of the first set, setting up Jones for the kill on the outside time after time. The momentum from Harvard’s attack forced Springfield to take a timeout and regroup.
Coming out of the break, though, the Pride went on a 6-2 run to take a two-point lead. But Jones ended the run with another kill to bring the Crimson within one point. It was a tense set at the end as each team traded points, but Springfield ended up too strong for Harvard.
Tied at 35, the Crimson made a crucial error. Thinking the ball was going out of bounds, the team’s passers watched as the ball landed on the line to give the Pride set point. Springfield took the first set, 37-35, when sophomore Nikola Ivica hit the ball out of bounds.
“We made a couple of messy mistakes in that first set,” co-captain Erik Kuld said. “We know it’s something we need to improve, and that’s something we’re working on as a team.”
Harvard was all out of sorts in the second set, demoralized from the close first-set loss. The Pride did not look back as it surged to an 11-7 lead, and freshman Greg Falcone sent a message to the Crimson with a fierce kill on the first point. Springfield extended the lead to 18-14, forcing Harvard to take a timeout.
The Pride continued its momentum, coming out with a 5-2 run to move even closer to a two-set advantage. Springfield’s domination in the second set showed when one of its players dove to save a ball and the team managed to save the point. The Pride ended the Crimson’s misery in the second set when a Springfield spike deflected off of Harvard out of bounds, giving the visiting team the second set, 30-18.
“I think the first set was one of those we needed to win to give us extra confidence in the match,” Kuld said. “We were close, but we just needed to close it out.”
Yet, the Crimson battled back in the third set, going on an 8-4 run with the help of a kill from Kuld. Harvard held the lead temporarily, but the team lost momentum when it miscommunicated on a play. Co-captain Gil Weintraub set the ball for a spike, but nobody was there to hit it, as the players watched the ball fall to the ground.
The Crimson fell behind 19-22, but was able to bring the set within one point with two Kuld kills. But junior Alberto Bravo of the Pride responded with a kill of his own to steal the momentum back. Facing a 21-25 deficit, Harvad was forced to take a timeout, but tied up the score by winning the next four points out of the break.
In the end, Springfield proved to be too strong, as senior AJ Nally ended the match with a kill that deflected off of freshman Derek Jansma.
The Crimson looks to rebound from this defeat and gain its second win of the season as it travels to Rivier next Wednesday. Despite the loss, the team remains hopeful that it can recover and regain its momentum.
“I think the new lineup we’re working with has its advantages and disadvantages,” Baise said. “I think we’re going to stick with it for now and keep trying some things to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering yesterday’s game against No. 15 University of New Hampshire (4-1), the Harvard women’s lacrosse team faced a tall order, looking to defeat its first nationally-ranked opponent of the year. The Crimson was poised to negate last weekend’s loss to Johns Hopkins and improve upon its 1-1 record to open the new season.
But it would take all of regulation play plus two overtime frames for sophomore Melanie Baskind to net the game-winning goal and lead Harvard to a 10-9 victory over UNH in Durham, N.H.
The Crimson fended off the Wildcats for much of the first half, producing a commanding 8-4 lead heading into halftime.  New Hampshire’s offense would claw back, mounting an offensive onslaught against Harvard in the second period, outshooting the Crimson, 13-2.
With less than two minutes left to play in the game, Wildcat Kate Keagins’ goal robbed Harvard of a regulation victory, sending the contest into two overtimes.
Despite controlling the draw to kick off the additional session, the Crimson struggled to get shots on goal, as Harvard appeared on the verge of letting a win narrowly slip away.
“[UNH] is just a really solid team,” co-captain Sara Flood said. “They came out strong in the second half, drew controls their way, and slowed down the game offensively for us.”
But Baskind had quite a different destiny in mind for the Crimson. With only 20 seconds remaining in double overtime and a successful attempt to clear by Harvard, Baskind located the back of the net, allowing the Crimson to pull off a crucial 10-9 thriller on the road.
“[What made the difference was] we played solid defense,” Flood said. “The team has been working on that a lot lately—communicating more and putting in a solid effort. We were also a little more patient on the attack side.”
Although a sophomore, Baskind is playing in her first season on the women’s lacrosse team. A new face on the field, she is no stranger to Harvard sports, as she is also a member of the varsity soccer squad.
“Melanie has stepped into a really big role,” Flood said. “She’s giving it her best every single day. She’s just an amazing athlete and is so coachable.”
The midfielder no doubt showcased her versatility yesterday, racking up a pair of goals and ground balls. Freshman Danielle Tetreault also had two goals, and Flood scored one goal and drew four controls.
Freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen’s five goals tallied for a team-high 11 goals on the season. Senior goalie Katherine Martino had 11 saves on the day.
With the win, the Crimson snapped the Wildcats’ unbeaten streak and leveled their overall record against UNH to 18-18.
Harvard asserted its dominance on the field in spite of the absence of junior attacker Jess Halpern, who is out with an injured knee. Halpern staged her own overtime upset against the Wildcats last season with a goal late in the second frame during what went on to become an 11-9 OT Crimson win at Cumnock Field.
“[Jess’s absence] is a really big loss,” Flood said. “We handled it really well though. Everyone stepped it up on offense to make up for what she does well.”
Harvard will now focus its attention on upcoming Ivy League competition, starting by wrapping up its road trip against No. 3 Penn on Saturday.
“The Ivy League has four top twenty teams,” coach Lisa Miller said before the season. “It’s a tough schedule, but it’s doable. In my mind, of the games you play, a third are always winnable games, a third are fifty-fifty games, and a third are reach games. And then you try to win your conference to get into the tournament. I’m ready for a change, and I’m optimistic and I’m realistic about the timing of things and I think we should make a move. We’ll have even more depth.”

A Dartmouth three-pointer and two free throws put the Big Green within three points of Harvard with less than two minutes to play in last night’s Ivy League matchup, though the Crimson had led the Big Green by a comfortable margin until the last few minutes of play.
Fortunately for Harvard, sophomore point guard Brogan Berry nailed two free throws, shooting one-and-one with 41 seconds remaining to seal the Crimson lead over Dartmouth. Harvard (20-8, 11-3 Ivy) earned its 20th win of the season with a 64-59 victory over the Big Green (11-17, 6-8 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion.
Though the Crimson never trailed the Big Green, Dartmouth forged a comeback in the last five minutes. Freshman guard Faziah Steen led the surge for the Big Green with 23 points, shooting 9-of-14 from behind the arc.
“They really locked it down on defense at the end of the game,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said. “We had too many fouls…We need to move our feet better and not reach as much, because we let them back in the game scoring when the clock was stopped.”
Harvard was able to end the game with a win, thanks to a balanced and composed offensive effort. Matera led the team in scoring with 17 points—including an impressive five-of-eight in three-pointers—and five Crimson players scored a least ten points.
Freshman guard Victoria Lippert, who shot four-of-eight from the field, made an impact for Harvard late in the game, hitting a three-pointer with 4:30 left to play to put the Crimson up 59-48 and stop Dartmouth from gaining momentum. Berry distributed the ball well, recording a game-high ten assists, in addition to six points of her own.
“I thought we did a lot of good things tonight,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I thought we mostly made good decisions on the offensive end. It was on the defensive end that there were times we made errors that I don’t like my team to make.”
Freshman forward Miriam Rutzen also came up big for the Crimson last night with a career-high 11 points, along with four blocks and three steals.
Harvard began the contest with a bang, starting out with a 6-2 run and leading by as much as 12 in the first half.
“We came out really strongly, attacking both on defense and offense,” Matera said. “That was something we were looking to do. I think the last game we came out more on our heels and they set the tempo, so we were looking to come out on fire.”
Junior guard Jackie Alemany had an especially strong first half, starting the game’s scoring with a three-pointer and contributing to the Crimson’s first nine points. Alemany shot four-of-eight from the field and was two-of-three from behind the arc, contributing 10 points and four assists for Harvard.
“Jackie has been a gamer for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s the spark plug. She just has that role and brings a lot of energy and passion to the floor.”
The Crimson controlled the tempo of play for the majority of the second half. Harvard was able to pull away from the Big Green right from the start of the half on a Matera three-pointer dished from Alemany on the first play of the half. Unfortunately for the Crimson, this momentum did not last.
“[After the strong beginning, the game] started to slow down, which was more of [Dartmouth’s] pace,” Matera said. “That’s what let them get back into the game.”
The game turned out to be a battle of three-point shooters, as 30 of Harvard’s points and 21 of the Big Green’s points came from three-point range. The Crimson ultimately outlasted Dartmouth, despite the very competitive last five minutes of play.  The outcome of this game carried particular importance for Harvard, as Dartmouth defeated the Crimson in a tight early-season matchup by a score of 45-44. A traditionally fast and aggressive team, the Big Green also defeated Harvard last year, ending the Crimson’s attempt at a three-peat in Ivy League titles.
“It will always be a rivalry,”  Delaney-Smith said. “It’s not so much this year because they sort of fell out of the race a little bit earlier than we did. We feel they upset us in the first game. That’s why I thought we really needed to make a statement here and get a [win].”
With the win in hand, Harvard looks forward to the postseason, as the imminent WNIT tournament poses a welcome challenge for the dynamic Crimson offense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's volleyball team's victory over New Jersey Science and Technology University last weekend was a spark of hope in what has been so far an underachieving season.
Reviewing the first 10 games, in which all except one have been losses, one of the key flaws of the team is its overall lack of efficiency both offensively and defensively. The Crimson offense has been error prone, committing 241 errors on 1118 total attacks this season. Harvard falls below its opponents in attack percentage, .191 to .289, as well as kills per set, at 13.4 to 14.9. Additionally, service errors —148 and counting—take away important and hard-earned possessions.
The fact that the Crimson cannot take advantage of its chances on offense is a big part of the reason for its losing record. In fact, in the 3-1 loss to the Stevens Institute of Technology four days ago, the team committed three service errors to give the game to the Ducks.
On the defensive end, Harvard falls below its opponents in total blocks 64.5 to 92.5. Also, it has committed 66 serve reception errors, translating to 1.9 errors per set. While this might not seem like a big number, momentum plays a huge role in the game of volleyball, and sophomore Matt Jones stressed the importance of stopping the opponent team's runs, a feat that can only be achieved through a more efficient and error-free defense.
On the bright side, the team has seen huge contributions from its young starters, with sophomores Nicola Ivica and Jones recording a combined 196 kills and freshman Derek Jansma getting 60 digs to lead the team. With the new lineup change and the team's recent shift in morale, the Crimson still has hopes of having a good season, provided the team plays more efficiently in both aspects of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have to admit, before this year I had never seen any wrestling matches in my life, live or on television. Sure, I had seen WWE wrestling with the dramatic storylines and fighting that captivated me as a child. But watching co-captain J.P. O’Connor and the other Harvard wrestlers for the first time was a new experience that suddenly made me interested in the sport.
This past weekend, O’Connor stepped onto the mat as the favorite at the EIWA Championships at Lehigh. He had been to the finals each of the last three years, but fell in the championship match every time, despite earning All-American honors in two of those seasons. This time around, as the No. 1 wrestler in the country at 157 pounds and with a 29-0 record on the season, O’Connor came into the final as the clear favorite. The question still remained, though, if he would be able to pull off the win that had eluded him for three years. Would he be able to do what only two other Harvard wrestlers in his weight class had done before?
O’Connor put all of the questions to rest and fought past whatever nerves he had to take the championship match in a 3-1 decision against Navy’s Bryce Saddoris, the No. 3 seed. Along with two of his other teammates, co-captain Louis Caputo and freshman Steven Keith, the senior qualified for the NCAA Championships at the end of this month. I haven’t heard much talk about his accomplishments on campus and there are not full crowds at the matches, but it’s a shame that more students did not get to see O’Connor in his final year of action in a Crimson singlet. Sure, it’s not exactly like the WWE wrestling from my childhood, but there is plenty of drama in watching the No .1 wrestler at 157 pounds go after a title he’s been seeking for years and cap off Harvard's second undefeated season in its history. Now, if only these storylines headlined HBO specials, Crimson wrestling and its stars might get the attention they deserve.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and  rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few  days. Click here to read more about our project.
Everyone  wants to eat in Quincy. Everyone wants to have their student group  meetings in Quincy. Everyone wants to crash the Masters’ open houses and party on the  roof. Clearly  everyone wishes they could be in Quincy. And people who live in the  House can tell you, those wishes are well-placed. Have you ever heard a Quincyite say, “Quincy is great, despite. . .”? Didn’t think so. Although Quincy may not be the  most aesthetically pleasing or have the most house spirit, there are no serious drawbacks to living  there.
Dining Hall: The Quincy d-hall is arguably the most popular on campus, due  to its proximity to the yard and the lack of restrictions on upperclass outsiders. Residents have grown accustomed  to arriving at meals unable to find a seat or recognize half of the  present  diners. But during off-hours or Thursday community dinners, the d-hall—which  resembles a ski lodge complete with floor to ceiling windows—is  a homey and comfortable place to meet up with friends for a meal or to  tackle that p-set. And despite their disproportionately high workload, the d-hall  staff manages to stay friendly and become an integral part of the house  community.  The mural at the back of the room is, however, unfortunate. And by  unfortunate we mean ugly and confusing.
Score:  +200 for sliders at community dinner, -10,000 for overcrowding, -75 for  the mural
Common  Spaces: Quincy  boasts a variety of common areas, although many are perpetually booked  by outside student groups. The Junior Common Room is a popular location for both  studying and gatherings to watch major events on the plasma screen TV.  The Quincy Grille, open until 2 a.m. during the week and 4 a.m. on weekends, is an always popular and  convenient choice for late night munchies—and they accept Board Plus. The Grille, which also has a  TV, can sometimes be crowded, but the wait makes those mozzarella sticks taste that much better. And the ping-pong table, a relatively new  addition to the lobby, is a popular after-dinner hangout spot for  rookies and hardcore players alike.
Score: -50 for never getting to see  the inside of the Spindell Room since it’s always booked, +350 since Quincyites have the right to kick out  intruding student groups in the JCR
Rooms: Quincy sophomores, like their counterparts in many other houses, are not immune from  lackluster housing  conditions. Those not placed in DeWolfe will find themselves living in cramped doubles and triples in Old Quincy, often complete  with awkward walkthroughs. But  most residents’ suffering will be rewarded with n+1 duplex suites in New Quincy in their junior and senior years. Senior quads feature immense common rooms that  are ideal for parties and many of which  are furnished with bars left behind by previous occupants.  You’ll also save a lot of money on pest  control. This FlyBy correspondent has yet to see a single roach or mouse during  her time in Quincy. Finally, New Quincy contains all the necessary amenities (most  notably the dining hall), so living there means you will never have to  go outside again.
Score:  -400 since  it gets reeeeeaaalllly cold in New Quincy during the  winter, +30,000 for the good odds that you are in n+1 as a junior.
House spirit: Quincy’s house spirit takes a more friendly and laid back approach than many other houses  do. Spirit never reaches the “ZOMG QUINCY IS SOOOO MUCH MORE AWSUMMM THAN YOU” level of obnoxiousness attained by other houses  (Mather we're looking at you), but Quincy residents are still proud of their home. House Masters Lee and Deb Gehrke are actively involved in student life and often can be  seen dining with students, opening up their apartment for Rock Band, or destroying students at  ping-pong. Stein clubs are not Quincy’s strongest point, but there are  events such as Field Day, the newly implemented talent show, and  Assassins every spring that bring the house together for carefree fun.  The House e-mail list, which once regularly featured arguments about  dining hall restrictions, has been sadly quiet for the last year.  Although banning freshmen from the dining hall has contributed to the peace within the house, this FlyBy correspondent admits to being  somewhat bored with the lack of controversy on the House list.
Score:  +5000 for having no fights, this means everyone loves Quincy. -2000 for  having no fights, because it’s boring.
Location: Quincy’s Plympton Street location isn’t far from anyplace you might need to go—except the Quad or beyond the  Science Center, but those are far for everyone. You might be disappointed to be  deprived a river view from your bedroom, but you’ll see the light when  you realize that the Yard, Eliot, and Mather are simultaneously only  five minutes away.
Score: +125 for not needing a shuttle  to get to class, -50 because the airport still requires a taxi (or the T)
Quirks: The Qube library, which juts out of New Quincy and is  supported on stilts, hosts its sizeable comic book collection—although you will need to ask to  see it.  There is also a gigantic stuffed white—gorilla, or something, we at FlyBy aren’t quite sure—that migrates  around the library. Also, Quincy’s mascot, voted into existence only a few years  ago, is the penguin.
Score:  +400 for the gorilla, -10,000 for not having a creepy horrible story in  the House’s history
Committee Rank: 7 out of 12, you're the best of the bottom half.

With only a few days remaining, Harvard's Houses have been releasing YouTube videos at a steady clip. The videos are filled with memes and pop songs. Some are pretty bad; others make us want to transfer from our lame Houses and into ones that know how to make a quality video.
Adams House
The new Adams House video features an original song in the vein of “Almost There” from Disney's “The Princess and the Frog" in which Adams House residents strut their stuff on a short walk to their House’s front entrance.
The song’s narrator tells a girl he meets in Widener, “Come and let me take you back to Plympton Street,” and finally, “Baby won’t you let me show you what it means to be gold coasted all night long,” as House inhabitants dance to the music.
Mather House
Mather’s video, “Concrete Seduction,” is heavily auto-tuned with some special effects scattered in for good measure. It shows a continuous party throughout the House. A gorilla and wizard roam the halls, opening the doors to reveal rooms filled with dancing Matherites. In the final rap, an unsuspecting first-year succumbs to the “concrete seduction,” as the featured vocalists verbally batter the other Houses—“Cabot sucks and Dunster swallows / Jerkland blows and Adams follows.”
While this year’s video was unable to top Mather’s masterpiece last year, it is a solid attempt and makes sure to brag about everything the House is known for—“singles for life,” the Mather Lather, the “Mather Express” shuttle, and concrete walls.
Eliot House 
Eliot’s video, entitled “(10,000) Days of Eliot,” opens with a faux-biblical quotation, extolling, “The LORD makes a distinction between Eliot and the other houses.” Following the quote, it is Housing Day, and we see the depressed reactions of the freshmen, who have not received an envelope with Eliot House scribbled inside. Their reactions range from shock to dread, all the way to tears. A new Kirkland resident even goes so far as to push their letter back under the door.
Finally, however, the video’s protagonist excitedly finds out he has been placed in Eliot, and walks from his dorm in Matthews down to the House in a celebratory dance a la “(500) Days of Summer”—complete with Hall and Oats’ “You Make My Dreams.” Hugging and high-fiving everyone he meets, he arrives in the Eliot d-hall to find it filled with dancing upperclassmen, welcoming him to his new home.
The Harvard Hooligans released another YouTube video in support of Eliot.
They ask students and staff about the other Houses and each time they receive a negative answer. For example when one student is asked about his impression of Quincy House, he responds, “I used to beat the shit out of a kid named Quincy.” Another student asserts throughout the video that he’s never heard of the Quad, while another alludes to the Mather House video, saying, “Concrete seduction, more like child abduction.”
Kirkland House
Kirkland House weighs in with a mere 14-second video clip.  With T.I.’s “What You Know” playing in the background, red letters on a black background read, “There’s really only one thing you need to know about Kirkland House. The ‘Holiday Dinner and Dance’ is for Kirkland Residents only.” A last ditch effort to endorse Kirkland with the days counting down? Maybe the prospect of Incest Fest will be enough to excite incoming Kirklanders, but this video sure won’t do the trick.
Winthrop House
Winthrop opens with a shout-out from Wyclef Jean and then goes immediately into a re-tooled version of Ke$ha’s “Tik Tok,” opening with “Wake up in the morning feeling like Bernanke.” Winthrop’s lion leaves its room and makes its way through the House and into the Yard, partying the whole way.
The video ends with a dubbed video of a little girl crying about how much she loves Winthrop House. Here is the original video of the girl crying about Justin Bieber.
Dunster House
Dunster splices Old Spice’s popular Super Bowl Ad with great success. The voice work in this is spot on. Make sure to watch it until the end because you are in for an exciting twist on what was already a cool ad.
While these videos are no replacement for getting your housing assignment, after watching these demonstrations of House pride, freshmen should have a few more reasons to believe that every House has something to offer.

Lowell House is close to the Yard, next to the MAC, and sometimes, too close to Noch's. While Lowell's detractors will complain about the Russian Bells (they’re only annoying on Sundays at 1 p.m.), there isn’t much to dislike about this Neo-Georgian beauty. If Lowell residents come to greet you on Housing Day, revel in the glory that the Housing Gods have bestowed upon you—for the next three years, you'll belong to a House that you'll be proud to show off to your parents and jealous peers.
Dining Hall
The dining hall, like most of above-ground Lowell, is gorgeous. With its fancy chandeliers, huge windows, yellow walls, and high ceilings, it is the perfect place to eat. When the opera comes to town (every spring), though, it gets a bit more cramped and the dining restrictions border on ridiculous—no guests allowed. It is pretty embarrassing when you show up with a non-Lowell buddy during opera season and get turned away from your own House’s dining hall. But for most of the year, Lowell is a great place to dine with friends; it’s neither as crowded as Adams or Quincy nor as far as the Quad.
While the dining hall itself will brighten your day, the food is nothing special—it’s HUDS just like they serve everywhere else. And there is nowhere to retreat for a late night hamburger either. Lowell has a “grille” in its basement, but it is serves only as a party space and the home to Lowell’s Thursday stein clubs.
Score: +10,000 for big windows looking out onto a nice green courtyard, -500 for the opera
Common Spaces
Most of Lowell’s useful common spaces are underground. It is a pretty ugly world down there, but at least you'll be protected from the elements. When the weather gets bad, you can get pretty much wherever you want to go in Lowell via the tunnels. There are two classrooms in the basement, which are great for study groups. There’s also the library, which doesn’t have bars over its books. For a more lively studying environment, you can work in the dining hall, which is always open and usually pretty well populated.
As we mentioned, the grille is in the basement and can be used for parties. Currently it’s a pretty boring space, and its foosball and pool tables are in poor condition. But rumor has it that the House Committee is thinking about ways to fix the place up.
Score: +10 for no bars, +100,000,000 for tunnels on cold winter days, -800 for the underused and ugly grille.
Rooms
Sophomores don’t get much say in their rooming assignments. You fill out a form and then it is up to House Administrator Beth Terry to sort out the rest. Expect a walk-through your first year here. The rooms can be a bit small, especially compared to your friends’ suites in the Quad or your linkmates’ rooms in Adams. But the housing gets better (Lowell is certainly no Winthrop). Next year, Lowell will be taking over a floor of DeWolfe, so sophomores will also have that option. Eventually, if you are looking for a party suite, there’s the nine-room Lowell Labyrinth, which sits above the library.
Score: +0 pretty standard
House Spirit
This is probably the category in which Lowell House is most lacking. The House e-mail list, creatively named Lowell-Open, rarely hosts a heated—or even lively—discussion. For the most part, the House list is used to plug upcoming events. As for intramurals, they are sometimes well-attended, but it can be a struggle to find enough girls to fill up the teams.
Lowell's Thursday stein clubs are a great source of fun, community, and alcohol. Show up to a stein club and you'll generally find much better alcohol than what you'd normally buy for your own room. Why drink Rubinoff when you could have some yummy Smirnoff Ice or beer that actually tastes good?
It would also be remiss to talk about Lowell House spirit without a mention of the famous Teas. Every Thursday at 5 p.m., head over to the Masters' Residence, hang out with our two wonderful House Masters Diana Eck and Dorothy Austin, and enjoy some tea and desserts.
Lowell certainly does not stack up to houses like Mather when it comes to unbridled House pride. But to some degree, that seems to come from a belief that Lowellians have no need to prove how great their house is. Why make a video for housing day when it could always look silly—doesn’t everyone want to be in Lowell anyway?
Score: +40 for teas, +400 for Stein Clubs, +4,000 for awesome housemasters, -300 for no Housing Day video
Location
Lowell has prime real estate. With the exception of Adams, and even that is debatable, there is no better place to be positioned geographically. Lowell is steps away from another House in every direction, and residents also have exclusive access to the House's back gate. Need to make a beeline for Eliot, Kirkland, or Winthrop? As a Lowellian, there's no need to walk all the way around Lowell like the plebian masses—just go out the back.
Score: +500,000 for domination in this category
Quirks
Lowell has some pretty sweet events. Sophomores get to go on a boat cruise down the Charles with Dorothy and Diana. The House also plays host to speakers organized just for Lowellians. For example, this past week, we had former U.S. Soliciter General Seth P. Waxman '73 and a bank-robber-turned-jail-house-legal-expert in the Junior Common Room fielding questions from students for over an hour.
Score: +10 for cool events, -5 for not leaving anything to complain about
Committee Rank: 5 out of 12, you're tied with Mather.

You may be turned off by concrete at first. Regal  old Harvard—mantelpieces, window seats, chandeliers—that’s what turns  you on.  But after moving into Mather,  you’ll be welcomed into a vibrant House community, get invited to one  of the parties that occur here each weekend, and hook up with a hot  Matherite in your (guaranteed) single. Concrete is seductive.
Dining  Hall
Matherites are  blessed with a bright and airy dining hall with cushioned seats, plenty  of room (none of that awkward I-can’t-fit-between-chairs crap you see  in Adams), a variety of table sizes (admit it, you prefer two seats  between you and the nearest acquaintance/awkward former hook-up), and  full-length windows that gaze directly onto the river. There’s even a  book-exchange shelf! Dining Hall Manager Michelle will know your thesis  topic, favorite food, and go-to bad-day outfit. Mather has  no dining restrictions. (Feel the democracy. Feel the love. Okay, feel the  distance.) The food is premium HUDS, it never runs out, there’s plenty  of variety at the salad bar, and the grill chefs have skillz. 
 
Score: +500 for staff friendliness, -20 for occasional blinding  sunlight from the windows 
Common Spaces
Mather has  a standard Junior Common Room (comfy couches, regulation size ping pong table, flat  screen TV, convenient kitchen), a “Big TV Room” with a pool table  and enough seating for a respectable Super Bowl party, and a “Small  TV Room” with a popular foosball table. But what really sets Mather apart  is the 24-hour library with a sweeping (concrete) spiral staircase and two-story  windows. Pulling an all-nighter? Come to the  d-hall, where brain break is available until breakfast, 20 of your  closest friends are doing that CS50 problem set, and at least one other  hapless soul will commiserate with you as you watch the sunrise over the  Charles.  
 
Score: +75 for late night  d-hall community, -100 for foosball procrastination 
Rooms
Mather’s  motto is “singles for life,” which refers to the fact that all  Matherites are guaranteed a single—either a medium-sized one within a  spacious, sunlit, low-rise suite, or a huge one in Mather’s  18-story tower. Suites consist of four, five, or six bedrooms located above or below  a common room large enough to fit three  futons, a bunk-bed-turned-double-decker couch, and a big screen TV (it’s  been done). Tower rooms are in clusters of five, and while they don’t  have common rooms, they do boast striking views of the Charles and  Boston. Sure, the walls are concrete and you’ll never get to pace the  same floorboards as John Quincy Adams or decorate your very own  non-functional hearth, but you’ll also never discover roaches crawling  out of your shower drain (summer in Dunster: a bad idea).  
 
Score: +1,000,000 for sexy rooms, -500 for recent mouse  infestations (but hey, they're cuter than roaches!) 
House Spirit
Every (bi-weekly) Mather Happy  Hour ends with a medley of Mather songs,  yelled at the top of Mather lungs  by hugging, jumping, swaying Mather patriots.  This House has not one, but two mascots, a gorilla and Leighdra,  a lion named after outgoing House Masters Sandra Naddaff and Leigh  Haffrey. Mather-Open overflows with YouTube  recommendations, inside jokes, lively debates, and requests for  everything from decongestant pills to pipe cutters, all of which are  always promptly answered. Mather invented  the Housing Day video when it sent “Mather House:  The Movie” to all freshmen in 2008, and it continues to dominate the  genre. But perhaps the greatest demonstration of Mather spirit  is the Louie Cup, a weekly intra-House competition that pits teams  against one another in pancake eating, coffee pong, and paper clip  trading. The guy in charge wears a cape.  
 
Score: + 1,000,000,000 Mather love  points, -3 occasional e-mail overload on Mather-Open 
 
 
Location
Let’s talk about  priorities for a moment. Mather overlooks  the Charles, Louie’s Superette—purveyor of wine, beer, and junk food—is  just around the corner, and the Mather Express  rolls right up to the gate. It takes savvy speed-walkers 9 minutes  to get to Sever, 13 to the Science Center. So what? It’s not like you  have to walk through the skeevy Cambridge Common, and you can stop by to see all of your friends in lesser Houses on your way to class.
Score: -50 convenience points, +1000 for not  being the quad 
 
 
Quirks
Some  inside info on Mather: Every month or so, a  new modern art installation goes up in Mather’s  main entryway, aka the Three Column Gallery. The House is also home to a  woodturning studio and a pottery studio; it hosts classes in both.  The low-rise suites are connected to one another via a  complicated network of fire doors and shared bathrooms, opening up the  possibility of 8-to-14-man rooming groups and sick games of  Assassins (the winner last year hid in his final victim’s closet for six  hours). Finally, never ask the Mather-Open  for the fax machine, but get excited when someone reports finding it.

Harvard students just can’t get enough of that Old Spice commercial these days. Not only has Dunster spoofed it for their Housing Day vid, the senior gift video brigade also turned it into one of three clips urging seniors to each donate $10 to the annual senior gift fund.
Thankfully, Harvard takes a less manic (and emotionally scarring) approach to their senior gift videos than Yale did. A group of friendly-looking seniors rattle off some of the things we'd lose without the senior gift fund—did you know senior donations help fund financial aid, energy conservation research, free WiFi, study abroad programs, exercise machines with TVs at the MAC, the New College Theatre, and many wonderful features of the Queen’s Head Pub (like 25-cent wings)? Well, now you do.
The Old Spice parody mini-video features former Crimson President Maxwell L. Child ’10 standing in the Crimson Sanctum, telling fellow seniors that they have the power to make their wallets like his by giving a $10 donation. The only thing missing from Child’s monologue is a horse—check out the promo here.
For the more musically inclined, Samir J. Paul ’10 will serenade you with a beat-boxing performance, recorded in front of the Queen’s Head Pub. Look out for the continued wing motif in this one—the first word out of Paul’s mouth is “wing,” and there is a 25-cent wings sign adorning the wall behind him. Talk about product placement!
On the Harvard Senior Gift 2010 Facebook page, one other form of media was enlisted to generate enthusiasm: word clouds. Seniors were encouraged to use Wordle (its Web site calls it “a toy for generating ‘word clouds’ from text that you provide") to create nostalgia-inducing Wordle representations of why they chose to give to the fund.
The final video features On Harvard Time founder and former anchor Derek M. Flanzraich ’10 chilling in a theatre on his laptop, convincingly arguing that if seniors give ten bucks they’ll get free internet. Good deal, right? While he mentions that the two might not be causally related, giving a ten is still the ethical thing to do: if you “don’t give ten bucks you’ll probably still get free internet…but you might feel guilty about it.”  Sound logic, indeed.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about our project.
“Pfuck my life” is what you might mistakenly think upon discovering a Pfolar bear at your door on Thursday morning. Sure, there are closer places to live than Pfoho, but the rabid enthusiasm of Pfohosers, tutors, and House Masters alike is a testament to the fact that Pfoho is among the better Houses. Pfoho is a tightly-knit, pfamily-style community of pfriendly people who like to hang out and have a good time. Incredible rooming and a social layout make Pfoho an awesome place to meet new people while not getting too n-1 close for comfort. Home, sweet Pfohome.
Dining Hall: Although all HUDS food has that I'm-not-quite-sure-what-this-is-but-it’s-probably-chicken taste, Pfoho boasts some of the (comparatively) most delectable food on campus due to simply having fewer mouths to feed. Pfoho's bright linoleum palace is home to the only two-tiered dining hall on campus. The lower level is more social, and tables are often combined for a large group dining experience, while the quieter upper level is perfect for homework, intimate conversation, and avoiding people—a sometimes impossible task in the community-oriented Pfoho. The hilariously awkward Lover's Balcony protrudes over the rest of the dining hall and provides one of the most romantic yet voyeuristic dining experiences on campus.
Pfoho also has arguably the best brain break in the Quad, and hungry Currierites and CaBOTS can be found scavenging late at night when their own d-halls have proved scarcer. The Pfoho d-hall may lack the portraits-of-old-white-guys charm of some of the River Houses, but there's never that awkward moment when you cannot locate a seat.
Score: -100 for boring linoleum and so-so decor, +75 for being able to find a seat without bribes or death threats, +25 for Adams D-hall swipe access 
 
Common Spaces: Pfoho is home to arguably some of the most utilized common spaces of any House on campus, probably because the old Harvard pretension is sacrificed for practical utility and student needs. The Holmes Junior Common Room is not glamourous, yet its central location, pool and ping pong table, proximity to the Grill, and constantly-tuned-into-football TV make it a sure bet for finding another pfolar bear to chill with any night. The Wolbach JCR is also heavily used—its kitchen and DVD player make it a common study break location and couch potato convention center. The Holmes Living Room, Senior Common Room, and Comstock Living Room are less heavily utilized but have more old-Harvard elitist charm.
Most Pfohosers have a love-hate relationship with the Pflibrary—love in the sense that you can show up in your pajamas, slippers, and Snuggie; hate in that it's a library and who ever looks forward to that? Nonetheless, the House Elves and House Masters Nicholas and Erika Christakis make work more bearable by bringing in occasional treats and baked goods for the late-night long haul.
Score: +15 for the average number of bros watching football at the Holmes JCR TV
 
 
Rooms: Un-pfreaking-believable. Almost everyone (except for a small population of unlucky sophomores) is guaranteed a single for all three years. It's possible for sophomores at the bottom of the housing lottery to get something as excessive as a 230 sq. ft. single. Sophomores live in mostly smaller suites of connected (but not walk-through) singles while juniors and seniors can take their pick of a top floor duplex suite in one of the three “bricks” (Holmes, Comstock, or Moors) or a highly prized wood-floored gargantuan suite in Wolbach. Jordan overflow housing—the Quad of the Quad—is actually highly desirable, as accommodations resemble DeWolfe without doubles—complete with cable TV, massive common rooms, and a kitchen. Sociable hallways in most of the House create a better sense of camaraderie with fellow floormates than the sometimes isolating and stair-intensive entryways of other Houses (by the way, we have elevators). Pfoho is also home to the infamous Belltower Suite, which consists of three interconnected quads, making it a 12-person party room complete with a built-in bar and the one of the largest common rooms on campus.
Score: +230 for the size in sq. ft. of this correspondent's sophomore year single
House Spirit: It is impossible to escape Pfoho pride. Brace yourself to have the letters pf attached to everything, an endless source of glee to those who spend 90 percent of their waking hours on Pf-Open—the be all and end all of House open lists that has posts ranging from event advertisements, requests for missing socks, to rabid pflame wars when someone gets “offended."
Pfoho's small size and sociable layout make it feel like a big family. The House staff is unbeatable and extremely popular. New House Masters Nicholas and Erika are very well-liked and known for occasional mischief (such as dressing up in a Pfolar bear suit and attacking a fake Kirklandite to celebrate Pfoho's victory over Kirkland in the House Life Survey). Other notable House figures include “Super” Mario, the beloved building manager and the Harry-Potter-esque House Elves.
Pfoho hosts some of the best d-hall dances on campus, such as the 90s dance and Make it Rain, which some old pfalums even flew in from around the world to attend this year (kind of wish we were kidding about this). The annual Miss Pfoho and Pfamily Pfeud events give House mates a chance to embarrass each other and themselves. It's the people and House spirit that really give Pfoho its oomPf.
Score: +23947738927 for the number of dollar bills at Make it Rain
Location: Great—if you're into cross-country running, waiting for broken down shuttles in the rain, and getting stabbed in Cambridge Common. Yes, your River friends are going to complain every time you beg them to come visit you. Nevertheless, the distance is over-exaggerated (it's a tad closer to the Science Center than Mather House is) by whiny Harvard students. The perception of Pfoho as literally “in the North Pole” and the lack of Harvard buildings on Garden Street make the House seem mentally farther away than its equidistant River counterparts. But despite the Quad's perceived isolation, some appreciate the separation of class and home, nearby Fresh Pond, and large selection of new restaurants and stores on Mass Ave. Plus, legend has it that 90 percent of Pfohosers meet their future spouse on the 9:50 a.m. shuttle. Legend also has it that 90 percent of accidental ass-grabbings occur on the absurdly overcrowded 9:50 a.m. shuttle.
Score: -400 for every tear shed watching the empty Mather Express drive by 8238494372 times at the Memorial Hall shuttle stop, +25 for Shuttleboy, a chivalrous gentleman who ALWAYS texts back
Quirks: Make the other Quad Houses jealous at the Pfoho Grill, an essential stop for that late-night mozzarella stick. Be sure to attend a Pforum, a roughly monthly occasion in which big names from a variety of fields (Daniel Gilbert was one of this year's guests) come to speak to Pfoho after a tastier-than-dining-hall meal. There's a sound studio in the basement for the musically talented, and noise-proof music rooms for the not-so-musically-talented. Plus, there's Pfojo, Pfoho's brand new yoga/dance/martial arts studio. Finally, be sure to check out the sexist remnants of the Radcliffe days, such as three-paneled mirrors in every hallway that everyone subtly uses to check him/herself out, and hooks to prop open the doors a few inches (literal cockblocks).
+1971 for the year that Radcliffe merged with Harvard
Committee Rank: 4 out of 12, you've exceeded expectations.

The writers for the upcoming film on the founding of Facebook may be regretting starting the script too early—juicy scandals and charged accusations surrounding the social networking Web site just keeps surfacing. A week after Facebook experienced privacy issues, Facebook founder and CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg '06 was accused of hacking into student e-mail and social network ConnectU accounts before dropping out of Harvard in 2004.
According to Business Insider, Zuckerberg hacked into the personal e-mail accounts of then-Crimson editors to preview the newspaper’s take on his legal dispute with the founders of a rival social network ConnectU, which eventually ended in a $65 million settlement. In another article, Business Insider charged Zuckerberg with hacking into ConnectU accounts in order to ridicule the ConnectU founders (by creating fake profiles that mocked one of them as "WASP-y") and deactivating some 20 accounts in an attempt to reduce competition.
One of the e-mails Zuckerberg supposedly intercepted was between Elisabeth S. Theodore '05, then The Crimson's managing editor, and Timothy J. McGinn '06, a Crimson reporter investigating the Facebook/ConnectU authorship controversy. Both declined to comment on the hacking incident for this post. ConnectU founders Divya K. Narendra '04 and Cameron S.H. Winklevoss '04 also declined to comment, citing legal reasons, while the other ConnectU founder, Tyler O.H. Winklevoss '04, was not able to be reached as of this posting.
While Facebook has not denied these allegations, the company informed Business Insider that they’re not interested in discussing the issue. Makes sense, seeing that hacking into e-mail accounts is a federal offense. Plus, with privacy issues brewing around Facebook, it doesn’t exactly look great if the CEO is accused of having gone on a hacking spree—whether the accusations are true or not.

As part of our Housing Market series, we've been posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses. Click here to read more about our project.
 
So, you want to be a member of the most elite House on campus? If you thought getting into Harvard was hard, clearly you've never tried to become a member of Kirkland House. Although not entirely abandoning DeWolfe housing, Kirkland will only keep one of its two current floors. This means that it will now accept significantly fewer freshmen into its storied halls.
Dining Hall: Kirkland is lucky to have card swiper (and bouncer) Tommy to guard the entrance to its small-ish dining hall, which has recently become more crowded with refugees from highly-restricted Adams, Lowell, and Leverett (negative points to you, other Houses!). But Kirkland's kitchen is one of the largest and easiest to navigate, with entrees and salad bar set off in different rooms. The House's grill chefs, once known for their superb breakfast omelets (rest in peace, hot breakfast), still serve up great greasy items for the other two meals of the day. Smaller tables allow for more intimate gatherings in the bright, naturally-lit space, though the lack of napkin dispensers on tables—the House Masters think they're unsightly—annoys some messy eaters.
Score: +100 for the kitchen, +100 for "intimacy", -20 for no napkins
 
Common Spaces: Kirkland's Junior Common Room is classic Harvard, with carved wood paneling, red drapery, and a trophy case to display fair Kirkland's gleaming triumphs. It's a comfortable place to relax when there's not an event in progress, though getting someone to stop playing one of the two (yes, TWO) grand pianos can be daunting. Hicks House, the Kirkland-only library, has many study rooms in an atmosphere that's more like your grandma's musty attic than Widener. It's a cozy and popular spot to finish those p-sets. Though it no longer serves food, the Grille is a comfortable venue for stein clubs and TV-watching on the big screen. In warm weather, even the courtyard becomes a common space, with Kirkland's famous hammocks.
Score: +100 for JCR, +200 for Hicks House, +20 for hammocks, -50 for piano cacophony
 
Rooms: With fewer residents spread out along Mill Street in DeWolfe next year, most students will be in Smith Halls (Kirkland's main building) or "The Annex."  In addition to no cable or air conditioning, that means a lot of doubles for sophomores and even juniors. Those who are lucky enough to snare singles may have to deal with walk-throughs or lack of common rooms. n+1 housing will almost certainly be reserved for seniors.  So, all right, there's a small price to pay for being in the best House on campus.
Score: -200 for lack of singles
 
 
 
House Spirit: Holiday Dinner, IncestFest, Secret Santa, Minutemen in the courtyard—the list of Kirkland's spirited gatherings goes on and on. From the Kirkland ode to a top-secret "debaucherous" dance to the House Masters' dogs, everything about Kirkland brings out the House's great spirit.
Score: +1000 for all around awesomeness
 
Location: Kirkland's location is about as good as can be hoped for. It's just three blocks from the Yard, but more importantly, it's also right next to Pinocchio’s Pizza and The Garage for those inevitable late-night cravings. When you wake up and feel you need to work off those calories, the Malkin Athletics Center is just across the street. Even the view out the House's windows is all trees (and Kennedy School), though pompous Eliot-ites might point out that there's no river view.
Score: +100 for Noch's, -10 for John F. Kennedy Street traffic noises
 
 
 
Quirks: Some traditions never die. Every Sunday night, Kirklanders still gather for milk and warm cookies at Boat Club, the most delicious—we think—House tradition at Harvard. It may also boast the only combination ping-pong-pool-gym room at Harvard in the basement of F-entryway.
Finally, in addition to all its accolades, Kirkland does have the dubious distinction of being the only House on campus in which someone has been shot (at least within the past year). Not to worry, statistically that makes the chances of it happening again even slimmer.
Score: +100 for Boat Club, -1000 for shooting 
Committee Rank: 3 out of 12. At least you would get a medal (bronze).
