After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every first-year student at Harvard swipes their ID at Annenberg dining hall and walks past a portrait of Charles Sumner. After graduating from Harvard College, Sumner spent 22 years as a public servant representing Massachusetts in the Senate. Throughout his time in Congress, he was famous for his fierce support for the abolition of slavery and unpopular belief in equality for all people. For his accomplishments, Sumner deserves to have a Harvard House in his name.
On May 5th, 2022, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay sent out an email detailing a new institutional process for FAS affiliates to petition for the denaming of Harvard structures. Per that email, the administration will consider denaming spaces “based on the perception that a namesake's actions or beliefs were ‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values.”
The new denaming process has one glaring omission, however: Students seemingly cannot argue for whom these structures should be renamed — they can scrub names, but offer no alternatives. Renaming is a significant part of restoring the harm of the name that came before. It offers an opportunity to permanently reconstitute whomever we choose. The goal is not just ripping down plaques of those that have lagged behind the moral character of Harvard; the ultimate goal is to celebrate the people that represent the best of the University.
Case in point: the unwavering stances in the pursuit of justice that defined Senator Charles Sumner’s career in the halls of Congress. In cooperation with members of the Women’s National Loyal League, he helped organize a petition with over half a million signatures for the abolition of slavery, which he used to push for the expansion of the Emancipation Proclamation. Furthermore, his proposal for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery was too radical for some of his colleagues, as it attempted to recognize emancipated Black Americans equally under the law. He also famously initially opposed the 14th Amendment, because the bill did not sufficiently protect the right of Black Americans to vote. In these and other ways, Sumner was the John Brown of the legislature, uncompromising in his belief in the universal rights of men.
Charles Sumner’s ideological framework was far from epiphany. Charles Pinckney Sumner, Senator Sumner’s father, played an influential role in shaping his son’s politics. Also a graduate of Harvard College, he instilled his own abolitionist views in his son, teaching that abolition would mean nothing unless white Americans were willing to “learn to have a good feeling toward [Black Americans], and treat them as well.”
Moreover, Sumner’s grandfather, Job Sumner, fought for freedom during the colonial period. Job was admitted to Harvard at age 20, entering in November of 1774. When the American Revolution erupted, Sumner joined up with the patriot army, putting to use the skills he had learned with a Harvard military company that would later become known as the “Harvard Washington Corps.” Major Sumner was later recognized by the President and Fellows of Harvard University for his service in the armed forces, who honored him with a Master of Arts degree. When the eldest Sumner died, then-Vice President John Adams, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and other revolutionary officers attended Job Sumner’s funeral.
Sumner House has no shortage of names to replace. As of now, two of Harvard College’s  Houses, Winthrop House and Mather House, are named after slaveholders. Eliot House and Lowell House, meanwhile, have eugenicists as namesakes. Presuming that chattel slavery, the genocide of native peoples, and belief in eugenics have become “‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values,” these Houses surely qualify to be denamed.
It would be especially fitting that a family with a lineage of abolitionists replaces a family with a lineage of enslavers: the Winthrops. Governor John Winthrop helped justify the Pequot War by claiming the superiority of advanced peoples to assert their “civil right” to the land. He owned the wife and two unnamed sons of Pequot sachem Mononotto and at least four other unidentified Indigenous people. The younger John Winthrop, a President of Harvard, owned two enslaved people named George and Scipio. To replace Winthrop House with Sumner House would be a symbolic gesture, but a significant one — a sign of a more serious commitment by Harvard to reckon with its ugliest history while embracing its best.
There are few families tied to the legacy of Harvard that come close to the honor and fortitude of the Sumner Family. Those who we choose to memorialize define what we as the Harvard community want to embody in the future. As we work to become a more just community, we must reckon with our history. That process can begin at Sumner House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Queen Elizabeth II was undoubtedly a graceful leader, a reassuring diplomat, and an idolized celebrity. And while she wasn’t America’s leader, she was certainly our celebrity. Since her death, glowing obituaries and commentaries — and even several analyses on the future of her pet corgis — have dominated our news media.
At Harvard, talk of her greatness and criticism of the monarchy’s imperial legacy dominate our campus. We make too much of a fuss, both about the good and the contentious. The Queen deserves our respect but not our effervescent and wide-eyed worship. We should admire actions, not ancestry, and the Queen was a stoic witness, not a doer.
Many have rebuked the Queen for the atrocities and inequities committed in her name. Royalists say it is silly to fault a constitutional monarch for the actions of her government — for the government holds the real power. She could not comment on the British crimes during the Mau Mau rebellion, for example, because doing so would violate some sense of impartiality. Her neutrality, her boringness, is what made her great, they say.
Indeed, we should not fault the Queen for the good or the bad during her tenure — for politicians, not the Queen, were truly in charge. But then why do we celebrate someone so bound by neutrality, who is little more than a figurehead? Yes, a neutral monarch can serve as a necessary glue in a polarized society, and I believe the Queen was a dedicated public servant who glowed with humility and love for country in her boringness. But let’s not pretend her service was wholly selfless. Because of her preservation of the monarchy, her heir, King Charles III, is exempt from up to £9.5 billion in inheritance tax.
Perhaps America grew fond of her because she lived for a long time. Indeed, she ruled for a long time. But longevity is not an action and therefore should not be grounds for praise in and of itself.
And why did she rule? She didn’t rule because she was the best person for the job (though she very well might have been), or because the people chose her (though the people might well have). She ruled because her father was king, like his father before him, and his father before him.
I, like a young Liz Truss did, find the idea that one can be born to rule iniquitous. I imagine hardly any on this campus — or in this country — would disagree. In fact, nothing seems less meritocratic, less American. So, let’s be careful with our praise. We should not laud hereditary and decades-long supremacy just because it enthralls us. We should question how non-egalitarian such a system is, and not exclude the Queen from our skepticism.
But if nothing else, she had grit, the obituaries and classmates remind me. She did work until the age of 96. Despite my cynicism, I do believe the Queen was a great woman who did much for her country. But cutting ribbons in your late 90s is hardiness not grit. Grit is conviction and resilience. Rosa Parks had grit. Charles de Gaulle had grit. Rosa Parks and Charles de Gaulle changed their countries; the Queen witnessed hers change. Hardiness is respectable but not admirable.
Maybe the monarchy works in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms. I’m neither a royalist nor a republican: As an American, I have no stake. But I see no reason for us on this campus or in this country to praise the monarchy or its symbols, despite their longevity, neutrality, or hardiness.
I am sure this is a tough time for the Queen’s family and many Britons, and sending our condolences across the pond does little harm. But let’s avoid fixation. As Nigel Farage remarked: “The Queen is dead… Sad day, but we now have a king.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is rather befuddling that parents send their children to college with the full knowledge that their sons and daughters will return home and reject every value on which they were raised.
My suggestion that rebelliousness is a universal phenomenon amongst Harvard students is, of course, somewhat hyperbolic; however, there is no guarantee that students will maintain their parents’ values after four years in Cambridge. After all, college is an opportunity both to contemplate who you want to be and to realize that ideal self in a context far away from your childhood cocoon.
Over the past couple years I began practicing Orthodox Judaism. I frequently inspire inquisitiveness from those who grew up as observant Jews. It is not unprecedented to become a religious Jew after growing up rather secular; many of my Harvard friends share a similar background. Yet being a Baal Teshuva — which literally translates to a “master of return” — is still uncommon. So when people find out I didn’t grow up religious because I have some unusual question about what page we are on in the prayer service or whether I can do a certain thing on Shabbat, the sacred day of the Jewish week, they invariably ask me, with an air of great respect, why I became religious. They act as if I had accomplished some monumental tasks, but it doesn’t feel that way to me.
I became who I wanted to be. I am like any other student. I had the opportunity to consider what the Truth is, how I wanted to live, and had a full understanding of the world I was leaving. Students who remain religious persist in their faith while having no such privilege. I greatly admire them for their resistance to temptations which still possess the lure of curiosity, a task far more challenging than throwing away a shiny apple that carried a rancid taste.
For example, Jewish students who are raised observing Shabbat come to Harvard and see their friends partying on a Friday night. Without abandoning their faith, they can’t feel for themselves the relative vanity of that experience. A person who goes to parties, realizes their ultimate vapidity, and then chooses to guard the Sabbath has no uncertainty about “what else is out there.”
In my view, religion means obligation — it is something which intentionally restricts one from what he or she would naturally be inclined toward because that thing is disfavored by another party. At its core, religion is the supplanting of one’s own, inherent will, with a different will, a divine will. In an age of self-expression and liberation, that seems rather unappealing.
In an environment such as Harvard, one’s options are limitless — not just in these four years but beyond. For one to forego the opportunity to dabble just a little bit in things they know to be forbidden requires enormous self-control. I chose to have these restrictions on me; in a way, they feel self-imposed. But to have something given to you from your birth, with a sincere promise that this is what you should be doing, offers no such freedom.
Humans have an immensely strong natural curiosity. Our greatest instinct must be asking “Why?”. It is this reaction that has motivated the wisest philosophers we have known and the most daring explorers. The human desire to answer it is not purely cognitive; it is also experiential. So when you have taken something to be true, but have not tried anything else, you seem to lack some way of knowing this truth. To deny oneself a form of knowledge, even one that threatens corruption, is difficult. If you accept what you were taught, or only live your life in one way, you must rely on faith.
Faith has become something of a diss at Harvard. Some may remark that it is for those who are ignorant and unenlightened. I would rather say it is for those who are brave and noble. Take the distinction between believing in the divine and trusting in the divine: Believing in the divine is an intellectual claim or an innate feeling that does not require sacrifice. Trusting in the divine means according your life with His Will — when we are told that we will be heard if we pray, for example, it means actually going to pray.
Faith is the bravery involved in taking a walk in the dark or climbing a mountain covered in clouds. We are going somewhere, and we can see what is right before us, but not what is all around us.
I hold deep admiration for those who live with such faith. By choosing religion, by making the decision to go my own way, I am in some way arrogant. I am taking for myself control where those who walked the line must forfeit that to others.
Those who remain religious don’t do so because it’s the easy thing to do, or because they are familiar with it and leaving is scary. They do so because they are brave.

Harvard will begin offering Moderna’s new Omicron Covid-19 booster shot to affiliates later this month, the University announced Tuesday.
The booster shot will be required for all on-campus affiliates for the spring semester. The shot provides protection against the original strain of Covid-19 and the Omicron variant.
Harvard University Health Services will offer the boosters in conjunction with free flu vaccines this fall.
The announcement comes just days before the University will wind down its PCR testing program on Sept. 16, which allows on-campus affiliates to submit tests to a lab. Harvard College students will still be able to receive antigen Covid-19 tests from building managers in their houses.
Harvard has dropped nearly all Covid-19 restrictions on its campus, including mandatory testing and masking, which were in place last year. In an email announcing the change on Tuesday, HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen said the school strongly encourages voluntary masking in order “to reduce the risk of transmission.”
“Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable for their personal masking decision in a mask-optional setting,” he wrote. “Be mindful that there are members of our community who must mask.”
Nguyen also provided updates on the school’s efforts to prevent the spread of monkeypox on campus. Just over 350 cases of monkeypox have been reported in Massachusetts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nguyen wrote Tuesday that affiliates who need a vaccine referral or an evaluation for suspected monkeypox infection or exposure can contact HUHS for further instruction.
Students who test positive for either Covid-19 or monkeypox are required to report it to HUHS and isolate in place.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana declined to comment on the early exit of Leverett House’s former faculty deans but affirmed the importance of Harvard’s house system in a Monday interview.
A staple of Harvard’s undergraduate experience is its residential system, which places each undergraduate into one of 12 upperclassman houses led by a pair of faculty deans. Khurana said the College does not comment on personnel matters when asked about the circumstances surrounding the departure of Leverett ex-faculty deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras, who stepped down suddenly in June.
The Crimson reported earlier this month that some affiliates allege Farrell and Ferreras’ leadership was marred by a pattern of mismanagement. Neither a College spokesperson nor Farrell and Ferreras provided a reason for their departure. In 2019, Khurana did not renew Winthrop House’s deans for another term following a Crimson investigation that found they fostered a toxic culture.
When asked how the College plans to prevent instances of mismanagement and hold its faculty deans accountable, Khurana highlighted the importance of the house system.
“The College continues to work with faculty deans, resident deans, and house staff to ensure that the students are having a wonderful experience,” Khurana said.
Another stress test for Harvard’s house system is the uptick in students living in overflow housing. With the exception of Leverett, upperclassmen in 11 of the 12 houses reside in overflow housing due to the unprecedented size of the Class of 2025 and ongoing house renewal projects.
Khurana said the College made a “values-based” decision in choosing to admit the same number of students despite a high number of deferrals from the Class of 2024 during the Covid pandemic.
“We tried to be very clear what the consequences of this would be, which would be a swell of students coming through the residential system,” Khurana said. “Our residential system was already under strain because of house renewal, but we still felt that it was important to bring students to campus.”
Still, some students in overflow housing have raised concerns about feeling disconnected from house life and having to travel longer distances to dining halls.
“We hope that continual focus on house renewal and other ways of strengthening and expanding the house system will help alleviate some of the strain in the coming years,” Khurana said. “But it is an ongoing challenge.”
Khurana said the focus for College administrators should be on encouraging students to stay connected to their houses through activities like study breaks and intramural sports.
“It’s anchored in our philosophy that the house system is really critical,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Council on Education submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Education Monday, calling for changes to the Title IX amendments proposed by the Biden administration in June.
Nearly 50 higher education associations signed on to the Monday letter, which asked the ED to clarify institutional reporting requirements and Title IX coordinator responsibilities. Ahead of the letter’s submission, Harvard sent its own recommendations to the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, a signatory on the letter.
The Biden administration’s draft Title IX amendments in June sought to clarify and enhance protections for survivors of sex-based discrimination and harassment in federally-funded educational insitutions.
The Monday letter raised concerns about the “expansive and convoluted set” of reporting obligations outlined in the June proposal for all school employees. The ED amendments would set different procedures for reporting Title IX violations depending on employees’ job duties.
“This will undoubtedly lead to confusion for employees about what their reporting responsibilities are, and for students who may wish to confide in a certain employee but be unclear what that employee’s reporting obligations are,” the letter states.
The letter recommends the ED simplify its proposed rules on reporting procedures to help students determine “whether confiding in a particular employee about their experience will trigger notification to their institution.”
“Colleges and universities strongly support efforts to encourage students and employees to report all sex-based discrimination to the institution,” the letter reads. “At the same time, the reporting expectations and system must align with individual campus structures and be simple enough to be clearly understood by all community members.”
The ED’s amendments also proposed the expansion of Title IX coordinator responsibilities to include obligations such as monitoring for obstacles to reporting misconduct and taking action to stop sex-based discrimination.
“By requiring the Title IX Coordinator to be responsible for — versus coordinating — certain compliance functions, the proposed rule would conflict with administrative structures on many campuses,” the ACE press release states.
Calling the role of Title IX coordinator “one of the most challenging jobs on a campus,” the letter recommended the removal of the new coordinator responsibilities.
The June proposal also sets new requirements for institutional grievance procedures of sex-based harassment complaints against employees. Monday’s letter claimed these procedures would likely conflict with existing state laws and employment at-will policies.
The signatories urged the ED to exempt employee-respondents from the proposed grievance procedures to ensure consistency with established policies.
“It is critical that the final regulations are sufficiently flexible to be effectively implemented across diverse institutions, reflect a sensible level of simplicity, and provide clarity about federal expectations for institutions and their community members,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine students and alumni who reported sexual and professional misconduct by Harvard faculty members demanded the University reform its Title IX and Office of Dispute Resolution procedures in a letter Tuesday.
Addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, the letter calls on Harvard to include victims’ input in improving its procedures for reporting and investigating misconduct. The signatories previously filed complaints against John L. Comaroff, Jorge I. Domínguez, and Gary Urton — all of whom the University found in violation of faculty conduct policies.
“After all, who better to contribute to reform than the women who had suffered most from its failure to protect them?” they wrote.
Tuesday’s letter follows a September 2020 letter sent by some of the same signatories to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay requesting representation on a committee formed to review the FAS’ interim sexual harassment policy.
“As we have now repeated for years, we stand ready and willing to help – in revising the Title IX and ODR process or even in the search for a new ODR Director,” the Tuesday letter reads.
The ODR currently operates under interim director Nicole Newman following William D. McCants’ departure earlier this year.
Of the nine students and alumni that signed the letter, three current Anthropology graduate students — Lilia M. Kilburn, Amulya Mandava, and Margaret G. Czerwienski — filed a federal lawsuit in February alleging Harvard ignored years of sexual harassment and retaliation by Comaroff, an African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor. They filed an amended suit in June, which included additional allegations of sexual misconduct by Comaroff before he joined Harvard.
Last week, the United States Department of Justice filed an amicus brief backing the plaintiffs after Harvard argued it should not be held liable for its employees’ retaliatory actions.
“Even in [Harvard’s] response to our lawsuit we’re also seeing indifference or an argument that they’re not obligated to act in any way,” Czerwienski said. “This University has a problem with systemic abuse, and the culture is set from the top down.”
Letter signatories also included three alumni — Charna E. Sherman ’80, Suzanna E. Challen, and an anonymous graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School — who reported sexual harassment by Domínguez as early as 1978. Three alumni — Carrie J. Brezine, Jade D’Alpoim Guedes, and Nenita Ponce de Léon Elphick — who reported sexual harassment by Urton in 2008 and 2020 also signed.
In a response to the letter Tuesday evening, Harvard Deputy Provost Peggy Newell encouraged the signatories to submit their comments to the University working group reviewing proposed changes to Harvard’s sexual harassment and misconduct policies.
“Although I disagree with a number of the characterizations in your letter, I have valued the input that you’ve provided over the course of those discussions,” she wrote. “I regret that despite this engagement, you feel that you have not ‘been really listened to.’”
Newell pointed to the University’s investigations and sanctions of the accused senior faculty members, writing that administrators “share a concern” for the “well-being of the Harvard community and the ongoing improvement of our policies and procedures.”
A May 2020 investigation by The Crimson found that three Anthropology professors — including Comaroff and Urton — faced allegations of sexual harassment. Just days later, Brezine and D’Alpoim Guedes came forward regarding years of sexual coercion and emotional abuse by Urton.
Within a week, Gay placed Urton on administrative leave before he retired in August 2020. A year later, Gay stripped his emeritus status after a University investigation found he violated sexual misconduct policies.
In 2018, Domínguez retired after 18 women accused him of repeated sexual harassment over nearly 40 years. One year later, Gay revoked his emeritus status.
Comaroff declined to comment on the Tuesday letter. Domínguez and Urton did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Correction: September 15, 2022
A previous version of this article misstated the nature of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvard professor John L. Comaroff included in an amended lawsuit filed in June 2022. The amended suit included new allegations of misconduct against Comaroff, but they were not based on court testimony.

Harvard wants its engineering students to turn research into reality.
The University launched an initiative last week that aims to help affiliates translate research into startups by providing funding, work spaces, and mentorship opportunities.
The initiative, called “The Grid,” is a collaboration between the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Office of Technology Development.
The project expands previous funding sources that were available to science and engineering researchers through OTD’s Physical Science and Engineering Accelerator, which has supported at least 16 startups since 2013. The Accelerator program will now be housed under The Grid, which is located in Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex.
The new program, which will be able to award “more and larger grants,” will offer networking and advising opportunities to early-stage entrepreneurs who are selected, according to a press release announcing its creation.
“What we’re hoping to do is partner with faculty and graduate students and undergrads anywhere along the spectrum to accelerate the flywheel of University research translation,” said Paul N. Hayre, executive director of The Grid.
Sam T. Liss, executive director of strategic partnership at Harvard’s Office of Technology Development, said the initiative seeks to fill “a gap” in support for early-stage startups.
Liss said the program could be “a feeder” to other existing startup initiatives, including the Harvard Innovation Lab.
“We’re building connections to the various complementary programs in our ecosystem,” he said.
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle said in the press release announcing the program that it will seek to diversify the population of startup founders by providing greater resources and mentorship opportunities to women and members of other underrepresented groups.
Hayre, The Grid executive director, said the program will reach diverse groups of entrepreneurs by collaborating with student organizations throughout Harvard.
Marko Lončar, a SEAS professor who founded a company with Harvard support prior to The Grid in 2018, said the new program will benefit young entrepreneurs.
“Some students benefit from just a little bit of guidance, and I think a lot of us would learn in the process,” he said.
He said he hopes to see The Grid offer workshops on entrepreneurship and create opportunities for students to meet venture capitalists in order to help with “market discovery.”
“I think it would be nice to have a physical space where people interested in entrepreneurship can go,” he said.
Yaro Tenzer, CEO of Righthand Robotics, a startup that got initial funding from the Harvard OTD accelerator that preceded The Grid, called the new program “fantastic.”
“When you’re starting a company, there are so many ways the company can fail,” he said.
Having “a centralized place that knows how to take entrepreneurs from ideation to prototyping” to receiving funding “really reduces the risk for entrepreneurs,” he added.

If you haven’t been to Annenberg lately, you may not realize that the ceiling is currently covered due to construction. But the covers lead us to wonder: what exactly is going on under there? Realistically, Harvard isn't going to change anything on the ceiling for the sake of tradition, but what if they did? Here, Flyby imagines (using crude expert Photoshop skills) some possibilities of what could be added to the ceiling of Annenberg.
LED Lights


The hottest trend in dorm decor is LED lights, so why not add them to Annenberg? If Harvard adds a disco ball as well, we would have a sweet new party space and the first years wouldn’t have to endure the 9th circle of hell that is Tasty Basty™.
Functioning Shuttle Tracker


As if things could not get worse, Passio Go recently had an update that has rendered the app more dysfunctional than it was before. Now would be the best time to add a working shuttle tracker to the ceiling that would help CS students catch their shuttle to the SEC. It is not my job to design one so here’s a screenshot of the old Passio Go. R.I.P. :(
Live Remy Tracker


If there’s one thing almost every Harvard student can agree on, it is that Remy is a wonderful presence on campus. If there was a tracker to let us know his location 24/7, we could destress by petting him anytime. Live, Love, Remy <3.
First Year Premed Drop Counter


LS1A and LS1B are not for the faint of heart and it is no surprise that many students decide to stop being pre-meds during their first year. By adding a live counter, people will know they are not alone. We could also add a Hunger-Games-style cannon sound while we’re at it.
Sistine Chapel Style Painting of Bacow Passing on the Presidency


This is the most cursed thing I have ever created. But if I had to see it, so do you.
