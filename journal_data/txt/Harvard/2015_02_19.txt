After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the surprise release of “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” will inevitably bring comparisons to Beyoncé’s 2013 self-titled album, Drake’s latest effort might more aptly be juxtaposed with Young Money labelmate Nicki Minaj’s “The Pinkprint.” Both artists have struggled to be taken seriously at times, Minaj as a woman and Drake as a man. And where “The Pinkprint” was Minaj’s way of legitimizing her frustration, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” is Drake internalizing his and trying to balance his widespread fame with his longing for a sense of identity.
A mixtape disguised and packaged as a full-length album, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” touches on many of the same themes as previous entries in Drake’s discography. Drake himself, however, seems more veteran than ever as he effortlessly shifts between quiet self-reflection and “Headlines”-esque bravado. But as Drake will be the first to attest, that’s where the similarities between “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” and the “Take Care” era end. “Please don’t speak to me like I’m that Drake from four years ago / I’m at a higher place,” he says on “No Tellin’.” The versatile rapper appears unsurprisingly comfortable on an album lacking in features and radio-ready singles; the minimal and shifting nature of “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” gives Drake the freedom to rap ferociously throughout “Energy” and dedicate “Jungle” to gentle, wandering vocal lines.
Despite the album’s scribbled cover, its diverse tracklist shows evidence of Drake’s trademark dedication to his work. The expansive “Star67” is divided into two completely different halves, connected by a familiar disconnection message from a telephone operator. Though the sudden interjection seems forced, the two halves of “Star67” function organically as two parts to a touching story. Even the seemingly simplistic opener, “Legend,” is backed by a stunningly beautiful sample of Ginuwine’s “So Anxious,” and “6 Man,” the shortest track on the album, ends with a thoughtful nod to Erykah Badu’s hook on “You Got Me” by the Roots.
The production on “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” is largely handled by the in-house producers of Drake’s own OVO Sound, giving a sense of welcome familiarity between the vocals and the production. Boi-1da’s dark and brooding contributions provide a familiar backdrop to Drake’s schizophrenic verses, and Noah “40” Shebib’s “Madonna” pits a slowly burning beat against an entrancing, murmured hook. PARTYNEXTDOOR, another OVO labelmate, stars on “Preach” and “Wednesday Night Interlude,” where he layers distorted vocals over eclectic samples from rapper Haven’s “Feelings” and a chopped-up version of up-and-coming EDM force Ekali’s “Unfaith.” The latter track is PARTYNEXTDOOR’s most gripping contribution to the album, a free-form R&B ballad that introduces the more introspective and personal second half to the album.
Even with the meticulous composition and production, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” is ultimately a mixtape at its core, and its 17 disparate tracks feel effortlessly honest, almost stream-of-consciousness. It’s a strangely nostalgic album, as evidenced by countless references to Toronto as “the Six.” The most touching of these is “You & The 6,” a heartfelt tribute to Drake’s parents that manages to be comprehensive and cutting without losing its genuinity. But there’s also a different nostalgia on the album for a simpler life without the cost of fame. “I need a girl from the country, I need a girl from Kentucky,” Drake raps on “Company.” Later on the track, he turns singularly direct, confiding, “I need you to take my mind off being in my prime.”
The struggle to be taken seriously can easily weigh an artist’s discography down, but, fortunately, Drake shows on his latest release that he knows when to let his music speak for itself. The album’s closer, “Jungle,” is a refreshingly no-twists slow-burner that brings the tape to an ethereal, intimate end. The release of “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,” which potentially completes Drake’s four-album deal with Cash Money Records, ushers in a Drake who is no longer questioned for his authenticity but recognized for his talent. If anything, Drake’s insistence that his latest release is a mixtape suggests that the album is both an effective capstone to his rise and an introduction to a new sound on an LP that is yet to come.

Purity Ring is difficult to put in a box—Tiny Mix Tapes’ Ben Sullivan described its unique style as “witch house”—but perhaps the moniker  “dream pop” better describes the group’s hazy blend of synths and sharp vocals. It’s clear that the duo, who came together in 2010 with the release of experimental track “Ungirthed,” has been working on a unified sound since. The songs of “Another Eternity” show the depth of their musical partnership; from Megan James’s clear, though slightly-autotuned, voice to Corin Roddick’s artfully arranged layers of melody and bass, their sounds make up a complex aural landscape that invites listeners to let the music soak into their bones.
“Another Eternity,” as per Purity Ring’s trance reputation, relies on rampant use of repetition for its emotional punch. In “Flood on The Floor,” James sings “Don’t forget / forget / Don’t forget / forget” in circles, building a quiet tension that Roddick reinforces with the thrumming synths in the music’s roots. “Dust Hymn,” titled cleverly to reflect religious undertones, utilizes a similar method as James sings, “Dear lie still along my old web / Cursed by your dust filled head”—and repeats the sequence at least six times. While most of the repetition contributes to the eerily autotuned atmosphere, in some cases it becomes underwhelmingly trite and begs the question: What else is there?
“Another Eternity” boasts lyrics that, when supplemented by idiosyncratic rhymes and music, create powerful and haunting imagery. Love—platonic and romantic—is a major theme in this album, and it is handled in a delicate and detail-laden way. “Heartsigh,” the opening track, examines the possessive love of an infatuated romantic: “I’ll build a house around you / Stir a moat until you drown, down.” With any voice other than James’s pixie-like soprano, “Heartsigh” would be obnoxiously gruesome; the lightness of James’s vocals, however, makes for a quieter and more subdued but all the more terrifying mood. “Begin Again,” a slow-building dance track, features a series of paired lines of grandiose language that bring to mind epic love poems of eons ago: “I need not one thing more / Oh, wrap the ground around / Your gentle winding mind / Oh, guard the pounding sound / Breathe in your fiery air.” Once again, James uses her controlled and resonant voice to bring life to the lyrics; she convincingly makes them sound like ancient poetry.
While Purity Ring seldom offers explicit cultural allusions on the album, much of “Another Eternity” excitingly evokes tropes from across the pop music spectrum.  Though “Bodyache” still features James’ high-pitched voice and a set of impressive harp-like arpeggios in the music, the chorus of “I, I, I lied, now I’m lying awake / I, I, I cried ‘til my body ache” is reminiscent of the type of hip hop ballad Beyoncé or Rihanna might sing. “Repetition” brings to mind the sultry sensuality of Lana Del Rey in its “Hey / Hey / Hey” hook and its verses, where James hits with the sexually provocative, “I’mma dig you up and give you what I took / Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look.” Likewise, “Stranger Than Earth” calls forth Frank Ocean’s “Thinking About You” in its pulsating chorus: “Again, again, again / I wasn’t thinkin ‘bout you / I wasn’t / I wasn’t.” In “Sea Castle,” though, James seems to find her own grungy spine when she screams, “Look at me, I’m a sea, I’m your sea! I’ll shut out what’s destructed around you!” Clearly, James is musically literate, but she is also unafraid to do her own thing.
Although its repetitive use of lyric and synth can be at times overwhelming, “Another Eternity” provides a compelling and unique aural aesthetic. The closing track, “Stillness Woe,” is exhilaratingly out of left field, with a  calming slow-tempo wash of upper-register piano that pushes back against the freneticism of first track “Heartsigh.” “Stillness Woe” is oddly reassuring in its abstract poetry: “Push my mind around as if it’s warming up your hand / As if it’s softer than the land, all silked and supple / Don’t be afraid if it’s a little bit close.” James and Roddick, for all of their dependence on hypnotic cycles,  imbue the song, and much of “Another Eternity,” with a deft human touch that elevates the project above less emotive electronic works.

Big Sean is at his most prolific. Over the last four months, the rapper has delivered the banger “I.D.F.W.U” among upwards of 10 free-styles and features. He has not just released an impressive quantity, but has also showcased a bottomless bag of lyrical tricks. In the first verse of his newest single from his upcoming album “Dark Sky Paradise,” “One Man Can Change the World,” Sean drops: “My step-brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day / No Kim K but he bagged ‘Ye.” The mixture of heavy subject matter with snark and impressive wordplay has become Sean’s M.O.—where 2012 Big Sean could do one of these things successfully, he now juggles all three—alongside solid guests Kanye West and John Legend—and sounds even better doing it.
In September’s “Fourth Quarter,” Sean rapped about Ferguson and bragged about his fear of implication in that month’s infamous nude celebrity photo scandal in the space of 40 seconds. His subject matter here is just as diverse. His second volley, an ode to his grandmother that somehow manages to sincerely invoke “The Mask”-era Jim Carrey, ranks among his most intricate. John Legend complements Sean’s lyrical acrobatics with a sappy but effective piano line that sounds out of “RENT. Following the trend set by West’s tracks “Only One” and “FourFiveSeconds,” the song survives largely without a prototypical hip-hop beat. The move toward a beatless backing and a more soul or folk-rock accompaniment is an innovative trend that works extremely well here. Even without an emphatic 808, Sean grabs the beat and never sounds out of sync. West croons along on the melodic sections with his trademark auto-tune and feels like a welcome and unobtrusive guest.
The chorus is the critical sticking point. It’s a pretty melodic line on which Legend and an auto-tuned West  switch off, but the lyrics are laughably egocentric.  “When you get it on/ Remember one thing: / One man can change the world” may not be a direct reference to Sean himself, but it comes off as one. Such a braggadocio sentiment, particularly in a song that is otherwise a sensitive meditation on humble roots, is jarring. While Sean and his compatriots are stating a relative truth—they have changed at least the rap world—the lyrics still belong more on GOOD Music’s boasty “Cruel Summer” than in a soul-baring ballad.
The pompous chorus notwithstanding, the song shows Big Sean on the precipice of what looks to be his most lyrically rich and aurally diverse release yet. Sean would do best to avoid topical mismatching, but, even if he doesn’t, “Dark Sky Paradise” seems poised to fly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early January of this year, the United States Olympic Committee selected Boston 2024, a private group of Olympic boosters, as its candidate to represent the United States as the host city for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Harvard is prominent in this effort: Katie Lapp, the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Harvard, is on Boston 2024’s Executive Committee. Harvard Stadium would be used for some events, as would other Harvard properties in Allston.
As Harvard alumni, we urge the school to reconsider its apparent full-throated endorsement of Boston 2024’s bid. There is much that is wrong about the bid. First, it was developed behind closed doors and it was only when Boston 2024 faced strong public pressure that it released the bid—more than a month after it submitted its bid to the USOC. The release of some of the bidding documents has exposed a budget far above the $4.7 billion operating budget that organizers have claimed—exposing taxpayers to substantial risk.
Additional costs not included in the operating budget include building the Athletes’ Village for $2.5 billion, acquiring and preparing land for the temporary 60,000 seat Olympic Stadium for $200 million, constructing the Broadcast Center and Main Press Center for $500 million, and building several other venues (like the velodrome and handball arena). It all adds to $8.1 billion in expected costs. The total recommended annual budget for the City of Boston is only $2.7 billion—so the Boston 2024 budget for one month of the Olympics is three times that of the City of Boston for an entire year.
And this does not include the cost of security or transportation expenses during the Games, which Boston 2024 assumes the Federal government will cover. The cost is estimated by independent experts at more than $2 billion—a lot of money, but then, putting anti-aircraft emplacements on the roofs of Boston buildings is not cheap. Boston 2024 estimates another few billion in state infrastructure spending “would happen regardless of the Games,” according to Boston Globe columnist Shirley Leung.
Finally, economists have found that every Olympics since 1960 has cost more than its initial proposed budget. Professor Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College has stated that “the Summer Games have an average cost overrun of 252 percent in real terms since 1976—that would put Boston’s final cost at $28.5 billion, not counting the separate infrastructure budget.”
While Harvard has been a cheerleader for the Olympic effort, it has not publicly committed any revenue to close this multi-billion dollar gap. If it does offer to contribute financially, it should have to justify these outlays versus other needed University programs, including financial aid and support of core academic programs.  If it does not contribute financially, it will still be encouraging a reckless public policy that will divert scarce public resources away from core priorities such as education, healthcare, and basic infrastructure—all for a three-week festival.
While we encourage and commend Harvard’s substantial involvement in civic and community endeavors, we feel in this case that the Olympic bid is the wrong one to support. Harvard should not have joined and should not continue to support the massive selling effort that is now taking place for this civic misadventure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost three years ago, Slate.com published an article that correlated a city’s level of walkability to its political liberalism. The idea was basically this: The more people walked, the more their perspectives came to include the homeless on the street, the indispensability of public transportation, and other public services.
These residents would then go on to vote for local candidates who supported allocation of funding towards better public transportation, and better institutions for the poor and the homeless. Further, the city is the breeding ground for our friends that proudly sport the socially-liberal-and-fiscally-conservative banner; if you’re a heterosexual student with gay friends, it’s hard to say that they don’t deserve the same human rights as you.
Perhaps we can we say that this is the chic, urban remix of Southern hospitality by walkable cities?
There’s no doubt that there are a ton of other factors that go into the mix for painting one’s political color, but the point is to make an analogy. When it comes to matters of social justice, there are a lot of people at Harvard that haven’t walked the walk. More specifically, when it comes to matters of gender, race, sexuality, and socioeconomics, those who’ve never walked the walk of vulnerability are considered to embody a sort of blind privilege. There’s no doubt that this part about “blind privilege” is true—you don’t know what you’ve never seen or felt, and that’s just part of the human condition.
But I worry that there is an increasingly starker dichotomy of those who “get it” and those who don’t on our campus, a dichotomy that’s ironically made Harvard’s social justice community one of the more intentionally exclusive groups on our campus, and has also served to vilify people who do what they do and say what they say, simply because they “just don’t get it.”
And this worries me, because the thought that the phrase “social justice”—one that stands as the sweeping representation of a normative disposition towards a fairer society—is not open to everyone is a scary one.
When we talk about privilege, we refer to the privilege of being “the norm,” of being comfortable in your skin, where you are, without giving a second thought, and of not having centers dedicated to an important part of your identity—i.e. the Women’s Center, the BLGTQ center—cornered away in an inconspicuous corner of a building basement. Our conversations are based on our demographic identities, with the rightful understanding that some are coddled and some are screwed over by the unfair societal results of a malicious history.
But I think there’s also a privilege to knowing—and being able to remind yourself on a daily basis—that these things are privileges. And I wonder if this realization might be the ignition to an empathy that our student body can put to use in creating a more open social justice community.
Knowing about the intricacies of intersectionality and knowing why what someone said was an “ouch” moment for another person are definitely the more subtle privileges of perspective and knowledge. But the beautiful thing about this privilege is that it’s one with the potential for the maturity to invite people into it.
Any kind of privilege, whether it’s the ironic privilege of perspective or just the darn real, blinding privileges of money and race, breeds an exclusive structure of in-group and out-group. This is precisely why the two privilege groups are often uncomfortable with each other.
But the thing about the former kind of privilege—the privilege of having walked the walk—is that it’s too important for everyone not to have. And for the people with the privilege of “getting it,” there’s a real opportunity to show those with the other kind of privilege what the maturity of inclusion and empathy can do for the world, and more importantly, in broadening their own perspectives on human life.
I have a feeling that that’s really the spirit of social justice behind social justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are lots of reasons to dislike New York City.
The summers are harsh (scorching), and the winters are harsh (freezing). There is a provincial team called the Yankees that occasionally inspires ill will. Plus no one seems to know for sure whether a family of alligators is living in the city’s sewer system.
However, there is one indisputable virtue that the Big Apple has, and that virtue is called Humans of New York.
For the uninitiated, Humans of New York, affectionately known as HONY by its more than 12 million Facebook followers, is a personal exercise in photojournalism that takes photographer Brandon Stanton across the city to ask provocative questions to strangers on the street. A few hours later, et voilà: the encounters are transcribed, edited, and uploaded.
While mustering the chutzpah to change from bond trader to street photographer is impressive enough, Stanton is most remarkable for the roughly Cuba-sized network that he has created. And in recent weeks, this virtual country has achieved an unprecedented feat.
On January 19, 2015, Stanton posted a quote in which Vidal Chastanet, a middle-school student, described the huge influence of his principal Nadia Lopez. The upload inspired a campaign to pay for three years of student trips from Mott Hall Bridges Academy, which is in one of the most dangerous areas of the city, to the Harvard campus.
From here, the numbers tell the rest of the story: one campaign, 50,000 contributors, and $1.4 million. It’s so much money that Stanton, who spoke at the IOP on Wednesday, February 11, has helped establish a yearly summer program and scholarship fund.
The HONY fundraiser reemphasizes an already emphasized fact: the Internet has redefined what activism means and what it can achieve. When else, and how else, could 67 words from a 13-year-old change so much?
Of course, HONY is not the only organization to leverage online activism. From the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to #blacklivesmatter, various causes have swept across social media and varyingly called for money, political action, or basic awareness.
Let’s define this sort of action as crowd-sourced compassion. Such activism is public and communal, and both these attributes aid the effectiveness of the campaigns.
Publicity: by broadcasting your participation with this or that movement, you’re encouraging your friends into equal participation.
Community: a group such as HONY instills donors with the confidence that their money is building towards a concrete impact. In real time you can watch money pile up, and posted updates enure that your donation has aided in the creation of something beautiful.
However popular, these methods are not the only ways to give. More importantly, I’ve begun to wonder whether they’re the best ways to give.
Last Saturday, about a week after the HONY campaign ended, longtime basketball coach Dean Smith passed away. He left behind a reputation for quiet compassion, including the story of how he fought for desegregation in North Carolina.
Smith’s activism relied on neither publicity nor community. Here was the grand strategy: in 1964, without an announcement of any kind, he walked into a restaurant with a black friend and a local pastor. So began the slow death of segregation in Chapel Hill.
Years later, when sportswriter John Feinstein brought up the incident in a conversation with Smith, the coach bristled and demanded to know who had leaked the anecdote. Then he said these words, which have the ring of an epitaph: “You should never be proud of doing what’s right. You should just do what’s right.”
Where the HONY campaign was noble for its openness, Smith’s campaign was noble for its loneliness. Where the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge tried to broadcast information, Smith tried to keep information hidden.
Is there a special dignity to this method of silent activism?
It’s an open question, but my answer is an affirmation: on a gut level, this method feels virtuous.
Not all situations can be resolved with the genre of vigilante activism that Smith performed in Chapel Hill in 1964. But given the web-wide push to a visible extreme of social justice, we too often dismiss the invisible alternative because we are too afraid to be lonely advocates.
Raising awareness is beneficial, clearly, but so is working on your own. Sometimes you can’t fall back on the moral support of a large community or the material support of knowing that your contributions will have an impact. Sometimes, in Smith’s words, “you should just do what’s right” because it’s right.
For me, this philosophy is best encapsulated in the image of blind activists. Such people act without looking at others, which means, by extension, that they can only look at themselves.
No matter what cause enflames you, I encourage you to close your eyes, point your head down, and do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin Steinberg is an exceptionally admirable, inspirational, and accomplished woman, lawyer, and leader. For these reasons, she was chosen last month as one of 50 women lawyers to be honored as part of the law school’s International Women’s Day Exhibit at Harvard Law School, organized by the Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development Society. On Monday night, the New York Post ran a story criticizing this choice in light of the fact that two Bronx Defenders’ staff attorneys had participated last month in a music video depicting violence toward police. A few hours later, the WLA and LIDS announced it was withdrawing Ms. Steinberg from the exhibit. Along with the 180 other students who at the time of writing have signed this letter, we are deeply disappointed with this decision.
As the visionary founder of the Bronx Defenders, Ms. Steinberg exemplifies the women this exhibit is meant to honor. Under her direction, the office has pioneered a new model of holistic defense that has transformed the way public defense is practiced everywhere. Ms. Steinberg now assists public defender offices across the country, ensuring that their work is sensitive to the myriad issues that indigent clients face.
Under Ms. Steinberg’s leadership, the Bronx Defenders has distinguished itself as an office that advances feminist ideals while working towards racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic justice. The holistic defense model assists clients with issues that have a disproportionate impact on women and racial and ethnic minorities, including housing, family law, and immigration law issues. In addition, the Bronx Defenders employs 259 people, 179 (or 68 percent) of whom are women. Women serve as Managing Directors of all four practice areas in the office. These statistics are not coincidental: Ms. Steinberg seeks out and supports women in an effort to serve as a counterbalance in a legal field that has been historically dominated by men.
The limited explanation that the Harvard Women’s Law Association (WLA) and the Harvard Law and International Development Society (LIDS) have offered concerning this decision makes this situation even more disturbing. The organizations stated that: “[a]s lawyers who aspire to build a more effective criminal justice system, we believe that advocating violence against police in any form is reprehensible.” Robin Steinberg has spent her entire career helping to build a more effective and more just criminal justice system. The attacks on her and on The Bronx Defenders are part of a divisive campaign by the New York police union and its allies aimed at dismantling an organization that routinely challenges police officers and police practices in court. We are deeply disappointed that the WLA and LIDS, groups that claim to support women and other marginalized populations, would cave to these exploitative attacks.
The decision to remove Robin Steinberg from the exhibit does not represent the feelings of the student body, and it was not made in a democratic or transparent way. In fact, the decision was made without meaningful dialogue or consultation with members of either organization or even the various students who contributed to the nominating process. This decision-making suggests that the leadership of the WLA and LIDS caved to the pressures exerted by a divisive, and often sexist, media campaign, as well as to pressures from our own administration, instead of staying true to the wishes of students who believed Ms. Steinberg worthy of recognition despite the recent events involving The Bronx Defenders.
The Law School spoke when we nominated Ms. Steinberg for this honor because we–as law students, as feminists, as members of racial and ethnic minorities, as future indigent defenders–believe that she deserves our admiration. Ms. Steinberg has encouraged all of us to approach indigent defense from a critical perspective; she has challenged her office to think critically about sexism and racism in the criminal justice system, and her critiques are felt across the field and across the country. For decades, her work has improved the lives of countless women and individuals whose voices would otherwise be silenced. Those who stand up for the rights of the marginalized and indigent in this country will always hold uniquely and inherently precarious positions. We are standing with Ms. Steinberg because her work is both politically precarious and critical to marginalized populations, which is why it deserves the most vigorous championing.  By defending those whom society would rather ignore, Ms. Steinberg and the Bronx Defenders ensure more robust legal protections for all of us.
The leaders of the WLA and LIDS do not speak for us. As such, we are extending our own invitation to Ms. Steinberg to speak at HLS. Our community has a lot to learn from her. We also expect these organizations to either meaningfully explain their decision or to apologize and include Robin Steinberg in the International Women’s Day Exhibit.

To the editors:
We, as organizers of Our Harvard Can Do Better, are writing to register protest at your use of our organization's name to castigate Divest Harvard for their civil disobedience in your recent staff editorial. Although Our Harvard Can Do Better takes no position on fossil fuel divestment, it is neither our wish nor our place, as a campaign tackling one particular power structure, to purport to model the sole responsible form of activism on this campus. We respectfully request that you do not cite Our Harvard in this manner in the future.

Well, it’s that time of the year again, the time when loveless (and sexless) Harvard students have their best chance of finding the one who’s missing from their lives. No, I am not talking about the podst-Valentine’s Day spike in Tinder use. We’re talking about the one, the only, Datamatch. If love can’t be found using questions such as, “What kind of infectious disease describes your sex life?” then all hope is lost. With that in mind, FM describes the seven people with whom you Datamatched (whether or not you are excited about them is up to you).
01. Your TF/CAHave you always wondered what it would be like to date a TF? Wondered whether it would guarantee you an A? Or, at the very least, an A-? Well, here’s your chance to find out. Send them that email. Forget the awkwardness. Just because Harvard banned relationships between faculty and students doesn’t mean that you can’t go for this! Your GPA might (or might not) thank you for it.
02. The final club guy who still can’t get anyHe’s handsome. He’s tall. He’s most likely an athlete. His father is probably quite wealthy, so asking him out could potentially be your first coffee date not paid for with Board Plus. In other words, he seems perfect. But deep down, there’s a part of you wondering what must be wrong with him if he still hasn’t found someone despite partying every weekend at a club with a 1:10 guy-to-girl ratio.
03. Your best friendIt’s happened to all of us. One day, you see this person as the platonic rock of your life. The next, Datamatch tells you that maybe you’ve got it all wrong. Maybe there is something more. If Datamatch’s algorithm says you have chemistry, you probably do, since you both recognized Tom Brady’s balls as the Super Bowl MVP.
04. That guy from last semesterYou met at a party. You left the party together. You had a good time...maybe? It’s unclear what happened after that night, but all you know (and all your friends knows) is that it’s awkward now. He was always an awful texter, so even if you have thoughts of rekindling this “romance,” he probably won’t get back to you for another three weeks. By that time, you’ll hopefully have found a new bae.
05. Section kidThe obvious answer. You’ve never spoken with him or her, but you have heard them speak plenty about practically everything, from why Napoleon invaded Russia to the importance of learning about Darwinism. Typically, their voice elicits a strong reaction similar to when you’ve had too much beer on an empty stomach. You don’t even have to get coffee to know whether or not you want this match to go anywhere.
06. That girl/guy from freshman year in AnnenbergYes, we all have one. Do not be afraid to admit it. You probably had lunch with him or her once during Opening Days. Since then, every time you’ve seen this person in a dining hall, seven tables away, you have sensed a tingling in your stomach unlike anything you’ve ever felt before (though it’s possibly the swai you had for dinner). Well, good news! This is your chance to have coffee with him or her. Then again, you may not even remember names without it attached to a hometown and potential concentration.
07. Your exThis is just plain awkward. If you both plan first to volunteer for charity after you graduate, then give up and sell your soul for money, doesn’t that mean you should get back together? Wait, that’s not a good judgment, since 90 percent of us will do that. Hm. We don’t know what to tell you about this one, but tread carefully. There’s a reason you broke up in the first place, even if Datamatch says otherwise. Free waffles be damned, an algorithm can only take you so far.

Picture this: It’s 12:40 p.m. on a Tuesday, you have a class approaching fast at 1, and the dining hall just won’t cut it today. In fact, you have a very specific craving in your bones: burrito fever. But which store deserves your service? Luckily, FM is here to do your dirty work for you.
BOLOCO – 1:44:74
We decided to step up to the plate here, boldly sacrificing the usual Nutella milkshake, divine in its own right, for the sake of exemplary journalism. Rather than the assembly line one encounters at your Qdoba, Chipotle, or Felipe’s, Boloco adopts an innovative strategy involving the selection of ingredients up front. This allows the burristo to simply read the choices from a sheet of paper, crucially minimizing human interaction. Unfortunately, and perhaps our exquisite tastes were to blame, this did not help Boloco’s performance time.
QDOBA – 1:17:45
We’re going to be brutally honest here, because we know you expect the best. Qdoba’s female burristo, under a mask of unassuming charm and good–nature, possessed deadly efficiency with her hands. Or should we say weapons—weapons of mass burrito consumption. Witnessing this masterful performance hearkened me back to my stint on Ford’s assembly back in ’07—1907, that is. Henry Ford himself would have shed a tear at the ruthless efficiency displayed within this otherwise typical burrito store. Good job, Q.
TACO TRUCK – 1:27:16
A few extra minutes must be accounted for in your itinerary planning for the confusing time you invariably experience when you realize that you are, in fact, standing in what appears to be a store and not a truck–truly why some have referred to this establishment as the Atlantis of burrito stores. Other than that, Taco Truck follows Boloco’s model of choosing ingredients in the beginning, although performing 17 seconds (a whopping 16.2%) faster than Boloco.
CHIPOTLE – 1:01:05
Like a beacon in the night, it always welcomes you home. Never has an atmosphere of cold steel and concrete been so satisfying. Shuffling down the Chipotle food line is one of the most dependable burrito experiences the square has to offer. The only issue is rush hour, adding anywhere from two to ten minutes to your dining experience. Fortunately, it appears that the nearby Felipe’s location is taking a lot of business from this Old Faithful. So wrap me up like a burrito, baby, ’cause I’m overpriced, high quality, and only need a minute.
FELIPE'S – 1:22:38
We stepped into new Felipe’s with a heart full of wonder. Or rather, we tried to but were met with a line extending out the door. Although the taqueria only moved a hefty two blocks, the Harvard equivalent of Mordor, the crowds have followed. Even so, the BLUNT (Burrito Line Uncertainty Time) was an impressive 7:23:45. The key to Felipe’s is to know what you’re doing when you get to the counter. Always spring for the super burrito, and be ready for the lightning round of topping options. Godspeed.
In the end, is there a clear winner? Superior burrito speed in some restaurants was counteracted by long wait times. Maybe the moral here is that we’re all winners. Because, burritos.

UPDATED: February 20, 2015, at 1:42 a.m.
John Capodilupo, a former member of Harvard’s class of 2014, works just a few minutes away from Fenway Park. His office, located in Boston’s Landmark Center, spans two floors. It’s right under the basketball court, Capodilupo notes as we climb up a narrow stairwell with exposed brick walls.
The space has all of the typical features of tech-industry decor—hand-written equations scrawled on glass walls, bright Post-it notes covering whiteboards, flat white desks strewn with Mac computers. Employees sit (or bounce) on exercise balls and occasionally get up to fetch a Luna Bar from a snack-laden table in the center of the room.


Capodilupo comes from a family of academics; he matriculated expecting to pursue a Ph.D in computer science. That all changed, however, during Capodilupo’s sophomore year, when friends connected him with Will Ahmed ’12, a former captain of the men’s varsity squash team who wanted to create a wearable exercise monitor—a Fitbit-like device for serious athletes. The idea became a prototype, the prototype became the company Whoop, and Capodilupo became a Harvard drop-out.
Of course, Capodilupo, now 23 years old, may return for his junior year of College whenever he wishes, thanks to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ generous leave of absence policy. The chief technology officer, who still wears a Harvard rugby shirt with his jeans and thick-rimmed glasses, looks more like a grad student than a truant.


“I talked to the resident dean of Quincy House, and the way she put it was, Harvard’s always going to be here,” Capodilupo remembers. “It was kind of a no-brainer to try this out.” Capodilupo’s parents took some further persuading, but friends and faculty agreed with Chapman. After all, many of his friends had applied for the Thiel Fellowship, a prestigious program that offers entrepreneurial students $100,000 to drop out of school for two years.
Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Matt Damon—Harvard has had its fair share of famous drop-outs. Popular culture depicts these figures as the ultimate rebels, the entrepreneurial renegades with the brains to get into Harvard and the balls to leave it. Now, though, with supportive faculty, programs like the Thiel Fellowship, and an accommodating return policy, students considering dropping out have few reasons not to do so. While entrepreneurial and artistic opportunities are often time-sensitive, Harvard, these students believe, can wait.
Harvard Innovation Lab mentors, as well as professors who teach classes about innovation and entrepreneurship, seek to enable students to pursue these opportunities on campus. Still, given the difficulty of fully utilizing Harvard’s resources while maintaining a full course-load, many students find that at a certain point, it becomes easier to leave. When students reach that point, they discover that many of the same mentors and faculty they’ve already been working with are eager to help them move beyond Harvard’s gates.
If Whoop’s space looks like a cross between the Google headquarters and a fitness center lounge, then the Her Campus office in Boston is a girl-world mecca. I meet with Annie Wang, formerly a member of Harvard’s class of 2011, in the magazine’s “living room,” a small area with red walls and a white corner couch. Wang sits under three framed drawings: a pair of red lips, a bottle of Chanel No. 5, and a nail-polish set. Most office accessories are a particular shade of pink—“our pink,” Wang explains.The magazine, an online platform for college women, now numbers 20 staff members and about 5,000 contributors worldwide. It merits its own shade.


But the company traces its beginnings to a less glamorous setting—Quincy dining hall—where Wang and her co-founders, Stephanie K. Lewis ’10 and Windsor H. Western ’10, first began working on their proposal. After winning Harvard’s i3 Innovation Challenge, which offers a variety of awards for promising entrepreneurial proposals, the team moved to a space that Harvard Student Agencies offered to the contest’s winners. The three founders worked there for another year before Lewis and Western graduated and Wang took time off to work at the company full-time. During that year, the magazine garnered national attention and the founders were featured in Inc.com’s “30 Under 30.”
“I felt that this opportunity was once in a lifetime,” Wang says. She wears a faux-fur vest and her long black hair in a high ponytail. “It was a speeding train and I needed to get on board.” Beyond material success, though, Wang explains that had she not left school, she would have lost the chance to follow her passion. “People feel like they need to go on the path set by others…that’s such a denial,” she says.


The level of that passion—as measured in late-night hours and skipped lectures—often provides a litmus test for students wondering when it’s time to drop out. Erik C. Schluntz ’15-’16 and Merrill H. Lutsky ’15 decided to pursue funding from Y Combinator, a seed accelerator that provides $120,000 to fund startups, when their consumer technology start-up Posmetrics took off during their sophomore year.
“The summer between freshman and sophomore year, I was waking up thinking about the company, going home thinking about the company, and going to sleep thinking about the company,” Schluntz says. Now, having sold Posmetrics to a software company, the pair is back at school; Lutsky will even use advanced standing to graduate with his class.


Conversely, investors often interpret students’ willingness to drop out as an indication of their passion (and their confidence in their companies’ financial prospects).
“Investors say, we want founders, not students,” Lutsky says. “If it’s an idea I want to put a million bucks into, I want the person on the other end to truly believe that it’s a billion dollar company.” Lutsky added that while some accelerators like Rough Draft and Dorm Room Fund target current students, these companies typically invest smaller amounts.
Rory O’Reilly, formerly class of 2016, and Kieran O’Reilly, formerly class of 2017, wear nearly identical glasses. They’re Skyping in from Berkeley, Calif., though they still have “kind of a house” in San Francisco; Paul A. Bottino, a Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences lecturer who teaches Engineering Sciences 95r: “Startup R&D,” helped set them up there. That was back when they were working on Glyphic, a GIF-messaging app. Once the two moved to the West Coast, they realized that the market for such apps had already been saturated.
Now, the two have a new project, GIFYouTube, a site for users to upload videos and convert them into GIFs. They’re joined over Skype by Patrick H. Pan, a 16-year-old freshman and former member of the class of 2018. Right now, Pan, an inactive Crimson arts editor, sits cross-legged on his dorm room bunk bed, but he’s scheduled to fly out early the next morning to meet Kieran and Rory on the West Coast. A fourth student, Aaron Neuman, formerly a member of the class of 2017, also previously worked with the team.
“I just felt like it was my child,” Kieran says. “I couldn’t abandon it. I wanted to see it grow. I actually have nightmares that the website will break.”
Before settling first in San Francisco and then Berkeley, the team set up temporary work stations in hotel lobbies. Now that they’re pulling 17-hour days, they often have to remind each other to leave the house.
“Yesterday I went to a friend’s party, and I asked Kieran to come, and he was like, ‘Nope, I have to keep coding,’” Rory says.
But that’s standard in the tech industry, and start-up teams operating under deadlines must operate on even tighter schedules. A Thiel Fellowship only funds two years, and the Y Combinator sponsors teams for three-month periods, culminating in product presentations on “Demo Days.”
“The YC mantra was...write code and talk to customers,” says Lutsky, who would start making sales calls at 9 a.m. on the East Coast and finish at 5 p.m. on the West Coast for a total of 11 straight hours of sales work every day.
Eventually, Schluntz says, “they added exercise.”
Even during down time, many start-up entrepreneurs find themselves still focused on work. In fact, it’s hard to get away from it on the West Coast. “We live in this pretty large house in San Francisco with eight other people, and between all of us there are four companies,” explains Colton T. Gyulay, a former member of the class of 2015 who left Harvard to develop a mobile game app with Connor N. Zwick, of the same class. “So we always talk and bounce ideas off each other.”
One of the aforementioned roommates walks across the screen as we talk via Skype; he’s a drop-out, too—they all are. Though Zwick originally left school on a Thiel Fellowship whose two years have passed, he says that it seems unlikely he’ll return to school in the near future.
It’s the 17-hour days and households of dropouts that lure many tech-minded students out of school. This path appeals to many not because it seems exotic, but because it seems typical.
“When we tell people [that we dropped out], they’re like, oh, of course, Harvard-drop-out-start-up,” Kieran says. “Since I got [into Harvard] I told my parents I would drop out.”
That doesn’t mean all students interested in technology or computer science choose that path. According to Bottino, of the 232 students who have enrolled in his start-up class, only five have left school. Harvard College has a 97 percent graduation rate; of those students, 86.2 percent graduate within four years.
Michael P. Burke, the Faculty of Arts and Science Registrar, says that about 200 students take a leave of absence for a variety of reasons every year, and roughly an equal number return. He does not collect data on the lengths of individual students’ leaves of absence, but estimates that most return after a year.
“We make every possible condition [enabling graduation] available to them,” Burke says. But when a student comes to a thoughtful decision to take time off, it’s “not at all” a problem. The leave of absence policy does require that students returning after a leave of five years or longer petition the Administrative Board, and leaving in the middle of a term may interfere with financial aid.
Still, most house and resident deans respond encouragingly to students considering taking time off.
“Harvard can wait,” says Luke A. Leafgreen, Mather House dean. Leafgreen estimates that roughly 10 percent of his students take time off for a variety of reasons.
“In some cases, they’re so excited about their career and they find they don’t need a degree, and that’s fine, too,” Leafgreen says of students who never return.
“I think that generally when students want to take a leave of absence, it’s a good thing,” says Adams House dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal, adding that he often assuages the concerns of students worried about falling behind.
So for those who have promising opportunities, the choice often seems obvious.
Receiving YC funding, Lutsky says, made the decision a “no brainer.”
“It was like getting into Harvard—you can’t say no to it.”
Like tech-whizzes, talented artists are often presented with time-sensitive opportunities. At 3 p.m. on a Friday afternoon, Kaledora Kiernan-Linn (who goes by Kaledora Fontana), a former member of the class of 2018, has just finished rehearsal. Now, she’s re-lacing her pointe shoes in an empty studio, adjusting her purple leotard and translucent skirt in front of a wall of mirrors.


It’s a short day for Fontana, whose rehearsals often go from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Someone else needs the studio—a bearded man carries a camera through the room and and two legging-clad dancers stretch just outside the door—so we walk to an independent coffee shop down the street, across from the apartment Fontana shares with a roommate.
Fontana is starving—rehearsal often goes through lunch—so we order some food and coffee and sit down to talk. As hectic as her days might be, Fontana feels relieved that she’s no longer juggling a full course load along with dance. When the Boston Ballet first hired her before her freshman year at Harvard, Fontana asked her director if she could commute from Cambridge. He said yes, but Fontana soon realized that she had taken on too much.
“If I had five minutes during rehearsals, I’d be reading a book,” she says. “That was really fun because I like being really busy, but eventually I got to the point where I thought I was superhuman and could survive on four hours of sleep.”
Though Fontana tried to manage her schedule by finding a fourth class whose lectures she could watch online, midterms and finals brought unavoidable conflicts—she had four exams at the same time as performances. After a weekend of two performances per day, Fontana scheduled three make-up exams back-to-back on a Monday.
“I set up a meeting with my resident dean [Madeline Currie of Oak Yard], and I was like, I can’t do this anymore.”
While Fontana can come back to Harvard anytime, age matters in ballet; this might be her only opportunity to dance. After all, as a graduate of the School of American Ballet, she’s been training for it her full life.
“This was the only time I could do this, so it would be stupid not to,” she says.
Anna B. Lee, a former member of the class of 2017, Skypes in from Germany, where she’s studying with a violin master. Like Fontana, she had first tried to balance a burgeoning career as an artist with the normal demands of school. “I had concerts on the weekends in Europe, so I got an excuse to be absent for three days during orientation week. So already orientation week I wasn’t there,” she remembers.
After missing several German classes (Harvard language classes allow no more than three absences), Lee realized that she could no longer sustain her schedule. She could return to school later, but she needed to study violin now—her teacher was reaching the end of his career. “I can do literature at any age, but in terms of my body, things like learning how to do certain techniques or learning with this particular teacher, there is an expiration date,” she says.
Unlike tech-oriented students, however, artists don't necessarily have a set path to follow after leaving school. For some, it’s just about pursuing an idea when it strikes.
My Ngoc To, formerly a member of the class of 2015 and an inactive Crimson editor, wrote a memoir while taking time off after freshman year for personal reasons. She returned to school in the fall, but then came across another project.
“I was having lunch in the Signet [Society], talking to this nice old dude, and I was saying I love writing and art, and he was like…you should write a children’s book,” she recalls. Now, To is on her second leave of absence, writing and illustrating a children’s book based on Vietnamese fairytales.
Having written both at school—in creative writing classes and as a member of the Harvard Advocate—and outside of school, To believes that the latter better facilitates her creative focus. “At Harvard it’s hard to fully immerse yourself because there are so many distractions,” she says. “[Art] takes diving really deep into whatever you’re creating.”
Students who drop out of Harvard to write set their own schedules and work on their own terms. “It would be 11 p.m. on a Friday and I’d be turning off the lights in the common room and turning on the lamp in my room,” says Charlie Horan, a former member of the Class of 2018 who’s taking time off to write a novel. Now he writes from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. without disturbing roommates.
Harvard might not be able to provide an alternative to the Boston Ballet or full time study with a master violinist, but it has sought to bring the tech industry closer to campus. Based across the river at an edge of the Harvard Business School campus, the Innovation Lab does not look unlike Capodilupo’s office.
In a lounge area in the center of the room, a couch wraps around a black rug, facing a flat screen TV and Wii controller equipped with Guitar Hero paraphernalia. Most of the white walls feature doodles, written quotes, and tacked photographs. It’s dinner time, but a dozen or so students sit at flat white tables, hovering over laptops and occasionally leaning over each other’s screens.
One wall holds about 10 sheets of paper that read “___ is a ____ looking for a ___ to help with ___,” the spaces filled in with requests for investors, technicians, and team-members. Yin Liang, a student at Harvard Business School and a founder of Potluck Energy, one of the iLab’s Venture Incubation teams, tells me that she’s used the help board several times. “It’s set up so people can support each other,” she explains.
The Venture Incubation Program attempts to mimic that San Francisco atmosphere—eight people and four companies in a room—here on campus. Between 50 and 60 VIP teams each season receive office space, participate in workshops, and collaborate with iLab mentors for 12 weeks.
For some students, though, the iLab cannot provide a permanent alternative to dropping out. Several iLab alumni—Capodilupo, Lutsky, Schluntz, Gyulay, and Zwick, among them—went on to pursue resources outside Harvard. The O’Reilly brothers started an application for the program but never followed through.
Gordon S. Jones, the managing director of the iLab, says he does not see this as a failure on the part of the iLab. Rather, he says he understands that the iLab can serve as a launch pad for students who will ultimately go on to work in the industry full time. “We’ve had students who have left after finding some resources here that gave them the confidence to step out and run with their ideas,” he says.
Jones says he believes that the iLab serves students best by meeting them at their individual stages of development, and then connecting them with the appropriate resources. Jones maintains that the iLab “makes it easier to stay in school.” But for students who ultimately leave, Jones says, “we’re supportive from a distance.”
The iLab offers monetary funding through the President’s Challenge and the Dean’s Challenge; other entrepreneurial students, like Wang, apply for the i3 Innovation Challenge. These competitions are meant to provide students with the resources—monetary and otherwise—to develop companies during the semester. For many students, though, supporting a full-time company while at school proves unsustainable, not because of a lack of resources, but because of an inability to take full advantage of them.
“We’ve had an overabundance of resources thanks to the iLab and the amazing faculty here,” says Reylon A. Yount ’16, whose start-up, a performance interface application called Worldi, won the Dean’s Social Entrepreneurship Challenge in 2013. “We’ve just had so many mentors that we find ourselves still processing advice before we can go ask for more.”
“But there are some fundamental challenges that come along with having a full time academic career and doing this thing that’s supposed to be like 100 hours a week,” he continues.
Yount says that looking back, he wishes that he had known more about the time and effort that would be involved in maintaining a Dean’s Challenge project. “I sort of became aware of the challenging balance after talking to a lot of my own mentors,” he says. “It would be helpful for some of these very idealistic students to know early on that it’s not just a side business. The people from the Dean’s Challenge can be very direct and honest about this.”
According to Jeremy S. Sabath, a former member of the class of 2016 who left Harvard to pursue a job as a user experience strategist for a company called Freshly Tilled Soil, students who attempt to grow companies on the side end up “in no-man’s land.”
“There are people who seem to have more hours in the day,” Sabath says. “But in general it’s a disservice to encourage people to do both [school and a start-up] at once. They’re going to do worse at both.” Sabath says that while at school, he wished he could take two classes and count residency at the iLab for another two credits. “People have to decide between doing well, pursuing their passion, and sleep,” he says.
For others, like Gyulay, the iLab just cannot compete with the start-up environment in the Bay area. “It’s unparalleled the way it can happen [in San Francisco],” he says.
The iLab might better serve students for whom entrepreneurship has not yet become a fully-fledged passion. Many who work at the iLab have little or no experience in starting a company. “Most people here have not done it before,” Jones says. For them, the iLab allows for experimentation without risk; it also requires less of a time commitment.
Others, like Liang, have already completed their undergraduate degrees and entered the professional world. Liang says that outside of her two HBS courses, she has a large amount of free time to spend at the iLab. “Most of the people I work with [at the iLab] have two to four years [professional] experience and are grad students,” she says.
According to Jones, 30 percent of students who swiped into the iLab this past year attend the Business School, 40 percent attend the College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and 30 percent attend Harvard’s other schools.
It’s 9 a.m. on a Thursday morning, but the students in Fernando M. Reimers’s education and social entrepreneurship course look eager to get to work. Desks face each other at odd angles, and the students form haphazard groups of threes and fours; Reimers has asked them to identify a challenge in contemporary education. The walls of Longfellow Hall are painted bright green.
Reimers wears a sweater with a sport coat and tie. He circulates the room, approaching each group for a few minutes, asking students to share their ideas with the class.
He passes the microphone to a girl wearing a blue sweater. She’s concerned that online education is too solitary. Over the course of the GSE-listed course A132, Reimers will work with her—and the course’s other students—to develop entrepreneurial projects that will address these identified challenges. Yount, who took Reimers’s class, developed Worldi after noting how arts education might be improved if students were more aware of contemporary performances.
“You should be able to gain experience that connects you with the world while you’re in college,” Reimers says. The professor of the practice in international education explains that when students have come to him considering dropping out, he’s discouraged them; he believes a student’s desire to leave indicates a failure on the part of the school to engage with her.
“I think when a student drops out it’s because they didn’t make a connection with someone who challenges them,” Reimers says.
That might have been the case for the O’Reilly brothers, who say that their schoolwork did not engage them to the extent that their independent work did. “Our start-up is pretty much our life,” Rory says. “At school our [academic] work isn’t our life, it’s something we do for classes.”
Sabath also noted that he felt disengaged with Harvard due to a lack of “experiential learning.”
But most faculty at SEAS and Harvard’s Computer Science department view the decision to take time off as a personal one. That decision might be motivated by a desire for an experience that Harvard cannot provide, rather than experience that Harvard has failed to provide. James H. Waldo, Harvard’s chief technical officer and a professor of the practice in computer science, works with students to develop independent projects in courses on distributed systems and privacy.
“I’ve surprised some students when they’ve come to me thinking of [withdrawing],” Waldo says. “I think they expect me to say ‘stay in school’ like a parent, but I generally don’t do that. I say, ‘If you think this is really interesting, go do it.’”
Waldo recognizes that working in the industry teaches students skills he could not possibly impart in the classroom. “Craftsmanship is learned by doing the craft, not teaching it,” he says. “I try to teach some of these things in my class, but how do you teach people to maintain a piece of software over several years in one course?”
Waldo, who designed software for Sun Microsystems Laboratories and Hewlett Packard before joining Harvard, argues that industry training is about experiential, not monetary, value. “There are much easier ways to get money if you’re a Harvard student than starting your own company,” he says. “But even students who come back after their company has crashed and burned—they’ve learned a lot.”
Bottino says that students who manage their time wisely can grow a company without dropping out, he would not discourage a student from taking time off if she came to the decision thoughtfully. “Harvard is fantastic in its liberal policy that you can come back at any time,” he says. “If you come to it as a reasonable decision, if you really want to do this, if now’s the time, if it’s just too hot, then yeah, take time off.”
Harry R. Lewis ’68, interim SEAS dean and a former dean of the College, also supports students of his considering leaving school. “There’s no downside risk,” he says. “If they are paying more attention to things other than Harvard at Harvard, go do the other thing for a while. So I don’t mind people leaving—the ones who don’t come back aren’t coming back because they’ve been very successful.”
He notes that popular portrayals of start-up culture often portray drop outs as defying or one-upping their former schools. “One of the things I found slightly curious is people who try to say, ‘Haha, we got you, so-and-so dropped out,’” he says. “People drop out all the time for all kinds of reasons.”
Like Jones, Lewis says he believes that students can manage companies without leaving school; in 2001, he pushed to rescind a rule that prohibited students from starting businesses in their dorm rooms.
Outside Whoop’s conference room, a glass door—also covered in equations—reveals a room full of coders hunched over their laptops. Upstairs, the hardware room is empty, save for a board labeled with the Whoop logo. They’re not company products, just props from a party the office hosted over the summer.
Capodilupo can’t show off the product he dropped out three years ago to create; he has to keep it under wraps before the spring launch. I can’t help but wonder whether he’s nervous—after so much time dedicated, an education halted. “The start-up world is a roller coaster,” Capodilupo says. “One week you’re on top of the world; the next week an investor pulls out.”
Knowing the unstable nature of the job, did Capodilupo see dropping out as a big risk? Not really. “It was just a total thing to do in the tech world at Harvard,” he says.
On the salted and ice-hardened streets of Boston, Harvard’s campus is just a T-ride away. It’s separated from the city only by a narrow river, only by an iron gate.

I want to be known, and loved, and intellectually and sexually adored constantly by everybody. I want each party to be a glimmering climax where I utterly belong.
Enter Valentine’s Day weekend: a playground of hungry hearts and lonely bodies.
Weather: drunk.
Ethos: thirsty.
Drake summarizes the prevailing feeling: “I need a girl who gon’ love me/I need a girl who gon’ trust me/Someone to fuck me/Someone to make me feel lucky/Someone that’s so proud to be with me.”
Moscato
(Party; in exchange for my sparkling presence)
I’ve been stomping the slushy streets of Cambridge the past couple evenings, scenic in my loneliness, wallet fat from babysitting. I’m stalking down a slutty senior spring dress. What I find is a slutty senior spring romper: black lace, air-delicate, and more ass cheek than Harvard Square ever knew it wanted. As Kim Addonizio might have written had she been more fashion forward:
I want a black romper
I want it flimsy and cheap
I want it too tight. I want to wear it
Until someone tears it off me.
And then someone does. “You have a perfect body,” the rando is saying. It’s Friday night, shit’s gotten tipsy yet still affirmatively consensual, and we’ve ditched the party to make sweet love on my bed in the common room. “I always like a white woman with a great ass.”
Sexual experiences teach me new things. For example, Rando’s name. For another example, I never realized I was a great ass person. I always thought I was a mediocre ass person, and a great tits person. Women can have it all!
At this point, my roommate stumbles in. It’s 3 a.m.: From the door, to the bathroom, right past where Rando and I, in states of compromising undress, are rompering.
Cue the retching.
I jump out of bed naked and knock at the bathroom door. “Hey, baby, how are you doing? Do you want anything? Water? Me to hold your hair back?”
“No,” he slurs between vomit sounds.“No,no. It’s okay. It’s cleansing!”
I hover nervously for a second and then return to aforementioned sweet lovemaking to the barf soundtrack.
“Hey dude!” says Rando to Roommate when the latter emerges cleansed and in his boxer shorts, because it’s not at all gay to chat with another dude naked while you’re engaging in intercourse with his friend. “How’s it going, bro? Good night?”
“Great night,” says Roommate, pleasantly.
Cheap White Wine
(Hanging out in room; bonding)
The boy stays the night, pretty against my pillow in the clear-lit morning, but that’s not the important thing. The important thing is later Saturday, my head on Roommate’s lap as we lay on the couch talking.
“We have to chat about last night,” Roommate says.
Oh God, oh shit, I think, he felt icky. “I’m so sorry,” I tell him. “Did I make you uncomfortable? Do you want me to put up a curtain? I really don’t get laid usually. It was totally out of the ordinary.”
“No, no, you’re fine,” he says. “I just wanted to say it sounded like you were having a great time last night, and I’m really happy for you.”
His hands are in my hair. One time a few years ago, when I thought I was maybe sexily crush- ing on him, I asked Roommate at a party if he thought he’d ever want to sleep with me.
“I think you’re beautiful,” he said. “But I don’t want to have sex with you.”
The wine is sweet on the couch mid-after- noon, his hands are cool, and I’m sleepy. My brain turns over, like smooth stones, a couple HD lines:
So, when you had risen
from all the lethargy of love and its heat, you would have summoned me,
me alone,
and found my hands,
beyond all the hands in the world,
cold, cold, cold,
intolerably cold and sweet.
My Friend’s Margarita
($12; Border Café)
You know what else is intolerably cold and sweet, and also alcoholic? A margarita. Three of us are at a table at Border, me and The Queers, friends I’ve known, loved, and been flamboy- antly gay with since freshman year. She has a margarita; he’s digging into the fried shrimp; I have singlehandedly finished off our second chip basket. Like the gayest-ass version of Sex and the City, we are catching up on the music of the pre- vious evening.
“No, no,” he’s saying, “it’s a little bit more of a groan–you know, like a low groaning.”
“Like a moan or a groan?” I ask. “I’m a moaner. Not a groaner.”
“You know, like a low-pitched–ughhhhhh,” he says.
“Not like a breath? Not like a–uha-uha-uha- uha.”
“Or what about a, you know, a–mmmph. Mmmmmmph.”
We pay the bill and bundle up. She’s in love, he’s high, I’m a little bit of both. We link arms. We are everything. We huddle into the slushy night.

This historic winter, Harvard has afforded students more snow days than anyone could possibly need. Now that everyone has frolicked sufficiently, snow days have become a time for learned contemplation. FM considers how students of various concentrations can best use their time off.
Astrophysics:
Where the hell did Venus go?
Celtic Languages and Literatures:
Turns out Celtic languages and literatures are pretty useless on snow days, too.
Comparative Literature:
Read two different books that mention snow. In different languages. Compare.
Computer Science:
Develop an app that tells you whether or not it’s snowing outside. Sell to Yahoo for $3 million. Put some more tech company bumper stickers on your laptop.
Economics:
No different than any other day, really. Just prepare for your interview with Blackstone for an internship that will absolutely be emotionally, intellectually, and morally fulfilling.
Engineering:
Snow trebuchet.
English (Creative Writing):
Write 30,000 words on the quiet desperation of a mutt defecating in the snow. Take a break from reading and writing to forge the uncreated conscience of your race. Try to recreate Robert Frost’s “Stopping By The Woods on a Snowy Evening,” by becoming distracted by the extremely loud speaker system in the Fly, and experience a crushing sense of your own artistic inadequacy.
Folklore and Mythology:
What better use for a snow day than Norse Mythology cos-play? Dress up as Skadi, the Goddess of Winter and the Hunt, and act out an unhappy marriage with Njord, whom you only chose based on his beautiful bare feet.
Germanic Languages and Literatures:
Think about what a shitty time it is to invade Russia.
Government:
Thank Obama.
History:
Think about what a shitty time it is to invade Russia.
Music:
Realize that a surprising number of composers’ names can be combined with the word “bro” to make a compelling portmanteau (e.g. Bro-zart, Shota-Bro-Vich, Bro-kofiev).
Philosophy:
Deconstruct the Classical mimesis of snow with archetypally shaped Nietzschean symbols through the Cartesian lens in an attempt to elucidate the flawed dynamism of the Empiricists. Be generally unbearable to talk to.
Slavic Languages and Literature:
Slowly and tragically descend into alcoholism and hysteria before ultimately being framed for your father’s murder by one of your more educated servants. Or, watch a 24-hour loop of the film adaptation of Boris Pasternak’s “Dr. Zhivago” starring Omar Sharif.
Statistics:
Come up with a full statistical model that calculates the probability of the University having another snow day. Alternately, extrapolate the number of snow days exponentially. Realize that, by 2027, Harvard will just be a post-apocalyptic frozen tundra in which cannibalistic hordes vie for the approval of a charismatic overlord (Khurana).
Social Studies:
Utilitarianism dictates that only one of your blockmates needs to brave the snow to fetch provisions from the dining hall. Choose wisely.
Visual And Environmental Studies:
Consider the effect of the snow on the North American environment as a means of image concatenation through a uniform color continuum.
Women, Gender, and Sexuality:
Express disgust at the oppressive symbol of virginal purity that is the fresh-driven snow. Why don’t we make snow women?

On the tall, wooden shelves of the Office of Career Service’s library, curious onlookers can find dozens of binders full of Harvard students’ summer experiences. These nostalgic reflections tell of OCS-funded summers ranging from traditional trips abroad (read: that internship your mother’s friend keeps nagging you about) to far more eccentric adventures (octopus research opportunities in Naples, Italy).
But according to Robin E. Mount, the director of OCS, only about 50 percent of applications for summer funding are granted. This statistic got us thinking. Sure, there are definitely some applications that are tough to reject—after all, rejecting any app from a Harvard student is simply going against precedent (waitlisting, on the other hand, is begrudgingly accepted)—but we want to consider the apps that weren’t even close. Here are a few summer proposals we’re almost positive that the OCS has received, and no doubt rejected, in the past.
The Athlete
Request: High School Research Internship Fellowship
College athletes are cool. But you know who’s cooler than a college athlete? A senior in high school who has just committed to play college ball. I used to have everything, man: low stress levels, high confidence, and, most importantly, huge biceps.
Also, I was the only soon-to-be college athlete in my class. At Harvard, there are hundreds of kids who, like me, have grueling practice schedules, massively deflated egos, and fastidiously sculpted biceps. All I want from the OCS is the chance to go back.
The Protest Kid
Request: Recreate Jon Krakauer’s “Into The Wild,” Harvard-style
After spending last summer protesting the Keystone Pipeline outside the White House and essentially all of this year standing outside of Drew Faust’s office, I am done walking the walk.
I am seeking funding for the basic necessities, namely food, water, and shelter, as well as solar panels and a satellite dish to power my 65” plasma screen LCD TV. This summer, I plan to watch National Geographic and “Game of Thrones” from the comfort of my aunt’s humble summer abode in East Hampton. Why go into the wild when you can bring the wild to you?
The 'Shoulda Gone to State School’ Fratstar
Request: Full cultural immersion in the Sigma Nu “society” at the prestigious University of Alabama
As per my granddad’s request, I have tried out this whole Hahvahd thing. Ya know, I worked at Goldman last summer and am planning to go abroad to take a profile picture with help the “less well-off.” But god, I just miss The Crimson…Tide. I visited Alabama during the spring of my freshman year and have been, like, dying to go back to that culturally rich oasis. All I want is some good state school PBR.
Listen, I’m not about rolling joints—I’m about rolling tide. Take me home / to the place / I was boned / Alabama.
Yoga Girl
Request: An oculus rift virtual reality headset to take me on the “Eat, Pray, Love” trip without having to ever actually go to Indonesia because, like, ew.
I’d just love to be a free spirit this summer, which, as a faux-zen Harvard student, doesn’t exactly come easily to me. To that point, I don’t actually want to go anywhere; I need to always, and I mean always, have an organic, sustainable juice bar and a SoulCycle within jogging distance. This is why I need an oculus rift virtual reality headset: I want to go around the world without ever leaving my yoga mat.

I meet the Collegiate Club in their collegiate meeting spot: Lamont Library’s Larsen Room. Reclining in their chairs, these freshmen greet me with faces bright with excitement. They want to convince Harvard that they are putting out a quality product with their online fashion blog. I want to tell them this is not Stanford— we don’t just make things happen around here; we first try to comp and seek entry to the Acropolis of exclusive organizations.
“I was seeing a lot of guys not dressing that well,” starts to explain Bardeya Moradi ‘18, one of the founders. “They wear suits that don’t fit properly.”
As a true entrepreneur, Moradi thought, “there must be something I could do.”
The Collegiate Club will cater looks for the students to aid them with crucial first impressions by offering snapshots of trendy looks on their Lookbook and the Yard Style page.
The group directs its criticism not only towards fashion-ignorant students, but also those who restrict themselves to embodying the Ivy prep. In a world where Vineyard Vines and boat shoes sometimes seem like the only wardrobe options, the Collegiate Club’s founders believe students lack the resources to express themselves.
The staff also publishes features on “The Hook Up” (a pun on hooking up students with ideas and hook up culture).
Silvano D’Agostino ’18, a co-founder, mentions that he will publish a piece on the beauty of silence. He nods to take in the sounds of admiration from the board. He wants to discuss “metaphoric and literal silence” in his essay. D’Agostino has the air of a seasoned professional. I examine his grey suit and double collared shirt. He explains the origins of the Collegiate Club, a name that they picked because “it just sound[ed] cool,” according to Moradi.
“Bardeya and I met at a panel discussion in October about e-commerce,” D’Agostino says. The other members later connected with the duo. It seems like having noticed Moradi’s style before the conception of the magazine is a common sentiment across the board. “That guy is really well dressed but I don’t know him,” reminisces Irene A. Nicolae ‘18, the editor-in-chief.
Moradi attributes his own striking sense of fashion to his origins in Kensington, a swanky district of South London. The other members on the board—Nicolae, Head of Photography Katie L. Borrazzo ’18, a Crimson multimedia executive, and Michelle L. Kim ’18 who does the social media/PR—contribute their distinct talents but share a mutual understanding of fashion.
I turn to Nicolae, who seems to particularly enjoy embodying a sense of fashion and vocalizing her passion. She stresses the need for education about fashion. “It’s the motifs,” she reflects, and points out that no one knows what the looks are “from the runway.”
“Who cares about fashion if they are running Goldman Sachs?” Moradi interjects, acknowledging that some students may not have time to invest in their choices of attire.
Even though they went online just this month, the group is already in the midst of scaling, but their first priority hasn’t changed: to put out good content. For their Valentine’s Day Special, “50 Shades of Crimson,” Moradi accepted a guide to masturbation from a student who reached out to him in Annenberg.
“We’re happy to push limits,” he says. Another feature of this nature is “How To Douche Your Way Through Valentine’s Day,” by Max F. Mondelli.
Whether Harvard students will deem the Collegiate Club worth their time, and pay attention to the content they create, only time (and the number of clicks on the website) will tell. In the interim, members of the board will keep creeping over people’s computers in Annenberg to see if they are reading the new issue of the Collegiate Club.

From 67-cent Top Ramen at CVS to Instagram-worthy burgers with ramen patties instead of buns, a tasty Japanese staple has come a long way in America. As one might expect, the rise of ramen has created a demand for traditional shops that serve the real thing—no styrofoam packaging necessary. This phenomenon recently arrived in Harvard Square in the form of Santouka, a bona fide restaurant serving ramen and only ramen.
Unfortunately, a regular-size bowl costs about $12, a price that could buy you nearly 18 packages of Top Ramen. So, the question remains: Is fancy ramen really worth that price tag?
Well, the residents of Cambridge certainly seem to think so. As one woman standing near me put it before she turned around and walked out: “Look at that queue, man.” Noodle-hungry patrons packed the entire entrance to the restaurant. At lunch time, it took nearly a half hour to get a table, and I couldn’t even get in the night before because they hosted a private party.
Santouka’s interior is modern and simplistic, bathed in hues of grey, white, and black. An open kitchen lets customers observe the ramen creation process. It’s a huge step up from the scenery of the microwave in my dorm room.
The entire staff is unbelievably helpful. Whenever a new customer is about to be seated, the hostess yells something in Japanese, and the entire kitchen staff responds. While I understand nothing beyond “domo arigato,” I certainly felt welcomed.
Santouka also provides a plethora of seating options. There are both small tables and large, dining-room style seating meant for large parties, or in my case, communal dining. Because of the midday rush, I was seated at one of the larger ones with eight complete strangers. It was Freshman Week all over again.
When enjoying packaged ramen, I can slurp it up in the solitude of my dorm room, not worrying about what I look like with a cascade of noodles dangling from my mouth. This is not possible when eight other people are positioned to stare at me, whether or not they want to. Thankfully, the large plants in the center of the table and the wonderful distraction of the iPhone provided me with enough cover that I didn’t actually feel too uncomfortable.
This may have had to do with the ramen itself, because as soon as I took my first bite (or slurp), I was lost in the carbo-loaded bliss that is Santouka’s ramen. Unlike Top Ramen, the noodles are real. They’re made of real dough—not mysterious, GMO-ridden strings—and subsequently don’t crumble away to nothing when they’ve been in the broth for more than five minutes. The broth bursts with flavor that clearly didn’t come from a “chicken-flavored” packet. I tried Shoyu, a version flavored with soy sauce in the signature pork broth. It comes topped with several vegetables and cha-shu, pork meat that they marinate for an absurd twenty hours. It shows.
In terms of flavor, packaged ramen cannot even touch Santouka. Go for that reason alone. Trust me.
But because we’re all broke college students, I won’t say that I’ve sworn off Top Ramen forever. Unfortunately, with Santouka’s prime location quite literally across the street from the Yard, many students’ wallets— perhaps even mine—could be taking a beating this semester.

I’ve never been to a Culver’s restaurant that hasn’t been full of old people. The Culver’s nearest to my home is across the street from a giant, painted fiberglass statue of a chicken and is next to a gas station that sells worms out of giant tanks and bulk bags of discount wild rice. The Culver’s by my grandparents’ house, in the suburbs of Minnesota, is nestled in a generic stripmall area next to some used car dealers and a Home Depot. A Culver’s in its natural environment, though, is always found in Wisconsin. On the side of any highway, framed by scrubby trees, you’re bound to spot the navy blue oval of a Culver’s sign, that beacon leading to squeaky cheese with a crispy, hot outer crust and served with cups of shamelessly fatty frozen custard.
For those whose arteries are unacquainted, Culver’s is a fast-food chain, born in Wisconsin and endemic to the upper Midwest, that is known for serving fried cheese curds as a side dish alternative to fries. While Californian kids get to drool about In-N-Out burgers and their animal fries and make everyone else in the dining hall jealous, the youths of Minnesota and Wisconsin can’t logically brag to those from other regions about the ButterBurger, Culver’s rather tasty but downright embarrassing champion entrée. Most of us did not grow up near a healthy juice place or even a frozen yogurt shop.
I’m not saying that I come from hardship—I don’t. I’m saying that I come from a region of the country where a gluttonous basket of Wisconsin cheese curds every once in a while is something to be proud of, and a bag of uncooked cheese curds in the fridge is a treasure. Even better than the squeak of a fresh, cool, salty unfried cheese curd out of someone’s fridge is the fact that this snack usually accompanies an afternoon of sitting around and talking for hours without bothering to look at the clock on the oven, sunlight gleaming off the snow on the pine boughs out the window. The Wisconsinites and Minnesotans I’ve met at Harvard have gushed over memories of Culver’s and are eager to return to it not because it’s glamorous or perfect, but because it’s ours, and it’s pretty delicious.
Coming to college at Harvard has made me conscious of a lot of things I’ve never done. I’ve never travelled internationally—heck, I’ve never traveled to California. I never learned calculus (please don’t tell my admissions officer). I’ve been to New York and Chicago, but I still get a little starstruck when I’m in downtown Boston at night and look up at the illuminated buildings, at the way a city can glow brighter than the night sky. But, though college has opened me up to a lot of new experiences, the core of who I am comes from where my cheese curds did: I am Minnesotan, and Midwestern.
To me, being Midwestern does mean that I grew up camping and eating dairy, but it also means I was raised in a culture of kindness, thoroughness, communality, and respect. I returned home to Minnesota from school last spring with a fractured tibia that the school trainer had hastily misdiagnosed as a muscle strain. When my parents sent me to the clinic, I underwent minor culture shock at a number of elements of my trip, starting with the lack of traffic on the road and the near-emptiness of the waiting room. What really got me, though, was the way the woman behind the desk looked me in the eye when she asked how I was doing and genuinely processed my answer. She then offered to walk me to the room for my appointment to be sure I could find it.
Sitting in the waiting room for my X-ray and seeing the people around me looking calm andrelaxed, I relaxed a bit more myself, and, for the first time in months, I sat still, without feeling compelled to check my email or otherwise look productive. I’m not saying that no one in Cambridge has treated me with kindness or respect—many, many people have. I’m saying that I was raised in a land where the pace of life is a bit slower, and the spotlight often shines less brightly on the kind of accomplishment that I see championed at school. Heck, I’m from a region where people ice-fish. To this day, I have no idea why it’s fun to saw a giant hole in the ice on a lake and sit around it all day with fishing poles. But some people spend all year looking forward to that. Perhaps my version of ice fishing is walking my dog in the woods and picking fresh raspberries, eating them as I walk.
In spite of the new skills and experiences I’m picking up on in college, I try to hang on to elements of the Midwestern culture I was raised in. I often still pronounce the word bag like “baig,” to the amusement or frustration of many of my teammates and friends. But, more importantly, I try to remember the way that the family and neighbors and teachers who raised me generously gave their time, wisdom, resources, and cheese curds. Though I’m nowhere near perfect at it, I try to act in a way that will lead me to living a Midwestern lifestyle as an adult, no matter where I live or work.
My arteries don’t miss Culver’s cheese, but my feet miss the cool water of Minnesota’s lakes. I do feel at home, though, anytime someone wants to sit and chat after dinner on a weeknight. I feel at home around the many wonderful people I’ve met here who value creativity and personality over image or productivity. Most of all, though, I fit right in with anyone who loves salty, squeaky cheese.

For most college students, the thought of their car produces memories of long summer drives, or, for the more accident- prone, uncomfortable confrontations in the high school parking lot. Members of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Racing Team meditate on more technical car-related questions. How does carbon fiber increase the car’s speed? How can one maximize aerodynamic efficiency?
The SEAS team is currently building the Crimson Cruiser, a battery-powered vehicle that it hopes will push the boundaries of efficiency. This April, the team will compete in the battery-electric division of the Shell Eco-Marathon in Detroit, Mich. The goal of the competition, at which high school and undergraduate teams from the U.S., Brazil, Canada, and Mexico compete, is to build the most fuel-efficient car possible. Past winning designs have achieved over 2,000 miles per gallon. “You think your Prius is efficient?” asks SEAS Racing Team President and Steering Lead Jonathon C. Budd ‘15. “That’s not even close to how good these cars are.”
Founded in 2013, the SEAS Racing Team has grown under Budd’s leadership to include over 20 members of all four class years and a wide range of concentrations. Members are divided into subcommittees that focus on different components of the car, including the chassis, body, electronics system, steering, and brakes.
After modeling airflow for the various designs on a computer program and using a 3D printer to create several lightweight prototypes, the team is now ready to transition from the design phase into the actual fabrication of the car. A lightweight, carbon- fiber chassis and body will increase the car’s efficiency while still being sturdy enough to hold a student driver, who will steer lying feet-first, strapped in on his or her back.
Eventually, the team will hold a time-trial to determine which member has the optimum combination of low body weight and steering ability. The drivers won’t be expecting much fanfare at the test-run, however. When asked for a potential location, Budd responds: “Classified. If we told you, people would not let us test there.”
It’s a complex engineering project for an undergraduate team, and Budd has inevitably encountered some unforeseen issues. The constraints imposed by their workspace in Pierce Hall often make maneuvering large parts difficult. Additionally, some of their design plans have been downsized to accommodate a limited budget. Then there are Harvard’s concerns over the “liability issues with an actual, moving, potentially dangerous, high-speed car,” Budd says.
However, the enjoyment that comes from working as a team outweighs the frustrations.
“It’s really great to just work with other students and try to tackle such a large problem,” says Chief Engineer Willie J. Pirc ’15.
In an environment where hours spent reading and studying can appear to amount to just a letter on a transcript, the project provides the team with the satisfaction of producing a tangible outcome. As Budd says, “At the end of the day, you don’t have, ‘Oh that was a sweet p-set I just crushed.’ No, this is my car, let’s get in it and go drive it around.”

As millennials, there are a number of items on our collective to-do lists. In addition to texting and listening to music non-stop (and consistently disappointing our elders), we are honor-bound to follow the photo blog Humans of New York. And so when the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum announced Brandon Stanton—the man with 2.5 million Instagram followers—would be visiting Harvard to speak, we scrambled to enter the lottery for the event. With the fates smiling upon us, we received confirmation emails a few days later.
Fast forward to Feb. 11—guess what? It’s a blizzard. As we walk down the narrow and slick sidewalks of Harvard Square towards the Institute of Politics, one of us (who shall remain unidentified) realizes they forgot their ticket. Panic sets in. Spinning around, they sprint back up those perilously narrow, slick sidewalks, praying and time-checking and cursing the whole way.
With the crisis averted, we arrive, running low on breath but high in spirits. From our perch on the second floor, we see it all: the audience members leafing through their programs, the third floor viewers leaning over the railing searching for that prime camera angle, that one guy updating his status about the cool event he is “just so honored to be at.” The IOP is hopping. A few minutes go by and IOP Director Maggie Williams steps out with Stanton to roaring applause. With smartphones ready and waiting to capture this very meta moment, the humans of the audience snap photos as quickly as they can.
Stanton quickly proves himself to be just as kind, observant, and witty as we had hoped. Breaking the ice with his audience through humor, Stanton starts out with a joke about the massive amounts of snow we’ve been seeing. And although it hits a little close to home—it’s tough not seeing the sun for a week straight—Stanton manages to set a light, conversational tone which he keeps up throughout the event.
Humbly, Stanton touches on his blog’s most exciting new developments: A partnership with the UN, his recent interview with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, and his trips to Africa. Still, Stanton’s self-deprecating charm—he repeatedly declares himself to be “a terrible photographer” and offers the disclaimer that it took him six years to graduate from the University of Georgia—keeps him grounded despite his monumental successes.
The tables turn on Stanton during a question and answer session. The man so used to being behind the camera and doing the interviews suddenly faces the very same questions he poses to the people on his blog. Asked about his biggest regrets, his biggest inspiration, and his favorite blog post, Stanton is forced to dig deep and come up with honest answers. Stanton chuckles, commenting that it’s only fair that he has to squirm a bit—he asks the same questions of people on the street day in and day out. For Stanton, his job is “not judging or analyzing, but just hearing their experiences,” which may explain why he’s been able to draw personal and meaningful stories out of everyone from gang members to drag queens, state officials to kindergarteners. Stanton truly sees this as his personal calling, his mis- sion in life. “Time,” Stanton argues, “matters so much more than money. I wanted to make enough money so that I owned my time, and could do something meaningful with it.”
Stanton touched on the inherently political nature of his blog. Even though he never intended for his project to have any political leanings, the nature of the interview process means that personal biases will inevitably come into play. For Stanton, the blog will always be, first and foremost, a sweeping portrait of the human experience, and his goal is to create solidarity even when opinions are divided. He notes that he’s very fortunate to receive a wealth of positive comments on his page.
When the lengthy Q&A draws to a close, the event really escalates. No longer bound by the behavioral expectations for a polite viewing audience, the crowd swarms towards the stage. Each crowd member has the same goal—a selfie with Stanton—and like gladiators, everyone is prepared to fight to the death for it (and by that we mean pushing, shoving, and stepping on toes). From our disadvantaged position one floor above, all we could do was put on our coats and try in vain to convince ourselves that we just don’t need a selfie with Stanton, anyway.

The Sloth is not, as it may appear at first blush, an apathetic new final club. It is in fact a storytelling initiative based on the national success of the Moth, a similarly named and structured event founded in 1997 that spawned a weekly podcast, public radio show, and book collection. Sloth attendees gather in the Barker Center, splay out across plush chairs and couches, and listen to their peers recount true short stories from their lives that all center around a weekly theme.
At the Sloth’s Senior Night, the theme is “lessons learned.” The Barker Center’s Thompson Room lends a casual feel to the proceedings. A hat rests by the door as I enter, and I’m instructed to write my name down on a slip of paper and drop it inside if I wish to share a story. A few years under the cut off for this event, I am resigned to just listen and park myself in the front row.
The Thompson Room quickly fills with the buzz of excited chatter under the stern portraits and strange statues that line the walls. The audience seems to be made up of groups of friends, many of whom are here to cheer for the storyteller in their midst.
Senior Night emcee Jackie R. Schechter ’15 picks a name from the hat, and David R. Grieder ’15 gets us off to a knee-slapping start. He recounts the freshman year antics between himself and his neighbor Kramer (the fortuitousness of his neighbor’s name is lost on none of us, least of all Grieder). Facebook hacks flew back and forth as they raced to embarrass each other online in front of romantic interests. The lesson learned? Close your computer on your way out.
Some of the presentations are polished and prepared performances, but some are off the cuff, as people are talked last minute into submitting their names. Evan B. Weiner ’15 gets off to a rocky start with a story about his travels to India, but in the end, like all the storytellers, he manages to spin the threads together into a moving piece that advocates going outside your comfort zone in order to grow.
While some of the stories strive for wisdom, the majority are tales of daring pigheadedness and relatable stupidity. The crowd is quick with the correct responses, whether it’s raucous laughter, moans of sympathy, or understanding head-bobbing snaps. Scott Y. Zhuge ’15 recounts learning to cook for the first time—we discover that if you try to emulate Chipotle, you might end up with a sodium deficiency. Another senior takes us to the Alps, where we’re chased by vicious sheep dogs—they are evidently an “important” part of Alpine heritage. The final story of the night teaches us the valuable lesson of not applying deodorant while driving—you may crash into a granite mailbox and total your car a block away from your house.
After about an hour, with a handful of names left scattered inside the hat, the Sloth is forced to call it a night. Although the seniors told their stories at a microphone, it felt more like they were clustered in a common room, sharing them with a group of close friends. I look forward to returning, next time with a story of my own to tell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As faculty scrambled to rearrange schedules after Harvard canceled three days of classes in as many weeks when historic snowfall hit New England, the Office of Student Life reached out to student groups requesting that they alter their schedules so their members prioritize academics over extracurricular commitments.
In an email last week to leaders of student groups, including The Crimson, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich asked student leaders to set “the expectation for your membership that they should be prioritizing academic commitments over extra-curricular activities.”
Administrators, both at the OSL and the College more broadly, have previously expressed a worry that students, at the expense of academics, are spending too much time on extracurriculars, which have been on the rise over the last decade. The direct message about the snow days comes in the context of these concerns, administrators said.
In an interview, Friedrich said the OSL has repeatedly emphasized that academics should be students’ first priority. This email, which hundreds of student group leaders received, reiterated that consistent message, he said.
“It’s a general principle that we certainly believe in, but also something that’s particularly relevant for this moment,” Friedrich said.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, for his part, said the number of snow days this early in the semester makes it difficult for students to stay focused on their academics.
“With the snow days it’s going to be harder than ever,” Dingman said. “I think it’s a helpful reminder that developing some flexibility around organization meetings in order to get the extra class time in is helpful. I think all of us can get very busy and forget really why we’re primarily here.”
Some student group leaders said they thought the OSL’s request to modify schedules was reasonable, although they said they will not necessarily modify comp requirements or notify all their members of the request.
Fernando Espino ’15, president of the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, said the request is logical, given that Harvard is an academic institution, but also said he hopes that the College gives him ample notice if room schedules needed to be switched around to accommodate class changes.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16,  president of the Harvard College Democrats, said executive board members discussed the email at a meeting and agreed with its sentiment, but added that the group will likely not modify any planned events.
“For us it wasn't as much a policy change as a reminder,” Carrel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council leaders plan to create an alumni advisory board during their term in the hopes of eventually acquiring alumni funding for student groups.
UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said in an interview Wednesday that through the advisory board, they will first focus on fostering relationships between current members of the Council and alumni before ultimately soliciting donations. Securing funds for student groups through alumni donations was a centerpiece of their campaign for UC leadership last fall.
“The moment the board steps on, we can’t demand funding,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “We don’t think that’s a tactical way of going about it, so we’ll first focus on building relationships.”
The board will consist mainly of former, graduated UC representatives, according to project manager and Oak Yard representative Berkeley Brown ’18. The board will first be used to gather advice from alumni about current UC initiatives.
“Because [the UC is] a student group without a faculty adviser, an advisory board would be of particular use to us as we continue to take on projects that greatly affect the student body,” Brown said.
In addition to soliciting advice and funding, the advisory board will organize Council reunions, write a newsletter, and establish an online directory that both UC representatives and UC alumni can access, according to Brown.
“The alumni advisory board was created with the idea in mind that it’s sometimes good to have an outside perspective,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “Right now, we get our outside perspective from student groups, administrators, or faculty, but its easy to have your opinions clouded from the inside of the College.”
According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, the donations that the advisory board will eventually gather would be for specific UC initiatives as opposed to for general Council funds.
“That’s a more of a concrete argument to make, rather than going to them and asking for a blank check,” Goyal said.
In recent years, securing more funding has become a perennial issue for the Council. Former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 launched an ultimately unsuccessful campaign last spring semester to obtain $250,000 in additional funding from administrators. Months later, in November, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal ran for UC leadership on a campaign platform that proposed that the Council acquire funding for student groups by soliciting alumni donations.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal will be meeting with University President Drew G. Faust on Thursday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists including a U.S. congressman and Kennedy School of Government professor discussed what they saw as recent restrictions to voter rights at a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event Wednesday night, 50 years after the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law.
The panel—which featured Congressman Robert C. Scott and Penda D. Hair, co-founder and co-director of a civil rights organization called the Advancement Project—was moderated by Kennedy School professor Alexander Keyssar.
Sponsored by the Institute of Politics and the Kennedy School Ash Center, the event, called “50 Years after the Voting Rights Act: Strategies for Moving Forward,” drew about 75 audience members to a discussion that was largely critical of recent developments in voting legislation.
The speakers argued that the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder—which struck down the coverage formula of the Voting Rights Act of 1965—and congressional opposition to the Voting Rights Amendment Act has allowed states to pass more discriminatory legislation.
Keyssar cited these recent obstacles as evidence of a recent relapse in voting rights progress. “The history of enfranchisement in the United States is not a history of continuous expansion, it’s a history of expansions followed by counter-effects,” Keyssar said during the panel.
When asked by Keyssar about Republican reluctance to support the Voting Rights Amendment Act, Scott expressed his own disbelief and frustration with his peers, especially given the nature of the bill.
“The bill is so modest,” he said, “you almost feel embarrassed fighting for it.”
Hair, for her part, expressed hope for a constitutional amendment that would establish voting as an explicit right. Such a provision could allow for uniform voting laws across states as well as “higher judicial scrutiny” of voting laws, Hair said.
When asked by Sarah S. Fellman ’18 what individuals can do to advocate for voting rights, both Hair and Scott had words of encouragement and advice.
Hair emphasized that despite the recent developments, encouraging voters to elect officials who are supportive of voting rights is just as important as ever. “Take people to the DMV, take people to vote… and fight,” she said.
“With the whole speed bumps against progress, all we can do is work hard,” Scott said.
Olivia M. Castor ’17 said she appreciated the panelists’ viewpoints.
“With a place like the IOP, we often can get caught up in a lot of the bigger, fancier issues like abortion, gerrymandering, and we forget about the importance of basic things,” Castor said. “Voting is basically the foundation of everything else that is happening in our government.”

Members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment praised the goals of a student sit-in staged last Thursday in Massachusetts Hall, home to the office of University President Drew G. Faust, arguing that the protest returned attention to demands that the University withdraw its investments in fossil fuel companies.
The group—which is comprised of 232 faculty from across Harvard’s schools who have signed an open letter urging the University to divest—issued a statement on their website last week reaffirming their support for the message of Divest Harvard, the activist group behind the protest. The faculty group is affiliated with that organization, which also spearheaded a rally in Harvard Yard on Friday after their 24-hour sit-in.
“We wanted to make a point of letting people know that we supported the students’ goal,”said Medical School assistant professor James M. Recht, who was one of the four principal authors of the open letter released last April.
Although the group statement did not feature any comment on the students’ choice of protest tactics, some professors who were signatories applauded the tactics as an effective means to raise awareness for the issue.
“It was a peaceful sit-in, got the message across, and got people to talk about divestment again,” said History of Science lecturer Soha Bayoumi.
“I think it was a legitimate use of protest, and I gather it was less disruptive than the last time they blockaded,” Classics professor Richard F. Thomas said. A student was arrested for blocking an entrance to Mass. Hall last May during a previous protest urging the University to divest.
Romance Languages and Literature professor Doris Sommer said that she was “grateful” that the students staged the protest, even if the impacts are not immediate.
“I think that keeping attention to the issue is necessary, and one won't see the effect from one week to the next,” Sommers said.
Recht, for his part, called the method of the sit-in not only necessary but “the right thing to do.”
The faculty group has been quiet since releasing a letter to Faust and Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee on Dec. 1 requesting “a well-publicized and well-planned open forum this spring to discuss the University’s role in addressing climate change.” Faust has repeatedly argued that Harvard should not divest from fossil fuels.
But Recht said that this week a national group called Faculty/Staff Divestment network contacted members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment requesting signatures on a petition calling for institutions of higher education to divest from fossil fuel companies. Members comprising a “core group” of about two dozen faculty for divestment have already signed that petition, Recht said, and those core members will begin reaching out to other faculty this week for more signatures.
Some signatories of the letter contacted for this story said that they had not followed last week’s developments and had not been active within the organization recently.

A new finding by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits, or GIANT, consortium has identified 97 gene regions associated with obesity, tripling the number of such genes previously known. The study, which stands as the largest genome study conducted to date, was led by Harvard Medical School professor Joel N. Hirschhorn.
According to University of Michigan assistant professor Elizabeth K. Speliotes, the consortium is a "group of investigators that are trying to understand the basis of anthropometric traits,” which includes statistics such as human height, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio.
This medical advancement did not come without time and effort. Ruth J.F. Loos, professor for preventative medicine of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said the study has been in the works for many years.
“It took us about four years to combine even more data and that is what was published recently,” she said. According to Loos, the paper is the most recent in a series of publications and represents the work of 125 studies, which used about 340,000 individuals as subjects.
Many of the gene variants were located in the brain, meaning that many of the genes regulated processes such as hunger and energy expenditure. “Obesity is more of a central nervous system disease,” Loos said.
Speliotes said that “our work clearly shows that predisposition to increased BMI is not due to a single gene or genetic change. We report 97 genome-wide hits but we show data that even more regions of the genome are likely to influence the trait. This suggests that different people may be predisposed to become obese by different mechanisms.”
Despite the strong influence of genes in obesity, the environment can play as strong a part. According to Loos, only 40 to 70 percent of the variation in obesity is caused by genetics. The remaining 30 to 60 percent can be attributed to the environment you live in. “We definitely do not claim that it is destiny,” she said.
For Cecilia M. Lindgren, scholar in residence at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and a professor at the University of Oxford, the GIANT consortium marked an important shift towards collaboration in genetics research. Lindgren also noted that genetics is especially suited to large scale collaboration.
“When I started my Ph.D.… nobody was in consortia,” Lindgren said. “[But] in order to test [genetics data] robustly, you have to have really a large sample size. Now I think we have over five hundred authors on these papers… and over 300,000 individuals. I do think that collaboration is kind of the key to the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists argued that the perception—particularly among women—that careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are reserved for gifted students are unsustainable for the future of STEM fields at a forum Wednesday evening.
In the discussion, an Askwith Forum held at the Graduate School of Education and titled “A Space of Their Own? Girls, Women, and STEM,” panelists said that this change could occur by expanding and repackaging the educational resources available to those who might be interested in challenging, technical fields.
President of Harvey Mudd College Maria Klawe, one of the panelists, said there is shortage of workers in the STEM field, adding that women are an untapped labor resource that could help plug the gap.
“People are really realizing that we need many more people to graduate with computer science who currently do not go into that discipline,” Klawe said.
Technical fields are often framed as careers for genius levels of intelligence, and these cultural biases can raise doubts among students about whether they belong in such roles, said panelist Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.
“There [are] such deep notions of intelligence and capacity,” Margolis said, “and in this country, I think that culture is a ghost that accompanies people every step of the way.”
Margolis stressed the need for female students to know computer science, saying that all citizens need to engage with technology for the sake of political empowerment.
“Computer science is affecting every single solitary aspect of our lives. It’s affecting our culture, and it’s affecting democratic participation,” said Margolis. “It’s a civil rights issue, and it’s a democracy issue in today’s world.”
Speaking of ways to tear down the barriers to STEM, astronaut Stephanie D. Wilson from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration underscored the importance of providing role models for young women interested in these careers.
“It is important to be able to visualize the end of the road, and as you see that visualization, that you see a clear path to get there,” said Wilson.
Panelists also emphasized increasing exposure to and knowledge of computer science early on in girls’ educational careers through school courses and outside support programs.
“That kind of seeds the interest for them to continue along that path,” said panelist Kimberly Bryant, founder of STEM training program Black Girls CODE. “I think there’s a lot of policy that needs to happen on the educational side, both at the local and federal levels, to make that happen.”

As part of the Climate Change Solutions Fund’s inaugural round of awarding, seven Harvard affiliates collectively received roughly $800,000 in grants for projects focusing on climate change last week.
The fund, which University President Drew G. Faust created last April, seeks to support research about “long-term global climate change—as well as immediate threats to the natural environment,” according to a University press release.
Recipients included Jose Guillermo Cedeno Laurent, a research fellow at the School of Public Health; Emily M. Broad Leib, a lecturer at Harvard Law School; Michael B. McElroy, a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor; Daniel G. Nocera, a professor in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department; Rohini Pande, a Kennedy School professor; Jisung Park, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences doctoral candidate; and James H. Stock, a professor at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a Kennedy School of Government faculty member.
The focuses and disciplines of the projects varied, with Leib looking at reducing food waste, Pande researching market-based policy design to mitigate air pollution in India, and Stock investigating market impediments to the penetration of biofuels.
Autumn Bennett, program coordinator at Harvard's Office of the Vice Provost for Research, emphasized the University’s commitment to climate change research in a statement on behalf of Richard McCullough, Harvard's Vice Provost for Research.
“Harvard has the capacity and responsibility to address the challenge of climate change boldly and with conviction,” the statement said. “Shaping a more sustainable future, both on and off our campus, will depend on the insights of our scientists and engineers, as well as our experts across a wide range of disciplines.”
The announcement of the grant winners came just a day before protesters stormed Massachusetts Hall demanding that Harvard divest from fossil fuels as part of an effort to combat climate change.
The fund will accept online proposals later this year for its second round of grants. The value of the fund, according to the press release, was $20 million at the time of its creation.

The smartphone calendar application Ventfull is now open for Harvard undergraduates to use after the Undergraduate Council paid to bring the service to campus for the semester.
Ventfull, first started as a website at Brown University, is an online calendar tool that is geared towards colleges and aims to keep students informed of events happening on their campuses.
According to UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the Council paid $1,200 to bring Ventfull to Harvard for a trial period that will last through the spring semester. Goyal and UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 publicized the service to students in an email Wednesday.
Ventfull’s Harvard calendar currently lists various upcoming student group events and includes features that allow users to filter for various attributes such as House-specific events or events with free food.
In an effort to populate the calendar, the UC Finance Committee said in a meeting earlier this semester that all events funded through the Council will be required to appear on Ventfull’s Harvard calendar.
Ventfull was a major component of the current UC leaders’ campaign platform last November. The application will be available over an online platform, as well as on Android and iOS phone operating systems. Nasrollazadeh and Goyal also plan to launch a new version of the current Harvard smartphone application later this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After tying a season high with its sixth consecutive win Saturday, the Harvard men’s basketball team (17-5, 7-1 Ivy) will try to complete a perfect 4-0 homestand when it welcomes conference foes Penn (7-14, 2-5) and Princeton (11-12, 4-3) to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend. Dating back to the 2012-2013 season, Harvard has won 15 of its last 17 conference home games.
Although it has been just three weeks since the teams last faced off, much has changed. Harvard headed to Princeton on Jan. 30 looking up at the league’s top two in the standings for the first time since 2009. To keep within arm’s reach of rival Yale, Harvard faced the unenviable task of winning in its perennial house of horrors; prior to a 59-47 win in 2014, Harvard had left New Jersey empty-handed on 24 consecutive trips.
The storyline faded quickly after tipoff. Harvard led by 11 at the half and held off the Tigers in the second half for a 75-72 victory, completing the road sweep with a 25-point victory the following night in Philadelphia. The sweep kicked off sharply divergent paths; although Harvard has won all six of its games since tipping off in Jadwin, Penn and Princeton are a combined 5-7 over the same time frame.
Noting that Harvard has already given away four double-digit leads in Ivy League play, resulting in three close wins and a loss, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers said a focus for the team over the weekend will be controlling and closing out games.
“We talked about it extensively, we just have to finish,” Chambers said.
Friday, Harvard will aim to replicate its prior blueprint against the Quakers. In its last three games against Penn, Harvard has earned three wins and a combined 75-point margin of victory by walling off the paint and daring the Quakers to win the game from the perimeter. The strategy has been very successful, as Penn has shot 35 treys in the losses but converted at only a 26 percent clip.
Crucial to this strategy is containing junior Quaker point guard Tony Hicks. The sparkplug for the team’s offense, Hicks has averaged 18 points in Penn’s two Ivy League wins and just nine in its losses. When he is on—like in a 71-69 win at Cornell where he had 20 points and the game-winning floater—the Quakers are dangerous. If he struggles—he had just six points in the teams’ last meeting—Penn struggles to find sufficient offense.
“The main thing that we have to do against Hicks is that we have to do a better job in transition defense,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We got hammered with that against Cornell, who raced the ball up the floor against us and got stuff early and easy in the offensive possession.… Getting back and getting our defense set will be critical to contain them.”
The following night, the Crimson’s strategy will flip. While Penn coach Jerome Allen favors a conventional two-big lineup that cramps floor spacing, Princeton coach Mitch Henderson uses an array of fleet-footed wings and forwards in a less conventional lineup. Four Princeton regulars shoot at least 35 percent from the three-point line and each starter has three-point range.
In the teams’ last matchup, the Tigers hit five threes in the first half, with quick passes keeping Crimson defenders scrambling and chasing open shooter. The Crimson closed out better in the second half, but Princeton took advantage of foul trouble to co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and relentlessly attacked the basket.
“We need to rebound and close out the three-point shooters [this time],” Chambers said.
“All those players can shoot threes, and as a team we didn’t feel like we did a good job closing out on three-point shooters, guards, and forwards on either side.”
Offensively, Harvard will rely on its starting backcourt of Chambers and senior wing Wesley Saunders, whom Amaker calls, respectively, the team’s most important and best players. The two averaged 26 combined points in Harvard’s weekend sweep of Cornell and Columbia and have provided 39 percent of the team’s points and 65 percent of the team’s assists on the season.
“My teammates and coaches really trust me with the ball, so I have to make sure I am making good decisions with the ball,” Chambers said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 20, 2015, at 1:45 a.m.
If defense really does win championships, then the Harvard men’s lacrosse team appears poised to make a serious run at its second straight Ivy League title. When the Crimson opens its season at home against in-state foe UMass on Saturday, Harvard will field arguably the best defensive unit in the conference, with three returning all-Ivy selections.
Junior defenseman Bobby Duvnjak earned first team honors a year ago, while classmate Stephen Jahelka and goaltender Jake Gambitsky, both captains of this year’s squad, were named to the second team. Another member of the unit, senior long stick midfielder Brian Fischer, was recently selected in the fifth round of the Major League Lacrosse collegiate draft and named one of the top 60 Division I players by Inside Lacrosse.
“I think we have one of the more athletic defenses in the Ivy League,” Jahelka said. “What makes us so good is our chemistry together...through practice and film and last year in the games, we are more on the same page this year and know each other’s style of play.”
Heading into this season, Harvard loses just one defensive starter from a group that allowed the fewest goals per game in league play (8.67). Playing its best against conference opponents will be key for the Crimson, as the only way to ensure an NCAA tournament berth is to finish atop a league brimming with talent and shaping up to be as competitive as ever.
The latest media poll has five Ivy League teams in the top 20, with Cornell, Penn, Harvard, and Yale all bunched from No. 11 to No. 14, in that order. Princeton closes out the poll at No. 20, and, with only six league games for each team, it is impossible for any of the conference favorites to look past Brown or even recent cellar-dweller Dartmouth.
“As a player at Harvard and as a coach for 15 years, this to me looks like it's going to be one of the most competitive league races, certainly in my lifetime,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said.
Offensively, the attackmen figure to be the catalysts. Junior Devin Dwyer, a preseason third team All-American selection, led the Crimson in assists a year ago despite missing the first four games with an injury. He dished out almost three helpers per game and will again operate behind the goal as Harvard’s chief playmaker.
Many of Dwyer’s passes will likely be directed toward junior attackman Will Walker, who led the team in goals with 35 while serving as the offense’s most reliable finisher. Ian Ardrey also offers another option for the Crimson, as the junior attackman notched 13 scores mostly playing in reserve last season.
The major question marks for Harvard come at the midfield, where Peter Schwartz ’14 and Carl Zimmerman ’14 did most of the damage for Harvard in their senior campaigns. Schwartz finished second on the team in points in 2014 and Zimmerman added 15 goals to finish as the Crimson’s fourth leading scorer. Juniors Deke Burns and Sean Mahon return as the leading midfield threats, as both netted double-digit goals a year ago, but Wojcik insists that depth will be the calling card for his midfield unit.
“We feel as though we have 10 guys that we can put out in the midfield.” Wojcik said. “We have several groups who are going to play. We expect guys to step up and make winning plays.”
Outside of the deep Ivy League, Harvard has a number of opportunities to measure itself against the best in the country in non-conference play. The Crimson’s game against Albany features Lyle Thompson, the reigning Tewaararton Trophy winner and arguably the most exciting player in college lacrosse, who racked up six points against Harvard in last year’s meeting. Dates with UNC and Duke, the two-time reigning champions, also give the Crimson the chance to match up against the vaunted ACC, college lacrosse’s preeminent conference.
“We have a chip on our shoulder,” Wojcik said. “The ACC is really considered the gold standard of lacrosse, and rightfully so. We aspire to be as strong as the ACC in lacrosse. The programs within the league show commitment toward the sport, and everyone’s trying to compete on a national level.”
CORRECTION, February 20, 2015:
An earlier version of a caption to a photo accompanying this article misspelled junior Walker Kirby's name.

Last Friday night, I was trapped on a Harvard Shuttle for a total of 53 consecutive minutes. That’s just as long as many Harvard lectures. And if you thought Ec 10 lectures (the rarity that they are) were bad, you have not experienced real sorrow. Here’s a minute-by-minute recap of the night’s events:
9:35 p.m.: I board the River House C shuttle at the Quad. I’m expecting a 20-minute or so trip to Mather, maybe a bit longer if the shuttle driver has to relieve himself during the stop at Lamont.
9:41 p.m.: The shuttle stops at the corner of Garden Street and Mass Ave. A few Sigma Chi guys hop off with a 30 rack. It’s pretty quiet now. Just a few other passengers.
9:45 p.m.: The shuttle stops abruptly on Mass Ave. heading north toward Porter Square. Apparently a tiny woman has climbed on top of a snow bank to flag down the shuttle. She slides down the snow bank and hops onto the bus with us. She mumbles something to the driver and sits down.
9:52 p.m.: I’ve reached Lamont now. This would be a great place to get off if it weren’t -25 degrees. Since Mather is the next stop, I stay seated. I check Yik Yak. It’s funnier down in the Square than at the Quad. The Quad is subjected to the mediocrity of Tufts’s yak game. This is a breath of fresh air.
9:58 p.m.: No. Stop. We’re on DeWolfe Street and the shuttle isn’t slowing down. It’s passed the turn. It’s taking a left. We’re on Memorial Drive. What’s happening? Where is this driver taking me? There are only two other passengers on the shuttle with me? One is concerned, and the other is gleaming ear to ear.
10:04 p.m.: We stop in the HBS parking lot. The woman from the top of the snow bank gets off the bus. She sabotaged me. She told the driver to do this. He changed his route for her. Did she slip him a $20 when she mumbled some witchcraft to him that made him change his route? I hate her. I hate the Harvard shuttle. I have a social event to go to. And I won’t have many more opportunities this semester. I’m PRE-MED.
10:07 p.m.: We’re still stuck at HBS. I check Yik Yak again. Still funnier.
10:11 p.m.: Still there. I text my blockmate letting him know that in case of me not returning, he’s the sole heir of all my textbooks and flashcards. He sarcastically responds that he hopes I live so he doesn’t have to deal with my garbage.
10:18 p.m.: STILL THERE. I check the Harvard app on my phone to see what’s for dinner for the coming week. Swai… with a side of disappointment.
10:20 p.m.: WE ARE ROLLING AGAIN!
10:28 p.m.: I jump off the shuttle when it finally stops on JFK Street. Good riddance, and enjoy making someone else’s night miserable. See you never again (except forever and always, said the sad Quadling).

Like every other single girl on Valentine’s Day, I went to see 50 Shades of Grey with my friends to avoid the crippling sadness of being alone. You’d think seeing a movie about two people in a ‘relationship’ of any sort would make anyone’s feelings of loneliness worse, but honestly, I left that movie glad that I have no obligation to anyone and could not be less likely to be asked to sign any non-disclosure agreements or contracts. The only downside to that is no one is going to mail me first edition books or buy me a BMW.
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 25% tomatometer rating with a 50% approval rate from audiences, but do those numbers really do it justice? It made over $93 million when it opened this weekend, which has to count for something, right? Viewers have strong opinions on every detail of 50 Shades, but delving into all of the feedback may be too overwhelming. Other than the obvious (the sex scenes), there are some important aspects of the film that need to be considered if you want to go see it:
Dialogue: Honestly, who wrote this script? Every conversation is painfully awkward. Not a single character in this cinematic masterpiece has any tact or subtlety. Luckily, you’ll be able to share some laughs with everyone else in the theatre suffering secondhand embarrassment from these uncomfortable interactions.
Ana and Christian: Christian Grey is scary controlling. He won’t let Ana make plans without telling him, makes rules for every aspect of her life, and shows up in her apartment unannounced. This is actually a really hard part of the movie to deal with, and definitely could be a deal breaker in terms of interest in the movie.
Soundtrack: They had not one, but TWO Beyonce songs. I think we can all agree that the soundtrack is the real reason to go see 50 Shades.

The internet is a world of absurd claims about what Frozen is based on. If anything, I accept the recent claim that Frozen is based on the life of a woman in New Jersey. This New Jerseyan, Isabella Tanikumi, who sued Disney for $250 mil claiming that they stole her life story, offers EIGHTEEN instances where the plot of Frozen was stolen from her own life. Her most legit claims being that her autobiographies included sisters, along with instances of the older sister accidentally hurting the younger sister. Frozen also had sisters and the older sister hurt the younger one! Don’t worry Ms. Tanikumi, I gotchu.
Still, sorry Ms. Tanikumi , your claim is about to get straight rashed. I am here to tell you that Frozen is literally based on my unreal experiences with this year's blizzard in Boston. Like I have legitimate sources to prove this. Walt Disney, just last week, gave a speech admitting that while creating The Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT), “Disney created a time machine and we landed in Boston during a blizzard in 2015. We noted some interesting characters who seemed to actually be creating this blizzard, and decided to release a movie about it. We had to change some parts of the movie, of course, so that no one knew about our time machine. We changed Boston to the village of Arendelle, for example. Also, since it’s Hollywood we’re dealing with, we needed to beautify some things. Our Princess Anna was a decent-looking girl named Betty, but she was surely no Serena Van Der Woodsen, so we had to improvise” (Walt Disney 2015).*
If Walt’s message doesn’t convince you (especially because realistically I’m not just decent-looking), I am willing to offer you NINETEEN instances where the plot of Frozen intertwines with my last two weeks experiencing the many blizzards in Boston.
*I actually consider myself the Serena Van Der Woodsen of Boston. (Also in case anyone was wondering, Walt Disney didn’t actually say this and died a long time ago.)
