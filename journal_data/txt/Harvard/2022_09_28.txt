After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The position of the culinary arts within the world of creative expression is much like that of a 12-year-old in a college seminar. Our aspiring seventh grader, being the youngest person in the room, receives showers of attention, but the steely-eyed septuagenarian leading “Introduction to Sociology” treats him as an inferior. Similarly, cultural critics view the culinary arts as artistic, but not an art form in and of itself. They consider paying £255 for a meal to be ludicrous, but find coughing up $105 million for a five-hundred-year old sheet of fabric covered in egg yolk and colored powder to be a “bargain.” They complain about the most expensive restaurant in the U.S. charging $800 for a three-hour omakase experience, but voice no opinions about the going rate for first row seats at Sir Elton John’s farewell concert in Atlanta (Sept. 22, 2022): $9,729.
The debate is not about whether anybody should fork over thousands of dollars to experience art. Rather, this essay questions the arbitrary cultural bias against the culinary arts and the practice of “fine dining.” The present outcry against tasting menus is a case in point. To understand the crux of this argument, some context about the history and definition of tasting menus is necessary. From where did they originate? What distinguishes them from other forms of dining?
Although chefs have served lengthy menus highlighting signature dishes since the early 1900s, it was the French nouvelle cuisine movement of the 1970s that introduced the concept of a holistic culinary experience in which chefs dictated most, if not all gustatory decisions. Such esteemed establishments as Paul Bocuse’s “L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges” and Jean and Pierre Troisgros’ “Les Frères Troisgros” first coined the term “menu dégustation,” or “tasting menu.”
Based on the number of courses and the size of portions served, however, these early degustations did not resemble today’s tasting menus. Ferran Adrià’s “El Bulli” is the nearest culinary ancestor to the contemporary tasting menu. Beginning in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, diners at the institution were served fifty plus courses over five hours, each dish no more than several bites.
The basic unifying principle of all tasting menus is a reversal of traditional power dynamics between producer and consumer. At its core, a tasting menu format allows the culinary team to calibrate every element of the dining experience. If Grant Achatz decides to serve a Coronavirus-shaped canapé at his three Michelin-starred culinary stalwart Alinea during the height of the pandemic, every table will receive a bluish-gray half-sphere of coconut custard studded with freeze-dried raspberries. This authority is not immune to criticism. Like all artists, chefs are subject to praise and admonishment.
Critics oftentimes associate tasting menus with elitist institutions due to the prices at which they are offered. Yet, a multi-hundred dollar price tag is far from a requirement. Indeed, a growing movement of restaurateurs are offering tasting menus at the $50 to $100 range. This reduction is possible partly because providing a tasting menu actually decreases a restaurant’s expenses. Knowing the specific service menu and the exact number of reservations for a particular night informs restaurants’ supply orders. Venues that only serve a tasting menu thus reduce food waste, and, consequently, their operating costs. The savings associated with offering tasting menus often allow restaurants to provide livable wages to employees, too. For instance, at Somerville’s Juliet, minimum hourly compensation is fixed at $16, irrespective of tips and service-charge. Moreover, a raise is guaranteed after working at the restaurant for one year. In the best case scenario, owners, employees, and diners all benefit.
Still, Despite the growing movement towards more affordable tastings, profit mongering still exists at restaurants exclusively serving degustation menus. Moreover, the revenue earned by posh restaurants such as Blue Hill at Stone Barns does not necessarily lead to higher wages and better working conditions for restaurant workers. However, these are issues that plague the entire hospitality industry, not just restaurants serving tasting menus.
So, what about tasting menus in particular disgusts so many cultural commentators? The culinary freedom given to chefs and their teams.
According to Executive Director of the Food and Society policy program Corby Kummer, the leaders of the tasting menu movement are “a new army of fresh-faced Stalins” that “prepares to spread tyranny across the land.” The diner, Kummer writes, is “like a theatergoer, a passive participant in a spectacle he can either like or lump.”
By that logic, however, every concertgoer should riot at the possibility of a set program. Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony? Why not change that to Mahler’s Second for the evening? That’s treason!
In every field of expression generally recognized as an “art”— think music, drama, dance, and the visual arts — the creator’s imagination is held sacred: ars gratia artis. Yet, in gastronomy, “art for the sake of art” apparently goes by a different name: totalitarianism. Sure, patronage exists in all forms of creative expression. Nowhere else, however, does the patron determine the product like in the culinary artists. It is time to grant culinary artists the respect they deserve. Just ask the 12 year old.

“Disney’s Live-Action ‘Little Mermaid’ Casts Halle Bailey as Ariel” read Variety’s front page on July 3, 2019. These words sent waves throughout the expansive and dark waters of Twitter, conjuring up a villainous — arguably Ursula-like — tirade against the casting known as #NotMyAriel. Americans spent their Fourth of July debating whether a natural redhead must play the role of Ariel and raising questions about the hypothetical possibility of Black people realistically being mermaids. Regardless of the details, the clear outpouring of anti-Black rhetoric against Bailey revealed that many Americans want to protect their classic Disney tales and were uncomfortable with attempts to include people of color in the foundational stories of the “most magical place on Earth.”
Of course, this is not to say that this announcement was not a major win for Black girl representation. Halle Bailey is the first African American live-action Disney Princess ever, following in the footsteps of the original animated film “The Princess and the Frog” (2009) which featured actress and singer Anika Noni Rose as Princess Tiana.
Although “The Little Mermaid” presents an opportunity for impactful representation, Disney’s decision to remake white films with characters of color often fosters racism against the actors themselves. Disney must consider making original diverse content and anti-racism a priority not only through their casting but also through their production development. White audiences are sensitive to the traditions of their favorite characters, and without a holistic response from the corporation itself, actors like Bailey are left to deal with backlash by themselves.
In an interview two months after the announcement Bailey said, “I don't pay attention to the negativity; I just feel like this role is something bigger than me.” But perhaps two things can be true simultaneously. She's right –– her casting was monumental for Black women and girls — yet the burden of being a trailblazer requires unimaginable strength to carry on her own. She was only 19 at the time of her casting, with only five past acting credits.
After the release of a teaser trailer for the film in early September, it is clear that Bailey’s Ariel is of the same merit as Jodi Benson’s original 1992 performance. With red locks and angelic vocals, she represents a new kind of Ariel, one which has already impacted the young girls she represents. Compilations of Black girls’ reactions to the trailer have gone viral online as an example of the power of authenticity and media representation, countering the overwhelming 1.5 million dislikes left on the trailer before dislikes were disabled by the Walt Disney Studios YouTube channel.
It may be easy for supporters of #NotMyAriel to code their anti-Blackness as concern for authenticity, but Disney has historically changed the ethnicity of characters, just rarely from caucasian to African American. The same complaints prompted by Bailey’s casting did not apply to Elizabeth Olsen’s casting as Romani character Wanda Maximoff or Tilda Swinton’s portrayal of the Ancient One, a Tibetan character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
A part of what guarded Olsen and Swinton from heavy ridicule for their casting was not only their whiteness but also the fact that their work was more or less original content. Instead of remaking movies that audiences have already grown fond of and are eager to defend, they rewrote themselves as the first on-screen iterations of their characters and thus were able to evade the same degree of criticism Bailey faced.
Disney has made advances in the diversity of their content, but remakes with actors of color put these actors under fire and create controversy that limits the success of their projects. Representation cannot be limited to the recycling of white characters and instead should be a top down effort to create accurate, moving, and original stories about people of color, both fantastical and realistic.
Heedless of the negative feedback, ABC announced this week that Afro-Filipina singer Gabriella “H.E.R.” Wilson will play Belle in the 30th Anniversary of “Beauty and Beast” in a blended live and animated special on air this December. The public’s response has been more positive than the one to Bailey’s casting, but the project is still missing the mark on successful representation. Why can’t Wilson play an original Afro-Filipina princess and show children a multicultural narrative? Disney has placed an imaginary barrier on the kind of stories it can tell, creating repercussions not just for audiences, but for the industry itself.
Without initiatives for increased development of diverse content, the opportunity for writers and producers of color to bring their stories into the mainstream becomes increasingly limited.
Remakes may require tweaking of intellectual property but are not transformative, allowing Disney to comfortably virtue signal while maintaining the whiteness of the institution itself. Ultimately, “The Little Mermaid” is still directed by a white man and produced by primarily white executives, meaning the considerations of including Black narratives was limited to the cast only. It is time for a top-down, racially diverse, original Disney movie. Audiences will soon need a new classic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the humid and stylistically-confusing weather of summer’s end, fall has finally arrived. As the leaves turn, individuals add a new layer to their lightweight summer outfits and occasionally sift through messy drawers looking for a good long-sleeve. However, riding the highs of NYFW and an ever-quickening trend rotation, old and new trends are making their way back into the zeitgeist. So without further ado, here are some of the five fashion trends to plan for this autumn on campus and beyond.
5. Wide headbands
Although ear muffs had their moment last fall, it seems ear warmth may still be a priority. Channeling the spirit of the most stylish Disney Channel Original Movie, the Cheetah Girls (2003), anyone can rock this look with 2000s kid pride. Wide, ear-covering headbands are on the rise as a perfect complement to the Juicy tracksuit resurgence of the past two years. Cold weather is here and difficult to ignore, so we can expect to see crochet, fuzzy, and even printed versions of this head accessory this fall.
4. Bright knits and mohair
The Folklore era may be over, but knits remain a staple trend of every autumn. The popular Heavn by Marc Jacobs campaign features pop star Doja Cat and Tik Tok influencers alike in bright pinks, blues, and orange knits for their Fall 2022 collection. This popularity also applied to the Valentino PP Pink Collection which has been sported by celebrities like Zendaya, Dua Lipa, and Florence Pugh. The collection showcases monochromatic boxy and oversized blazers, knitwear, and platform shoes. As more accessible brands like ASOS and Urban Outfitters mimic these designer looks, prepare to buy a more vibrant staple sweater or cardigan.
3. Vests
Without fail, vests always weasel their way into the fall fashion trend cycle. Whether denim, leather, or knit, vests are a clever layer that can add some uniqueness to any outfit. Kendall Jenner sports this look as a signature casual and comfy choice, so anticipate an empty vest section at the thrift store as hordes of copycats make their way through the aisles. For Harvard students, a sweater vest could be the perfect multipurpose accessory: great for their first New England fall Instagram post and also a quick elevated look for interviews and meetings.
2. Cowboy™
“The Cowboy” is here to stay. For those with an eye for Western aesthetics, this might mean donning just the boots or a more simple denim-on-denim look. Chunky belts, embellished with gold and warm-toned accents, provide a sneaky hint of cowboy that will persist throughout the fall. The bravest fashion soldiers may even find a fringe jacket as the ultimate cowboy statement piece while others may simply opt to wear a flannel. Harvard students and beyond may tap into their inner Dolly Parton, Billy Ray Cyrus, or even Lil Nas X this autumn.
1. Maxi + Dr. Martens combo
There is no way to write about fashion, especially for Gen Z, without acknowledging one trend that always reigns supreme. The classic Dr. Martens boot and skirt combination transforms itself based on the season, and it's now fall’s turn to embrace this staple look. Instead of summer’s crochet, floral, and linen long skirts, expect to see leather, denim and even cargo midi and maxi skirts. Dr. Martens have already secured their place in the closet of most Tik Tok users and paired with pointelle and sheer printed socks for a delicate compliment to the bulkiness of the classic cold weather shoe. The yard has already seen the likes of Chelsea, Oxford, and platform Docs so anticipate many more of your peers stomping their way to class.

Quinta Brunson may have won the award for Best Comedy Writing at the 74th annual Primetime Emmys, but the same praises cannot be sung for the bit that involved Jimmy Kimmel laying on the ground at her feet during her acceptance speech.
The bit began with award presenter Will Arnett dragging co-presenter Jimmy Kimmel’s seemingly unconscious body onto the stage, who apparently went a bit too hard on the skinny margaritas backstage after failing to win in his Emmy category earlier in the evening.
Arnett seemed to search for the presenter card in his suit, and when he did not find it, he retrieved it from the pocket of “unconscious” Kimmel’s jacket. Arnett then led into and announced the winner of the Emmy for Best Writing in a Comedy Series: Quinta Brunson, for the pilot of “Abbott Elementary.” At this point, things were still fine: the “passed out Jimmy” bit had some solid entertainment value with the crowd, and Kimmel could now dust himself off, congratulate Brunson on her win, and retreat into the background.
An elated Brunson, herself, even lined Kimmel up for the perfect transition, speaking excitedly into the microphone: “Jimmy wake up, I won!”
But alas: He didn’t. Instead, he remained unmoving for the duration of her speech and until the category was over.
Understandably so, this sequence of events left a bad taste in the mouths of many viewers, including from Brunson's co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph. Ralph told reporters, “I didn’t know what was going on. I wish that man would just get up off the ground. Then I realized it was Jimmy Kimmel. Ooh, the disrespect, Jimmy! But that’s just me. I told him, too, to his face.”
Many noted that while the bit went on for several minutes, Brunson’s actual speech was cut short by play-off music. Furthermore, viewers also found it upsetting that a successful Black woman was forced to make space and share her spotlight with others during a moment that should have been completely dedicated to a celebration of her work as a creative.
Brunson, for her part, seemed to take the experience in stride. Backstage, she told reporters, “I don’t know. I know Jimmy Kimmel. The bit didn’t bother me. Honestly, Jimmy gave me my first big late-night spot, he was one of the first people to see Abbott Elementary. He was the first person to message me on Instagram. He was so excited it was going to be on ABC. I was happy it was Jimmy. He’s one of the comedy godfathers. Tomorrow maybe I’ll be mad at him.”
Even still, Brunson made sure to snap a photo of herself with Kimmel after the ceremony, making a point of holding her Emmy directly in front of his face.
That same week, Brunson faux-interrupted Kimmel’s monologue on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” saying “So you know how when you win an Emmy, you only have 45 seconds to do an acceptance speech, which is like not that much time… And then…you get less time because someone does a dumb comedy bit that goes on a bit too long?” To this, Kimmel jovially played along, giving Brunson the time to finish her list of thank-yous from the Monday night ceremonies.
The interview that followed also addressed the subject on a more serious note. During the sit-down portion of the show, Kimmel told Brunson, “They said that I stole your moment, and maybe I did. I’m very sorry if I did do that — I’m sorry I did do that, actually. And also, the last thing I would ever want to do is upset you because I think so much of you, and I think you know that. I hope you know that.”
Brunson replied with gratitude for his apology, but also with an assurance that she had been having too good of a time that night to even really notice.
Whether it was through the sincerity of Kimmel’s heart or the simply the good work of his PR team, the fact remains that this was a quite solid example of handling a conflict like adults: some serious efforts at accountability and communication, paired with — and nothing less should be expected from the likes of the two — a bit of humor to lighten the mood.
This being said, and given the subject matter, it is perhaps time to conclude by recentering Brunson in the narrative. With her three nominations, Brunson became the first Black woman nominated in three comedy categories in the same year, and the youngest Black woman ever nominated as an actress in comedy. Her win was also only the second time the award had been received by a Black woman. Not to mention, this was Quinta Brunson’s own first Emmy.
“Abbott Elementary” Season Two has recently begun airing on ABC on Wednesday nights at 9/8 Central, and new episodes can be viewed there or streamed on Hulu.

“To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.” - William Faulkner
My hometown of Jackson, Mississippi has been on water boil notice for two months. This isn’t the first time that Jackson residents have had a lack of access to safe, clean water — it happens fairly often in a city that has been subject to negligence and neglect for decades on end.
Jackson is one of the Blackest cities in one of the Blackest states in America, and is in the company of many Black cities across the country that have been subject to limited access to health care, limited educational resources, impoverishment, and premature death. Jackson sits in the heart of Mississippi, surrounded by wealthy predominantly-white cities and counties that seem to avoid the infrastructural problems that Jackson faces so often. And, as the capital of Mississippi, Jackson is filled with lawmakers who often fail to care about the poor quality of life that the predominately-Black residents of Jackson experience.
The water problem in Jackson began, not in August when central Mississippi was hit with historic rainfall, but earlier. In April of this year, prior to the peak of Jackson’s water and infrastructure problem, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba and other politicians asked the state legislature for additional funding for their water problems. However, the Mississippi State Legislature refused to allocate Jackson enough money to adequately fund and solve their infrastructure problems.
Thus when the rainfall and flooding started, this led to Jackson’s already-struggling water system to fail. Though it worsened this summer, Jackson’s water crisis has been brewing for years now. In 2016, a state report found lead in Jackson’s water system. And, in 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency found that Jackson’s drinking water “had the potential to host harmful bacteria or parasites.” Then, in 2021, a severe winter storm caused residents to be without water for a month.
The water problem in Jackson isn’t a partisan issue that can be chalked up to whether leadership in the city is red or blue. The problem in Jackson, Miss., is one of racial capitalism and anti-Blackness. Black populations have continuously been at the forefront of government neglect and violence. Whether it be Flint, Mich., Mount Vernon, N.Y., or Jackson, Miss., the problem is systemic and reflective of a larger history of anti-Blackness in America.
Water is politics. Access to water affects every aspect of life. Besides being unable to shower and drink water, people in Jackson don't even have enough water to fight fires and flush toilets.  Jackson is facing this issue, not due to municipal mismanagement, but because after years of white flight and segregation, Jackson became a majority Black city left behind to suffer in favor of wealthier white cities. A product of the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, and the War on Drugs, Jackson has had to fight against the rugged terrain of anti-Black governance for years now, and this has culminated in the crisis we see today.
Capitalism and anti-Blackness are the structuring modalities of a society birthed off the backs of slavery, and it is only when the legacies of anti-Blackness are addressed that Black populations are no longer treated as disposable. Treating the water crisis in Jackson as an isolated event just puts a bandaid on a bullet wound. The structural problems that Jackson faces today were years in the making–a legacy of anti-Blackness that spans the history of Mississippi and this nation. Before Jackson, there was Flint. Before Flint, there was Lowndes County Alabama, and there will only be more cities to add to the list as the years go on.
A first step to helping Jackson would be donating to Cooperation Jackson, The Mississippi Food Network, or The Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition. But on a larger, more structural level, it is our jobs as students now and as leaders in the future to fight for change in the status quo. In the years to come, we will be the next generation of writers, politicians, CEOs, and business owners. We will soon have the power to make decisions that will impact our future for the better or worse, and it is only through a concerted effort that we can fight the structures of oppression within our society and strive to create a better world for all those that live in it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 undergraduates living in Cronkhite Center, a former graduate student dormitory currently serving as overflow housing, have signed onto a petition urging administrators to serve hot food within the building’s dining hall.
This year, 11 of the 12 upperclassman houses have been forced to accommodate students in separate overflow housing. Some students who normally reside in the Radcliffe Quadrangle houses are currently living in Cronkhite Center, which is located next to the Admissions Office and roughly a 15-minute walk from their houses.
Cronkhite serves continental breakfast, bagged lunch, and Brain Break snacks. Despite living remotely, Cronkhite students are expected to eat hot food in their respective dining halls located in the Quad — an unnecessary burden, some residents say.
The petition, which has garnered 36 signatures, calls on Harvard administrators to open and fund Cronkhite Center’s own dining hall, citing inequity and harm to house culture. The petition was sent to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, and the faculty deans of the Quad houses on Sept. 6.
“This policy burdens all Cronkhite students, either because of the tight scheduling that tends to happen around lunch and dinner windows or because of chaotic events in our lives that necessitate being able to quickly grab food,” the petition reads.
“Many of us will wind up not eating—or only eating snacks—for certain meals, which disproportionately hurts those of us who are low-income and don't have the financial means to regularly eat out for $15 meals in Cambridge,” it continues.
Author Matt C. Mauriello ’24-25 wrote in the petition that the lack of in-house dining hall access has negatively impacted the mental and physical health of Cronkhite students, particularly those of first-generation, low-income backgrounds.
Matthew M. Kim ’25, who signed the petition, said the lack of dining hall access in Cronkhite is financially “unfair” to its residents.
“We found it unfair how we're paying the same board as everybody else, but everyone has access to their own d-hall,” he said.
Kim suggested the College reimburse Cronkhite residents through a stipend like Board Plus, a request also stated in the petition.
Cronkhite resident Sebastian G. Herrera ’25 said there is no “quick access” to hot meals for students living in the building. Herrera, who did not sign the petition, said he would have if he had known about the effort.
“I don't like ordering [food],” he said. “I don't like wasting money, but if it's raining, you have to go out in the rain and get your food.”
Gemma C. Rushton ‘25, who did not sign the petition, said she is sometimes forced to eat meals that are not nutritious.
“Some nights, if I work late, then I miss dinner or something, I end up just having a bagel for dinner, which is not the most balanced, super nutritious meal,” she said.
Currier House Faculty Deans Latanya Sweeney and Sylvia Barrett wrote in an email response to the petition that student concerns were “heartfelt and credible.”
The deans wrote that they are exploring possible options with the College though “decisions are beyond the house itself.”
“The time seems ripe now, at the beginning of the term before snow falls and courses get too demanding, to find a win-win sustainable solution,” the deans wrote. “Your message seems to want the same too.”
Sweeney and Barrett also offered to meet with the signatories and College and University administrators to discuss the concerns.
When asked about the student petition, Associate Dean of Students Lauren Brandt said in a Monday interview that the College views mealtime gatherings as one of the “crucial elements” of residential life.
“The hope, as I understand it, is really to encourage students to connect with their house communities and the meals that are offered in their dining halls,” she said.
Still, some Cronkhite students say the physical distance between Cronkhite and their traditional houses makes back-and-forth travel difficult.
Rushton said that adding a shuttle stop directly in front of Cronkhite would be helpful. Five Harvard shuttle routes include a stop at Radcliffe Yard, a roughly five-minute walk from Cronkhite Center.
Herrera said “Cronkhite being part of Cabot means nothing.”
“If you were to ask if I feel disconnected from Cabot, then, yeah, for sure,” he said. “Whenever there's Cabot events, I never go.”
“It's so ridiculously far,” he added.

Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Fernando M. Reimers told a Congressional subcommittee last week that Covid-19 has “exacerbated inequalities” in Latin America by reversing decades of improvements in public education.
Reimers, who leads Harvard’s Global Education Innovation Initiative, testified before a U.S. House subcommittee on Latin America. He told the committee that two principal factors affected peoples’ experience of the pandemic: social class and nationality.
“The choices that nations made — and not just nations, but what state you’re in, and so on — made a huge difference,” Reimers said in an interview.
While learning suffered across the board during the pandemic, Reimers said poorer children were affected the most.
“If you don’t learn for a year, and your family’s poor, and now you’re helping them with survival, education becomes a luxury,” he said.
The pandemic-spurred inequities were particularly stark in Latin America, where the suspension of in-person activities stretched longer than any other world region, he wrote in written testimony submitted to the subcommittee.
Reimers began studying Covid-19’s impact on education in March 2020 after speaking with a colleague at the Harvard School of Public Health and realizing the disease’s potential to become the “most serious crisis in the history of public education,” he said.
The move to virtual instruction disproportionately harmed poorer children, many of whom had had limited access to necessary technologies, he said.
“Many governments made decisions that were not really made with the poorest children in mind when they thought about how to continue to educate,” he said.
Reimers also lauded effective collaborations between governments and businesses, which he said occurred at an “unprecedented rate.”
“For a brief period, there was this sense [that] we all thought we could die,” he said. “We realized we were in this together and that there were goals bigger than ourselves — our narrow interests, the bottom line of our companies — that made it worth our while to collaborate.”
Over the past 25 years, Latin America has invested more on education as a share of government expenditure and GDP than any other region in the world. However, much of the progress was erased during the pandemic, Reimers said.
“Two decades of progress were wiped out,” he said, “but I have to emphasize it was not wiped out by the virus. They were wiped out by a combination of the virus, poor leadership, and these other vulnerabilities that compounded the impact of the pandemic.”

The total number of Title IX complaints and disclosures submitted by Harvard affiliates dropped significantly in fiscal year 2021 before returning to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal year 2022, per a University report released Tuesday.
Harvard released its annual report on sex and gender-based harassment for fiscal year 2021, along with preliminary disclosure data for fiscal year 2022. This marks the first time the University has disclosed Title IX data in roughly 18 months — a delay University Title IX Coordinator Nicole M. Merhill attributed to complications from the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the report, the total number of disclosures of potential sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct decreased significantly between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021, down to 252 from 449 in 2020. The report attributes the large decrease in disclosures to the campus-wide shift to remote learning during the pandemic.
[By the Numbers: Title IX Complaints at Harvard Since 2015]
“With so much of the Harvard community away from campus for the majority of FY21, the Title IX Office anticipated the subsequent and significant decrease in the volume of sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct disclosures shared by members of our community,” Merhill wrote in a letter included in the report.
More than half of all disclosures in fiscal year 2021 came from students, with the College’s Title IX office receiving 37 percent of all disclosures. The report identified 38 percent of potential perpetrators as students, noting that another 35 percent were faculty, staff, or postdoctorates.
Harvard also saw a decrease in the number of formal complaints in fiscal year 2021. Prior to 2021, the number of complaints to the University’s Office of Dispute Resolution stagnated at around 43. But in 2021, that number dropped to 27.
In previous years, students filed the largest proportion of complaints, while in fiscal year 2021, a plurality were filed by staff members.
Upon the University’s return to full capacity in fiscal year 2022, total disclosures to the Title IX Office rose by nearly 90 percent from fiscal year 2021, an increase of 226 disclosures. The number of formal complaints filed with ODR also increased, rising 52 percent from 27 to 41.
The report also included the demographic information of sexual misconduct cases spanning the last six years. Since fiscal year 2015, Harvard officials saw 66 complaints of unwelcome touching other than penetration and conducted 60 investigations into concerns of retaliation.
From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, 63 percent of formal complaints were filed by females against male respondents, while 13 percent were made by male complainants against female respondents.
Despite the delay in releasing data, the University continued to provide services to students and faculty members during the pandemic by hosting trainings, workshops, and presentations. According to the report, Harvard delivered 199 in-person Title IX training sessions and reached a total of 7,638 participants virtually.
Merhill also co-led a working group of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Action Collaborative from 2019 to 2021. The group published guidance on how to utilize campus climate surveys to measure the prevalence of sexual harassment within colleges.
Tuesday’s report marks the last annual report to be released by ODR in conjunction with the Title IX office, which was absorbed by the newly formed Office of Gender Equity in 2021. OGE and ODR are expected to release the full fiscal year 2022 report in February 2023.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian government of staging a set of referendums in an effort to draft thousands of Ukrainians into the Russian military while speaking at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Tuesday.
Speaking via Zoom to a packed IOP crowd, Zelensky said Russia will soon announce its annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — the four partially occupied Ukrainian regions where voting ended on Tuesday in the staged referendums.
Russian state media reported that over 96 percent of voters in each referendum supported joining the Russian Federation — but Zelesnky and other Western governments have called the elections a “sham.”
Zelensky said the “so-called” referendums and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilization of the Russian military last week represented a calculated effort by the Russian government to use Ukrainians to fight its war against Ukraine.
“They did it in preparation of annexation, with a clear aim to also muster and call up residents at those occupied territories — to force hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians of the occupied territories to be enlisted in their army,” Zelensky said through a translator.
Zelensky, who appeared in one of his trademark military-green T-shirts, was greeted with a 30-second standing ovation and a flurry of laudatory questions from audience members at the IOP.
Zelensky urged members of the crowd to take Russia seriously in its threats to use nuclear weapons.
“Even at the level of rhetoric, this already amounts to a crime,” Zelensky said. “Nuclear blackmail, annexation threats — the mere statements already earn some rigid action in response to prevent any such catastrophic scenario.”
Zelensky also discussed how the war has forced Ukrainians of all ages to become leaders.
“We’ve become leaders in war,” Zelensky said. “We were compelled to become those in our sheer attempt to withstand the evil.”
“Meanwhile, we have many Ukrainians who are demonstrating the newly discovered leadership skills every day on the front line,” he added. “We have kids collecting donations for the front line, we have kids who even simply bring water to our servicemen at checkpoints, we have wonderful health care professionals, we have nurses doing the utmost to help those wounded and maimed in the war.”
In response to a question from a Ukrainian student about how people studying abroad can use their knowledge to help rebuild Ukraine after the war, Zelensky said that the “key resource” of any nation is its people.
Ukraine will need to rebuild its infrastructure and revive its universities and other intellectual institutions, Zelesnky said.
“Given the amount of damage inflicted by Russian troops, I think there will be time and place for you, with your head, with your brains, with your education,” Zelensky said.
In an interview after the event, former Harvard Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison ’62 argued that Western universities should be opening their doors to educate and train Ukrainian and Russian students alike.
Zelensky has previously called on Western countries to ban all Russian citizens from crossing their borders — regardless of whether they support Putin.
Allison, who sat in the front row during the forum, said Zelensky’s call for a blanket ban on Russian citizens is “not sensible.”
“I’ve argued, to the contrary, that the U.S. should be recruiting super-talents out of Russia to demonstrate, as [Zelensky] said today, that ultimately, a country is the talent of its people,” Allison said.
“If the most talented people get up with their feet and walk out of a country that’s led by a leader they don’t respect, into a blind alley that they don’t want to go into, that country will be weaker in the long run,” he added.

The number of Title IX disclosures at Harvard has varied widely over the last half-decade, influenced by the #MeToo movement and Covid-19. Here's a closer look at the University's Title IX data from the last six years.
The number of Title IX disclosures at Harvard dropped significantly during the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, from 449 the previous year to 252. The number of complaints shot back up in fiscal year 2022 as campus returned to full capacity.
Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2021, 46 percent of all Title IX investigations found a policy violation.
In fiscal year 2021, during the pandemic, staff members filed a plurality of Title IX complaints at Harvard, a departure from past years.
A plurality of respondents to Title IX complaints at Harvard in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 were faculty members. From fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2019, staff members made up the plurality of respondents.
Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2021, 63 percent of Title IX complaints at Harvard were filed by a female against a male. Just 13 percent of complaints were filed by a male against a female respondent.

Sections
In the Venn diagram of Trader Joe’s lovers and Flyby readers, we are almost certain that everyone falls in the middle section. And so, in an effort to please our many fans, with ~fall~ finally in the air this past weekend, we schlepped over to the Trader Joe’s on River Street and filled our carts (and bellies) with an impressive number of dorm-friendly, new seasonal items.
That’s right — Flyby is BACK with another fall haul (yuhh that rhymed), full of fun and fresh items to try this pumpkin-spice season. We know you’re wondering which items you should definitely try (most of them!!) and which items you should just never, ever, buy (sadly there are a few), so read below for our honest takes on this year’s newest fall snacks.
We know. You don’t have to say it — you’re welcome.
Maple Almonds
These tasted exactly like Justin’s Maple Almond Butter (or does Justin’s taste like these?). Regardless, these were unexpectedly delicious — a sweet-salty, not-too-mapley snack that would go great on oatmeals or even salads if you’re really feeling yourself.
Gluten-Free Pumpkin Streusel Muffins
Sort of like a coffee cake but with a vague pumpkin spice flavor that makes you question your taste buds — in a good way. Universally appealing, you could make friends fast if you brought these around with you. We didn’t even realize it was gluten-free until we were writing this up! We’re hard-hitting journalists who noted the allergen info immediately!
Pumpkin Spiced Pumpkin Seeds
Whoaaa for all you HUDS oatmeal artists out there, we’ve got a winner. Corinne fell HARD for these ones. Like these-must-be-consumed-at-every-hour-of-the-day hard. These are truly the perfect way to “spice up” both your breakfast and your life. But, unfortunately they aren’t vegan (rip Janani) :(
Organic Pumpkin Spiced Granola Bark
Wasted potential… *audible sigh*... just wasted potential. Prior to the taste test, the possible combination of pumpkin + granola + bark made for quite a dreamy idea. However, much to our dismay, this fall-themed snack ended up tasting pretty mid. Like, it was fine… but here at Flyby, we. do. not. settle.
Greek Yogurt: Honey Crisp Apple Cinnamon
Hear us out – Quaker apple cinnamon flavored oatmeal meets HUDS vanilla yogurt. This one was a real dub. Real chunks of apple plus cinnamon galore equals the perfect creamy fall snack.
Pumpkin Rolls with Pumpkin Spiced Icing
Win. Period. The consensus was clear – these rolls offer great pumpkin vibes with their orange festive color, sneaky pumpkin filling, and top notch taste. The provided icing cements the pumpkin spice flavor, while also allowing you to channel your inner Cupcake Wars as you skillfully (not) adorn their tops. And these somehow were quite successful in a microwave, even though the instructions very clearly required a working oven. #hooray
Organic Creamy Cashew Yogurt Alternative: Pumpkin 
“First of all it’s not yogurt… it’s water.” – Janani
“Simply, why?” – Corinne
“Legally, it cannot be called yogurt, which is probably why it isn’t.” – Ellen
In summary, avoid.
Greek Nonfat Yogurt: Pumpkin
Ellen was a fan and was especially excited about the pumpkin puree taste. Corinne was not but probably because her taste buds were still fuming about the dreadful yogurt alternative (see above). But overall, an adequate pumpkin snack, folks.
Pumpkin Tortilla Chips
A solid fall option in case you’re feeling some chips and salsa (which we always are). They taste like tortilla chips with a ~suggestion~ of pumpkin, but they had real pumpkin seeds in them. Probably for show, but this really excited Ellen.
Pepita Salsa
While this salsa was super tasty and paired perfectly with the pumpkin tortilla chips, nothing about this was #fall. Points for trying, Mr. Joe, but we see right through you. Side note, these are slightly spicy to the absolute weakling (*cough* Janani) but would not be spicy to literally anyone else.
Pumpkin-Flavored JoJos with Other Natural Flavors
Pretty good pumpkin alternative to Oreos (and also vegan!). Janani is a die-hard fan; Corinne is a regular fan; Ellen was not a fan but is now a convert. Thank God. “Yummy.”
This Pumpkin Walks into a Bar Cereal Bars
These are basically just Nutrigrain bars with super cute packaging. Heads up, due to their EXTREME sweetness, we predict these cereal bars combined with a 9 a.m. would make for a terrible mid-lecture sugar crash. And they would definitely make your dentist sad.
Harvest Blend Herbal Tea
It’s giving warm hug. When you miss your dog or your mom or your 5th grade teacher, go make this tea. The chai spices are great and the absence of caffeine means you can pop off at midnight Brain Break with this one. 10/10 would recommend.
Pumpkin-filled Samosas (???)
Janani disagrees that you can call these samosas, but they do taste good. Game changing realization… you can microwave these, too.
Pumpkin Spice Coffee
If you make this, you’ll put every fall-dark academia Pinterest person out of business. It’s warm spices and coffee that make you feel cozy — what more can you ask for before your 9 a.m.?
In summary, yes. This article was just a glorified excuse to eat our way through most of Trader Joe’s newest seasonal offerings. But now we know that the microwave in Mather JCR is very good for making pumpkin rolls. And warming pumpkin samosas. And pumpkin muffins. And we also know that no matter what, there is no good reason to ever buy a pumpkin-flavored cashew yogurt alternative.
We consider this haul a success — and we really hope this experiment helps you navigate the many offerings on the Trader Joe’s shelf this fall too.
Happy pumpkin-spice season — ’til next time <3
