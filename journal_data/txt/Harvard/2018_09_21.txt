After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I thought long and hard about whether or not I wanted to begin on the journey of writing another column for The Crimson this semester. By virtue of your reading this, you know what my decision was. Yet the process of getting to a place where I felt comfortable doing this alone, without a partner to parse through ideas, write, edit, and push-back with me was not an easy one. Being publicly vulnerable is terrifying, and can reveal the ugliest parts of humanity. Not writing this semester would have felt simpler, easier, and safer. And yet, here we are.
Throughout the process of making that decision, I’d been thinking a lot about “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action”, a paper delivered by Audre Lorde in 1977. In the speech, Lorde processes her cancer diagnosis as a period of awakening and a time in which she recognizes her biggest regrets in life as the things she had left unspoken and the ideas that she never gave voice to. She asks herself, “Of what had I ever been afraid?”
As I contemplated whether or not I should write this column, I began to ask myself the same question: Why am I so averse to vulnerability? Why am I hesitant to share my ideas, terrified of speaking my truth? Why do I subject myself to silence?
My answers to these questions are reflective of the same fears that Lorde grapples with. In sections for my courses I find myself keeping my hand down and my voice quiet for the fear that I have nothing new to contribute, that what I want to say has been said before with more eloquence and power. And so, like Lorde, I subject myself to silence for fear that my words are bound to be plagiarized.
However, in “Poetry is not a Luxury”, Lorde offers up the theory that “...there are no new ideas. There are only new ways of making them felt,” and in my journey of overcoming my silences these two sentences have been the most liberating. No longer do I attempt to delude myself into thinking that my ideas are or must be revolutionary or even original — they aren’t and never will be. Every thought in my brain has been thought of before. Every sentence I have uttered is a mosaic of others’ words, theories, and perspectives. My role, then, is to serve as the glue in between fractured pieces, creating something beautiful out of many other beautiful things.
In my time at Harvard my fears have also been informed by real feelings of inadequacy; I continuously doubt my ability to speak confidently (or speak at all) about any issue, especially ones that require some form of expertise like law, sociological theory, governance, and politics. While I have managed to muster up the courage to be vocal about some of these issues, there has always been a voice in the back of my head that tells me I’m not qualified or informed enough to be asserting my opinions. For every op-ed I’ve authored and every statement I’ve made, there are twenty others that have been abandoned in a pool of self doubt, twenty other silences.
And yet, more recently I have found myself often overcoming those silences by first working to understand where they stem from. In conversation with a friend last semester, I found myself qualifying every statement I made around writing and publishing, repeating over and over again that I would have to put in a ton of work to feel comfortable enough to begin putting pen to paper. When I offhandedly said that I would need a degree in law to write about critical race theory, she finally confronted me, telling me that I needed to come to recognize that I would never feel qualified, that as women of color in America, we have been conditioned to constantly doubt ourselves, to constantly strive towards perfection, and to let those fears and doubts consume us.
Something in my head clicked, and I began to realize that the same structures that oppress and subjugate my people, the same structures I have been so vocal about fighting against, had also managed to silence me before I allowed myself to speak. I had given them victory before the fight had even begun. And as I continue to confront and attempt to conquer my silence, I must excavate and interrogate the source of my fears. I remind myself that the world has set my default at mute. In order to ensure that the words I need to give voice to are not left in the dust, I must push myself harder and further into discomfort.
That’s what I’m working on doing this year. I am allowing myself to take up space. I will give voice to the thoughts and ideas I have quieted in the face of fear. No word will be left unspoken, no passions dampened, no excitements contained. Like Lorde says: “there are so many silences to be broken.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The striped ties were what first caught my attention. Glaring ties, clearly advertising that the wearers were in a group. Then I got closer and I saw that it was not just any group. It was an improv group.
I love improvisational comedy: I always have. Immediate Gratification Players were advertising their auditions, and I was more than a little tempted. Then the kicker: “No experience required.” The guy handing out fliers had never done improv in his life until he joined IGP. Well, I thought, I only have nine years of experience under my belt. That might be a leg up.
Soon I found out that there were three improv groups on campus. All of them seemed open and fun and advertised directly to first-timers. I auditioned for all three and felt pretty good about myself. Sure, there was a lot of talented competition, but I had a lot of experience.
More than that, though, was the feeling I got during auditions. I felt like I fit in for the first time since arriving on campus. The energy was familiar. I knew how to relax into that theater vibe, how to let go of forethought and over-planning. How to be anyone I wanted to be for an hour or two.
I looked forward to my back-to-back auditions all week. I could not wait to join one of the troupes and be a part of a community. I could not wait to see the callback lists.
Three auditions, three days, no callbacks. I tried to play it down and hide my disappointment, but I was really upset. It was a flat-out rejection. It was being told that I was worse than first-timers. I had spent nine years doing improv, and now I had nothing to show for it.
I failed, and it hurt. I have to say, at this point I did not have much experience with failure. For me, and I’m sure for most students at Harvard, failure was not a common occurrence in high school. I was generally good at the things I did. I was not always the best, and there were a fair few things where I was maybe the worst (I am looking at you Junior Varsity Dance Team), but outright rejection was not something I was familiar with.
And it did not stop with improv. Soon thereafter I got my all-time lowest test score, homework and comps kept piling up, and I simply felt like I could not win.
This is the point where I am supposed to talk about the importance of failure. I should say that it leads to personal growth and builds character. The truth is I cannot say that; not yet, at least. I am too entrenched in the failure. I cannot yet look back on an ongoing experience with the benefit of hindsight.
What I can say, though, is that failure is unavoidable, in life but especially at this school. There are just too many incredible people for anyone to be the best at everything. As my roommate likes to say, “You lose some, you lose some!”
In order to cope with failure, I needed to redefine my idea of success. This environment may tell us that success means one thing. That success is a specific path you have to take. That success is being the best and always coming out on top. In reality, that is an impossible standard and can only lead to seeing every step forward as a failure. We need to define success in our own terms. It can be as simple as making friends laugh or speaking up in class. Success can be achieving small goals and making incremental progress toward new ones.
And if I cannot avoid failure, I can try to guarantee success. I have started to carve out little wins throughout the day. Go to the gym in the morning, do my laundry, finish my problem set. By setting realistic goals and achieving them, I give myself the confidence boost I need to tackle bigger tasks, tasks that may result in failure.
But failure will not stop me from trying. I will not lower my standards or settle for less. I am still going to go after the things I care about and work as hard as I can, win or lose. However, I will not say that consistently losing is something I am okay with. It’s hard. So, I need to break up the big failures with little wins. Eventually, I will score big. Maybe soon I will be writing another article about how failure built my character, led me to success, and can do the same thing for you. In the meantime, I will keep learning, keep failing, and keep on celebrating the small victories. That is the best I can do for now, and I am okay with that. Sometimes things won’t go my way, but I can always stay positive and improvise a new solution. With this kind of improv practice, maybe my auditions will go better next semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following last year’s announcement that the Hasty Pudding Theatricals would begin allowing women to audition for its cast, six women have been accepted into the famous acting troupe — achieving gender parity.
While the Hasty Pudding’s decision to admit women is positive, finally allowing women into an organization over 40 years after Harvard went co-ed is a decision that is long overdue. The Hasty Pudding has cleared a very low bar in doing so. While we applaud this step, we are not offering a standing ovation.
It must be noted that this change does not comes without much external pressure — and especially the advocacy efforts of women who refused to stay backstage any longer. From the women who boldly auditioned for the cast despite an enforced “no girls allowed” policy, to Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Mila Kunis criticizing the all-male cast, we are struck by their tenacity and determination. Many of these women have since left Harvard’s campus, never to see their own name on a Pudding cast list. They have made this moment possible.
Furthermore, we hold enormous respect for the six women who have chosen to break years of tradition by joining the cast. We hope and believe that the Hasty Pudding selected these women solely based on their credentials; it would be saddening if their presence onstage to be seen as mere tokenism. Their inclusion in the Hasty Pudding should be a testament to the overwhelming degree of talent and artistic skill present in Harvard women.
Around the same time as the Hasty Pudding’s announcement of its cast, the Din & Tonics also announced that they accepted their first female member. Much of our arguments above are applicable to this case — in particular, our belief that this member was admitted on her own merits. However, we find all-male singing groups less fundamentally problematic than an all-male performance that borrows heavily from exaggerated femininity. The Dins have not employed such tropes in their performances, and we commend them on their decision without reservation.
In its drag show, the Hasty Pudding performed a stereotypical vision of womanhood — sexualized dress, high pitched voices, heavy makeup — without giving female-identifying students a voice of their own. A show designed to play with gender that also discriminates on the basis of gender is unavoidably damaging.
As the Hasty Pudding moves into a more gender-inclusive era, its community members should ensure that its current female actors feel fully welcomed on and off stage. Moreover, we believe that the Hasty Pudding has more reflection to do. Drag was established as a space to celebrate queerness and communities of color. Students of these backgrounds should be given the opportunity to play a starring role.

For the first time in three years, Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics,” has ceded its spot as the College’s most sought-after fall class to long-time competitor Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” and dark horse Culture and Belief 22: “The Ancient Greek Hero: Mythology and Facing Death.”
Ec10a, the introductory course to the Economics concentration and a prerequisite for most economics classes, dropped to third place behind CS50 — the second most popular course for the past three fall semesters — and CB22, which surged to second place after its enrollment more than doubled from last year.
CS50 led course enrollment numbers with 724 undergraduates, according to data released by the registrar’s office of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Thursday — well ahead of the 631 and 582 undergraduates in CB22 and EC10a, respectively. Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” and Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” — which regularly make the top five most popular fall courses among undergraduates — rounded off the list with 505 and 425 students, respectively.
Of these five courses, only CS50 and Stat 110 have significant non-undergraduate enrollment. The total enrollment in CS50, including 51 cross-registered students, is 796.
Comparative Literature Professor Gregory Nagy, who teaches CB 22, said the course’s enrollment hovered around 100 students until two years ago. He said he thinks the course’s addition of a subtitle, “Mythology and Facing Death,” two years ago may be responsible for the rapid increase.
“I’ve always thought that the reason people should learn about ancient Greek heroes is that it teaches us so much about how to live and how death is part of how we live,” Nagy said. “So who knows, maybe it’s the subtitle that has caught the attention of people. We started it last year, and that’s when we had one big jump, and now we’ve had a bigger jump.”
Additionally, CB22 counts for a General Education requirement and 65 percent of fall 2017 students who responded to the course evaluation survey, known as the “Q Guide” — a database where students assess courses and professors — reported that they spent less than three hours working on the class per week.
Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who has taught Ec10a since 2005, said the course provides an “important foundation” for informed citizenship.
“So many issues that you read about in the news require an understanding of economics to even begin to understand what the right policy is,” Mankiw said.
When Mankiw learned his course had ceded the top spot, however, he said he wasn’t too concerned.
“One thing we teach in economics is that competition is good,” he said.
Several long-standing courses have had to modify their meeting times and curricula this year to accommodate the new course schedule, which extends the length of many courses from 60 to 75 minutes and eliminates “Harvard Time” — a College quirk under which professors began class seven minutes after the official start time.
Computer Science Professor David J. Malan ’99, who teaches CS50, wrote in an email that the teaching staff adjusted the course’s schedule last year in preparation for the new changes.
“Last year, we met weekly for lectures on Fridays, 10am–12pm; this year, we officially meet on Fridays, 9am–11:45am, which is longer, though we won’t always use the entire block,” Malan wrote.
“On days we wrap early, we’ll reserve time at the end for optional discussion and Q&A,” he added.
Nagy said that, thanks to the new course schedule, he extended his class to 75 minutes and was able to add “Songs of Sappho” to CB22, as part of his personal interest in female heroes.
“I’ve been going around saying for a long time that the creativity that goes into, especially, the ‘Iliad’ is not predominantly male. There’s a lot of female art that goes into it,” Nagy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s first Latinx Convocation will be held this weekend on Sunday, Sept. 23 at 4 p.m. in Memorial Church to recognize the Latinx students of the Class of 2022.
The event will feature speakers and will be open to all students, their families, and faculty. Students from Latinx organizations Fuerza Latina and Concilio Latino worked together to plan the ceremony.
Cecilia A. J. Nuñez ’20, vice president of Fuerza Latina and one of the event organizers, said the event was inspired by last year’s inaugural Black Convocation ceremony, which she said signaled a move on campus to embrace diversity.
“We were definitely inspired by all the work the black community did by making convocation a part of their community, and it was something we thought would be useful for our community,” she said.
The event — themed “Mis Raices, Mi Communidad,” which translates to “My Roots, My Community” — has garnered a lot of attention from Harvard students, according to Nuñez.
“There are over 200 RSVPs so far, half of which are freshmen. Faculty and alumni will be coming out too,” Nuñez said. “I have been working with Concilio to plan it, and we have been working together to plan it since June.”
Among Sunday’s speakers will be Elizabeth Solomon, assistant director of academic affairs and fellowship programs at the Harvard School of Public Health and a member of the Massachusetts Tribe at Ponkapoag. She will speak about the history of the land on which Harvard stands.
Several students said the event is important for reflecting and celebrating the diversity of Harvard’s student body. Andrew Castillo ’21, who has Mexican heritage from both parents, said “I think it’s super cool we are having this. It's a step in the right direction in terms of honoring the diversity of the school.”
Daniela D. M. Villafuerte ’21 said she thought the event was important for letting incoming students know about the cultural communities present on campus.
“I'm happy the freshmen get to experience this, something I didn't,” she said. “Coming here to Harvard and seeing a Black Convocation, and no Latinx one, or anything related to my culture, gave the message there isn't a big community here.”
Diego Navarrete ’21, who has been involved in the planning of the ceremony, said the amount of work that has gone into the event is indicative of the strong relationships between Latinx students leaders on campus.
“Essentially, moving forward, Harvard has to be conscious of the immense student labor that is being used to put on such projects like Latinx and Black convocation,” Navarrete said.
He also said showcasing and celebrating student diversity is especially important right now in light of the ongoing lawsuit Harvard is facing over its race-conscious admissions policy, which the plaintiffs charge discriminates against Asian-Americans. Experts say the future of affirmative action in the United States probably hangs in the balance.
Nuñez emphasized that while the event is focused on Latinx students, families, and affiliates, all are welcome to attend.

The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research awarded the W.E.B. Du Bois medal Thursday to eight recipients, including football player and activist Colin Kaepernick and comedian Dave Chappelle.
The medal — the University’s highest honor in the field of African and African American studies — recognizes individuals who have made “significant contributions” to African and African American culture.
“The medal honors those who have made significant contributions to African and African American history and culture, and more broadly, individuals who advocate for intercultural understanding and human rights in an increasingly global and interconnected world,” according to a press release.
Kaepernick first made national headlines for his activism in 2016, when he chose to kneel during the national anthem at NFL games in protest of racial injustice in the United States. He has since received Amnesty International’s 2018 Ambassador of Conscience award and recently launched a widespread advertisement campaign with Nike.
Artist Kehinde Wiley, known for his portraits of people of color, including President Barack Obama, received a Du Bois medal this year as well. Kenneth I. Chenault, a corporate executive who also serves on many philanthropic boards, is another recipient. Chenault is a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body.
Chappelle, best known for his comedy show “Chapelle’s Show,” will also receive the award. Chapelle has produced and acted in numerous films, and he has received numerous awards for his work including two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Grammy Award.
Among the other four medal recipients are Shirley Ann Jackson — a nuclear physicist and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute president — philanthropist Pamela J. Joyner, author Florence C. Ladd, and Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative.
The recipients will be recognized at an awards ceremony to take place on Oct. 11 in Sanders Theatre.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of the Hutchins Center and University Professor, said this year’s recipients exemplify the values of Du Bois, a pre-eminent African American scholar and civil rights activist who graduated from the College in 1890 and became the first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895.
“Emerging from a variety of backgrounds and professions, each represents the quest for knowledge, freedom of expression, and pursuit of truth that are foundational to black history and culture, and that were foundational to Du Bois as a thinker and activist,” Gates said.
Harvard first presented the Du Bois Medal in 2000, and past winners include Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou, Muhammad Ali, Steven Spielberg, and Chinua Achebe. Last year, Harvard honored rapper LL Cool J and filmmaker Ava DuVernay with the medal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated: Sept. 23, 5:22 p.m.
Some Harvard Law School students are urging the school to bar Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from returning to campus to teach this winter unless “a full and fair investigation” is conducted into allegations of sexual assault brought against him by a California professor.
Kavanaugh, who currently serves as a lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, is slated to teach a course titled “The Supreme Court since 2005” during the winter 2019 term. He skyrocketed to national name recognition over the summer after President Donald Trump nominated the long-time U.S. Court of Appeals judge and D.C.-area resident to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy.
Kavanaugh’s confirmation seemed all but certain until Palo Alto-based psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford sent a private letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party held over three decades ago, when both were in high school. Over the next few weeks, details of the letter leaked in the national press, eventually spurring Ford to put her name to the allegations in an interview with the Washington Post.
Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh — “stumbling drunk” at the time — pinned her to a bed, attempted to remove her clothes, and covered her mouth when she tried to scream to alert others to her plight. She said she was able to escape before anything else occurred. Ford has indicated via her lawyers that she is willing to testify regarding her accusations before the Senate next week, though she hopes the FBI will open an investigation into Kavanaugh first.
Kavanaugh, who has vehemently and repeatedly denied Ford’s accusations, has promised he will testify about the incident in a high-stakes hearing on Monday.
Four Law School students — Molly M.E Coleman, Yaacov “Jake” Meiseles, Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount, and Sejal Singh — demanded the University prevent Kavanaugh from teaching in Cambridge in an opinion piece published in the Harvard Law Record Thursday.
The students wrote that they want to know whether the Law School will “take seriously the credible allegation of Kavanaugh’s sexual assault against a young woman before he is allowed to continue teaching young women.” The piece also notes that Kavanaugh was paid “$27,490 for 9 days of teaching” in 2017.
Law School spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.
Kavanaugh first started teaching at the Law School about a decade ago when he was hired by then-Dean Elena Kagan, who now sits on the Supreme Court. From 2008 to 2015, Kavanaugh taught a class on the separation of powers. Since 2014, he has taught a course on the modern Supreme Court — the same class he is supposed to teach this winter.
Kavanaugh’s course is supposed to take place during the Law School’s winter term, a special three-week session of classes held in January. Every J.D. student is required to complete three winter terms before graduation.
The Law Record article links to a copy of Kavanaugh’s 2017 financial disclosure report published by the Center for Responsive Politics. Kavanaugh recorded the $27,490 figure under the “Non-Investment Income” section. The salary from Harvard Law School was Kavanaugh’s only reported income on the form.
The students further criticized the Law School’s failure to respond publicly to Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh.
“The administration diminishes women’s access to education when they fail to address allegations of abuse,” the students wrote.
The four authors of the piece are all members of the Pipeline Parity Project, a student advocacy group that aims to end harassment and discrimination in the legal field.
In an email, Coleman wrote that the opinion piece “came from the organizing efforts of the Pipeline Parity Project.” She wrote the group will wait until after the hearings next week before pursuing further activism around the issue — including possible discussions with Law School administrators.
“We're waiting to see how the next week plays out, especially in regards to steps taken (or not taken) by the Senate before we decide on where we go from here,” Coleman wrote.
Pipeline Parity has already plotted out ways to stand with Ford. The group plans to distribute buttons reading “I Believe Christine Blasey Ford” around campus over the weekend — buttons that mirror those worn by supporters of Anita Hill when she testified in 1991 hearings regarding her allegations that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her.
Members of Pipeline Parity had originally planned to host an all-day viewing of Monday’s confirmation hearing in Lewis Hall — but that watch party is now “up in the air,” Coleman wrote.
“[W]e’re following the Judiciary Committee’s actions, and will adjust our plans accordingly,” she wrote.
This is not the first time Law School students have waded into the national debate over Kavanaugh’s candidacy.
Over the summer, students at the school circulated at least two letters — one praising Kavanaugh’s character and one opposing his nomination. Kavanaugh’s former students authored the first letter, in which they dubbed the nominee “a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and a gracious person.”
The second letter, by contrast, stated that “many members of the Harvard community staunchly oppose [Kavanaugh’s] nomination to the most powerful bench in the country.”
At the time, Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 congratulated Kavanaugh on his nomination in a statement posted on the Law School’s website.
“An inspiring teacher and mentor, Judge Kavanaugh has somehow always found extra time for his students, whether to dig deeper into important legal questions or to offer valuable career advice,” Manning said in the statement. “Let me take this occasion to thank Judge Kavanaugh for the generosity, dedication, and collegiality he has shown our community.”
Manning has not commented publicly on Kavanaugh since Ford’s allegations surfaced last week.
Correction: Sept. 23, 2018
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount.

Harvard Management Company has sold $950 million in warehouse properties to private equity firm Blackstone Group ahead of HMC’s yearly returns announcement, Bloomberg reported Thursday.
Harvard acquired the properties jointly with MDH Partners, a real estate development company that has worked with Blackstone in the past, according to Real Estate Alert. MDH has spent more than $500 million acquiring 80 properties since 2014, according to Real Capital Analytics.
The warehouse portfolio spans 14 million square feet, Bloomberg reported. Many of the warehouses are last-mile warehouses, which are small industrial buildings often near urban locations that help facilitate expedited delivery to customers who purchase goods from companies like Amazon online.
HMC sold a majority stake in a collection of New York City properties for nearly $244 million to Blackstone earlier this year. The endowment's CEO, N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, oversaw the outsourcing of the Harvard’s real estate management team to Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital last year.
In a letter to Harvard affiliates in Jan. 2017 announcing the spinoff, Narvekar praised the group's real estate holdings.
"The real estate portfolio has been a key driver of returns for HMC since the direct platform was established in 2010, and the team will continue to be a valuable partner to HMC moving forward,” he wrote.
Narvekar’s recent decisions to sell real estate mark a shift away from how experts envisioned his strategy. His experience in alternative assets — including private equity, hedge funds, and real estate — characterized much of his career prior to joining Harvard.
Last year, HMC posted the lowest returns in the Ivy League.

Updated: Sept. 23, 5:15 p.m.
The Harvard Kennedy School closed out its capital campaign at more than $700 million — surpassing the school’s original goal by $200 million — according to an August email sent to HKS affiliates by Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf.
The Kennedy School raised approximately $721 million in the campaign as of June 2018. The University-wide capital campaign began in 2013 and ended in June 2018—raising a record-breaking $9.6 billion, the highest amount ever raised by a single institute of higher education.
In an interview on Wednesday, Elmendorf said the money raised was not only to finance the Kennedy School but to also “support making a better world.”
"A lot of people at the Kennedy School on the staff and the faculty worked very hard to make a case to prospective donors that we would put their money to good use to advance the goals that we and they share of improving public policy and public leadership across the country and around the world, so that people can lead better lives,” Elmendorf said.
As of February 2018, the Kennedy School had raised more than $660 million. The school had surpassed its goal of $500 million by March 2017, collecting roughly $580 million by that point.
Approximately 18 percent of the money — $130 million — will go to student financial aid. In all, 40 new fellowships have already been added with funds raised from the capital campaign.
Elmendorf said former Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, who was the dean at the start of the campaign, made expanding financial aid “one of his top priorities.”
“We feel so fortunate and so grateful that we were able to raise as much money for financial aid, and we are putting it to use,” Elmendorf said.
Campus renovations were another top priority for the campaign. In total, $108 million in funding went into the $126 million campus transformation project that began in 2015. The project added more than 90,000 square feet of new classrooms, common spaces, and an outdoor courtyard.
Despite the significant amount of money raised by the school, Elmendorf warned in his email that Kennedy School affiliates “should not be sanguine about the financial outlook.”
“Asset returns in the coming years probably will be lower than in the past, which will constrain the payout from the endowment, and tuition (at the Kennedy School and across higher education) has outpaced many people’s incomes in recent years, which means that we need to keep future increases in check,” Elmendorf wrote.
In the Wednesday interview, Elmendorf said although HKS “is in a very solid position financially,” school affiliates should understand future financial limitations.
“I think when people see such large numbers, one can get the impression that everything we would want can now be done, but we're a large organization,” Elmendorf said. “Even a campaign as successful as ours does not let us do everything, and so part of what I wanted to do was to explain why we could be both very successful at the campaign and very grateful for people's generosity, and yet not able to accomplish everything we want to accomplish.”
The end of the campaign comes at a time when Harvard enters its first year with an endowment tax Republicans passed in Dec. 2017, which former University President Drew G. Faust said would limit Harvard’s ability to fund financial aid, research, public programs, and other endeavors around campus.
Elmendorf said new University President Lawrence S. Bacow is aware of the financial situation at the Kennedy School.
“I see Larry Bacow regularly as other deans do, and Larry is well-appraised of what's happening at the Kennedy School,” Elmendorf said. “I am very grateful for his support for the Kennedy School. I'm delighted that he is our new President."
Correction: Sept. 23, 2018
Due to incorrect information provided by Harvard, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated the amount of money the Kennedy School's capital campaign raised as of June 2018. The correct figure is $721 million, not $705 million. The amount of money that will go to financial aid ($130, not $126 million) and the amount of money that went toward the campus transformation project ($108 million, not $109 million) were also misstated. This article also previsouly included a graphic depicting the incorrect figures. 
Editor's Note: 
A Harvard spokesperson provided The Crimson with a copy of the HKS magazine, which included some incorrect capital campaign figures, causing the paper to publish an incorrect article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-four students were elected to the Undergraduate Council in a relatively high turnout election, the UC Election Commission announced Thursday evening.
In total, 1,885 students voted in this year's election, held Monday through Thursday. This figure includes 881 freshman students, an uptick from totals in the past two years. In 2017, 1,454 students cast ballots, while 1,820 undergraduates voted in 2016.
Freshmen traditionally vote at higher rates than do their upperclassman counterparts. That trend continued this year. More than 50 percent of freshmen — representing roughly 900 individuals — cast ballots to decide which UC representatives would represent them. As usual, Harvard's sophomores, juniors, and seniors were less engaged. Voter turnout in some houses reached relatively high levels compared to previous years: five separate Houses saw votes from more than 100 students.
Seventy-eight students ran in this week’s election, 36 of whom were freshmen. Both of those figures are lower compared to last year, when more than 100 students — including 60 freshmen — ran for the Council.
The makeup of the new Council will be vastly different from last semester, given nearly half of the representatives elected in the spring refused to run for re-election, resigned over the past few months, or lost in this week’s election. In addition, six former representatives graduated in May.
The finance committee will have to replenish its ranks in the next few weeks, after most of the committee — including its chair, Henry S. Atkins ’20 — decided not to return to the Council.
This week’s UC election was the first to use the Borda count system, a ranked-choice voting method the Council adopted after some members argued it would simplify the election process. The UC voted in early September to abandon the Hare-Clark method, also a ranked-choice system, which representatives said was difficult to explain to voters and made it difficult to tally results quickly.
Multiple races in this week’s elections were quite close, and it is unclear whether the results might have looked different under the old method. In Quincy House, Sung Kwang Oh ’21 defeated Mason G. Meyer ’20 by just over 0.15 points — 18.66 for Oh to 18.50 for Meyer — while in Cabot House, Tauheed Z. Islam ’20 eked out a victory over Karina Dubrovskaya ’21 by less than 0.50 points.
The new Council will convene for its first meeting of the term on Sept. 30. Its presidential election will follow in mid-November.
UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 — who ran on an ambitious platform that included 39 policy planks — will have significant work to do in order to implement all of their goals by the time they leave office at the end of 2018. According to the Council’s website, the duo has fulfilled roughly 56 percent of its promises.
The full list of newly elected representatives is as follows:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With live music, free food, and speeches from a litany of Harvard administrators and donors, the newly-renovated Smith Campus Center was ceremonially inaugurated Thursday evening, the culmination of a planning and building process that spanned the terms of multiple Harvard presidents.
The 10-story facade, replete with study areas, restaurants, and meeting rooms, is located on Massachusetts Avenue just outside the gates of Harvard Yard.
“This is a dream come true,” said former University President Drew G. Faust, who helped oversee the project during her 11-year tenure, which ended in July.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow echoed Faust’s sentiments, calling the center a “welcoming front door” to Harvard.
“This is what this space should be like,” he said. “This is the heart of our campus.”
Richard A. Smith ’64 and his late wife Susan F. Smith donated an undisclosed amount to the University to finance the renovations. Speaking at Thursday’s event, he said the eponymous campus center reflected the “One Harvard” initiative that comprised a staple of Faust’s presidency.
“‘One Harvard’ meant no more dividing the social experience and the learning experience of conviviality and conversation and working with and alongside students,” Smith said. “It was all dispersed.”
“It was done in the Houses and in the graduate schools,” he added. “Believe it or not, Harvard University — as the leading university in the world, and I don’t think there’s too much of a contest for that designation — didn’t have a central campus facility.”
Multiple students at the Thursday event praised the Center’s renovations. Illan E.R. Freudman ’22 said the numerous study spaces throughout the renovated building would provide a much “nicer” place to meet fellow students to work or relax.
Justin Y. C. Wong ’22 said he particularly liked the new 10th floor area, replete with lounges and a game room, as well as the numerous restaurants throughout the building.
“Most of the rest of the school is kind of decentralized,” he said. “But this is a good place to be and hang out with people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both Harvard tennis teams got off to promising starts to their seasons this past weekend, earning victories against conference and out-of-conference rivals. The men’s team submitted a strong performance at the Chowder Fest tournament, winning singles and doubles matches against Old Dominion, Indiana, and Texas Tech. The women’s team traveled to the Dartmouth and Columbia Invitationals, finishing with winning records at both and going nearly undefeated at Columbia.
For the men’s team, the 2018-19 season is one with some uncertainty, in large part due to the departure of head coach Dave Fish at the end of last season after he spent 42 years with the team and amassed 21 Ivy League titles. Taking Mead’s place as the new head coach is Andrew Rueb ’95, who most recently served as the assistant coach under Fish. As a player at Harvard, Rueb won Ivy League Player of the Year twice and captained the team in his final season.
However, the team has plenty to build off from last year, especially under senior captain Andy Zhou, who came into the weekend ranked No. 112 in the ITA Preseason Singles Rankings.
Zhou showcased his abilities at Chowder Fest, sweeping opponents from Old Dominion, Indiana, and Texas Tech 3-0 in singles Flight 2. Freshman Brian Shi and junior Logan Weber also impressed in their doubles debut together, going undefeated on the weekend, including an impressive 7-6 tiebreaker over Texas Tech’s duo of Parker Wynn and Bjorn Thompson. Other notable Harvard performers included senior Andrew Ball and freshman Harris Walker, both of whom went 2-1 in singles.
The women’s team sent squads to Columbia and Dartmouth to open the season. At Columbia, Harvard won five singles matches and four doubles contests. The Crimson certainly has plenty of future potential in its younger ranks, as freshmen Rachel Lim and Chelsea Williams both put forth stellar debuts. Williams, who came into Harvard as a five-star recruit, won a three-set match over Mika Genkova from St. John’s University. Lim won both two matches in her singles draw before teaming up with fellow freshman Annika Bassey to split a pair of doubles matches. Williams was paired with Clemence Krug of LIU-Brooklyn to defeat a Hofstra duo, 8-1.
The tournament at Dartmouth was a particularly strong one for the Crimson, as Harvard’s team prevailed in all six matches on the first day before losing just two matches the rest of the way. The Crimson also swept the Big Green in doubles play, winning four out of four matches. Perhaps most impressive was freshman Rachel Eason, who went undefeated on the weekend, defeating Dartmouth’s Allison Chuang, 6-0, 6-2 and Madison Hwang, 6-1, 6-2. She also worked with junior Natasha Gonzalez to defeat Dartmouth’s duos of Jasmini Abidi and Chuyang Guan and Nina Paripovic and Nicole Conrad, 8-4 and 8-3, respectively.
Both teams have tough schedules ahead of them — the men’s team will be at home for the Ivy Plus tournament against Princeton and Yale this weekend, the women’s team off to California for the Oracle ITA Masters — but if this opening weekend was any indication, Crimson tennis is poised to see a great deal of success on both the women’s and men’s sides during the 2018-2019 season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ivy League play commences on Friday evening and Harvard and Brown have first dibs on game action. This year’s rendition of the century-long rivalry will showcase the 118th meeting between the Bears and the Crimson in Providence, R.I., at 7 p.m. under the temporary floodlights installed at Brown Stadium exclusively for this contest.
While this exact match up story has been told over and over again, the coverage is anything but typical as the game will be televised live on ESPNU and ESPN+, drawing into the viewership a national audience.
“It’s going to be awesome,” captain Zach Miller said. “We rarely get night games, we rarely get Friday night games, so for us to be able to go out there this Friday and play on ESPNU I think it’s going to be a ton of fun.”
In past renderings of this perennial match, Harvard (1-0) has dominated. The series record stands at 85-30-2 and the Crimson has topped the Bears (0-1) in the last seven meetings between the two teams. Last season, Harvard took the contest in a cool, 45-28 victory under the September sun.
Brown will arrive Friday night on the tail end of a 2-8 overall and 0-7 Ancient Eight record in the 2017 season, placing it in last place in the division. The first game of the 2018 season didn’t seem to indicate any hint of a reversal in that trend. In the team’s first trip across the Mississippi River in a century, it was succinctly downed by 44-15 by Cal Poly.
In comparison, the Crimson saunters into Friday’s contest down two running backs, but up a game. Senior and 2017 All-Ivy back Charlie Booker III and classmate Semar Smith were noticeably absent from Harvard’s starting lineup last weekend, but sophomore Aaron Shampklin pounded any doubt of his competence from onlookers’ minds.
Shampklin danced his way into the endzone on four separate occasions, accumulating 178 yards on 15 attempts in his season opener. A Crimson running back hadn’t tallied four touchdowns in a single game since Oct. 4, 2014. The effort earned the sophomore Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week Honors.
Also in the backfield will stand sophomore quarterback Jake Smith. Despite the turbulence he experience in the backfield as a freshman — switching starts with then redshirt senior Joe Viviano — Smith was the first freshman quarterback to earn a spot on the starting squad since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05. The sophomore seemed to be in complete command of the offense on Saturday against San Diego. Smith toss the pigskin 195 yards, 127 of which came when the ball landed in the hands of senior wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley.
Clearing the path for Shampklin and holding the front for Smith, Harvard’s offensive line stays true to the what has become a staple of the Crimson brand — they’re quite large. The homogenous crew of five big men are led by senior center Ben Shoults. In addition to Harvard’s 266 yards on the ground, the offensive line let only one man get to the quarterback all game.
“When our front five on the offensive side of the ball completely dominate the other team, that’s amazing,” Miller said. “San Diego’s not a bad team. They’re a really established program, they’ve been doing a lot of great things and their front guys are very respected in the FCS and for our front guys — our offensive line, our defensive line — to come out there and have a showing like that, that’s incredible.”
The line will have its work cut out for it Friday as the unit faces off against the Bears’ junior tri-captain Michael Hoecht. The 6 foot 4 inch, 310 pound defensive end found the ball carrier 14 times last week in Brown’s defensive disaster.
“[He’s] absolutely one of the top players in the Ivy League,” coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s a beast. You think he’s a senior…[I] thought he was a senior last year, he was a sophomore last year.”
Hoecht isn’t the only threat. On the inside, senior defensive tackle Daryle Banfield returns into the fray after an 18-tackle 2017 season. Last week alone, the 6 foot 3 inch, 300 pound senior drove Cal Poly players to the dirt eight times.
“I think they have a great [defense], they have a lot of returning starters,” Shoults said. “I know that their nose guard is back… he’s a great player. They always play hard, especially when they’re at home and they always want to get after us. So they’re going to have a great team and we’re going to have a great challenge ahead of us.”
With only one week of film, the Crimson enters this matchup with less knowledge of who it's playing than last week, when the team had two weeks of 2018 film to draw upon. To exacerbate this, the Bears have changed their defense. To exacerbate it further, Brown played a triple option team last week.
“For the first time in 20 years they’ve changed defenses,” Murphy said. “They have been doing very well with the same coaching staff for a lot of years and they’ve gone from a four down team to a three down team. It’s hard to tell versus a triple option team because everything is just so different. It’s 95 percent run and a very different type of run than what you’re going to get from us.”
Last week, Shelton-Mosley was kept mostly silent on punt and kick returns as San Diego kicked either short or out of bounds. This week, he faces perhaps the best punter in the Ancient Eight, Bears’ senior Ryan Kopec. In 2017, Kopec placed five kicks inside Harvard’s 20-yard line and did not overshoot for a touchback even once. In one instance, he booted the ball 69 yards to the Crimson two. He also landed punts on the Harvard nine, eight, nine again and four-yard lines.
Against Cal Poly, Brown relied mostly on the pass game in the debut of sophomore quarterback Michael McGovern. Throughout the matchup, the second year threw 50 passes, finding the hands of his wideouts exactly half of the time for 312 yards.
“They’ve got their fair share of new faces too so we don’t have a great feel — with the small sample size we have — for their personnel or their scheme,” Murphy said.
Noticeably absent — at least for the Crimson coaches, players and sports writers — from the Bears’ 2018 roster is second-string gunslinger T.J. Linta. Prior to subbing in Linta in last season’s third quarter, Brown had scored two points. In the span of 18 minutes, Linta threw for 253 yards and three touchdowns. The quarterback has since graduated and is the starting play caller for the Wagner Seahawks in his fifth year of eligibility as a grad student transfer.
Friday night’s game under the lights will be the first time the Crimson has played in such circumstances since last season’s 52-17 loss to Princeton at Harvard Stadium. In addition, the Bears have a grass field as opposed to the turf one in Cambridge. It was in the Yale Bowl that the Crimson last played on grass.

As Harvard students, we’re lucky enough to live just few T stops away from the incredible city of Boston. As great as that is, it’s all too common to get stuck in the “Harvard Bubble” and go about your days (and years!) without ever leaving the Square. However, if you’re looking to see something other than the Smith Campus Center this weekend, there’s plenty to do if you’re willing to burst the bubble.
Friday:
College Night @ The Museum of Science
Admission to the Museum of Science in Boston is usually $28, but this Friday from 5-9 p.m., the museum is holding “College Night” where you can get in free with your HUID! There will be live animal shows, Boston Duck Tours, and something called the Theater of Electricity, among other exhibits, so it’s sure to be a fun time. Gather some blockmates or entrywaymates and take advantage of this night at the museum!
Saturday:
Fluff the 13th @ Davis Square
Every town likes to celebrate its great inventors and their inventions, and lucky for us, Somerville was once home to Archibald Query (what a name), the inventor of Fluff (a.k.a. marshmallow cream). Every year, Somerville pays tribute to him with a Fluff-themed festival, which involves more marshmallow fluff than most people have ever encountered in their lives. If this sounds like your scene, head to Davis Square this Saturday from 3-7 p.m, and you might never think of Fluff in the same way again.
Sunday:
Dumpling Festival @ Central Flea Market
This event is in Cambridge so is it really bursting the bubble? Idk, but dumplings are great, and it’s even within walking distance. This Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., 15 different restaurants and food trucks will be serving up dumplings of all types to hungry market-goers. This event is hosted at the weekly Central Square Flea Market, so in addition to the dumplings there will be over 90 vendors selling just about everything handmade and/or vintage that you can imagine.
We hate to burst your bubble, but Harvard is not the entire world. So go forth and burst the Harvard bubble with these events!
