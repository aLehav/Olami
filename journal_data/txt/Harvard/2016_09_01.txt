After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m sitting in a classroom, surrounded by my peers, but I can’t speak. There’s a pit of uncertainty pooling deep within my stomach, growing larger with every expectant glance from my Teaching Fellow, and I can’t help but feel inferior.
It’s just another day in my Ethical Reasoning Gen Ed, where my peers effortlessly pronounce the French names of philosophers and politicians long gone. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Maximilien Robespierre roll smoothly off their tongues. They reference their multiple international trips and confidently reason with one another as the polished lawyers they say they want to become. Their diction is a plethora of words I only learned from standardized testing, words that no one from home ever integrated so essentially into their daily vocabulary.
A girl sitting next to me poses a question, and I know the answer. My mind erupts in a tug-of-war: Do I answer her or do I let it go? I feel the answer on the tip of my tongue, but I swallow it down, burying it deep inside. Better to stay quiet than to suffer the judgmental looks of everyone around me as they realize I’m different. Then they’d know; they’d know my weakness; they’d smell my fear of not being good enough.
I imagine what it might have been like to be born into a family of college graduates where money and experience could comfortably guide me towards a secure future. I wonder what it would have been like to be like them—the seeming majority of Harvard’s student body that, unlike me, isn’t first-gen, low-income, or a minority.
I entered into this institution without an ounce of experience when it came to how to interact with people who seemed more sure-footed than I. I didn’t know how to talk to my Teaching Fellows about the essays I was struggling to write or my professors about the newfound concepts I just wasn’t understanding, without feeling like I was wasting their time. I grew up thinking that the only reason students talked to their teachers was when they had a question with an answer. A divide existed between us that could never completely be crossed. Now, here in Cambridge, I was surprised to learn that conversations with professors that had no definitive answer were not only permitted, but also essential to a future of recommendation letters and connections. How did someone even do that? I wish I knew.
So many times freshman year I was struck with wishing—wishing I had known the things I know now. That all those “indispensable” books on the syllabus the professor says you need to buy are actually in the library for free. That moving away is hard, especially when you have to fit your entire life into 3 suitcases and decorate a room your family will probably never see. Maybe I would be better off if I’d known that it was okay to be imperfect; to be human in an endless sea of the seemingly special, perfect students who make up this place. But what could have helped me?
The chance to meet other students from a first-gen background, students experiencing the same adjustments as me, would have been invaluable at the beginning of the semester. I wish I had the opportunity to talk to upperclassmen who could have told me that no matter how inferior I could feel or how overwhelmed I may be, I was chosen to be here for a reason. I needed real advice on how to battle the mountains of readings that I had never been given before and how to balance my schedule. I needed guidance from the moment I stepped foot on Harvard’s campus, that went deeper than the network all freshmen are given. I needed a bridge program.
A bridge program for incoming first-gen, low-income students can only help realize the potential of the freshmen Harvard has taken a chance on. The freshmen who can’t look to home for advice on college life could look to a bridge program. Despite the lengths that Harvard has taken to level the playing field by not accepting college credits and providing generous financial aid packages, the institution must acknowledge the plight faced by first-generation students, especially those who are low-income.
The Freshman Enrichment Program (FEP) is an initiative that won funding by the Undergraduate Council last year. It is a bridge program that could provide the guidance I needed in the beginning, and it is a program that needs to become a reality as soon as possible. A bridge program like FEP could have provided me with the support, the advice, and the experience necessary to have had a smoother transition. Perhaps it could have even given me the voice and the confidence to wield my knowledge. I can speak; I just haven’t found my footing yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does it mean to “settle down”? Merriam-Webster defines “to settle down,” as “to begin to live a quiet and steady life by getting a regular job, getting married, etc.” We use the term to describe buying a house or raising little humans hoping, praying that they don’t turn out bad people.
What?
Quiet and steady? Yeah, right.
We say “settle down,” acting like there’s no irony in the term—as if getting married to another human being and saying “Hey, I am going to bind myself to you spiritually, emotionally, physically, and lawfully” is an easy and safe thing to do. As if everybody should do it, just because it’s normal and traditional. But perhaps we should instead be saying: “buckle up.” Getting married, buying a house, and raising a kid are among some of the craziest and most adventurous and difficult things a person could ever do.
There’s a weirdness surrounding this term, “settling down,” and feminism—something which I kept thinking about this past summer, as I watched endless episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy” on Netflix, investing myself deeply in the lives of Meredith Grey and Cristina Yang.
At one point, Meredith Grey has a husband, a child, a home, and a booming career as a surgeon. Cristina Yang lies in direct juxtaposition, attached to no one (except for maybe Meredith, and even that causes her to move cross-country for a while). Cristina is committed only to her path as a surgeon, whereas Meredith’s path involves being a surgeon, a mother, and a wife.
In a way, Cristina seems to have made the wiser choice for feminism and independence. Her facial expressions are tougher than Meredith’s, her clothes less “girly” or stereotypically feminine, her manner of speaking more definitive. She embodies the anthematic phrase “I don’t need a man.” And we think, of course, that no woman needs a man or a relationship or any of the things that Meredith Grey has. But somehow, despite all that, we still root for Meredith—to have the husband, the child, the house, and the wildly successful career.
Logically speaking, however, Meredith’s attachments should have no real claim on any assessment of her strength, independence, or feminism. It’s undeniably true that Meredith has chosen to “settle down” in the general sense of the phrase, in addition to continuing to focus on her career as a surgeon. But that dichotomy should not be a comment on her status as a feminist. In truth, the fact that she has also chosen to pursue a domestic life, in addition to being career oriented, makes her no less strong a character as Cristina. These things are not at odds. Women should not be made to choose between domesticity and independent careerism. Men don’t choose.
Men in the West have traditionally lived between the two worlds of home and work, without any need to compromise. No one is concerned about Joe Shmoe “balancing” being a father with pursuing a successful career. But if a woman is pregnant, it is often second nature to assume that she will cease to work. And if she does not cease, there are articles written about her in amazement and applause. She is atypical of the traditional woman.
To be fair, it is new for women to be taking on the roles in society that they are. But at the same time, our view of what it means to be a woman is severely underdeveloped and oversimplified. To be a woman, first and foremost, means to be human. If the general public accepted this fact, feminism, as a movement for women’s rights, would be less relevant, since women would automatically have their human rights as a matter of course.
Lastly, we need a new definition of feminism that does not ask women to live and proclaim an unrealistically independent lifestyle. Many contemporary pop songs champion the idea that women don’t need men—an idea that, while not totally untrue, is also not completely true. Some women don’t need men; some do. That has nothing to do with their feminism, but everything to do with them being a human with unique and individual choices.
Being an independent person does not mean that we must cut ourselves off from romance, or friendship; independence is not the lack of dependence. Instead it’s a healthy dependence upon those people placed in our lives to love us, to help us grow as humans. It’s a dependence that is grateful for those who come alongside us, help us bear the burdens of living and walk with us.
Additionally, let’s not act like our independence requires burned bridges. Sometimes we do have to burn bridges because people suck, men and women; but we are independent regardless of any bridges burned—with or without the man.
So no, I don’t plan on settling down. Meredith Grey didn’t settle; she buckled up. I want to walk the path I was meant to, and if that means having a husband and a kid, great. If it doesn’t, then that’s also great. Either way, I’m myself.
I want to be rooted, but not stagnant. Independent but never unattached, and never pressured to choose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, University of Chicago Dean of Students and former Harvard Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” Ellison sent a letter to incoming freshmen stating his opposition to safe spaces, content warnings, and other restrictions on expression. The missive has been contentious, with some arguing that it was a publicity stunt or hypocritical.
In our view, the genesis of safe spaces and content warnings ought to be uncontroversial; they work to create an academic environment in which people feel free to speak their mind, without any fear of harassment or abuse. Fostering that atmosphere must be one of the foremost priorities of any institution of higher education. When attacks on individuals’ humanity are tolerated or long-settled questions of race and gender are exhumed, any community is moved backwards. There is a crucial distinction to be drawn between free speech and hate speech.
For these reasons, legitimate efforts like those at Yale to prevent Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking aren’t questions of freedom of expression. Dedication to First Amendment speech rights endorses racial or sexual harassment no more than a commitment to the right to assemble implies support for Nazi marches through Skokie.
Ultimately, however, these examples are red herrings. In the vast majority of cases, speech or assembly ought to be sacred. Rational and reasonable people can disagree about the precise lines between the unacceptable and the inflammatory, or between the bigoted and the simply questionable, but content that falls clearly on the wrong side of that divide shouldn’t be the focus of a debate over campus activism. Universities are communities with dual responsibilities to free expression and their members.
Beyond the most extreme examples of hate speech on campus, the core idea behind safe spaces and content warnings—that debates which include all are freer ones than debates which exclude—can become lost. Mainstream leaders in law enforcement, government, and international development have been prevented from speaking at universities under the wrongheaded assumption that inclusivity means censorship of unpopular views. While the University of Chicago may have overstepped in issuing a blanket condemnation of safe spaces and content warnings, its letter was also a reaction to the suppression of speech that has every right to be heard on university campuses everywhere.
Universities should strive to strike a balance between ensuring students’ right to express dissent and combatting kind of vitriol that stifles, rather than furthers, free discussion in a free society. In their original forms, safe spaces and content warnings can help achieve this goal, but at their most extreme, they can threaten it. Guarding against absolutism on either side of issues of campus speech is the work to which all American institutions of higher learning should commit themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four protesters chained themselves to the front doors of  Cambridge City Hall, as Black Lives Matter activists and allies gathered to demand changes to the city’s affordable housing policies.
Carrying signs that read “25% Affordable Housing,” protesters called upon City Council members to vote in favor of a 25 percent affordable housing quota for new developments of more than nine units. Currently, about 11.5 percent of new developments in Cambridge are dedicated to affordable housing. A city ordinance mandates that 15 percent of base units in new developments be affordable, according to the website for the Inclusionary Housing Program for Developers.
“Most of the affordable housing in Cambridge is studios and one-bedroom apartments, which totally excludes and marginalizes any kind of family,” said Sonia B. Kikeri, a graduate student at Brandeis and active member of the Cambridge chapter of Black Lives Matter. According to Kikeri, income requirements and wait lists often leave those seeking affordable housing homeless.
Wednesday's demonstration, which lasted about eight hours, featured several speakers and a presentation of four demands for Cambridge's elected officials. In addition to the 25 percent affordable housing mandate, protesters called for the City Council to use free land for public spaces and affordable housing instead of selling it to developers; establish a Rent-to-Own program; and allow MIT to further develop student on-campus housing in order to leave more space for affordable housing.
The crowd of about 30 protesters was largely made up of Cambridge residents. Two high school students chained themselves by the neck using bike locks, while two others attached themselves to the students. Some Harvard affiliates, including current undergraduates and several College alumni who had been involved in the Phillips Brooks House Association, also attended the demonstration, according to Noah R. Wagner ’18.
Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, and City Councillor Jan Devereux addressed the protesters on the steps of City Hall. In an interview, McGovern expressed a desire to change the city’s current affordable housing ordinance by the end of the calendar year.
“This isn’t a discussion that will go into next spring,” McGovern said. “I want to see as high a percentage as we can possibly get.”
However, McGovern also said a 25 percent affordable housing quota may not be financially feasible. Citing a consulting report and recommendations from the Affordable Housing Trust, McGovern said a 25 percent affordable housing quota could render project financing impossible for development companies.
“At 20 percent, it can work,” he said.
In order to change the ordinance, the proposal will need votes from at least six of the nine members of the City Council. According to McGovern, five councillors have vocalized support for a 20 percent affordable housing quota. Kikeri said that the officials’ statement to the protesters emphasized the lengthy process involved in changing the housing policy.
“They’re committed to the process, that’s what they keep repeating,” Kikeri said. “And that’s fine, except that they also need to be doing things to expedite the process when it’s people’s lives at stake, or they need to be doing a parallel complementary temporary program to keep the integrity of Cambridge—otherwise, it’s just going to be housing for rich white people.”
The protest ended at about 2:30 p.m., when the four individuals chained to City Hall were arrested. The Cambridge chapter of Black Lives Matter is currently collecting donations for jail support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates began the fall semester fighting for seats, with some students having to settle for floor space as crowded classrooms marked the start of the College's course shopping period.
Not every student was even fortunate enough to be in the room for English 188GF: “Global Fictions” in Sever Hall Wednesday. Indeed, many had to stand in the doorway and hall. 
“The room just kept filling up. There were people sitting on the floor, and I didn’t expect so many people to come to the first day of class,” English assistant professor Kelly M. Rich said. She estimated that at least 45 students attended her class.
“The energy in the room was really electric,” she said. “Although it could have been nice if everyone had a seat, I’m just getting used to shopping period, and I guess this is the way it goes.”
Jenna Gray ’19, who attended Rich’s class Wednesday afternoon, said she regularly expects overcrowded classrooms during shopping period.
“I think it’s to be expected as people have a lot of interests and there a lot of course conflicts, and people are trying to navigate their interests and requirements,” Gray said. Although large classes can be a “turnoff” for her, she said it does not impact her course selection if a class is “truly enticing.”
In recent years, popular classes such as Economics 1010a: “Intermediate Microeconomics” or English 190we: “David Foster Wallace” have also attracted more students than their assigned classrooms could hold.
Ec 1010a drew a large crowd again this year. Students quickly filled the 300-person capacity Menschel Hall, lining the halls and outside staircase, said Maxim Boycko, a visiting lecturer in Economics who is teaching Ec 1010a.
“We didn’t have a single free seat and people were standing, but generally I would say the air was very nice,” Boycko said. “We are off to a great start.”
Boycko said he hopes to accommodate all students who show an interest in his class.
In addition to crowded classrooms, this year’s shopping period featured some attempts on the part of instructors to address recent changes to the General Education program.

The memory of the mumps outbreak that spread through Harvard earlier this year may still linger, but summer vacation and a high rate of vaccination have eliminated any active cases on campus.
In total, 66 cases of mumps were confirmed by Harvard University Health Services as of Wednesday, according to Director Paul J. Barreira. Sixty one of those confirmed cases were recorded at the time of Commencement on May 26.
State-wide, there have been 109 confirmed cases and 101 probable cases, according to Larry C. Madoff, the director of epidemiology and immunization for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
“There were probably many more cases we don’t even know about, including probably 20 percent with mumps who weren’t symptomatic,” Madoff said. “They may have not even known that they had mumps and spread it.”
Madoff said the decline of mumps could be attributed to the end of the school year, when students left town for the summer.
“The close, dormitory kind of contact that we saw ended, and that really ended the outbreak for the summer,” Madoff said.
Barreira also said state legislation concerning vaccinations helped stall the virus.
“Massachusetts has strict immunization requirements that students must meet in order to register for classes,” Barreira wrote in an email. “Harvard University complies with all state requirements and typically 98 to 99 percent of students are fully vaccinated.”
Talk of mumps swept across the University in late February, after Barreira emailed students informing them of the first two cases. The number of cases rose steadily throughout the spring, and the virus spread to other local universities such as Tufts and Boston University. Infected students were quarantined in the Harvard Inn, a move that drew ire and concern from residents already living there.
“We worked very closely with Harvard UHS and the Cambridge Public Health Department to monitor the cases and make sure that we isolated cases, and instituted measures to try to control contact,” Madoff said. “And that did a lot, I think, to contain the outbreak.”
Madoff said it is difficult to trace the origin of a mumps outbreak.
“Certainly many of the [mumps] cases are vaccine-preventable diseases from other countries and that may have been the case here, but we don’t know for sure,” he said.
Though Harvard administrators initially worried that the outbreak would affect Commencement and other end-of-year events, Barreira said that mumps had no effect on the proceedings.
“Really, the message we want to get out is immunization works, and we’re happy Harvard has such a high rate of people who are vaccinated,” Madoff said.
Although there are currently no active cases at Harvard, Madoff encouraged individuals to seek medical attention and to contact HUHS if symptoms of the virus appear.
“There’s always that possibility, and we need to be vigilant,” he said.

Even after last week’s landmark National Labor Relations Board ruling that would force Harvard to legally recognize an elected graduate student union, the path forward for universities is far from clear.
The NLRB overturned precedent in ruling that student assistants at private universities are considered employees, and Harvard has invited members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers to discuss next steps in light of the decision, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng.
But for graduate students involved in the unionization effort, the fight is not over. Graduate students weathered a period in limbo after the Board first recognized graduate students as employees in 2000, a decision effectively overturned in 2004. That rocky history shows the NLRB's recent decision may not guarantee a smooth path to unionization.
The NLRB visited the issue of unionization in its New York University decision in 2000, granting students at private universities the right to collectively bargain. At that time, graduate students at Harvard were not actively seeking a union, but other campuses saw a lot more activity.
Student movements at several Ivy League schools moved forward with plans to hold a union election following the NYU decision. After Brown administrators refused to hold an election, the NLRB scheduled a hearing and ultimately ruled students had a right to hold the election. Ninety percent of eligible graduate students cast their vote in 2001. But because Brown’s request for review was still pending at the time of the election, the ballots were impounded.
William B. Gould, a Stanford Law professor who was chairman of the NLRB from 1994 to 1998, said it is important to have elections right away, especially on college campuses.
“If you wait until that issue is resolved, those employees—particularly in the university setting where they go on and graduate and go on to other things—they may never be able to express their position. Because it will take a number of years to have the matter resolved,” Gould said.
By the time the NLRB decided the Brown case in 2004—which allowed universities to ban unions among graduate students—President George W. Bush’s Republican appointees had swung the NLRB rightward, and reversed its NYU decision. The ballots were left uncounted at Brown, as well as at Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania.
Labor law expert David Rosenfeld, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, said it will be harder for universities to take a similar avenue, given new union election rules announced in 2015. There is no longer a 25-day period between submitting a petition and holding an election, any post-election challenges are waived, and objections must now be made within seven days of an election.
“It doesn’t mean [the universities] can’t ultimately delay, but it’s going to make it more difficult,” Rosenfeld said.
It is unclear how Harvard will act going forward. The University reaffirmed its opposition to unionization after the decision was released, and again in an email from Meng, the GSAS dean. If an election is held and HGSU-UAW wins, the University could immediately agree to sit down with organizers and negotiate.
But Gould said he expects private universities to challenge the decision. The fact that Harvard has now agreed to sit down with union organizers did not sway his opinion.
“They will emphasize the inhospitable posture of [the Supreme Court] toward bargains in higher education and the chaos that may ensue from the Yale petition today for ten different units,” Gould wrote in an email, referring to the Yale union effort’s move to file ten separate petitions by department. Graduate workers in each of those departments will vote to join a single union, an approach Gould called “unusual.” A recent revision of NLRB rules allowing for “microunits” of workers inspired the move, and it theoretically makes it easier for a union to win an election.
In the event of a challenge from universities, Gould said the NLRB  would litigate the matter and raise it before the appellate courts and potentially the Supreme Court.
“I think we’re going to hear a lot more about this in the coming months,” Gould said. “The Board is in for a real fight.”
Despite the lengthy road ahead, John T. Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, said he believes the students can win their battle.
“The Harvard graduate students right now are in a much better position to achieve victory for unions than was the case then,” Trumpbour said. “People right now are so much more organized and energized.”
In the same turn of events that happened in the early 2000s, the upcoming presidential election could impact the Board’s decision. Trumpbour said a Donald Trump administration would be in the University’s best interest, with the idea that he would pack the NLRB with Republican appointees who would reverse the decision.
“They’re kind of in a tough position because they are very afraid of Trump getting elected for a variety of reasons, but on this particular issue they would much more be in need of a Republican president to get the Board’s composition to change,” Trumpbour said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

University President Drew G. Faust talked about her own scholarly training and “confronting difficult truths” of history at Morning Prayers Wednesday, the first day of the semester.
In her speech, which took place as part of the weekday Memorial Church prayer ceremony, Faust said that the last few years have demanded a particularly acute examination of both American and Harvard history.
“Ferguson, Charleston, Staten Island, Baltimore, Orlando, Baton Rouge—far too many places and names and tragedies to list—all refocused our national attention on the unrealized promise of liberty and justice for all,” Faust told the congregants in Holden Chapel.
A “card-carrying” Civil War historian by trade, Faust discussed how her scholarly background—which she called “the ideal training for leadership”—has informed her approach to the University’s presidency. She said that it has helped her to empathize with other people and understand the possibility for change.
“History, like leadership, is about change, about understanding what makes change happen, about who embraces change and why, about who resists it and how,” Faust said.
Faust cited last semester’s decision to change the Law School seal—which was formerly the crest of a slaveholding family—as one example of such a change. Throughout the debate over the seal change, though, Faust remained adamant that Harvard should not overwrite or forget its historical connections to slavery.
“A true understanding of the past can disentangle us from lingering vestiges of harmful assumptions that may in hidden ways influence us still; we must understand how our narratives about the past have shaped and continue to shape the present in order to be able to transform that present into a better, juster future,” Faust said.
Faust also discussed an initiative to memorialize Harvard’s ties to slavery that began last semester with the unveiling of a plaque at Wadsworth House to honor four enslaved people who lived and worked at Harvard. That project will continue this year, Faust said, with a conference at the Radcliffe Institute on slavery at universities.
“We must all be historians.  Who we are is indelibly shaped by who we have been,” Faust said.

More than a hundred gathered at the Medical School Wednesday to develop a list of priorities for the new dean to help make the school more diverse, convening after a semester of campus activism aimed at selecting a leader dedicated to the issue.
The event was organized by students at the Medical and Dental School and included discussion groups in which students generated items for a “social justice agenda” they plan to deliver to the new dean George Q. Daley ’82, who was in attendance. They requested more representation of students on faculty search committees and increased diversity within the student body. 
The discussion among students, faculty, and staff comes months after student activists amplified efforts to influence the Medical School dean search, and after a year of heightened campus activism surrounding issues of diversity. In January, members of the Racial Justice Coalition, comprised of Medical and Dental School students, delivered a petition to University President Drew G. Faust calling on administrators to select a dean dedicated to increasing diversity. About 300 students signed the petition.
The group also requested that at least a quarter of candidates interviewed for the dean position—vacated in July after Jeffrey S. Flier announced last fall he would step down—“come from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine.” The group also requested that the new dean had “demonstrated a commitment to social justice, as exemplified through actions and/or scholarship furthering health equity.”
At the event, Medical School professor and renowned humanitarian Paul Farmer gave an address highlighting the importance of student voices in decision-making.
“The students drive a lot of the agenda here, and a lot of the dean’s agenda,” he said.
Farmer spoke directly to Daley in response to a question about what a new dean can do to make widespread changes at the school.
“We need a more diverse faculty—senior faculty,” Farmer said, calling the issue of faculty diversity among the “obvious” challenges for Daley.
Daley, who will take over as dean in January 2017, spoke to the audience, his remarks unplanned.
“I will listen. I will listen to every one of you,” he said. “And I will commit myself, on behalf of Paul [Farmer], on behalf of all of you, to aspire to do better.”
The event also featured speeches from other progressive Harvard groups. Members of UNITE HERE Local 26, a union of Harvard dining hall workers currently in negotiations over benefits, spoke about rising healthcare costs and how Medical School students could get involved in their efforts.
Jayne Rice, a first-year Medical student who attended a historically black college before coming to Harvard, said she was pleased with the event.
“There was a reason I was hesitant about coming to Harvard. It wasn’t made for black people, it wasn’t made for minorities,” Rice said. “It’s really encouraging that students are very aware of these issues.”

Harvard has raised more than $7 billion so far in its capital campaign, the University announced Thursday, blasting past the record-setting drive’s goal with about two years of fundraising still left.
The campaign, which publicly launched in September 2013, set out to raise a historic total of $6.5 billion for a number of initiatives including expanded financial aid, a new engineering campus in Allston, and the renewal of undergraduate Houses; many expected Harvard would easily reach its goal by the end of the fundraising drive. The University had not updated the public on fundraising progress since October 2015, though The Crimson reported in March Harvard had raised at least $6.5 billion and set a higher education fundraising record, surpassing Stanford’s $6.2 billion capital campaign that ended in 2012.
University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly said Harvard will not raise its overall fundraising goal, even though some peer universities, like Columbia, raised their goals during successful capital campaigns.
“From the very beginning of the campaign when we set the target, we were confident we were going to hit the target,” Michael T. Kerr ’81, a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Campaign Steering Committee, said. “But the fact now is that I think we’re going to achieve a number that’s fairly historic for American universities, a spectacular achievement.”
Harvard also revealed they had raised $820 million towards financial aid across the University’s 12 schools, including $460 million pledged towards undergraduate financial aid—$140 million short of the FAS goal. The University did not make public the progress of any other campaign initiatives.
With a set end date of June 2018 for continued fundraising, the University will turn its focus to funding various other programs and priorities, including undergraduate financial aid and the Allston campus, that have not reached their fundraising targets. Harvard has had no trouble beating its overall goal, but there are still individual “buckets” of need that have been hard to fill.
“$7 billion is a huge, a huge amount of money—so the question is why continue?” Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, a member of the Boston Campaign Committee, said. “The answer to that is that even this $6.5 billion goal didn’t nearly cover what Harvard’s needs were. Harvard decided at the very outset the campaign wasn’t a wish list. These were necessities, and there were many more necessities than could be included in the goal.”
Some fundraising priorities can be more tricky to fulfill, as some donors may be interested in funding programs Harvard may consider a priority. Additionally, Buttenweiser said, new programs and needs can develop over the course of a campaign, drawing the attention of donors while other fundraising priorities move out of the limelight.
“If you look at the $7 billion figure, that is money that Harvard will use wonderfully, but it’s not all for campaign goals per se,” Buttenweiser said. For example, John A. Paulson’s $400 million donation to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences helped push the school far past its fundraising goal.
William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—wrote in an emailed statement that the fundraising drive remains important to fulfilling institutional priorities.
“Pursuing Harvard's teaching and research mission has never been more vital, and the vision of all who have participated in the campaign will advance that mission and support the faculty, students and staff who bring it to life every day,” Lee wrote.
Still, some donors have previously said the campaign’s prime days of nine-figure gifts may be in the past. Last year, a $350 million gift from Gerald L. Chan renamed the School of Public Health, while Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 gave $150 million to undergraduate financial aid. Those two gifts, along with Paulson’s record-breaking gift to SEAS, compromise almost a seventh of the entire capital campaign.
Peter L. Malkin ’55, a major donor, said Harvard could conceivably maintain a breakneck fundraising pace as long as it continues to connect donors to the right fundraising priorities.
“I don’t think it’s so much that $7 billion has been raised and that will dissuade people. I think what it is, they have to keep coming up with specific programs or projects that people want. I think if they come up with attractive uses of the money, the money will still be there,” Malkin said.
And with almost two years of fundraising left, Malkin predicted the money will keep pouring in.
“I think one would be shocked if between now and the end of the campaign they didn’t raise another billion dollars,” Malkin said.
