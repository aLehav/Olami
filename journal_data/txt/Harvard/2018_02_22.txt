After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There I stand ’neath the Marquee Moon / Hesitating.” In a beautiful album full of striking images, the most memorable part of Television’s “Marquee Moon” is at its center, as the 10-minute title track comes to a climax. Television’s singer, guitarist, and lyricist Tom Verlaine hesitates between those lines, and since the instruments have also paused, his fermata creates a rare moment of peace, an eye in Television’s hurricane. Then, the instruments crash back and the other guitarist Richard Lloyd launches into another gorgeous, tightly-crafted solo.
Verlaine’s vocal delivery elevates those lines to a near-apocalyptic significance. Surely, the marquee moon promises something great and terrible. But what? It never arrives. The third chorus instead concludes “I ain’t waitin’, uh-uh!” Throughout the album, we see Verlaine frantically roaming an impressionistic New York exploding with light, sound, and friction, seeking something that would help him transcend everything bombarding his senses. When he finds it, whether it is the titular lunar skyscape or falling “into the arms of Venus de Milo,” he runs into another problem—that experience does not deliver, either. At least, we never learn what he makes of these moments. We only hear his angst through riffs, solos, basslines, and fills.
“Marquee Moon” was released at a turning point in music history. Punk was drastically changing the contemporary rock landscape, leaving behind the increasingly long-winded prog and art rock of the period and moving towards radical simplification. Bands like the Ramones and artists like Patti Smith had helped shape the increasingly successful punk scene.
Television was a significant early leader in the movement, with Tom Verlaine playing lead guitar on Patti Smith’s cover of “Hey Joe,” a song often considered the first punk song. Television had a substantial cult following in New York, but they had yet to release an album. In the time between 1974 and 1977, the band had turned down several major labels in search of a record deal they felt was appropriate. They also passed up the chance to work long-term with Brian Eno, after they felt initial demos minimized the expressive, guitar-driven sound they sought. Then, founding member Richard Hell left the group because of creative differences. The other members had grown increasingly adept in their instrumental and compositional abilities, while Hell insisted on a frantic, raw sound. It was Hell’s departure that allowed Television to create the distinct sound of “Marquee Moon.”
“Marquee Moon” was simultaneously a culmination of the punk sound Television helped create and a drastic departure from the category as a whole. Punk was a style that depended on brevity and wildness, but every song on “Marquee Moon” is an extended bout of extreme control. Save for the hook-filled opening duo “See No Evil” and “Venus,” no song is below four and a half minutes. The guitar lines are drawn out and are generally straightforward like in punk (except for the solos), but all the pieces come together to create long, powerful songs far bigger than the instrumentation itself. The deceptively complex arrangements somehow feel simple. From the riffing on “Friction” to the tension of “Torn Curtain,” every note is calculated. “Marquee Moon” uses the simplicity of punk to create the lengthy, precise pieces like those of their prog contemporaries. Rebelling against punk’s own revolution of wild simplicity, Television harnesses that simplicity to make long, technical, and controlled music.
Television’s big shift is instrument-driven. The interplay between the crashing, twisting guitars and the accompanying rhythm lines creates a powerful intellectual headspace that harnesses punk’s simplicity within far bigger and multifaceted pieces. The guitars that envelop the album’s sound in songs like “Elevation” and “Friction” verge on disorder, but the harmonic meshing between instruments grounds the band, building a sense of calming exactness such that “Marquee Moon” feels faultless.
People often wonder why there was never another album like “Marquee Moon,” and the answer is simple: Television is one of those bands that is so weird they are basically impossible to fully imitate. As Matt LeMay wrote for “Pitchfork,” “Everyone who plays guitar will, at some point, learn the solo from ‘Stairway to Heaven’, but it’s practically impossible to sit down and actually play anything from ‘Marquee Moon.’” Indeed, while some have attempted to imitate Television’s sound—The Edge, for example, uses an effects pedal in an attempt to emulate Verlaine’s tone—no other band has ever been able to turn the chaos of punk into such carefully tempered energy. Verlaine’s low whine and the high, wavering dual guitar sounds working in perfect harmony with the bass and the drum lines allow Television to create a radical album while remaining perfectly in unison.
While there was never any true successor to “Marquee Moon,” the album essentially created the genre of post-punk. If Television is inimitable sonically, they can at least be stylistically approximated. Bands with similar avant-garde aspirations can use the same style of punk simplicity to achieve powerful results.
Though “Marquee Moon” laid the groundwork for later trends, nobody could ever hope to match its expertise or the perfect unity of the musicians playing it. In many ways, it’s the “Citizen Kane” of albums, the unassailable height of accessible experimentation. No album has more powerfully subverted the expectations of a genre since,and in this sense, few albums have ever been so revolutionarily original. “Marquee Moon,” through the use of increasingly conventional punk tactics of simplicity, created a perfectly complex avant-garde masterpiece. As the riffs build and dissemble, the lyrics meander from near-climax to near-climax. Television may not find any meaning in the mayhem, but they certainly find beauty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since The Weeknd’s “Earned It” peaked at number three on Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart, big names in music have been vying to produce the latest hit song for the “Fifty Shades of Grey” film adaptations. The second single for the first movie, Ellie Goulding’s power ballad “Love Me Like You Do,” hit number one in over 25 countries. ZAYN and Taylor Swift handled the lead single for the second installment with their Jack Antonoff-produced duet, “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” which also debuted on Billboard’s Hot 100.
The formula for these songs, it seems, is relatively simple: syncopated synth beat, layers of “ooh” vocals in the background, a creeping, sultry verse that builds to a stomping, anthemic chorus. Oh, and lyrics that beg and cajole, that bemoan the kind of romantic love at the center of “Fifty Shades,” the kind that’s illogical and irrational, yet simultaneously uncontrollable and alluring.
Whether it’s actually love or incessant boning that “Fifty Shades” celebrates, the climax of the trilogy is upon us—and so, too, is the final soundtrack. Producers tapped Julia Michaels—a relative newcomer best known for the song “Issues”—for the soundtrack’s third single, which earned Michaels her first Grammy nominations just this past January.
Michaels’ contribution to the “Fifty Shades Freed” soundtrack is “Heaven,” a sensual, slow-burn ballad recalling a love affair as toxic as it was intoxicating. Though sonically understated compared to its “Fifty Shades” predecessors, “Heaven” showcases Michaels’ vocal range and technically clever songwriting.
Michaels, whose songwriting credits include the likes of Selena Gomez and Fifth Harmony, smartly imbues “Heaven” with analogous lyric-sonic motion. “Falling for him was like falling from grace,” she sings on a descending arpeggio, as lyrical “falling” parallels musical descent. Its verse slides down a chromatic scale, whose breaks with major key signature produce a sound as discordant as the love affair in question.
“Heaven” builds on Michaels’ established sound, the staccato synth backing not unlike the plucked strings that preface the verse of “Issues.” Yet the song makes use of her breathy vocals to spin the tune into a much darker contemplation of love. “All good boys go to heaven, / But bad boys bring heaven to you,” Michaels opines in the chorus. It’s the kind of buzzy wordplay on a truism that sticks in your head—the kind of punchy one-liner you’d expect Dakota Johnson to recite in a “Fifty Shades” trailer.
Any singer who scores a track on the “Fifty Shades” soundtrack seems automatically poised for instant viral music stardom, or at least radio plays. On first listen, though, “Heaven” doesn’t feel like the pop power ballad of “Fifty Shades” soundtracks past. It doesn’t even sound like a song that plays while the credits roll. Sure, there’s nothing remarkably innovative or fresh about “Heaven.” It’s pop manufactured for Hollywood, love synthesized for the radio. It’s a slightly toned-down version of what’s already come, only with a dose of Michaels’ songwriting prowess.
But that’s not to say it’s any less impactful or catchy than its predecessors—in fact, its simplicity lends itself to accessibility. The love in “Heaven” is not the holy grail, as in Ellie Goulding’s version. Nor is love equated to immortality, in ZAYN and Taylor’s version. As Michaels herself sings in the second verse, “There’s no regrets. I just thought it was fun.” “Heaven” renders love, or at least the “Fifty Shades” version of it, in simple terms. The boy is bad for her, and yet, so good.

“Is it us? Or is it just supernatural?” BØRNS croons in “Supernatural.” Neon pink lights illuminate a leafy green backdrop behind him. White strobe flickers in the back. The song is about a relationship, rather than a person, but one can’t help wonder whether the singer himself exudes a certain supernatural, alien energy.
If not an actual alien, BØRNS is at least a very otherworldly human. At six-foot-three, he cuts a lanky figure onstage, sometimes seeming to tower over the audience. His crystalline falsetto rings, even several songs deep into the setlist. Multicolored, neon lights tinted his angled, androgynous features. His persona seems to be cobbled together from contrasts and contradictions, and so too, does his lyricism, which radically fluctuates between spirituality and sexuality, vibrant youth and aged melancholy. “Let me satisfy your soul, / Not a saint, but do I have to be?” he sings in “Holy Ghost,” a synth-pop seduction caged, somewhat sacrilegiously, in the language of worship. Even his stage name, stylized BØRNS, hints at the exotic, yet his biography—he was born Garrett Borns in Grand Haven, Michigan—feels unexpectedly rooted in the ordinary.
BØRNS’ “Blue Madonna” tour came to the House of Blues in Boston last Sunday, Feb. 11. Despite a brief lull during the less familiar songs of BØRNS’ repertoire, a rollicking encore featuring remixed versions of certified crowd-pleasers from his earlier album revitalized the energy in the venue. Mikky Ekko, a pop singer, opened for BØRNS, coming into the crowd in the floor section during his solo rendition of his 2013 duet with Rihanna, “Stay.” After Ekko, Charlotte Cardin, a Canadian singer-songwriter, continued the opening act, showcasing original songs and a husky, low register not unlike Amy Winehouse’s.
BØRNS’ own setlist opened with “God Save Our Young Blood,” a synth-heavy solo version of his duet with Lana Del Rey, after which he announced that he would “play the entire album, top to bottom,” a seemingly practical move given the recent release of his latest record, “Blue Madonna.” His sophomore album is front-loaded, though: The highlights, including sugary pop track “Faded Heart” and the album’s second single “Sweet Dreams,” came and went in rapid succession. BØRNS’ stage presence is minimal—despite the rock ‘n roll sonic influences, he prefers cool nonchalance to wild bacchanal dancing—yet still magnetic, a certain insouciant look in his eyes. Occasionally, he reached out to the audience, even taking from one concertgoer a pink flower crown to wear during “Man.”
Enthusiasm in the room seemed to dim after the first few songs. Given the late January release date of “Blue Madonna,” it might have been too soon for the crowd to sing all the lyrics back to him, save a few dedicated listeners. “Blue Madonna” tracks seem to burn slow—or stifle their own flame, as Pitchfork wrote of the album’s “great ideas constrained in songs that rarely allow them to come to fruition.” True, the “Blue Madonna” setlist seemed to lack the ear candy melodies and uniformity of BØRNS’ earlier work. A few hits redeemed the anemic second half, including drum-heavy charmer “Man” and glittery West Coast beachside bop, “Second Night of Summer.”
Energy hit a crescendo as the concert reached its encore and the singer returned to tried-and-true crowd-pleasers from his 2015 debut studio album, “Dopamine” and his EP, “Candy.” Cardin, the second opening act, reappeared for a sultry duet cover of “Strawberry Fields Forever,” both singers harmonizing in all-white outfits, basking in red light. BØRNS seemed to be in his element as he delivered a stripped-down, gospel-influenced version of “Seeing Stars,” illuminated overhead by a single spotlight.
If playing “Blue Madonna” from track one to the end felt like rote memorization or muscle memory, the encore breathed new life into the concert by showcasing BØRNS’ capacity for sonic transformation. The few, unrecognizable measures obfuscated which song was next, but it was precisely that ambiguity that seemed thrilling—that signaled the possibility for anything. “Seeing Stars,” “American Money,” and “Past Lives”—all highlights from earlier records—began with uncertainty and evolved into familiar hooks that, once recognized, gave rise to emphatic applause.
Naturally, the setlist concluded with “Electric Love,” the addictively joyous, viral hit that became certified platinum last year and won the singer his mainstream popularity. Since the tune has backed airline commercials and several movies, one might have thought the song’s life had already run its course. Yet, as fuchsia lights flashed and hands waved in the air, BØRNS jubilantly strummed an electric guitar and lengthened the bridge to dance for a few more measures. The best, it seemed, had been saved for last.

The Scripture tells us, “Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan,” and if we can expect that from the Almighty Himself, it does not seem too totally crazy to ask that of the Harvard Corporation.
I speak, of course, of the surprising recent announcement of Lawrence S. Bacow to be the 29th president of Harvard University.
Bacow is not a surprising pick because of his qualifications—he served as president of Tufts for a decade and as chancellor of MIT. Bacow is not a surprising pick because of his priorities—he seems like a safe choice intent on steering Harvard through choppy political and economic waters. Bacow is a surprising pick because he was supposed to be doing the picking.
The way Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 tells it, he was navigating the streets of the Boston metropolitan area—homeward bound from Logan International Airport—when he figured he might as well ask Larry if he wanted the top job at America’s oldest and wealthiest university.
Of course, it wasn’t quite that spontaneous. In the press conference, Lee admits that the presidential search committee had thought about Bacow as a candidate for some time before he was formally considered. Robin E. Kelsey, the chair of the faculty advisory committee to the presidential search, told The Crimson that Lee had explicitly inquired whether faculty believed there was a candidate hidden among the searchers.
Harvard says Bacow formally became a candidate in December, and Lee told the media that Bacow then underwent the “same processes as our other candidates.” But when Bacow woke up one morning and found himself changed into a presidential candidate, surely that marked the effective end of the search.
It’s hard to imagine that, having surveyed the landscape and considered over 700 individuals, the committee would have asked Bacow to become a candidate if more credible choices had abounded. By his own account, when he talked to Harvard affiliates, “Some of them said, ‘What about you, Larry?’ And I said, ‘No, thank you.’ I was there to get their ideas about others to lead Harvard.”
At the very least, the extraordinary act of asking him to step off the search committee was a signal of enormous support and confidence by the other searchers, in part because the decision was so exceptional. And once actually a candidate, he would have had an enormous leg up, having been privy to all the priorities, internal deliberations, and consultations of the first half year of the search.
It seems reasonable, then, to suggest that the act of turning him from searcher to candidate was the momentous one—that it was then that they had found their man.
It’s interesting to consider when they would have formally vetted Bacow. If the process was not complete before Lee’s call-from-the-car, the committee must have been prepared to make one of their own a candidate and then decline to offer him the job. Would they then have put him back onto the search committee? How would they have explained his ultimate absence from the ranks of the searchers?
If instead he was being vetted while still formally a search committee member, he must have known he was under informal consideration. (It would also imply that the committee had ruled out most of its other options prior to December.) Was there a special secret sub-committee that convened Bacow-free conference calls? Did they hang around at some meeting after he left to decide his fate?
Perhaps—and this remains entirely supposition—the choice to consider considering him was truly the pivotal moment. But in either event, it leaves open the possibility that for the last two (or more) months of the search, the committee was effectively going through the motions of a traditional search, complete with interviews, meetings, and consultations.
If indeed this was the case, it calls into question the role of the advisory committees and non-Bacow candidates in the search. The other candidates now know that they were not serious choices since late November or early December, as presumably the committee only decided to elevate Bacow after it had come to the conclusion that it didn’t have many better options.
Perhaps more interestingly, this timeline complicates the role of the rest of Harvard in the search. To their credit, the search committee convened advisory committees of students, faculty, and staff which were billed as one of the primary means through which Harvard affiliates could provide input on the search. Instead, the search committee had decided relatively early on that few, if any, of the 700-plus suggested candidates were viable.
Of the three, the faculty committee seems to have had the most impact. Kelsey, the head of that group, told The Crimson that they had suggested Bacow be considered, and he said the faculty committee’s work was mostly complete by the time Bacow stepped off the search committee. But if the student and staff groups were providing their findings along roughly the same timetable, concluding in December, the search committee may had already decided that most of the proposed candidates—save Bacow—were unsuitable.
For at least two months—as nearly 20 names were under consideration, as The Crimson reported on potential external candidates, and as the search committee continued to conduct candidate interviews—Harvard’s presidential search committee may have sat knowing that its decision had largely already been made. By then, they had already crossed the Rubicon.

On Feb. 20, Chicago Mayor Rahm I. Emanuel spoke at the Graduate School of Design. Before his arrival, over 30 graduate students at the school from the Harvard Urban Planning Organization and the GSD African American Student Union signed an open letter to Emanuel, criticizing many of his policies, including his decision to close 50 public schools in Chicago, the gentrification of certain neighborhoods, and other policies that affect Chicago’s urban planning. They also took issue with the lack of an in-depth, open dialogue concerning the costs and benefits of these urban development policies.
We believe that the event did a superficial job of evaluating Emanuel and his work. The event’s description claims that Chicago is “a great place to live, work, and play,” a characterization that fails to account for how Emanuel’s tenure has affected different communities in Chicago. To be sure, many have praised Emanuel for reforming the city’s community colleges, overseeing an uptick in high school graduation rates, and governing during a period of economic growth in Chicago. At the same time, though, many have criticized Emanuel for failing to adequately address the epidemic of police brutality in the city, refusing to be transparent, and being unreceptive to the needs of communities of color.
Oftentimes, expressions of dismay with a particular speaker can lead to unproductive insults and calls to uninvite the speaker. We commend the writers of the open letter for protestesting in a way that did not demean Emanuel or call for the cancellation of the event at which he was speaking. In fact, we believe that these student organizations explained their grievances with Emanuel in a highly constructive way that facilitated—as opposed to inhibited—conversation and free speech.
As we have previously opined, we encourage all Harvard students to continue to speak out in the future, whether they are in support or opposition of any speaker invited to campus. We believe that student voices and grievances are valuable contributions to open dialogue and a comprehensive Harvard education. The response to this particular event should thus serve as a model for similar situations in the future.
Students have demonstrated through their thoughtful action and protest that Emanuel’s mayorship is far more complex and nuanced than a simple one-sided view might imply. This recognition—that the truth usually does not completely lie with one side of any debate—is a vital one not only for those who organized the event at which Emanuel spoke, but also for students, faculty, and administrators at universities across the nation.
Indeed, this principle provides the foundation for the freedom of expression that stitches together the very fabric of our society.  We therefore urge students to make effective use of this freedom in the future, as they have today.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

I’ll never forget the day I became an American. My naturalization ceremony was one of a handful around the country to coincide with America’s 240th birthday—July 4, 2016. Taking the citizenship oath amidst the sprawling cacti of Arizona’s Saguaro National Park was a powerful moment that I will always remember. After moving to the United States when I was just two years old, my family and I waited 14 long years to gain U.S. citizenship. On that scorching midsummer day, we were proud to finally be able to call ourselves Americans.
Roughly 700,000 people become American citizens every single year, mostly originating from countries including Mexico, India, the Philippines, and China. By law, an American denotes any individual born or naturalized in the United States. In practice, however, the word takes on a different meaning. Perhaps Toni Morrison said it best when she proclaimed in 1992, “In this country, American means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.”
Over winter break, I traveled home for the holidays after completing my first semester at Harvard. Upon my return, my family friends were eager to know the details of my experience—one of them asked me whether I’d made lots of friends, adding, “Are most of them American?” For a moment, I was confused. But upon her clarifying, I realized she was actually asking if I had mostly white friends. To her, “American” and “white” were tacitly synonymous. Throughout the rest of my break, I’d run into similar comments made by family and friends who were quick to conflate the two terms.
But this misguided perception spans beyond the realm of just my community. Rather, it pervades communities across America, and Harvard is no exception. Many of my classmates of color anglicize, truncate, or entirely change their names to make them more “American-sounding,” while some deliberately mispronounce their names at the convenience of others, premising such actions upon the troubling idea that even today, “American,” by default, means “white.” In fact, just last year, in her new book The Origins of Others, Toni Morrison stated that “the definition of Americanness (sadly) remains color for many people.”
Morrison’s words ring true. According to several social psychology studies conducted by Professor of Social Ethics Mahzarin R. Banaji, non-white Americans are consistently associated less often with the label “American” than white Americans. In fact, implicit association tests reveal the prevalence of the “American equals white” bias, which has persisted up until today and bears deeply harmful impacts. Specifically, it can lead to discriminatory actions and judgments, especially in the realm of employment. Three 2010 studies found that when given resumes of job applicants, participants were less likely to choose qualified Asian-Americans for national security jobs compared to qualified white Americans, which—according to the researchers—stems from the perception that non-white Americans possess less national loyalty than white Americans.
Since elementary school, I have always considered myself to be just as American as my white counterparts. I’ll always remember learning about the foundations of U.S. government in my fifth-grade social studies class—since then, I’ve cherished our Constitution and passionately embraced the rights and liberties it has bestowed upon me and my peers. I love American television shows and movies, listen to American music, and happily partake in hallmarks of American culture. I’ll always remember the years I spent ardently watching seasons five through nine of American Idol, observing fireworks from my rooftop during the Fourth of July, and waking up at five in the morning to go Black Friday shopping with my family. Nor will I forget receiving my U.S. passport in the mail last year, registering to vote just a few months ago, or the proud, momentous day two summers ago that a federal judge proclaimed me and my parents to be the nation’s newest Americans.
Through Harvard’s Institute of Politics, I teach a weekly civics class to a diverse classroom of Boston fifth-graders. Many of my students are nonwhite. When we get to the citizenship unit, I start off by giving them the textbook facts about what it means to be a U.S. citizen, discussing relevant portions of the Constitution and pertinent vocabulary. But I also supplement this information with my own American story—a dynamic one that has continued to evolve into the present. Ultimately, I want them—and all Americans—to have unequivocal faith in this nation when it affirms that, regardless of race, color, or creed, each one of them deserves the title of “American.”

Plausible origin story for the neighborhood of Allston, Mass.: A bucolic Puritan utopia welcomes all, picks up the colloquial moniker “All’s Town.” The name sticks, eventually shortening to “Allston.”
It’s a fair assumption about a place some call one of Boston’s most diverse neighborhoods—but it’s inaccurate. Allston, Mass., is actually the namesake of a largely forgotten Cambridge artist, Washington Allston. In fact, historian William Marchione says he believes Allston is the only community in the country named in honor of an artist.
Allston was born in Nov. 1779 in South Carolina, and grew up in Newport, R.I. He started drawing at a young age. In a letter compiled in his biography, he reflected that “I used to draw before I left Carolina, at six years of age,” and he also used to enjoy “making little landscapes about the roots of an old tree in the country.”
Allston attended Harvard, where he “gave himself up to painting and poetry,” as classmate and friend Leonard Jarvis wrote in a letter.
In the same letter, Jarvis also remarked upon Allston’s affable personality, writing that “those who hated each other most heartily—and there were good haters in our class—and who agreed in nothing else, united in respectful and kindly feelings toward him.”
Allston evidently made quite the impression on his fellow students.
“His countenance, once seen, could never be forgotten,” continued Jarvis, praising Allston’s “smooth, high, open forehead, surrounded by a profusion of dark, wavy hair, his delicately formed nose, his peculiarly expressive mouth, his large, lustrous, melting eye.” Allston had a face, according to his friend, which was “irresistibly attractive, and which, united with his gentle, unassuming manners, secured him the good will of all his classmates.”
Allston flourished at Harvard, but was less adept at finding a direction for the future.
On the one hand, Jarvis, Allston’s stepfather, was a physician and “was earnest with him to follow that profession,” as Jarvis recalls. But his filial duty was at odds with what was already being called “his genius.”
Ultimately, Allston could not resist the pull of the latter course. He continued painting after college, graduating from Harvard in 1800 and traveling around Europe to hone his artistic abilities for more than a decade.
During this time, Allston earned praise for the way he conveyed mood in his landscape works, even garnering the moniker of America’s first Romantic painter. In addition, he sharpened his writing skills, publishing a collection of poetry called “The Sylphs of the Season with Other Poems,” as well as a Gothic novel called “Monaldi.”
His admirers included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Margaret Fuller, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, who described Allston as “an angel of light.”
Joseph Henry Green praised Allston in letters, writing, “Who, indeed, who had enjoyed the inestimable privilege of converse with such a man, could ever forget the purity, the depth and simplicity of his mind?”
In 1808, Allston married his first wife, Ann Channing, who later passed away in 1815. In 1818, he moved to Cambridge, where he stayed for 25 years. He remarried in 1830 to Martha Dana.
Allston had sacrificed his wealth to fuel his passion for his artistic work. “The love I bear my art you well know; no one could love it more; and I have given proof of it in the sacrifice I have made to it of my fortune,” he wrote in an 1832 letter to a friend, John Stevens Cogdell.
Allston died in 1843, at age 63. He was buried in The Old Burying Ground, located in Harvard Square next to First Parish Church.
In 1867, when the Boston and Albany Railroad opened a rail station and post office in East Brighton, the neighborhood of Allston came into being. Some have even claimed that the town was named specifically for Allston’s painting, “Fields West of Boston,” which included an illustration of the fields in Allston.
After Allston’s death, John Greenough wrote in a letter, “I feel that the memory or fame of Allston can never die. I feel that the years to come will raise a proud monument to him in every heart that appreciates the noble art to which he devoted all the best powers of his intellectual, moral, and physical nature.”
Evidently, Greenough’s prediction came true—far more tangibly than he imagined. Today, 29,000 people call this living monument to Washington Allston their home.

In the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, a smashed video game console is worth more than a working one.
The department’s reimbursement policy refunds students for materials used in art projects, including annihilated electronics in some cases. But strict rules apply—anything a student could use for personal gain after the project, like a working Xbox, cannot be paid for by VES.
Students say that financial constraints can pose major obstacles for completing VES assignments. Purchased materials can often enhance—and are sometimes necessary for—students’ artistic endeavors. The VES reimbursement policy exists to alleviate these concerns about price.
The department resides within the Carpenter Center, a monstrosity sitting atop the frozen ground right outside the wrought iron gates of Harvard Yard. It rises like a concrete stalagmite from a deep valley, looming large against the grey Cambridge skyline.

The office of Financial Administrator Yaneris A. Briggs is secluded behind swinging doors. In contrast to the open floor plan in the rest of the building, Briggs works in a small white room, closed off on all sides except for a glass door. She explains the subtleties of the policy.
The VES department’s reimbursement policy has existed for over a decade. Any materials purchased for class can be paid for, within a price range set by teaching staff. This system works to alleviate financial worries from students. It allows them to create art and do coursework uninhibited.
The policy is more complicated for individual projects like senior theses. For art made outside of a formal class, the administration has set up a list of rules and regulations that students must abide by, all enclosed in a huge book given to thesis students at the start of the academic year.
The VES department is willing to repay students only if items are entirely consumed by the art and do not have any potential for future personal use. Uber rides are reimbursed in full, as are cheap “props” like paper or boxes. The department will not pay for other items such as small drills, though, because they can be used later. The department also will not pay for costumes, which can be returned from where they were bought. Food for the cast and crew of a film is fine, but a hot plate for melting wax is not.
Hard drives under $100 can be reimbursed for up to half their price. Electronics are sporadically reimbursed, depending on the project. The only way to ensure the department will refund electronic devices is to smash the appliance into oblivion in the process of creating art. Begrudgingly, the department will give students the check for these mangled devices, but they now encourage students to buy used machines that don’t cost much money.
Art has rarely ever existed solely for its creative contributions to society, and it always comes with a price tag. VES determines that price based on the market costs of materials that were used in the creation of the art, but student artists like Serena A. Eggers ’17 must decide how to place monetary value on abstractions such as passion, imagination, and vision.
“My thesis consisted of physical paintings, so those had a monetary value based purely on the materials and the time that went into creating them,” Eggers says. “They also had an added, less calculable value based on what they evoked and how much they mattered to me and to others.”
To Alex R. Cohen ’18, a student of Studio Arts and Film, money poses a significant hurdle in the industry he hopes to join. Cohen buzzes with energy as he sits perched at the edge of his chair. He’s on his way to submit an overdue reimbursement form, hoping that the department will be lenient about the 30-day post-purchase deadline.
“You can’t have something that is pure art and no business,” Cohen says. “When what you want to contribute to the world is something a little bit more abstract in terms of its societal benefits, commodification of art is inevitable. It’s capitalism, you know.”
For Cohen, the commercialization of art exists as a necessity. In a sense, the limitations of the policy prepare students for a life of professional artistry. Sacrifices of artistic vision are constantly made due to affordability.
“Use your talent,” Cohen says. “But you need to support yourself. There has to be money coming from somewhere.”

Standard protests usually include some combination of homemade posters, megaphones and other freedom-of-assembly staples. At Boston rallies, though, it’s not uncommon to find a tuba or two thrown in the mix. If the protest is big enough, it may even play host to an entire marching band, comprising drums covered in paint and rainbow duct tape, woodwinds wrapped in ribbons of all colors, and signs hanging from trombone slides.
That’s because the city’s protest scene is frequented by the Boston Area Brigade of Activist Musicians, a self-described “fire brigade of musicians” that can show up at any protest at a moment’s notice.
Their goal, according to player Catherine T. Finn–identifiable by her purple plastic trombone–is to support the people protesting. “We really put the focus on the organizers who are setting up these protests, and we really want to be of support for them,” she says.

BABAM was founded in 2016, and arose from an already-existing Boston tradition called the HONK! Festival. The festival is a gathering of activist street bands who come to Somerville for a weekend of music and protest. BABAM’s founders wanted to create a group of musicians who could go to demonstrations at a moment’s notice, instead of just once a year; hence, BABAM was born.
Reebee Garofalo, who got his Ed.D. from Harvard in 1974, is one of BABAM’s founders. He noticed that many bands in the area play during marches, but that “it’s often very difficult for a single, self-contained band to mount enough players to make it worthwhile,” Garofalo says. “So the plan became, we’ll post a limited repertoire of songs, so everyone knows what songs to play, and whoever can show up is a band.”
The players are an eclectic mix of professional musicians and people who haven’t seriously played since high school. New musicians interested in BABAM can even learn to play at the School of HONK, a program offered through the HONK! Festival. “Anyone who wants to come can play with them,” Finn says.
BABAM’s musical style can best be described as improvisational jazz, though several other labels could apply. Their performance style is heavily influenced by New Orleans street bands, especially Mardi Gras performances. “It’s a celebratory, upbeat kind of music,” Finn says.
“We just add a lot of sound to a protest that’s already happening,” percussionist Candace Esslinger says. “You’re going to hear voices, you’re going to hear music, you’re going to hear drumming, and you’re going to get a lot of attention.”
As Garofalo observes, the music does more than increase the volume of an already-loud protest. “I think brass street bands have an enormous amount to offer to demonstrations,” he says. “The music always kicks the energy up a notch, and because we’re mobile and acoustic, we can play anywhere we want.”
In fact, BABAM’s style can explicitly lend itself to helping protesters amplify their dialogue. “One of the styles we’ve been developing over the years is to play songs in such a way that they lend themselves to chants,” he says. “So we will play the melody line of a song and drop out the melody instruments and leave the low brass and percussion while the organizers of the demo do one of their chants over the rhythm. So we can really augment the message in that kind of way.”
“The people there are very happy that we come,” Esslinger says. “Whether it’s two of us or 10 or 15, people seem to appreciate us.”
The group officially styles itself as “non-partisan,” but Finn also notes that “We are progressive, so the things we tend to hear from are progressive groups.” The gigs range from small union protests to large events like the March for Science. At the Women’s March last January, a sousaphone bell donned a 26-inch wide pussy hat.
Last August, BABAM performed at the counterprotest to the alt-right “Free Speech” rally that took place at the Boston Common a few days after the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. Finn says she felt particularly excited about this gig. “We’ve had a lot of positive reactions, but the best reaction we’ve had ever was when we did the counterprotest when the neo-Nazis came to town,” she says.
BABAM became the unofficial leaders of the counter protestors when they moved toward the front of the parade. By the end of the march, “it almost broke out into a street party,” she says. “Even though we had been playing for about four hours at that point, it was like there was this electric current that came through the crowd, and it was just amazing.”
These kinds of experiences keep the musicians signing up for gig after gig. According to Esslinger, “The activism, the music making, the community coming together for a common cause, supporting people and bringing attention to matters that are important, and also making people happy. That’s what BABAM is about.”

3 a.m. is the cruellest hour, breeding
Burritos out of the dead night, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull guacamole with gloved hands, feeding

The Stool I sat on, like a burnished throne,
Glowed on the tile, where the seat
Held up by legs wrought with bare metal
From which I saw the hot sauce
(Burning burning burning burning).
In vials of plastic and coloured glass
Unstoppered, lurked Jefe’s strange synthetic spice,
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
And drowned the tongue in sauce; stirred by the roasted veggies
That languished amongst the tomato, the hot sauce descended
In fat drops that flung themselves into the burrito,
Disturbing the pattern on the sour cream.
But
O O O O that Corona Light
HURRY UP PLEASE WITH LIME
The Phoenician flames of fluorescence
Reflect light upon the table as
The soft edges of my burrito roll over it,
From satin tortilla poured Salsa—Mild or Hot in rich profusion.
Huge meat chunks fed with Refried Pinto Beans
Burned light brown and dark brown,
Framed by the salsa verde,
In whose saucy spice Carne Molida Picante swam.
Above the folded foil was displayed
As though a window gave upon the savory scene
The smiling burrito forced, by the barbarous poet
So rudely forced into the gullet.
Belches, short and infrequent, were exhaled.

The tuba player is the first to arrive at the intersection of Cambridge Street and the River Street Bridge.
He is here to boost morale for the rally-goers, a welcome contribution on this 22-degree morning, colder with windchill, colder still in the shadow of the Allston DoubleTree Suites hotel. At 8:02 a.m. the crowd is two dozen strong, and traffic is slow on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Traffic is always slow on the Massachusetts Turnpike.
“Let’s hear it for Kirk on the tuba!” Allstonian Galen M. Mook, clad in an electric blue parka and bike helmet, has the megaphone. “And all the transit advocates on the corner!”
More rally-goers in brightly colored parkas are waving hand-painted signs toward the gridlock. “And all the transit advocates on the median!” A small cohort of shivering, sign-wielding locals cheer from across several lanes of traffic.
Despite the bitter cold, the “Transit Not Traffic” Rally on Jan. 25 is in full swing. This rally was organized by People’s Pike, a coalition of Allston residents and other locals advocating for functional transit. The group plans to march to Governor Charlie Baker’s reelection headquarters on Lincoln Street in Allston to voice the coalition’s frustrations directly.

The mood is vaguely celebratory after an exciting announcement from Harvard the day prior: the University pledged $50 million toward the construction of West Station—a long-awaited transit stop—and an additional $8 million toward an interim station meant to satisfy transit needs in the meantime. Harvard owns more land in Boston than in Cambridge, and has huge power to set the course of the neighborhood over the next several decades. Allstonians have been asking Harvard to front the total cost of the station—around $90 million—but for now, the commitment is appreciated.
No one knows how long “the meantime” is, but based on this morning’s traffic, protesters say a solution is sorely needed. Weeks prior, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation released a report outlining potential impacts of the upcoming I-90 Interchange Improvement Project. The project plans to realign the “structurally deficient, functionally obsolete” stretch of the Mass Pike to make it safer and more efficient.
This will effectively reconfigure the neighborhood. The project has been described as “multi-modal,” meaning it will plan for pedestrians, bikers, and transit riders, as well as drivers.
According to the report, West Station forms part of Phase 2 of the I-90 Interchange project. This means it is slated for completion in 2040. Some Allston residents interpret this timeline to mean “never.”
“Now the governor has to act,” says Stephen H. Kaiser, a traffic and transit engineer at the rally. Kaiser, who is in his seventies, boasts the rare qualification of having actually read MassDOT’s report, which clocks in at several thousand pages, including appendices. “But Harvard has done the right thing. For today, for this week, for this month, they’ve done the right thing.”
The tuba player’s keys are beginning to freeze. A tiny protester whimpers. His mother pulls him close: “Face mommy’s belly and then I’ll make the sign protect you.” She angles her sign to block the wind, but her four-year-old resists. “Oh, but you want to see!”
He is one of several children holding signs before heading off to school. This neighborhood is home to college students and elementary school students alike, recent Boston University graduates and locals who’ve lived in the area for sixty-plus years. All kinds of Allstonians are affected by the congestion—and proposed development—around I-90, and a multi-generational group of neighbors has stepped up.
This is not a new scene—Allstonians have grown accustomed to pushing back. Residents often advocate for their neighborhood amidst the various agendas and development projects of Harvard, the city, and the state. But in 2018, everything seems to be coming to a head.
One rally sign reading “Ragtag Transit Advocate” wryly reclaims a moniker bestowed by a Boston Globe columnist. “A lot of us have been laughing at that,” Alana Olsen, a People’s Pike affiliate, remarks later. “Sometimes I make the joke that I’m just waiting for my honorary masters in planning after going to all of these many, many meetings.”
“It’s almost like the neighborhood feels pinched.”
Mook stands at the corner of Windom and Hopedale, bike characteristically in tow. It’s early evening on Jan. 25—the “Transit Not Traffic” rally was this morning, which Mook deemed a success, even though the cold prevented the group from marching all the way to Governor Baker’s office.
Mook says he is well-acquainted with this neighborhood. He’s lived in the Allston-Brighton area for 14 years—which he’s quick to point out is not a long time, compared to others. Mook is the marketing and advocacy associate for Landry’s Bicycles, a member of the Allston I-90 Interchange Task Force, and a central figure among People’s Pike transit advocates.
He’s gesturing down Windom Street, “the street that’s basically under attack… from the construction that’s going to happen with the Enterprise Research Campus.”
Mook refers to the Harvard development project currently on the horizon. The enterprise research campus is billed as a “regional innovation hub” and will be home to both residential and commercial buildings.
“You wanna play street hockey on this street, right?” says Mook, pointing to the now-deserted road. Windom Street is flanked with street-parked cars, but otherwise offers a perfect street-hockey location. This makes the thought of hundreds of cars cutting through this street every morning more jarring—and it’s perhaps only a fraction of what’s to come. The development of the enterprise research campus would usher 1,700 new people into Allston every morning.
“Windom Street is actually very worried right now,” Mook says. The landscape, he points out, demonstrates Allston’s position at the intersection of powerful institutions, and the problems that arise at that intersection. The street suffers from highway congestion caused by the Massachusetts interstate system and exacerbated by Harvard’s development. It lies adjacent to Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus, and sits in the looming shadow of a monolithic Boston University building.
A flashing light interrupts Mook’s description of the neighborhood: Priscilla R. Anderson turns the street corner, her bike helmet’s safety light piercing the almost-dark. She immediately asks Mook how the rally was (“so cold”) and introduces herself as a neighbor, apologizing both for interrupting and for being unable to attend the morning’s rally. The two have a brief aside, both holding bikes, to exchange information on enterprise research campus meetings and comment periods.
Anderson is an Allstonian, and moved to the region in 2001 to work as a preservation librarian for Harvard University Library. Because of this connection, she trusts Harvard more than many of her neighbors do and considers herself a moderate voice in the conversation.
As Olsen explains, “To be a transit advocate in Allston is to constantly be talking to at least three major audiences.” In addition to working with People’s Pike, Olsen is the former executive director of Allston Village Main Streets, a neighborhood community development organization. At neighborhood meetings, she is often one of the youngest and most vocal people in the room.
The first audience she’s referring to is the City of Boston, which manages the development process in all of the city’s infrastructure. The second is the state and Commonwealth, which oversees Mass Pike, as well as stretches of various major roads in Allston. The third, she says, is “always Harvard and sometimes B.U.” She calls them the “giants at the table” due to their considerable property and influence with the city. This is part of the reason why Harvard has pledged the money for West Station—the neighborhood expects community benefits as Harvard breaks more ground in Allston.
Here, Olsen makes a distinction. “Harvard as an academic institution, and Harvard, when I say Harvard,” she says, “Are not at all the same thing. I think about Harvard as the person who won at Monopoly. They own the entire Monopoly board.”
The best advice Olsen ever got, she says, came from a state transit employee. “He looked at me and said, ‘Alana, Harvard was here before America was a country. Harvard will be here after America is a country. They have a 200-year development timeline. You can’t treat this in your mind the way that you would treat negotiating with someone who’s trying to build a 47-unit apartment building.’”
Ari Ofsevit is a Cambridgeport-based transit activist who has run a transit blog for the past ten years: “Something that a surprisingly non-zero number of people read,” he says. In addition to dealing with several institutional entities, he cites geographic location as a source of the neighborhood’s grievances.
“Allston has always been a place people are trying to get to, and since the turnpike was built it’s a place where a lot of cars try to get,” he says. “Which means that Allston gets the worst of both worlds. They don’t have good access themselves, but they have to deal with everyone else trying to get through them. They get traffic, but they don’t have that accessibility.”
Allstonians make up only a fraction of the daily congestion on the Pike. Commuters from all around the Boston area pass through Allston, and residents are quick to emphasize that West Station is not just a gift to Allston, but a matter of  regional significance. The area’s lack of public transportation makes commuting by train slow and tedious, so people drive. West Station would give Allstonians transit access—and get drivers off the roads.
The impassioned locals are not alone in their fight for functional transit. Major transit and infrastructure-related advocacy organizations in the Boston area have thrown support behind Allstonians. On Jan. 17, five Massachusetts politicians, including Representative Michael Moran, released a comment letter urging Harvard to pay the full cost of West Station—a gesture transit advocates welcomed after MassDOT’s 2040 projection for the station’s completion. City Councillor At-Large Michelle Wu ’07 released a comment letter on Feb. 5, after Harvard’s pledge of $58 million, that asked for West Station to be built in the first stage of the I-90 project instead of the second.
“I think it’s really great that there’s the recognition from all parties involved that this is serious and requires investment, and Harvard coming to the table and increasing their commitment makes a big difference,” Wu says. “So I’m hopeful that MassDOT will see what great support there is for doing something that is comprehensive but also immediate to improve transportation in the area.”
In an emailed statement, MassDOT spokesperson Patrick Marvin wrote the roll-out of the project is contingent on “assessments of projected regional development, ridership demand and impacts to existing service.”
On Jan. 22—days before Harvard’s $58 million pledge—the Impact Advisory Group, composed of Allston residents and Harvard officials, convenes at Harvard’s i-Lab to discuss plans for the Enterprise Research Campus. Allstonian Joyce Radnor is in attendance, and she’s annoyed. The residents have been skeptical of Harvard’s proposals: too many parking lots and not enough transit options.
To some residents, Allston’s long-standing, fraught relationship with Harvard presents an opportunity for neighborhood improvement. For others, the encroachment is inevitable and West Station is the consolation prize. Despite Harvard’s power on paper, university representatives and Allstonians squabble and negotiate in meetings like an old married couple.
An IAG member has been diligently writing down attendees’ questions on a whiteboard. “I was wondering about directing questions to the audience instead of to the IAG,” she says.
“We’re not the audience,” Radnor mutters to the woman seated beside her in the crowd. “We’re the neighbors.”
Her use of the word neighbor is, of course, literally true. (“We are neighbors. You know, we see each other on Halloween,” Olsen says.) But the ubiquity of this word in conversations around advocacy in Allston hints at its rhetorical significance.
“If you’re just a neighborhood person, and you have to go and deal with an institution like Harvard University… It’s something about claiming our space at the table,” Olsen says. “We are important. We are just as important.”
And besides, Radnor says later, “They should be way more entertaining if I’m the audience.”
Radnor bought her Windom Street home in Allston in 1995, but traces her neighborhood advocacy involvement to the events of June 1997. That’s when Harvard announced that between 1988 and 1994, they had spent $88 million and acquired 52.6 acres of land in Allston, unbeknownst to Allstonians, the previous landowners, or even the Mayor of the City of Boston.

Using the local Beal Companies as an agent, Harvard bought up wide swaths of land in secret. When this came to light, Allstonians feared dramatic changes in their neighborhood. Mayor Thomas M. Menino called the purchase “the highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”
“We had a new neighbor, and it was a big neighbor,” Radnor says. She began going to local meetings.
“I have viewed it as a responsibility,” says Radnor. “This is my neighborhood… You don’t get to complain if you didn’t show up. But, I will tell you, the exhaustion sets in.”
Radnor says she tolerates the SEAS complex. “Those are institutional uses that in the long run are nice additions to the neighborhood,” she says. But the enterprise research campus, which will bring “a bunch of commercial buildings” near Radnor’s home, is “beyond comprehension” to her. After two decades of years of experience dealing with the University, she says she’s resigned.
“The minute they start, you can’t stop ‘em,” she says.
“Harvard should take their lead from the unwritten neighborhood handbook, which is you treat your neighbors with respect,” Radnor continues. “And if you’re having a party, you either invite them, or at least let them know you’re having a party.”
The University acknowledges its position as a neighbor, and maintains a sense of accountability for the area. When Harvard made its financial pledge, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp released a comment letter to MassDOT encouraging the early construction of West Station. Following that announcement, Lapp submitted a comment letter on behalf of the University, directed at Secretary Matthew A. Beaton of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, outlining their intentions for involvement with the project.
“We are the landowner here and this is an instance–and is always an instance—where Harvard is going to be a neighbor,” University spokesperson Kevin Casey says. “We want to be on the basis of trust, so that accountability is really important to us.”
The concurrence of the Enterprise Research Campus and the I-90 Interchange Project means it’s a pivotal moment for the neighborhood. The sheer scale and long-term planning of the I-90 Project will lead to a substantial reconfiguration of the Allston landscape. It’s a matter of shaping a new neighborhood altogether.
Allstonians say the new population density brought by the enterprise research campus only makes the need for transit more critical. Harvard’s presence complicates matters, but no one denies that it signifies opportunity. If neighbors put in the hours now, then—for the first time in a half-century—there is the possibility of transit in Allston.
Alana Olsen cannot sit still.
Dozens of neighbors sit in the community meeting room at the Honan-Allston Library. It’s a few days after the “Transit Not Traffic” rally, but this scene better represents what it means to be a “neighbor” in practice. Allstonians often describe a sense of exhaustion associated with the perpetual cycle of community meetings.

James E. Gillooly, the deputy commissioner at the the Boston Transportation Department, and Warren O’Reilly, the Allston-Brighton Neighborhood Liaison from the Mayor’s Office, stand at the front. They’re here to discuss the traffic on Windom Street.
Olsen is darting around the room. She clarifies, interprets, probes, and plants herself next to different residents in the crowd to confer. Sometimes she paces in the back.
Commuters on I-90 have been cutting through neighborhood streets. Neighbors can’t pull out of their driveways in the morning on Windom Street, and the impending construction on I-90 will only worsen the congestion.
Maybe “Residents Only” signs can go up on side streets, someone suggests. But what about when your cousin or oil delivery man comes, another objects, and anyway, no one follows those. Residents recall an earlier attempt with these signs, and a moment of vigilante transit justice. A woman would stand on her Hopedale Street front porch and hold a video camera up to passing cars. “And people would panic,” an attendee recalls to laughter. “There was no tape in the camera!”
At the front of the room a woman raises her hand. She’s from a different neighborhood but has traffic frustrations of her own. This triggers murmurs around the room. A hand goes up in the back: “Can we keep this to our neighborhood?” Another woman interjects in response. “Because this is a neighborhood meeting and she doesn’t even live in our neighborhood.”
“We’ve had three meetings for your neighborhood,” O’Reilly tells the Allstonian.
Up front sits Tony P. D’Isidoro, a lifelong Allston resident who still lives in the Raymond Street home his parents bought after his father’s return from World War II. He collects community titles like stamps: President of the Allston Civic Association. Member of the IAG. Member of the I-90 Task Force. Former captain of the Brighton High School baseball team. His biggest claim to fame is his “Community Notes,” he says, referring to his twice-weekly newsletter.
Until the 1960s, the Allston-Brighton area was home to three rail stations. But D’Isidoro remembers when the Mass. Pike was first extended through Allston in 1964, resulting in the removal of all the neighborhood’s commuter rail stops. “You have to realize,” he laments, “We got punished for being where we were.”
“The other traumatic experience that really raised activism was Barry’s Corner,” he adds. In 1961, the then-Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city’s urban planning body, announced plans to demolish a small subset of the neighborhood. Letters went out to residents that their houses were to be taken by eminent domain. Many resisted. “There were protests every night,” D’Isidoro says.
“We heard stories at the end—it got so bad at the end that a few of the people that were holding out went out to go shopping. When they went out, [the BRA] went in and changed the locks so they could knock the houses down. They got pennies on the dollar,” he says.
After a lifetime in Allston, D’Isidoro remains a self-proclaimed optimist. He says he thinks West Station is coming soon. But, he adds, “We’re getting weary. We’ll call it development-weary.”
With weariness comes savviness, Olsen notes. “In Allston, we’re certainly having conversations at a much higher level than is normal, just because we’ve been doing this for so long,” she says. “You learn so much every time you go through this development process.”
There is a sense of intergenerational solidarity in the work of Allston’s neighbors. D’Isidoro warmly commends the contingent of young people focused on transportation advocacy. “When Galen or [other young people] speak at the I-90 Task Force, they’re taken very seriously because you can tell that they’ve done their homework,” he says.
Harry E. Mattison meanders in front of the DoubleTree Suites hotel, pushing his bike along. He is the newspapers’ favorite neighbor, a member of several task forces and a vocal critic of Harvard, the city, and the state. Mattison recently made television and radio appearances on WGBH and WBUR discussing the I-90 Interchange Project. He is also, perhaps, Allston’s resident cynic.
Mattison moved to Allston after college in 1994 and became involved in transit advocacy after observing the neighborhood’s unsafe streets. “When people get killed in your neighborhood walking and riding a bike, you know, you think maybe we should do something.” He rattles off three deaths in recent memory.
Walking his bike down Cambridge Street, Mattison gestures toward the site of the future enterprise research campus. “It would be great for all this land to be developed, for there to be more housing and jobs,” he says—with the caveat that he first wants to see transit plans firmly in place.
The difference between being a transit advocate in the mid-’90s and now? “Ten or 20 years of being promised things,” Mattison says, “And being shown these watercolor pictures of, ‘Look at how great it’s going to be!’ But then you spend all this time seeing it actually not happen. So you can’t just come and draw West Station on a map anymore.”
Mattison is also skeptical of 75-year plans. “Presidents come and go at Harvard and mayors come and go and governors come and go.”
What’s more, he adds, “If they’re telling us, ‘After you and all your children are dead it’s going to be really nice,’ that’s not super interesting.”
He points out the trash that litters the side of the Turnpike, and mentions filling three bags of trash on the street over the weekend. He points to the bike lanes that are now habitually used for ad-hoc vehicle parking, and recalls attending the months of meetings they required.
Despite the hours he puts in, Mattison, like most Allstonians, tends to avoid identifying as an “activist.”
The more commonplace word is “advocate.” Allstonians are advocates and neighbors. They want to better the neighborhood.
“My status as a neighbor is very important; it demonstrates that I have a very big stake in the game,” says Anderson, preservation librarian for Harvard University Library. “I have a lot to lose and a lot to gain. I’m not an activist for a cause, there are a lot of causes... I feel like I’m focused on promoting the health and success of our neighborhood.”
John A. Bruno is a lifelong Allston resident (“I was born on Western Avenue,” he quips.) He has sat on a number of selection committees, co-authored Article 51 (the zoning document for Allston and Brighton) and is a man of many task forces. Most notably, he chairs the Harvard-Allston Task Force. “I have a pretty good stake in the community,” says Bruno. This seems like an understatement.
Still, he reasons, “‘activist’ means that I’m a proponent for one side only, and I’m not that person. So I would be more of an advocate.”
And yet, they go to the meetings. They spend the unpaid hours reading the technical transit briefings. There is a sense, in talking to the neighbors, that the word “activist” is absent because it is implicit.
Long-term life in Allston yields a particular breed of citizenship. The neighborhood sits at the junction of Harvard, the city, and the state; nestled between Cambridge and Boston and between Boston and its Western suburbs. Residents who are invested in the character of the neighborhood must be constantly advocating for the endurance of this character—a perennial advocacy.
After a several-minute-long digression on Allston’s inefficient bus routes, Bruno momentarily switches gears.
“Maybe I am an activist.”
Standing beside Mass Pike, Mattison retrieves yet another tale of failed planning from his mental archives. He begins another anecdote, but interrupts himself before Cambridge Street intersects with Harvard Street: “We should cross here, because crossing farther up is where that guy got killed a couple years ago.”
On the other side of the street is a biker who turns out to be Mook. He greets Mattison warmly before zooming off to MIT. Down Harvard Street, Mattison carries on. He describes a request a decade earlier for a sound barrier wall beside the interstate, to which the state agreed. After a series of planning meetings, a fence went up. “They didn’t build a noise wall,” Mattison says. “They put up a wood fence like you’d build in your backyard.”
A month later, he recalls, during the first snow of the winter, snow flew off of a plow and knocked down part of the fence. Residents called state authorities, who came and repaired it.
“A couple of weeks later there was another storm,” he says, “And it knocked the entire fence down like dominoes. Just the whole thing collapsed. And then they came and took it away and left.”
“It’s sort of like Charlie Brown and Lucy, and she pulls the football away,” he says.
Before mounting his bike in front of the Honan-Allston Library, Mattison pauses. “Am I too jaded?” he asks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 20, 2018 at 1:45 a.m.
Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has piloted a new model for service provision to reduce the wait time for students who request therapy appointments—though a high volume of requests has continued to slow response time.
Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira sent an email to College students last week updating them about the changes to the service provision system. In an interview earlier this month, Barreira said the new model is meant to address the “deluge of need that was coming” to UHS.
Barreira said Harvard has seen an uptick in the number of students who are admitted to psychiatric units in recent years. When Barreira started working at Harvard around 14 years ago, 30 students per year entered psychiatric units, he said, compared to 55 in the fall of 2017 alone.
“If you looked at the slope, it's an increasing number of admissions, increasing number of students being admitted for suicidal behaviors too, that’s also just another measure of severity,” he said.
Throughout the month of January, CAMHS employees undertook an “exhaustive review” of the way they provide services, according to Barreira. The staffers ultimately decided institutional change was needed.
“The way counseling and mental health services are structured doesn’t meet the need of contemporary students, so just adding, adding, adding isn’t sufficient—other things have to happen,” Barreira said.
CAMHS evaluated data from previous years to create the new system for treating students. The target wait time for the updated model comprises 48 hours between the time a student requests an appointment and the time they are seen by a team of CAMHS clinicians.
“The CAMHS triage team will work to respond within 48 hours of your booking request to determine the best options for you,” Barreira wrote in the email to students Friday. “For urgent care, mental health clinicians are available for same day appointments.”
After the 48-hour period, according to Barreira, a CAMHS employee is supposed to call or schedule a 30-minute face-to-face conversation with the patient. The student will then have a counseling session with a mental health professional five days after that initial short conversation.
Because this mental health service falls under HUHS, students will have to pay no additional cost, Barreira said.
Even with the new system, though, CAMHS has struggled to meet the high volume of student requests for counseling, he said.
“We haven’t reached that goal yet because instead of 100 a week we’ve got 140 a week, so you know everything has to be examined and then adjusted,” Barreira said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 20, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that CAMHS employees are supposed to schedule a 20-minute face-to-face triage consultations with patients. In fact, CAMHS employees are supposed to schedule 30-minute face-to-face triage consultations with patients.

UPDATED: February 22, 2018 at 7:46 p.m.
The Harvard School of Dental Medicine has surpassed its $8 million capital campaign goal, reaching  $10.1 million in donations during the four-year campaign that ends this June.
The school launched its capital campaign, titled “It Begins with Me,” in April 2014. At the time, Dental School administrators said they aimed to devote $6 million toward financial aid for its students and $2 million toward public oral health programs.
Wanda Mock, associate dean for development and alumni affairs at the Dental School, said 1,300 donors have contributed to the current $10.1 million total. The school has about 2,500 living alumni, who together gave 26 percent of all donations collected during Fiscal Year 2016.
Foundations and companies also accounted for 10 percent of the donations to the school, but the largest source of donations comprised individuals unaffiliated with the school, who gave 64 percent of the 2016 funds.
The capital campaign also benefited from a $2 million gift from Gordon Macdonald, who spent a decade at the school, and his wife Ruth.
“The campaign has accelerated the School’s ability to educate value-based and service-oriented future leaders in the oral health profession,” Mock wrote in an emailed statement.
Mock also wrote the donations given to the campaign “will touch the lives of the School community and its students for generations to come.”
In 2014, the school didn’t have the funds to provide all of its students competitive financial aid packages, according to Mock. Annual tuition at the Dental School is currently $59,800, and the total cost of attendance can exceed $100,000 each year.
In 2013, the average student graduating with a D.M.D. from Harvard had $162,000 in debt. Students completing D.M.Sc. and M.M.Sc. degrees, which cover specialties like orthodontistry, averaged $243,000 in debt at graduation.
The campaign’s case statement, a document released at the start of the campaign, specifically mentioned three types of aid donations would support: D.M.D. scholarships, fellowships for postdoctoral students in specialty programs, and a fund for Dean’s Scholars, who often pursue careers as academic researchers.
Mock wrote the campaign has enabled $2.7 million in additional financial aid.
The University-wide capital campaign has raised over $8 billion in the last four years, exceeding its $6.5 billion goal. Administrators at other schools, like Harvard Medical School, have previously said financial aid fundraising has lagged behind other development goals.
The Dental School is among the smallest of Harvard’s twelve degree-granting schools, with 137 students in its D.M.D. program and 103 students in D.M.Sc.  and  M.M.Sc. programs.

A $25 million donation to the Divinity School will enable a complete renovation of the main campus building, administrators announced last week.
Artist and philanthropist Susan S. Swartz and her husband, investor James R. Swartz '64, have donated the largest gift in the school’s 200-year history. Susan S. Swartz is an impressionist painter who serves on the Divinity School’s dean’s council. James Swartz is the co-founder of the global venture capital firm Accel. Both have pursued philanthropic initiatives in the past, including previous donations to the Divinity school.
Hannah Peters, the associate dean for development and external relations at the Divinity School, said the gift will mainly be used to fund the Andover Project, a long-desired renovation of the school’s main campus building, Andover Hall.
“It is for our campus community, for projects that have been our priorities for a long time, and the gift catapults them into action,” Peters said.
Executive Dean of the Divinity School Patricia M. Byrne said the goals of the project include updating multimedia facilities, increasing levels of energy-efficiency, and creating new spaces for students and faculty.
Though the school provides plenty of events and other opportunities for conversations, according to Byrne, there is not yet a lot of public space where students can engage with each other after class.
“We’re trying to create new gathering spaces for the students and connect it, visually and physically, to library spaces, and the cafe space, and public gathering spaces, so that we have a community structure of the campus,” Byrne said.
The Divinity School has been a leader of sustainability efforts among the Harvard schools, Byrne said. It achieved LEED Gold certification in 2009, which includes multiple indices related to energy, indoor environmental quality, and water efficiency.
“We will be able to revise this treasured building as an energy-efficient building, giving it new and extended life,” Byrne said.
“The infrastructure of our building is somewhat out of date, we have updated a number of individual rooms within the building, but we need to do a better job for that,” Peters said. “It was designed as a Protestant seminary in the early 1900s. It is 2018 and the school has a very different mission now.”
“This is a signal moment for HDS, and we are all very grateful to Susan and Jim for their remarkable support,” University President Drew Faust said in a Divinity School press release last week.
Susan Swartz said she and her husband wanted to expand on previous gifts and “to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Dean David Hempton and President Drew Faust.”
Faust will step down from the University's top job in 2018 after over a decade in the role; Harvard recently announced Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow will serve as her successor.
“We are thrilled to be their partners in ensuring that this unique and historic building will become an innovation lab for the future of religious education and ethical leadership,” Swartz said.

When President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow assumes the University’s top job in July, he’ll add environmental economics to a long list of fields that Harvard’s academics-turned-presidents have pursued—ranging from theology to Renaissance literature to analytical chemistry.
Bacow, who earned a doctorate of public policy and a degree in law from Harvard, taught urban studies and planning and environmental studies at MIT from 1977 to 1998 before entering the school’s administration, first as chancellor and then as chair of the MIT faculty. Later, he became president of Tufts.
Over the course of his academic career, Bacow published two books and various articles on environmental studies, economics, and higher education policy. His first book, published 1982 and titled “Bargaining for Job Safety and Health,” explores" how labor and management work together and against each other to abate occupational hazards,” according to the MIT Press.
“Environmental Dispute Resolution," which he co-wrote with retired Harvard Business School Professor Michael Wheeler in 1984, examines the formulation of environmental policy, as well as negotiations between the government, environmental advocates, and regulated entities.
Health Policy Researcher Craig V. Thornton, who reviewed “Bargaining for Job Safety and Health,” said it covered “a really interesting" field of study.
"[It's] a really important topic for a Harvard president,” Thornton said.
Though Bacow holds more administrative experience than his immediate predecessors Drew G. Faust and Lawrence H. Summers, he has published a smaller body of scholarship, boasting considerably fewer academic articles than either of the other two scholars.
Faust continued working as a civil war historian right up until she moved in to the president's office in Massachusetts Hall. Before assuming the University’s top job, Faust was Dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study and simultaneously held a professorship.
By contrast, it has been 20 years since Bacow worked as an academic. 
Before her appointment to the presidency, Faust also published eight books, one of which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist.
Harvard’s 27th president,  Summers, was “the first social scientist ever to receive the annual Alan T. Waterman Award of the National Science Foundation,” according to Harvard’s website.
University of Michigan Professor John E. Tropman, who reviewed an article Bacow co-wrote, “Facility Siting and Public Opposition,” said Bacow’s work in administration left him less time for scholarship.
“If you have the kind of jobs he’s had, there’s a cost to that,” Tropman said.
But Tropman said Bacow’s academic work likely prepared him very well to be president.
Some of Bacow’s scholarship has touched on university administration, covering employment benefits, technology in higher education, and real estate.
Tropman called Bacow “a pracademic, a practical academic... more practically-oriented than theory-building.”
“Obviously the new president has an interest in and a talent for problem-solving and managing,” Tropman said.
In much of his scholarly work, Bacow has collaborated with academics in different fields.
University of Chicago law professor Randal C. Picker, who worked with Bacow in 2014 and 2016, said Bacow was “exactly what you would hope to have in a colleague” while they worked together.
“[He was] open minded, intelligent, someone who has his own ideas, but also who listens to other ideas,” Picker said. “He’s willing to engage and we’d go back and forth, in the best way that academics do.”
“I would do another paper with him tomorrow in a heartbeat,” he added.

The Harvard Foundation called on Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi to better address her country’s ongoing persecution and expulsion of Rohingya Muslims in a statement Wednesday.
The Foundation previously presented Aung San Suu Kyi with its Humanitarian of the Year Award in 2016 at at an awards ceremony that met with some student protest at the time.
“We urge her to recognize publicly the Rohingya people, their identity, and their rights,” the students interns who penned the statement wrote Wednesday.
The statement outlines the development of the Rohingya crisis and criticizes the national leader for what it dubs her “tentative” response. Thirty-two faculty and student members of the Harvard Foundation signed the document.
Following a military crackdown in Myanmar last fall, the Foundation began conversations with student groups to discuss how to better respond to criticisms of Aung San Suu Kyi, according to Foundation student intern Jasmine Chia ’18.
“The Harvard Foundation therefore believes that Aung San Suu Kyi’s lack of public recognition for the Rohingya, and the continued brutality in Rakhine state, does not live up to the spirit of the award we gave her,” Cengiz Cemaloglu ’18 wrote in an email.
According to its website, the Harvard Foundation presents its humanitarian award “to an individual whose works and deeds have served to improve the quality of our lives and have inspired us to greater heights.” Rihanna and Elton John received the award in 2017.
When the award was given to Aung San Suu Kyi, S. Allen Counter, former director of the Harvard Foundation, praised “her courageous struggle for democracy, human rights, and peace in her nation” at the Sept. 2016 awards ceremony. Counter passed away in July 2017.
“The courageous struggle for democracy was and is still inspiring,” Cemaloglu wrote.
Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her continued advocacy for nonviolence and democratization while Myanmar was governed by a military junta. After Myanmar democratized and held elections, she won a seat in parliament and became the leader of her party.
Legally ineligible to run for the presidency, she assumed the newly created position of “state counsellor” in 2016. Filling a role similar to that of a prime minister, she is the de facto head of government in Myanmar.
Though the Harvard Foundation celebrated her achievement of democratic reforms in 2016, the award ceremony drew protest from students in the Harvard Islamic Society, who had earlier criticized Aung San Suu Kyi’s selection given her silence on the persecution of the country’s Rohingya minority.
The Foundation’s Wednesday statement shows a reversal on part of the Harvard Foundation, which now echoes those criticisms.
“We hope to encourage the Burmese government to recognize the humanitarian atrocities of the situation and move towards a more inclusive citizenship policy,” Chia wrote.  “The rights of ethnic minorities must be taken more seriously, not just with the Rohingya but with the Shan, the Karen, the Chin, and the various other 135 ethnic groups that live within Myanmar’s borders.”
Representatives of the Burmese government were not immediately available for comment Wednesday.
“This year, the Harvard Foundation is actively working to make it’s process more transparent and more comprehensive, beginning with our 2018 Scientist of the Year Award,” Chia also wrote.
The Harvard Foundation will be seeking input from Harvard affiliates in the nomination process in the future, according to Chia.

Some professors of popular General Education classes slated to lose their General Education status under a proposed new College system said they are frustrated their courses will no longer qualify under the updated requirements.
The College will roll out the new Program in General Education in 2019, a year later than originally planned. With the switch, perennial General Education favorites like Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism” and Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt” will no longer count towards requirements.
Shaye J.D. Cohen, who teaches CB23 and another course on the Hebrew Bible in the fall that has seen high enrollment numbers in the last few years, said the General Education committee decided these courses would no longer count for General Education credit under the new program.
In March of 2016, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to overhaul the current General Education program after a committee tasked with reviewing the program reported it was “failing on a variety  of fronts.”
Though Cohen said he supported the motion at the time he said he was not aware of the way the implementation committee would choose courses for the new program.
“Had I known at the faculty meeting when we approved Gen Ed 2.0, had I known this is the way it was implemented, I would've voted against it,” Cohen said.
Cohen said he thinks the criteria for new General Education classes is biased toward certain disciplines.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations Professor Carter Eckert, who teaches Societies of the World 27: “The Two Koreas,” said the implementation committee told him the course would no longer be counted for General Education credit last summer.
Eckert said he sent an application to the committee explaining how his course fits the new General Education categories.
“I was rather puzzled that the Gen Ed committee decided that the course didn't fit, and there wasn’t a clear explanation in the email that I received as to why it did not fit, apart from saying it didn’t fit into these categories,” he said.
Though Cohen said he can’t predict future enrollment numbers, he said he assumes “that the enrollment will diminish substantially” with the loss of Gen Ed status.
In the spring of 2017, Cohen’s CB23 had 365 enrollees in the College. This past fall, his course Cultural and Belief 29: “The Hebrew Bible” had 297 enrollees in the College.
“I'm more than happy to reach out to a large number of students,” Cohen said. “That number is probably going to go down. As far as that is true, I will be less happy.”
Peter Manuelian,  a professor of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, said his Societies of the World class, “Pyramid Schemes,” might face similar challenges in enrollment if the course is removed from the General Education program.
“I wouldn't want to see a large enrollment course turn into a small enrollment course just because we're redefining it under some way,” Manuelian said.
Manuelian said he has not decided whether he will apply for the new Program in General Education or teach it as a departmental class.
Both Cohen and Manuelian also said they were sad to see a “Study of the Past” requirement that exists under the old General Education system not be included in the new program.
“The current system has at least one course dealing with the study of the past, and I’m not sure that will be part of the new system,” Manuelian said. “Speaking as a biased person who deals with the ancient world, I’d like to see that stick around.”
The chair of the standing committee on General Education did not directly respond to a request for comment.

The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College hosted Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and actress Jill Scott  and Grammy Award-winning jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding for a conversation and masterclass Tuesday to kick off the week-long Black Arts Festival.
Black Arts Festival Co-Chair Olutoyin Demuren ’18 welcomed Scott and Spalding to the festival and introduced this year’s festival theme, “Coming of Age,” which she said symbolizes “a constant making and remaking of our identity.”
Scott credited her early exposure to art to days in her youth when her mother would take her to Ortlieb’s, a jazz club in Philadelphia.
“That’s where I learned how powerful art truly was,” she said.
When Spalding asked Scott where her "authenticity" comes from, Scott said she looks to other actors and musicians who inspired her to ask how they mastered performing with genuine emotion.
“I tried to remember that they have to find the truth in every word, every phrase, every moment. Where is the truth as an actor, as a writer, as a singer, as a human being?” Scott said.
The event started with Kuumba singers serenading Scott with her song “Golden.” Several students then performed musical numbers and received feedback from Scott. Guitarist Alexander S. Graff  ’17 provided backing instrumentals for several of the performances.
Billed to the public as a masterclass, the feedback and instruction Scott gave to student performers made the event an interactive space, attendees said.
After Arlesia G.  McGowan ‘19 performed an original piece called “Unenduring,” Scott emphasized the importance of sharing personal spirit through your song.
“Taste what you’re saying. See the color of what you’re saying,” Scott told McGowan.
Later, after Roderick Mullen’s ’19 cover of “This Woman’s Work” and “Latch,” Scott spoke about finding ways to sing with more passion. “What we look for as vocalists is water to swim in,” she said.
Scott seemed to particularly enjoy an original, untitled composition performed by Eden H.  Girma ’18. After Girma finished singing, Scott said, “You don’t need to sing anybody else’s songs anymore.”
Michael A.  Wingate ’18 performed last, singing a cover of “Plastic” by Moses Sumney—marking another song Scott appeared to relish.
“When you have a voice like yours, all you have to do is tell the truth," Scott said.
While Scott offered performers feedback, she shared her insight with those watching, too, telling them about the struggles that come with publicly performing.
“You have to be vulnerable to many,” she said. “The price of performance is impact and vulnerability.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Conversations, a new Undergraduate Council initiative that facilitates dinner table discussions between students and faculty members, debuted to campus-wide praise last week.
The dinners—accommodating one faculty member and ten to 12 students—focus on topics chosen ahead of time by the faculty member.  Upcoming topics range from impostor syndrome to the role of scientists in the public sphere.
The UC agreed to partially fund the program at a meeting earlier this month.  Education Committee Chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who helped spearhead the initiative, said the Office of Undergraduate Education will foot at least $5,000 of the bill for this semester.
According to Palaniappan, Harvard Conversations formed to overcome “barriers” that the popular Classroom to Table program imposed on students.  That program —which pays for small groups of students to eat at Square restaurants with their professors—requires students themselves to schedule outings.  Harvard Conversations, on the other hand, is organized by UC representatives, allowing students to simply sign up for a dinner.
“Harvard Conversations allows you to just click ‘Sign up,’ fill out a very brief form, and then we will put together the group of students that would be there,” Palaniappan said.  “It’s been a lot easier for students to participate in this program and also get to have dinner not only with an interesting faculty member, but students that they also probably have also never met before.”
Students said they think the new program has many advantages over Classroom to Table, including a more structured format that facilitates smooth dialogue.
Michelle Y. Zhang ’21, who attended last Wednesday’s dinner led by math preceptor Hakim J. Walker, said the defined scope of the conversation kept the discussion from going stale.
“The one thing that I did notice was how fluid the conversation was,” Zhang said.  “It was not awkward, there were never awkward silences.”
Biology lecturer Andrew Berry said he enjoyed leading Monday’s dinner, which centered on naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace’s contributions to the discovery of natural selection.  As an undergraduate advisor in life sciences at Harvard, Berry said he rarely gets to interact with students from other departments.
“It was actually really fun because people were bringing completely different perspectives to the table,” Berry said.  “And they’re asking questions that people don’t normally ask me.”
Multiple attendees of recent dinners cited the benefits of knowing the topic of the conversation beforehand.  Palaniappan said specifying the focus of the conversations in advance helps ensure that only students who are interested in a given topic attend the dinner.
“Students are also lotterying into the dinners that have topics mostly attuned to their interests,” Palaniappan said.  “Maybe it’s been on their mind, and they just wanted another space to be able to converse with other students who feel similar.”
The dinners, catered by Square restaurants, take place every Monday and Wednesday in House common rooms. UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said in early February that over 50 professors, including Government professor Danielle S. Allen, had already expressed interest in leading a dinner.

UPDATED: February 22, 2018 at 7:25 p.m.
Harvard’s investment decisions often grab headlines. Protesters have blockaded administrative buildings and staged sit-ins in downtown Boston to oppose the University’s investments in fossil fuels and private prisons. And University President Drew G. Faust has publicly opined on whether or not it is wise to divest from controversial assets.
Meanwhile, two University committees routinely make a set of less visible—yet ethically challenging—decisions about how to act as a shareholder in its existing investments. At the meetings of these committees, Harvard takes public stances on issues ranging from climate change to the rights of indigenous people in its capacity as a shareholder.
Like any investor in a public company, Harvard must decide how to vote in shareholder elections, which advise a corporation how to act with respect to a certain issue. In 2017, the two committees took up 44 widely different proposals—ranging from a suggestion PepsiCo should curtail pesticide use in order to protect bees to a suggestion Verizon should create a human rights committee to a suggestion Home Depot should be more transparent about equal employment information.
As an educational institution, though, Harvard shies away from taking political stances. Considering ethical responsibilities while remaining apolitical is a difficult balance to strike, according to William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
“The line between responsible financial investing, having the University take political positions, and having things that are so antithetical to what we do that we don’t want to be involved, they are hard lines to draw,” Lee said in an interview in fall 2017.
Harvard Management Company, which is responsible for Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment, works in tandem with two committees on shareholder responsibility issues: the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, made up of four members of the Harvard Corporation, and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, comprising four faculty members, four students, and four alumni.
The ACSR deliberates during a compressed “proxy season” in the spring, after proposals are released for consideration by shareholders. The group considers social and environmental issues and gives its recommendations to the CCSR, which makes a final decision on how Harvard should vote. The CCSR is also responsible for monitoring HMC’s implementation of University investment policy—including any decision to divest from particular assets.
Harvard makes investment decisions with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors in mind, according to Lee. These factors include issues pertaining to climate change, pollution and worker health, and investors use them to assess risk and maximize long-term returns.
“They’re all about investing prudently and financially soundly, doing it in a responsible way,” Lee, who heads the CCSR, said.
Howell E. Jackson, a professor at Harvard Law School and the chair of the ACSR, said the committee carefully researches and deliberates on every proposal it considers.
“There is actually a huge amount of background reading,” Jackson said.
Once the ACSR makes recommendations about each proxy vote, it sends them to the CCSR, which Jackson said has a tradition of “overwhelmingly following” the ACSR’s recommendations.
Lee agreed, adding that “the overwhelming majority of the time, [the CCSR adopts] their recommendation on how to vote.”
In the unusual cases when the Corporation committee does not accept the ACSR’s recommendation, Jackson said the discrepancy is often because new information emerges about the issue in question. The CCSR publishes an annual report outlining the decisions made on proxies for that year; Lee said the report forms an effort on behalf of the Corporation to be transparent about Harvard’s shareholder votes.
“We’re one of the few universities that discloses how we vote on the proxies, and I think that’s an important part of what we do,” Lee said.
Last year’s report outlines  the University’s position on 44 issues, noting a sharp increase in the last few years in the number of proposals relating to political campaign spending. A rationale for the vote outcome and a sketch of the committee’s thought process accompanies each decision. The resulting 35-page report provides a glimpse into Harvard’s approach to investment ethics.
“The University’s posture with respect to socially responsible investing is relatively progressive, I think,” Jackson said.
The ACSR relies heavily on past precedent to make decisions. If a decision breaks with past precedent, their report clarifies why the recommended vote is unique from past decisions. But ESG priorities change over time. Harvard often voted against proposals to publicize political lobbying several years ago, according to Lee, but now consistently votes in favor of them.
Students, faculty, and alumni do not always agree with the University’s approach—and in recent years, some have called on Harvard to take a firmer ethical or political stance on controversial investment issues. The campus activist group Divest Harvard in particular has held rallies, blockaded multiple University buildings, and had its members arrested in protest of the University’s investments in fossil fuels.
Harvard has since “paused” investments in fossil fuels, though University representatives have repeatedly made clear the decision was motivated by fiscal—rather than political or ethical—concerns.
More recently, the Harvard College Project for Justice, a student group, petitioned Harvard to divest from its stake in private prison companies, which the University holds through investment firm Vanguard.
The University has long maintained an official position against divestment as a form of protest. Former University President Derek C. Bok, who led Harvard from 1971 to 1991, outlined in the 1989-1990 President’s Report his argument against divestment in all but extreme circumstances.
“Perhaps the greatest danger in exerting political pressure of this kind is the risk of sacrificing academic independence,” Bok wrote.
Faust responded to calls for divestment from fossil fuels with a letter in 2013 asserting that Harvard would not change its stance.
Beyond shareholder voting, ethics enters directly into Harvard’s investment decisions as well.
ESG factors also guide Harvard’s selection of external managers and ownership of farmland and forests, among other matters.
Incorporating ESG factors often means working with external nonprofits. In 2014, Harvard was the first U.S. university endowment to become a signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investing, an international network of organizations committed to incorporating ESG factors into shareholder responsibility and investment decisions.
Harvard is also a signatory of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a nonprofit that pushes publicly traded companies to disclose their use of fossil fuels. Harvard sends quarterly letters to non-renewable energy companies requesting that they implement standards for sustainability reporting. Lee said the Corporation will monitor HMC’s actions related to the project.
Harvard uses organizations like the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Forest Stewardship Council, and Global G.A.P to set ESG standards for their investments.
But as HMC cuts its internal staff and moves many investments to external managers—and as it sells its forest land and other natural resources—it is unclear how its approach to responsible investing will develop.
Lee said HMC will work to put ESG principles in place under the new system.
“We’re going to go to a new model which is going to be mostly externally managed. That requires the manner in which you pursue ESG principles be implemented differently, but the ESG principles will continue to guide us,” he said.
HMC spokesperson Patrick McKiernan said Harvard will continue to be committed to social responsibility even under the new system.
“Throughout the life of an investment, we monitor identified ESG risks and work with managers to ensure effective oversight. We also write letters to our team of external managers to inform them of our focus on sustainable investment and commitment to the PRI principles,” McKiernan wrote in an email.

UPDATED: February 22, 2018 at 6:25 p.m.
The Office of Student Life has placed religious group Harvard College Faith and Action on “administrative probation” for a year after the organization pressured a female member of its student leadership to resign in September following her decision to date a woman.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman announced the move to put HCFA on probation in an emailed statement sent to The Crimson Wednesday afternoon.
“After a thorough review and finding that HCFA had conducted itself in a manner grossly inconsistent with the expectations clearly outlined in [the Office of Student Life’s] Student Organization Resource and Policy Guide, OSL has placed HCFA on a one year administrative probation,” Goldman wrote in the statement.
Goldman did not specify how HCFA, the largest Christian fellowship on campus, had violated Office of Student Life “expectations.” In an emailed statement Wednesday, HCFA co-presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 were slightly more specific.
“Earlier today, we met with an administrator who informed us that the College would place HCFA on probation, citing our relationship with Christian Union as well as our standards for leaders,” Richmond and Ely wrote Wednesday. Christian Union—a national umbrella group with outposts at all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford—helps fund and support HCFA.
The decision to suspend HCFA, though, is almost certainly tied to the Sept. 2017 resignation of a female bisexual former assistant Bible course leader. HCFA leadership asked the woman to step down from her position after they learned she was dating another female student—violating guidelines laid out in the Harvard College Student Handbook, which stipulates recognized campus student groups cannot discriminate on the basis of “sexual orientation.”
This account of events is based on interviews with 12 current and former members of HCFA as well as documents, emails, and text messages obtained and reviewed by The Crimson. The former assistant Bible course leader, as well as several other members of HCFA, spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
The meeting between College administrators, Richmond, and Ely Wednesday—and the Office of Student Life’s move to put HCFA on probation—came less than a day after The Crimson contacted the College and HCFA about the publication of this story.
Goldman wrote in his statement Wednesday that the Office of Student Life “was alerted to a situation in December” regarding HCFA and has been “reviewing” the organization ever since. As part of the newly announced year-long probation, administrators will place an “official letter” into the Office of Student Life’s “file” on HCFA, according to Goldman.
If HCFA decides to re-register as a recognized student organization next spring, the Office of Student Life “will require updated materials demonstrating that they are in compliance with the University’s nondiscrimination” policies, Goldman wrote.
Ely and Richmond, though, maintain HCFA never fell out of compliance with Harvard’s non-discrimination guidelines.
“We reject any notion that we discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in our fellowship,” the co-presidents wrote in an email Wednesday. “Broadly speaking, the student in this case was removed because of an irreconcilable theological disagreement pertaining to our character standards.”
Ely and Richmond wrote they believe HCFA’s standards on topics related to issues like extramarital “sexual activity” are applied equally to student “leaders of all sexual orientations.” The two added HCFA only addresses violations of its leadership standards that others bring to the group’s attention.
“We’re not the morality police,” Ely and Richmond wrote.
Around the start of the fall semester, the former assistant Bible course leader was feeling “truly good.”
Sophomore year had been difficult; but the woman had begun a relationship in mid-August and was finally beginning to feel “inexplicable peace,” she wrote in a Sept. 18 email to her HCFA mentees. HCFA assistant Bible course leaders are each tasked with mentoring several other members of the organization.
“This person really makes me laugh, makes me feel safe, and can get me to breath[e] again during times of hyperventilating in a really bad panic attack, challenges me to be a better person for myself, others, and God,” she wrote of her romantic partner. “I know a person or relationship doesn’t ‘fix you,’ but I can honestly say that having this relationship has been an incredible support that has helped me get to the point that I am at now.”
There was just one “catch.”
“This person is a girl,” the woman wrote.
The woman wrote she and her girlfriend, also a member of HCFA, had prayed “a lot” about their relationship and that both felt “extremely at peace” with their love for one another as well as their faith.
HCFA leaders, however, did not feel the same. Weeks into the semester, at least one ministry fellow—a Christian Union-employed ministry faculty member who teaches HCFA Bible courses—discovered the woman had entered into a same-sex relationship.
Anne Kerhoulas, the ministry fellow, texted the woman on Sept. 11 asking to meet the next day, according to text messages reviewed by The Crimson. The woman knew Kerhoulas through her Bible study class, which the woman was helping lead.
Sometime in the next few days, the woman met with Kerhoulas and Christine Shin, another ministry fellow. During that meeting, the two ministry fellows sought to understand the current status of the woman’s same-sex relationship and how it had developed, the woman said.
After some discussion, the ministry fellows made up their minds: They requested the woman step down from her role as an assistant Bible course leader, according to the woman.
Four friends of the woman corroborated her account. Several students confirmed the meeting occurred and others said she gave them the same account of proceedings at the time, several months before she shared her story with The Crimson. The Crimson also reviewed text messages exchanged between Kerhoulas and the woman setting up the meeting that further corroborated the woman’s story.
Neither Kerhoulas nor Shin responded to multiple requests for comment.
Later that same week, after the meetings, Kerhoulas sent an email to HCFA students enrolled in her Bible course announcing the woman would be “stepping out of her role as an ABCL” for the class.
“It has been a hard couple weeks as we arrived at this decision, but I, the staff team, and the executive team all believe that this is the best and appropriate step,” Kerhoulas wrote in the email, obtained by The Crimson.
“In light of [my same-sex relationship], I have been asked to step down from my leadership position as a ABCL,” the woman wrote in the same email, her comments excerpted under Kerhoulas’s. “I cannot express how much this saddens me.”
The HCFA “executive team” Kerhoulas referenced in her email comprises the organization’s two co-presidents, Ely and Richmond, and two co-vice presidents.
Asked whether they or any other student leaders of HCFA played a role in the decision to ask the woman to resign from her position, Ely and Richmond wrote in an email Wednesday that undergraduates make all major decisions at HCFA.
“All decisions about HCFA, its policies, and its people are made entirely by the undergraduate leadership completely independent of ministry fellows or Christian Union,” the two wrote. “We as student leaders autonomously make decisions about HCFA.”
Asked whether students in same-sex relationships are allowed to hold leadership positions within HCFA, Ely and Richmond pointed to the group’s character standards. The two wrote the woman “was removed” from her leadership position because of a “theological disagreement” related to the standards.
HCFA’s character standards—outlined in an internal six-page document—do not specifically address or mention homosexuality. Two bullet points listed under the heading “Sexual Purity” suggest HCFA leaders should refrain from sex before marriage and also give general advice about relationships.
“Use wisdom in your dating life,” the document reads. “Be aware not only of the importance of honoring God in your romantic relationships, but to set a good example and model for other believers who will look to you for implicit guidance as a leader.”
Asked to explain the “theological disagreement” that led to the woman’s dismissal, Ely and Richmond mentioned HCFA’s stance on extramarital sex.
“Our theological view is that—for professing Christians who are in leadership—celibacy is the only option outside the bounds of marriage,” Ely and Richmond wrote. “We have applied and do apply this policy regardless of sexual orientation.”
The woman, as well as four other members of HCFA, said they believe she was not asked to step down from her position because she is bisexual. Instead, HCFA leadership pressured her to resign because she chose to actively pursue a same-sex relationship, according to the woman and the four other individuals.
BGLTQ students have held leadership positions within HCFA in the past. Veronica S. Wickline ’16 and Tyler S. Parker ’17, both of whom said they identify as BGLTQ, both said they served in HCFA leadership positions during their time at the College.
But both did not pursue same-sex relationships while in office. Parker said in an interview Wednesday that he remained “chaste” during his tenure as an HCFA leader. Wickline, who said she is bisexual, said she pursued a relationship with a man while helping lead HCFA.
Asked whether HCFA’s official policy mandates that BGLTQ members remain celibate in order to hold leadership positions, Parker said he thought that was a "better question for the current leadership."
Asked the same question, Ely and Richmond did not directly answer.
It is unclear exactly what HCFA’s newfound probationary status entails.
Ely and Richmond wrote in an email Wednesday that College administrators told them HCFA is the first-ever campus group to be placed on administrative probation. The two said they are unaware of the “full ramifications” of the designation.
Goldman, the University spokesperson who announced HCFA’s probation, did not immediately respond to a question asking whether probation means the group will be stripped of all rights and privileges granted to recognized student organizations.
Recognized student groups enjoy several benefits courtesy of the Office of Student Life, including the ability to reserve Harvard rooms and venues as well as access to a bank account.
Traditionally, HCFA has often held its weekly Doxa events—gatherings during which members worship together—in Yenching Auditorium, a Harvard space.
Other privileges granted to recognized student organizations include the right to poster on campus and permission to participate in activity fairs, both key ways campus groups recruit undergraduates. HCFA, founded in 2008, currently boasts roughly 200 members.
In order to reverse its probationary status, HCFA must prove its compliance both with Harvard’s non-discrimination policies and with “stated expectations regarding local governance,” Goldman wrote in his statement Wednesday.
HCFA currently receives funding and support from Christian Union, which asserts its mission to be “developing Christian leaders to transform culture.” Referred to on HCFA’s website as its “parent ministry,” Christian Union hires HCFA staff and subsidizes the cost of materials and events.
Some other Christian groups on campus hold similar ties to national organizations. In one example, the national InterVarsity Christian Fellowship helps hire staff for the Asian-American Christian Fellowship.
The Harvard College Student Handbook stipulates that all recognized student organizations must maintain “local autonomy” and must “make all policy decisions without obligation to any parent organization, national chapter, or charter.”
Don Weiss, a ministry director at HCFA employed by Christian Union, wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that Christian Union is not involved in the governance of the student group.
“The policies and decision-making of HCFA are made by the undergraduate leadership, not any of the ministry fellows or Christian Union,” Weiss wrote.
Ely and Richmond repeated Weiss’s assertions.
“We reiterate that Christian Union makes no decisions for HCFA,” Ely and Richmond wrote in an email Wednesday. “We partner with them for pastoral, spiritual, and financial support, but in no way do they control HCFA’s governance and leadership.”
Goldman did not respond to a question asking whether the Office of Student Life expects HCFA to disaffiliate from Christian Union in order to meet Harvard’s local autonomy standards.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 22, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the former assistant Bible course leader was asked to resign her position in Dec. 2017. In fact, as was noted elsewhere correctly in the article, she was asked to resign her position in Sept. 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Already safely guaranteed a top-two seed in the Ivy League Tournament, Harvard men’s basketball has —on paper— little to play for heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.
This, however, was the same narrative that earned the Crimson a quick exit on the first day of the inaugural conference tournament last season. Guaranteed the No.2 spot heading into the final weekend of play, Harvard fell short against No. 1 Princeton and No. 4 Penn before losing to No.3 Yale in the opening game of the Ancient Eight tourney.
As Harvard (14-11, 9-1 Ivy) prepares for the Tigers (11-14, 3-7) and Quakers (19-7, 9-1 Ivy) in its penultimate regular season weekend,  the focus is clear: continue its late-season momentum and avoid even thinking about the second trip back to Philadelphia on March 10.
“We feel with the pieces we have this year, the chemistry we have, everyone’s work ethic that we can definitely make a postseason run,” sophomore forward Christian Juzang said. “But first thing’s first, we got to get there. Not thinking too far ahead, one thing at a time.”
Step one in this process means repeating a dominant performance against Princeton, which was handily defeated by the Crimson on Feb. 9. The Tigers have not fared any better since that 51-66 defeat, extending a six-game conference skid that has seen last year’s undefeated champions fall to seventh in the standings. The only other time that Princeton suffered this many consecutive Ivy defeats was in 2008, when it lost nine straight.
Friday night’s contest at Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton, N.J., will need to be a bounce-back performance for Tigers coach Mitch Henderson’s team if they intend to even qualify for the four-team conference tournament. Suffering a triple-overtime defeat against Cornell and a 25-point blowout by Columbia last weekend, Princeton has just four games to eclipse Brown, Columbia, and Cornell who all sit at 4-6.
In that defeat to the Lions, junior forwards Myles Stephens and Devin Cannady each shot 4-for-11 from the field and combined for one three-point conversion. Against Harvard a week prior, the pair went a combined 5-for-22 from the field. Defensively, the Tigers limited the Crimson to a sub-30 percent night from deep but allowed its opponent to shoot 44 percent from the field. Juzang also had a career-night against Princeton, tallying 20 points.
Since that point, Harvard’s trajectory has only gone upward. Off a combined 34-point weekend from Juzang and a 38-point stint from sophomore forward Seth Towns, the Crimson cruised to victories against Brown and Yale. Sophomore big Chris Lewis held down the interior in both games, capped by an impressive 14 point first half against the Bulldogs. Lewis’s point average on the season now stands at 12.2 PPG, a five-point spike from last season.
“Right now we would love to see if we can perform to playing well and winning,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s what we are trying to do and trying to accomplish. It’s great that we have solidified ourselves as being in the tournament but we are still after some other things that are within our sights these last two weekends.”
Step two, as long as business is safely handled on Friday night, may be the deciding factor for the claim to the No.1 regular season spot. Heading down to the Palestra to face fellow conference top-dog Penn, the Crimson prepares for what may be a preview of the Ivy League Championship game. Although Harvard held a double-digit lead for most of the second half in its victory over the Quakers two weeks ago, that contest was Penn’s third game of that week alone.
The Quakers secured victories against the Lions and Cornell last weekend, including a massive run late in the Columbia win that propelled Penn to a 43-point second half. Held to coach Steve Donahue’s bench for much of the prior three contests, sophomore guard Devon Goodman had a breakout game against the Lions with five made triples and a career-high 23 points.
The sophomore was limited the following night against the Bears, however, attempting just six shots and converting twice. In the Cornell game, sophomore forward AJ Brodeur carried the load for Penn, missing only two field goals in a 21-point showing.
Lewis and sophomore forward Henry Welsh contained the 6’8” Brodeur to five field goals in its Feb. 10 matchup, but were less effective in covering junior big Max Rothschild, who had numerous easy looks at the basket. Harvard was able to protect the perimeter, as the Quakers converted on just a quarter of their 25 shots from three-point range.
More importantly for the Crimson, Harvard turned the ball over just six times in that game. Tallying over 15 giveaways in each of its past two games, Amaker will again need his team to maintain a high level of offensive discipline against Penn.
“I think our team has a lot of composure,” said Lewis after the Feb. 10 victory. “Even though the crowd was sold out, if it’s okay for me to speak for the rest of the team, I think we all focus with who’s on the court, our jobs, our roles, and no matter what the atmosphere is we always play to our same principles.”
For the Crimson, taking it one game at a time continues to remain the motto. If Amaker’s squad is able to come away with a sweep this weekend, however, one has to wonder if postseason thoughts will be springing up in the Harvard locker room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After having just one game in its entire 2017 season decided by one goal, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team has already had two such games in its first two contests of 2018. The second of the two also turned out to be the Crimson’s first overtime decision since 2016.
One year ago, Harvard opened its season with road wins over UMass Lowell and Holy Cross. Returning the favor, the Crimson welcomed these two in-state opponents to Jordan Field on Saturday and Tuesday, respectively, to start its 2018 campaign.
Both matchups came down to the wire, and whereas strong defensive play over the weekend helped Harvard (1-1, 0-0 Ivy) close out a 10-9 win over the River Hawks (1-1, 0-0 America East), a defensive slip on Tuesday night proved costly in a 10-9 (2OT) loss to the Crusaders (1-2, 0-0 Patriot). In splitting the contests, the Crimson will now enter its preparations for its first road game sitting at .500.
“We were glad to get the win on Saturday, but sometimes, you win a game and it can mask poor play,” said Harvard co-captain and midfielder Joe Lang. “We definitely didn’t play up to our standards over the weekend or on Tuesday, but taking the second loss will get guys looking in the mirror and figuring out how to improve.”
Holy Cross 10, Harvard 9 (2OT)
The Tuesday night matchup between the Crimson and the Crusaders marked both squads’ first midweek game of the season. Despite the players coming out onto the field with just two days of rest, the game had a lively start. Both sides put a shot on frame within the first minute and a half, and an offside penalty on the visitors at the 12:21 mark of the first quarter gave Harvard an early man-up opportunity.
It ended up being Holy Cross who got on the board first, however, as sophomore attackman Justin Lynskey scored a solo goal just over five minutes into the game to give his team the lead.  Fellow attacker Drew Babiak then added a second for the Crusaders a few minutes later, the first of five goals for the junior on the evening.
“Babiak and a couple of other guys on their team had great games,” Lang said. “But any time your defense can hold the other team to 10 goals or less, it’s up to the offense to capitalize.”
Despite putting up 42 shots in the contest, the offense had trouble doing just that––capitalizing on opportunities. The Crimson had five man-up chances over the course of the game but failed to score on any of them. A strong performance from Holy Cross sophomore goalie Jonathan Tesoro certainly played a role in the low scoring output for the home side, but sloppy execution and fifteen turnovers hurt it even more.
Ultimately, the Crusaders took advantage as Lynskey put home the decisive goal in the second overtime period. A quick slide to the left freed him right in front of goal, and he fired the ball past Harvard senior goalie Robert Shaw to give his team its first win of the year, and also first win over the Crimson in 35 attempts.
Harvard 10, UMass Lowell 9
Whereas the Crimson had to score a late goal on Tuesday to send the game against Holy Cross to overtime, it was in the exact opposite position on Saturday when it played host to the River Hawks. Harvard played the final seven minutes of the fourth quarter nursing a two-goal lead, and managed to keep UMass Lowell from mounting any sort of comeback until it was too late.
River Hawks senior attacker Sean Tyrrell scored with four seconds remaining to bring the margin to just one, but a face-off win immediately after by Crimson freshman Steven Cuccurullo iced the contest. Cuccurullo wound up finishing 13-17 on faceoffs in his first career game at the collegiate level.
“We asked a lot out of our two freshman [Cuccurullo and Kyle Massimilian] to step in today and take face-offs for us,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “I’m very happy with how they performed and we’re confident they’ll do just fine till [Sullivan] gets back.”
As in the matchup against the Crusaders, the Crimson had problems putting its opponents away. It held a 7-3 lead at one point in the third quarter, but allowed UMass Lowell to come back and tie the game at 7-7 early in the fourth.
An uncharacteristically low offensive output from talisman Morgan Cheek played a big role, as Cheek failed to register multiple points in a game for the first time since 2016. Backing him up, however, sophomore attackers Kyle Anderson and Ryan Graff each had strong games. Anderson tallied a hat trick in his first career start, and Graff added two goals and two assists. Graff’s second goal with 7:12 left in the fourth proved to be the ultimate decider.

Harvard is no stranger to euphemisms, and one of the most commonly heard phrases around campus these days is “blocking drama.” You don’t need to take Linguistics 101 to figure out that this broad umbrella term includes a ton of different experiences. Here’s what freshmen are really saying when they refer to blocking drama:
“I hate my friends”
I got too close to the people I met during Opening Days, only to realize by Thanksgiving that I actually hate them. So now I’ve been navigating this “drama” all by myself, and for now I’m too embarrassed to say that I’m going to be a floater.
“I have too many friends”
I somehow talked my way into five different blocking groups, and I don’t know how to break up with them. Actually, it might be easier to drop all of them and just float.
“I’m evil”
I eagerly volunteered to kick out the ninth friend from our blocking group, and I’m going to savor every second of it. No one’s safe.
“I might be the ninth friend”
My squad has been going to Berg a lot without me recently, they all just joined the same sorority, and they’ve already got plane tickets for spring break. Oh wait, I definitely am the ninth friend.
“My blocking group’s a mess”
My group is currently made up of my First Chance Dance hookup, some girl from my math section, and the ninth friend from the entryway next door. We’re probably going to get Quadded, too.
Whether you have zero friends or eight, blocking is a complicated time, but there’s no need to hide behind euphemisms. Next year, when you’re dealing with rats in Adams, booking it to class from Mather, or walking to the Quad in the snow, you’ll look back on freshman year and your silly “blocking drama” with fondness.
