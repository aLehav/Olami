After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 8, 2014, at 1:35 p.m.
A charitable foundation run in part by Gerald L. Chan, an alumnus and longtime benefactor of the Harvard School of Public Health, has pledged $350 million to the school, the largest single donation in Harvard’s history, the University announced this afternoon.
In recognition of the gift, the University will rename the school the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in honor of Chan’s late father. This is the first time in its history that Harvard has renamed one of its schools in recognition of philanthropy. Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government was named in memorial of former United States President John F. Kennedy ’40 in 1966.
The gift comes from the Morningside Foundation, which is supported by Gerald Chan and his brother Ronnie Chan. It was officially announced at 12:30 p.m at an event at the School of Public Health in the Longwood Medical Area.
The gift is among the largest single donations in the history of higher education. Only a handful, including gifts of $1 billion to Vedanta University in India and $600 million to the California Institute of Technology, have been larger.
The gift’s principal amount of $350 million will be handled by the Harvard Management Company as a part of the University's endowment, and annual dividends will flow into the School of Public Health’s budget, which is heavily reliant on federal and non-federal sponsorship. As of June 2013, the school’s portion of the University's endowment total was valued at a little more than $1.1 billion.
Gerald Chan, who made his fortune in private equity and venture capital, earned two degrees at the School of Public Health in the 1970s and has remained involved in the school. Chan’s Morningside Foundation endowed a professorship at the School of Public Health in 2012, the same year he addressed the school’s graduates at its annual commencement exercises. He has also served as a member of the school’s board of dean’s advisors and taught a Wintersession course at the school.
Chan, who lives in Newton, Mass., has also quietly bought more than $100 million in real estate in Harvard Square in recent years. His father, after whom the school is named, founded one of Hong Kong’s largest real estate firms in 1960.
“I’ve been around Harvard for 40 plus years now, and I really feel that the School of Public Health has a very unique voice,” Chan said in an interview Friday. “There are parts of the school which speak for economic efficiency. There are parts for the school which speak for other approaches to solving problems…. I think the HSPH has a very unique voice which should be heard more clearly within the larger community.”
Chan and top University officials spoke with The Crimson under the condition that their remarks not be published until midnight Monday.
Chan said that he approached William F. Lee ’72, a longtime friend and the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, with a rough proposal for the gift about six months ago.
“I brought this up to Bill to see if it was doable, to see if it was interesting,” Chan said. “And they thought it was interesting.”
Chan’s gift comes seven months after Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 gave $150 million to the College and the Business School, with most of the money earmarked for undergraduate financial aid. Driven by gifts from Griffin and others, the Harvard Campaign—which launched publicly last September with a goal of $6.5 billion—has gotten off to a fast start. As of the end of this March, Harvard had raised $3.8 billion across all of its schools.
Julio Frenk, the dean of the School of Public Health, said last week that the money from Morningside will touch all areas of the school’s operations. He focused on four particular threats to public health, including pandemics like Ebola, environmental concerns such as pollution, humanitarian issues like poverty and collateral damage from war and violence, and inefficient systems of healthcare.
“[The Chan family’s] generosity will ensure we have the resources to continue to develop the most innovative solutions that will enable millions of people to live longer and healthier lives, now and in the future,” Frenk said.
Frenk said that the money will also fund the school’s continuing commitments to student accessibility and faculty development. He added that the school is considering introducing a series of research awards and grants, as well as new funding for non-tenured faculty to take sabbatical semesters, new support for big data computing and management, and a student loan forgiveness program.
“Student debt is my number one priority, as it has always been,” Frenk said.
University officials told The Crimson last week that, for a smaller institution like the School of Public Health, the Chan gift has the power to alter the school’s trajectory. The School of Public Health, which often sends graduates into less lucrative careers than some other Harvard schools, has traditionally had difficulty matching the fundraising clout of the College, Law School, and Business School. The school draws significantly from federal and non-federal sponsorship—sources that fluctuate and are often referred to as ‘soft money’—which together made up 70 percent of its budget in fiscal year 2013.
“We are very grateful that this school, with its strong public service mission, is going to have this kind of funding and support,” University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview. “The School of Public Health is so dependent on federal funding and soft money for such a substantial portion of its operating budget. It’s great to have some solid foundation apart from those soft money resources that we can depend on.”
Last year, the School of Public Health set a goal of $450 million for its portion of the Harvard Campaign at a ceremony also celebrating the school’s centennial. Frenk would not say if he plans to adjust the $450 million target, but he did commit to continuing the school’s fundraising campaign for the next four years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 8, 2014, at 1:35 p.m.
When Gerald L. Chan arrived at Harvard in the early 1970s, armed with two engineering degrees from UCLA and a passion for science, he was convinced he would earn a Ph.D. in physics.
But that conviction, Chan said in an interview last week, changed very quickly when he arrived on campus and met an influential professor who urged him to leave physics in favor of biology. What appeared to be the next stop on his path through the physical sciences turned out to be a “pivotal point,” Chan said, in his education—one that would eventually realign the direction of his studies and lay the groundwork for a decades-long career.
With the professor’s guidance, Chan, the son of a wealthy Hong Kong real estate mogul, enrolled in College-level biology classes and worked his way into the School of Public Health. In 1975, he earned master’s in medical radiological physics, completing a doctorate in radiobiology four years later.
“For the rest of my life I’ve felt so grateful to have made that turn because…I don’t think I could have gotten into all this interesting work if I hadn’t made that turn to the life sciences,” Chan said.
On Monday afternoon, Chan and University officials unveiled a $350 million gift to the School of Public Health, the largest in Harvard’s history. The school will be renamed in honor of Chan’s late father, but the ceremony will highlight the one-time School of Public Health student, who went on to build a multibillion-dollar investment empire.
Chan’s career has been a novel mix of academia and business. As a doctoral and post-doctoral researcher, Chan published several academic papers, including at least one article in the journal Nature. After graduating, he worked as a research fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a Harvard-affiliated research initiative.
In 1986, Chan and his brother Ronnie C. Chan co-founded the Morningside Group, a private equity and venture capital firm. Under Chan’s leadership, Morningside invested in a range of companies, including biotech companies developing water filtration membranes, solar-panelled roofing, cancer targeting systems, a mobile app for early detection of autism, and full-length human DNA clones, among others. The group was one of the early investors in Chinese tech companies.
Chan is also a non-executive director of Hang Lung Group, a real estate development group founded by his father Chan Tseng-Hsi in 1960 and chaired by Ronnie Chan. The company currently has a market capitalization of over $7.5 billion, according to Reuters. Together, the brothers are valued at about $3 billion and ranked 17th on Forbes magazine’s “Hong Kong’s 50 Richest” list.
Chan made a splash closer to home this spring, when it came to light that he had purchased real estate totalling more than $100 million in Harvard Square. The purchases were made through shell companies connected to Morningside Group. Many longtime Harvard Square businesses occupying the buildings chose or were forced to close amid rising rents after the purchases.
Tamarind Bay, an Indian restaurant that had been open for almost a decade, was among them. Chan’s son, Ash Chan, plans to open a Japanese late-night restaurant in its place.
Chan, who lives part-time in Newton, Mass., has remained closely associated with the School of Public Health through the years, serving on the Harvard China Advisory Group and on the school’s board of dean’s advisors. The Morningside Foundation also established a professorship in radiobiology there in 2012.
The gifts came from Morningside’s charitable arm, the Morningside Foundation, which Chan also directs. The foundation has a track record of supporting higher education, donating in 2006 the initial sum to establish Morningside College, a residential college within the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
University President Drew G. Faust said last week that she “first visited Gerald Chan a number of years ago,” and stressed that the gift “coming from an alumnus of the school is particularly meaningful because it reflects an entire lifetime of engagement with the school...from somebody who knows how his life was changed by his experiences.”
Indeed, Chan’s connection to his alma mater has not been limited to philanthropy. He gave a talk in 2011 about pairing investment decisions with scientific acumen and a year later offered a Wintersession course at the school on innovation and change in public health.
“I’m probably the ‘black sheep’ of the School,” Chan said in the 2011 talk, according to an HSPH press release. “Not many graduates of this school go into the private sector. But I would like to report that I haven’t gone completely to the ‘dark side.’ I’m in the private sector, but I’m still involved in science and I’m still very concerned about the public good.”
Chan was subsequently invited to deliver the school’s 2012 Commencement address. In his address titled “The Idea of Public Health,” the investor spoke about the notions of idea, public, and health, ultimately underscoring the role graduates can play in fulfilling unmet global needs.
“Perhaps in social enterprises, our young people will find a way of melding together public and private interests and in so doing, will define a sustainable equilibrium both in their own personal lives as well as for society at large,” Chan said at the time.

Students have a new lens through which to view the Harvard College Dean’s Office—Instagram.
Last year, student leaders praised botanist and then-interim dean Donald H. Pfister’s signature email messages to students, known for book recommendations and references to Yard plant life, for giving the Dean’s Office a personable face.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who assumed the role in July, has taken to social media in the way Pfister took to email. While his emails to the student body so far have been mostly informative—his most recent was a welcome back message—the social media platform Instagram has become his virtual space of choice for more personal student outreach.
Khurana said he sees Instagram, which connects with Facebook and is used primarily for sharing photos and videos, as a way to “document [his] journey” as dean. Because students can choose whether or not to look at Instagram—they do not automatically receive a notification when Khurana updates his profile—he plans to use email primarily to inform.
“I don’t want people to feel like they have to see these [Instagram] things,” Khurana said. “If you send an email out to students, it’s often because you’re really asking everybody to read it. When we send emails, we want to make sure that they’re of importance enough that they’re to inform our community.”
This is not the first time that Khurana, also co-master of Cabot House, has utilized social media. For example, Cabot House joined Twitter last year, and its alumni have a LinkedIn page. Now, as dean, Khurana is combining several platforms—email, Instagram, and traditional in-person outreach through office hours and meals in dining halls—to connect with students.
“A lot of what I’m hoping this does is encourage people to walk into University Hall [and] feel like it’s not some kind of cordoned-off place, but rather that it’s also a place that students should feel really comfortable with,” Khurana said.
Previous deans have experimented with their own student outreach techniques. Every finals period, students congregated in Lamont Cafe when Evelynn M. Hammonds, who stepped down from the College deanship in 2013, brought them pizza and burritos. Pfister, who succeeded Hammonds after her controversial departure, offered cupcakes.
Both students and administrators point to Pfister’s strategy as one that set a precedent. Khurana, for his part, said Pfister demonstrated how important communication is to the job.
Pfister had a “wonderful demeanor” and “humanness” that really came through, said Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. Lassonde said Khurana’s conversations with students serve to convey a similar sense of personality.
“The students need to perceive him as their dean,” he said.
Khurana’s Instagram profile, which mostly hosts photos of students and landmarks around Harvard, has drawn more than 890 followers since its creation just two months ago. Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 is not one of those followers—he does not have an Instagram account—but he said outreach from the Dean’s Office is critical.
“A really important part of the Dean’s job is not just to be communicating with students who are in the student government, but students who aren’t,” Mayopoulos said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 8, 2014, at 5:48 p.m.
The Administrative Board is tightening regulations regarding enrollment in classes that meet at the same time. Beginning this semester, the Ad Board will no longer allow students to watch video-taped lectures in place of class and will only grant petitions for simultaneous enrollment to students who are receiving direct instruction from their professors outside of class or those who are enrolled in Computer Science 50.
The policy change, which was discussed at a faculty meeting in April and supported by the standing committee on Education Policy, comes after a five-year uptick in petitions for simultaneous enrollment.  Last semester, the Ad Board granted 200 such petitions, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, compared to 64 in the 2008-2009 school year.
The Faculty Handbook requires that “direct and personal compensatory instruction” for simultaneous enrollment, but only recently has the Ad Board refused to recognize videotaped lectures as a stand-in for class time.
Under the new rules, with the exception of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” students may only enroll in courses whose times overlap if professors meet with them for the same amount of time they would miss in the classroom, or if they miss no more than one-third of lecture time and the missed time is available on videotape.
Harris sent an email to instructors in late August notifying them of the change, according to former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
“Reading Dean Harris’s letter, it sounds like without changing the language in the handbook, the Ad Board is just going to reinterpret and enforce differently simultaneous enrollment,” Lewis said.
Although Lewis said he will not permit simultaneous enrollment in his computer science courses, he still thinks that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should collect more data to demonstrate that simultaneous enrollment has a detrimental effect on students.
“A lot of us are working at trying to improve how we use the classroom to motivate students to come to class and engage,” Lewis said. “[But] I wish that if this simultaneous enrollment procedure were going to be changed, we had some data that made the case that it needed to be changed.”
Several House deans announced the change over their House's email lists. In one such email, Adams House Dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal noted that the “innovative pedagogies” of the introductory computer science course do not limit it to a particular time slot.
David J. Malan ’99, the professor of Computer Science 50, said that he was not involved in the Ad Board’s decision to exclude his course, aside from writing letters on behalf of students who wished to simultaneously enroll in the course and another.
“I'm certainly pleased that students who wish to take CS50 will face fewer impediments when it comes to [simultaneously enrolling] because I think it’s been an impediment or a discouragement to students who have not been able to take CS50 and more generally other introductory courses,” Malan said.

UPDATED: September 8, 2014, at 3:42 a.m.
Small groups of Harvard freshmen will now have the opportunity to rub shoulders with star professors over dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club.
The series of twelve dinners is part of a new program called “Uncommon Fare,” which kicks off Sept. 16. The dinners are slated to take place at the Faculty Club over the course of the upcoming year. Each dinner will bring together ten students and one distinguished faculty member.
The series was made possible by an anonymous donation.
“We’re thrilled to be the recipients of this generous gift,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “We have had this as a goal for numerous years.”
According to Dingman, the Freshman Dean’s Office has long looked to add more opportunities for students to build relationships with faculty members.
The FDO already offers some programs aimed at enabling students to develop relationships with Harvard faculty, such as first-year faculty dinners, when freshmen can invite a professor to dinner in Annenberg Hall.
The FDO website notes that “one benefit of being a student at Harvard is the opportunity to develop relationships with the professors, preceptors, teaching fellows, administrators, coaches, and staff who help make Harvard a world-class institution.”
Students from the freshman class will be invited to the Uncommon Fare program by the FDO and the slots for each dinner will be filled on a “first come, first serve” basis.
“We expect it will be an exhilarating evening for the freshmen,” Dingman said.

As scaffolding rises over Dunster House’s iconic tower, members of the House community praised the renovated Inn at Harvard, which is serving as the center for House life during the renewal process.
The former Inn—rechristened “Dunster Headquarters” by House staff and students—houses students in double and single bedrooms and features House amenities such as a dining hall, music practice rooms, meeting spaces, and common rooms equipped with couches and televisions. After the renovation of Dunster House, the building will continue to serve as a residential and social hub for each House remodeled over the course of the the College’s decade-long House Renewal project.
A week into life at the Inn, members of the Dunster community said they are pleased with the quality of their temporary housing and the recently-opened dining hall.
“It’s completely not what you’d think of if you think of ‘swing housing,’” said Alex Y. T. Yang ’17, a Dunster resident living in the Inn. “I honestly think this is the best housing on campus.”
He added that the rooms all boast in-suite bathrooms and air conditioning—perks which he said make up for their small size.
Jocelyn L. Arndt ’17, another resident of the Inn this year, said she was “very happy” with her rooming situation. She cited the common spaces and dining hall as functional spaces that keep the Dunster community together.
“The Dunster-only meal hours are really nice. I’m still meeting people, but this is definitely Dunster Headquarters,” she said.
As he studied in the new dining hall, Jim Chan ’16, a Dunster resident living in Hampden Hall, said he enjoys the Inn’s proximity to the Yard and the other River Houses. Chan added that the displacement of students this year has not detracted from the community spirit that Dunster House fosters.
“The fact that we’re scattered doesn’t mean that we still don’t come together as a community at Dunster Headquarters,” he said, noting that the dining hall’s meal-time restrictions to either Dunster students alone or Dunster students plus one guest has helped preserve a tight-knit community and “gives us a sense of pride that we’re still an established House on campus.”
Dunster House Masters Roger B. Porter and Ann Porter wrote in an email to The Crimson that they feel the former Inn has become “a bright, welcoming, functional environment.”
They added that they are pursuing certain initiatives to maintain a sense of House community across the Inn and other swing spaces throughout Harvard Square, such as joint study breaks for all the House’s satellite locations and Masters’ open houses with dishes prepared by students.

Students filled a Science Center lecture hall Sunday afternoon to discuss matters beyond the study card: the differing ethical principles of Christians and non-believers.
The event, hosted by the student group Harvard Community of Humanists, Agnostics, and Atheists and non-denominational Christian group Harvard College Faith and Action, with co-sponsorship from the Harvard Political Union, was a moderated debate about varying conceptions of the “good life.”
Philosophy Professor Jeffrey K. McDonough helped guide the discussion as students attempted to articulate their different worldviews.
“Are theists alone in thinking that murder is wrong? Are atheists alone in thinking that fish sticks on Friday still aren’t that good?” McDonough asked.
Speaking for HCHAA, Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 said that she found a supportive and diverse community among fellow non-believers at Harvard, despite what she sees as a common belief that atheism lack the structure of many Christian religions. Members of HCHAA in the audience wore matching red shirts, which read “Got Soul? Me neither.”
“There is a strain of thought, especially in the Western thought, of singling out the atheists as ‘the other’ group,” Coughlon said. “There seems to be some sort of thought that religion does something that atheism can’t.”
Members from HCFA and HCHAA disagreed about the extent to which individuals are obligated to help others.
During a question-and-answer portion of the debate, David M. Fulton ’16 of HCFA pointed to a direct example of how another HCFA member continually reached out to a friend who was caught up in using drugs, stealing credit cards, lying, and drunk-driving to highlight the Christian commitment of continually helping others.
Coughlon and fellow HCHAA debater Savannah N. Fritz ’17 said they are committed to the idea of assisting those in need but do not think that individuals are morally obligated to insert themselves in situations that might cause them considerable pain.
Representatives from both groups said that they hoped the event would serve as a catalyst for future conversation.
“Everything that we are saying right now is kind of unsubstantiated,” Fulton said in his closing remarks. “You kind of have to go out and see for yourself.”
Audience members applauded the debate for providing a means of discussion and contact between students of varying religious backgrounds.
“I think that the debate is merely a starting point,” said Karl E. Krehbiel ’15, a member of HCFA, adding that “it generally tends to facilitate friendships.”
“I think that the purpose, for me, is to get the conversation started, to recognize how big the conversation is and how neither side can persuade the other in an hour or two,”  Harvard Humanist Chaplain Greg M . Epstein said after the debate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While some activists worry that the new Harvard health benefits plan announced last week may increase the cost of healthcare for some non-union employees, others say that the changes help balance the costs of the University's health system.
The restructured plan now requires employees to pay a $250 deductible for care that extends beyond routine visits and tests, thereby increasing potential out-of-pocket costs. To mitigate the financial burden, the University said last week that it expects to reduce monthly premiums and implement a cap on maximum out-of-pocket insurance costs.
The University will still cover the full cost of preventative care, including regularly scheduled doctor visits and other annual tests and screenings.
Still, the changes might create “an affordability problem,” according to Harvard School of Public Health professor Nancy Kane, who formerly served on the University Benefits Committee, the body that recommended the changes.
“With the caps on [out-of-pocket costs], I feel less concerned,” she said. “If there were no caps on it, it would be terrifying.”
As employees try to figure out how the new plan will affect their yearly insurance costs, some worry the changes will inflict greater harm than benefit.
“It’s a major cost shift, plain and simple,” said Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Director Bill Jaeger. “These changes are going in the wrong direction.”
Some worry the changes may increase disparities between union and non-union employees of the University. Union members negotiate separate health benefits contracts and were therefore not affected by the changes.
“It’s going from what has been a whole community program to a fragmented assortment of plans,” Jaeger said, adding that he has seen “lots of backlash” from the non-union employees who are upset about anticipated increases to their health care costs.
Jaeger also said that he worries the changes may disproportionately harm lower-paid employees who cannot afford the higher out-of-pocket costs.
The University has cited rising healthcare costs nationwide as the driving force behind the changes. A Center for Health Information and Analysis study released at the beginning of the month reported that overall health spending grew 2.3 percent in Massachusetts during the past year. Health benefits currently account for about 12 percent of the University's budget.
Given the rising cost of insurance, some people said they understand why the University chose to implement the cost-controlling measures.
“People are going to be more negative than positive because money is going out of their pocket faster,” Kane said. “But they don’t know the alternatives; it could be much worse.”
Incorporating deductibles and coinsurance are standard industry policy. According to a 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation report, 78 percent of insured workers in the U.S. pay a general annual deductible.
“I think nuanced cost-sharing in insurance can be a really useful tool in steering health care resources towards where they can produce the most health,” School of Public Health professor Katherine Baicker said.
Harvard’s Office of Human Resources has not yet solicited feedback on the plan from employees, but it has received a small number of fact-based inquiries regarding the details and nuances of the plan, according to spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Hundreds of alumni, students, and faculty members vied for standing room in the School of Public Health’s cafeteria here Monday afternoon, as top University officials formally unveiled the largest single gift in University history and honored its catalyst, alumnus Gerald L. Chan.
The announcement, including recognition that the school will be renamed in honor of Chan’s late father, T.H. Chan, was met with a standing ovation. A series of speeches and videos accompanying the unveiling framed the gift, valued at $350 million, as the cornerstone of the 100-year-old school’s second century.
Speaking at length, University President Drew G. Faust praised the pledge as “transformative” and outlined the new opportunities it will help generate for attacking problems such as the obesity epidemic, preventable diseases, and HIV/AIDS.
“This gift will inspire the next generation of public health students who will in turn be the following generation’s public health leaders and advocates,” Faust said. She added that undergraduates are equally energized by the field and have made “Global Health and Health Policy” the most popular secondary at the College.
“It tells the world that this is a public health moment, and it challenges Harvard to meet the moment by opening its doors wider, reaching deeper and farther, taking risks in pursuit of new answers and new solutions,” Faust said.
HSPH Dean Julio Frenk echoed Faust’s statements in his own speech and in an interview after the ceremony, reflecting on the school’s history and envisioning its future.
“This was a magical moment for the school,” Frenk said in the interview. “[The gift] makes a statement in the confidence of the future of public health.”
The $350 million pledge was made public shortly after midnight Monday and immediately captured the attention of national media. Though Chan has been the face of the gift, the funds come from the Morningside Foundation, his family’s philanthropic arm. The money will be added to the school’s existing $1.1 billion endowment for annual distribution.
Frenk detailed some of the initiatives that the donation will make possible in his speech. He said that HSPH hopes to offer a loan forgiveness program so students can afford to work in underserved communities in the United States and around the globe. In addition, Frenk said the donation will make possible innovative research projects, educational resources, and big data initiatives.
Chan, whose family has made billions in real estate and venture capital, followed Frenk and Faust to the stage. His roughly ten-minute address traced the motivations behind his generosity to the school, where he earned a master’s and Ph.D., and detailed his family’s values. The gift, he said, represents a mixing of his mother's commitment to disease prevention and his father's focus on education.
Chan said his mother, who in the 1950s was a nurse in a British hospital in northern China, led the hospital’s efforts to improve sanitation and hygiene and would frequently administer vaccines out of the family’s kitchen in Hong Kong, where they later lived.
He said his father, after whom the school will now be named, financially supported many Hong Kongese students studying abroad for their tertiary education who would not have been able to otherwise.
“His actions were powerful examples—it is most fitting that a school should be a part of his legacy,” Chan said.
Chan concluded by offering a personal motto: “Return is not only measured in financial terms but also in human lives and health.”
Chan’s message was received enthusiastically by the crowd, which included University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers—the University’s highest governing bodies. Chan’s mother and other family members were also in attendance.
Garber, speaking in an interview after the ceremony, stressed the importance of the gift given recent high-profile threats to public health worldwide.
“I couldn’t be happier about who’s giving the gift [and] the purpose the gift is being given for, which will not only strengthen Harvard’s School of Public Health but public health as an activity throughout the world,” Garber said. “The timing couldn’t be any greater.”
Students on hand said that the gift is already serving to energize the school.
“There is a lot of hope in the air, and students are looking forward to the next 101 years,” said Pratik Panchal, a student at the HSPH’s Master of Public Health Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the exception of its season-ending loss to BU in the NCAA tournament, the Harvard women’s soccer team finished its 2013 campaign by going unbeaten in 13 straight matches.
This weekend, the Crimson opened its 2014 season in strong fashion, as its young stars carried the team to two victories.
Harvard (2-0-0) followed up a home win over San Francisco on Friday with one on the road at Providence on Sunday, displaying solid performances and controlling the match on both occasions.
HARVARD 2, PROVIDENCE 0
On Sunday, sophomore forward Midge Purce followed up Friday’s win with another sterling performance, tallying both goals as the Crimson bested Providence at Glay Field on Sunday for its second win of the weekend.
The second year’s first mark came in the 13th minute, as she converted a penalty kick for her first goal of the season. Although the Friars (1-3-2) committed only three fouls in the game to the Crimson’s nine, that foul early in the game proved costly.
After being subbed out for a brief rest in the middle of the second half, Purce notched her second tally of the game less than 90 seconds after returning to the field.
The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year picked up where she left off last season, having scored 11 goals for the Crimson a year ago.
Durack and the rest of the Harvard defense again proved vital in the victory, recording the Crimson’s second shutout in as many games to start the season. The Friars put more pressure on Harvard than the Lady Dons did on Friday, as Providence outshot the Crimson, 18-11—including 10 to three in the first frame—but simply could not convert any of those opportunities into goals.
“[Our defenders] are such solid, consistent players…and it gives us the confidence to do what we need to do on offense,” Purce said. “They’ve just done a phenomenal job.”
HARVARD 1, SAN FRANCISCO 0
Freshman midfielder Dani Stollar scored in her collegiate debut as Harvard opened its season with a victory against San Francisco, 1-0, at Soldiers Field on Friday night.
The Crimson controlled the game for most of the first half, outshooting the Lady Dons (3-2-1),10-3, in the first frame. The lone tally of the contest came in the 36th minute on a set piece, as Purce played a cross to the far post. After the header was blocked, Stollar controlled the rebound and slotted it past junior goalkeeper Madalyn Schiffel.
Purce, Harvard’s leading scorer last season as a freshman, reprised her role as the Crimson’s offensive catalyst. She consistently used her speed to dribble through the San Francisco defense, creating chances both for herself and for her teammates.
“[Purce] started out well and really did move the ball a lot,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “She had a good pressure on the ball [and] was exciting in the attack.”
While the Harvard offense dictated the first half, the Lady Dons came out strong after halftime and outshot the Crimson, five to four, in a back-and-forth final 45 minutes. The teams traded possession in the midfield for much of the period as both defenses continually stymied potential offensive chances.
San Francisco tested the Harvard backline and sophomore netminder Lizzie Durack at times in the second half, but Durack made two saves and corralled some threatening loose balls in the box. Her final save came with five seconds left and sealed the win for the Crimson.
“We battled, let’s put it that way,” Leone said. “We didn’t play particularly great in possession, but we defended very hard and fought very hard, and that was a good start. We’ve just got to play more games.”
With the win, Harvard avenged a 1-0 road loss to the Lady Dons last season.The victory marks the first time since 2005 that Harvard has won its first two games of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team started its season off on a high note this weekend, winning all three of its games at the Princeton Invitational and living up to its ranking as the 19th-best team in the country.
“We played pretty well,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “There were still some things we need to work on, but you don’t want to be playing your best right now; you want to be playing at that level in November, when it counts.”
HARVARD 12, BUCKNELL 10
In its second contest on Sunday, Harvard faced a talented Bucknell team that has had the Crimson’s number in recent years. The day marked Harvard’s first win over the Bison in the last nine games of the series.
Going into halftime tied, 6-6, both teams continued to struggle to pull away from each other and ended up trading goals along the way to a 10-10 score at the end of regulation.
In overtime, however, junior goaltender Colin Woolway shined, shutting out the Bucknell offense for the entirety of the extra time and ultimately finishing with nine saves. Meanwhile, junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel and sophomore attacker Joey Colton notched scores, giving Harvard the lead for good. Both players finished with four goals.
“We need to improve in every stage of the game,” Minnis said. “Defensively we had some lapses, we can help a little better, and we can move the ball better. We will continue to grow in our system as the season goes on. The season is a staircase and you want to be playing your best later in the season, not right now.”
HARVARD 13, GEORGE WASHINGTON 9
Following a lightning strike that forced tournament games to be postponed to Sunday, Harvard faced George Washington in the first of two matches for the day.
The Crimson jumped out to a quick start and outscored its opponent, 10-6, in the first half, with three goals coming from sophomore attacker Viktor Wrobel. But the Colonials pushed back following the break, bringing the score to within two before Zepfel iced the game for Harvard with a pair of goals of his own.
“We played very consistently the whole weekend,” said Harvard captain and utility player Max Murphy. “Each game had its challenges, but we were able to overcome them as a team. This weekend was a huge team effort.”
Zepfel would finish the game with four goals, while Wrobel notched three. Freshman utility player Colin Chiapello continued on his strong debut performance, adding another two goals for the Crimson.
HARVARD 11, DIABLO VALLEY 7
In its first game of the season on Saturday afternoon, the Crimson faced off against Diablo Valley College, a community college in Pleasant Hill, Calif. The game started slowly, with Harvard taking a slim, 2-1 lead into halftime, but the Crimson quickly put the contest out of reach in the second half.
“We had a little bit of a slow start at the beginning,” Murphy said. “But by the time the second half rolled around, we got it together. Our defense was playing well the whole weekend, and that did a lot for us.”
Harvard went on an 8-2 run to take a commanding 10-4 lead with just over five minutes remaining in the game, and the team managed to withstand a late comeback attempt by the Vikings to finish off the match.
The Crimson was led by strong play from junior attacker Blake Lee and Chiapello, who each scored a hat trick. Woolway also came up big for Harvard, making six saves and keeping the game close in the early minutes.
“It’s still early, but we got to see what our young kids are able to do as well as our returning players,” Minnis said. “We were able to get into more of a flow and really focus on the things that we’ve been working on in preseason and improve what we do.”

Happy Monday! Incase you needed something to make you even more excited about the start of the school week, just a friendly reminder that shopping week is coming to an end and Study Card Day is tomorrow! In light of Study Card Day, see which of the below applies to you:
I chose at least one of my classes because…
a) I can iMessage my friends from home for a full 53 minutes instead of taking lecture notes and still manage to get an A
b) It doesn’t meet on Fridays
c) All my friends are in it, which means I can copy their p-set answers instead of actually doing them
d) There are no sections, which means less time spent in class and more time spent on HBOGo
e) It’s my first class of the morning, and by morning I mean 12 p.m. or later
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIt’s going to be sunny today, but only a high of 73 degrees (aka hanging out with friends in your room won’t feel like a torturous involuntary trip to the sauna)! There’s also a zero percent chance of rain, which is a blessing after the random and unexpected downpours this past weekend that made people sport garbage bags as ponchos (how unfortunate).

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
College students across America may just have returned to campus, but the school year is already proving eventful.
Over at MIT, an intoxicated woman fell from a window at the Lamda Chi Alpha fraternity last week, taking the term “drunken stumble” to whole new levels. Luckily she survived the incident, but the same can’t be said for the fraternity’s social prospects. MIT has banned all fraternity, sorority, and independent living group gatherings of more than 49 people. Really, we’re just surprised that many people showed up in the first place.
In other falls from grace, Yale’s chaplain Rev. Bruce M. Shipman has resigned following the publication of his controversial three sentence letter on Gaza to the New York Times. Powerful words, clearly. No word on his future career plans, but we hear there’s a spot open at BU for a new Dean of Arts and Sciences.
Also suffering from campus controversy, an exposé of sorts on Dartmouth’s Greek life recently hit the shelves. Former SAE Dartmouth bro Andrew Lohse released a book titled “Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy: A Memoir,” that claims the frat served lemonade contaminated with urine, and asked its pledges to swim through feces, to name a few of the organization’s hazing offences. The book promises 320 pages of unsavory anecdotes and gross insights to Dartmouth’s Greek scene, and follows up to Lohse’s 2012 Rolling Stone feature. But apparently it’s true what they say: any publicity is good publicity, because Dartmouth’s SAE chapter has been more popular in the past two years than it had in the five before. Go figure.
Moving on to an institution that apparently doesn’t celebrate exclusivity, Stanford recently announced they’re planning to increase their undergraduate enrollment, and will be accepting around 100 extra students for the fall of 2016. We applaud their efforts, but commiserate with those 100 unlucky students who’ll be missing out on a single next year.
Also now more inclusive, Mount Holyoke will begin accepting applications not only from cisgender females, but also others who identify as women. The college’s president, Linda Pasquerella, made the announcement in her welcome address on September 2, in which she said the college recognized that “exclusion from the category of ‘woman’ based on properties of birth is nothing new”.
