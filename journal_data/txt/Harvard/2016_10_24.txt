After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Fifty Shades of Grey” has an older, more intelligent sister, and her name is “Future Sex.” Emily Witt’s first book is an honest and unapologetic narrative of all things sex: its role in our lives, our response to its presence, and its association with both positive and negative behaviors. Knowing that sex can often be a taboo subject, “Future Sex” urges its readers to dive into the topic, whatever its awkwardness, and fosters a newfound understanding of the world of love around us.
Witt formats the book into eight chapters, encompassing topics from internet dating to internet pornography to birth control regulations. It is written completely from Witt’s perspective, as she recounts stories and memories from her own experiences. Knowing that every crazy, graphic, surprising scenario actually occurred makes the novel seem all the more real and makes one eagerly accept any absurdity. Witt deftly exposes her readers to an exciting world about which many people wish not to speak, and the presence of which is often neglected or regarded as inappropriate.
Although such occurrences might be uncomfortable to read about, Witt’s brave tone makes a reader feel welcome and at ease while discussing the uneasy. Some chapters contain extremely graphic material, much of which makes Christian Grey’s interests seem rather elementary. For example, chapter three contains a step-by-step description of a pornography scene that, while erotic, is ultimately meant to shed light on the dimensions of the pornography world and why people choose to indulge in it. Witt steadily helps her readers through this section, providing stable guidance.
To college students, the most intriguing part of the novel might be Witt’s analysis of dating apps. However, regardless of age, the shift from in-person interaction to online sexual communication is undoubtedly significant. We can already observe how technology has altered the world, but Witt shows us how it has particularly altered relationships as well as the perception of what they should look like. Ultimately, she expands one’s understanding of the impact of dating apps, claiming that they cause “strangers of the city to lower the barriers of their isolation.” There’s something unique and insightful about the way Witt allows one to think about something seemingly taboo in a more poised, academic manner.
Additionally, Witt’s critique of the limited accessibility of and consequences associated with birth control sheds light on how sex might not be so wonderful, at least not for everyone involved. When discussing her personal experiences with an IUD, she states, “It seemed impossible that in this era of advanced technology I was still reliant on the whims of a contraption that was literally elementary, a copper device that had been invented forty years ago.” While she had previously conveyed sex to be exciting and an object of interest, Witt’s frustrations regarding birth control allow a looking glass into her more multi-dimensional perspective on sex, as well as its often overlooked issues. Ultimately, Witt leaves nothing unsaid and is brave enough to tell the frustrating sides of every story.

To the Editor:
We are members and friends of the Harvard-Radcliffe Class of 1972 who wish to express our solidarity with the 750 Harvard University dining hall workers who are on strike, and with their student allies.
Some of us were student-workers in the dining halls as undergraduates.  Some of us took part in the struggles for pay equity among campus workers (women and men, black and white) during those years.  All of us urge the Harvard administration to accede to the strikers’ demands to maintain (if not improve!) health coverage and to guarantee that all full-time dining hall workers earn at least the very modest sum of $35,000 per year.
Harvard boasts that the average Harvard dining services worker earns $21.89 an hour. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, however, a minimum subsistence living wage for a worker who is supporting just one child would be $26.87 an hour.
While these numbers do not fully reflect the complexity of the issues at stake, the question remains: What values will be conveyed to students and the community by Harvard’s response to this strike?
Many of our generation believed, as students during “the sixties,” in the possibility of a truly just society, free of racism, sexism, exploitation, and war.  Most of us underestimated the nature of the struggle that would be necessary to achieve such a society.  Yet we are heartened that another generation is taking up that struggle.
Sincerely,

While most voters will be focused on the presidential election on November 8th, Massachusetts’ voters also have an important decision to make on Question 2. If approved, it would lift the cap on charter schools currently in place across the state, allowing 12 new ones to be formed. This issue was placed on the ballot due to thousands of citizens signing petitions after the General Court voted down a similar proposal. Opponents of Question 2 claim that charter schools drain money from traditional public schools and harm public education. But in fact, charter schools lead to increased public school funding and provide a superior level of education to thousands of at-risk children. Here are the three most compelling reasons that you should vote “Yes” on Question 2:
1. Charter schools are in high demand and incredibly effective.
First off, charter schools are public schools that are operated independently of a local school district. They are open to every child in the state and are free to attend. Unfortunately, the number of charter schools in Massachusetts is not meeting demand, so schools have to hold lotteries for enrollment. As of 2015, 32,000 students in Massachusetts are currently on waiting lists to get into charter schools. Clearly, families want to send their children to these schools, and lifting the cap will give far more parents the opportunity to do so.
Parents want their children in charters in large part because they’re so effective. In Massachusetts, charter school students receive the equivalent of over three more months of learning in math and almost two more months of learning in English per year than their public school counterparts. These are among the best results of any state in the country. In Boston, the gains are even more pronounced, with charter school students receiving the equivalent of 13 months of math learning and 12 months of reading learning per year more than their Boston Public School peers. Lifting the cap means more quality public schools across the Commonwealth.
2. Charter schools help the most disadvantaged among us.
Charter schools predominantly serve the most at-risk students in the state. While 37 percent of students in Massachusetts’ public schools are racial or ethnic minorities, 68 percent of charter school students are people of color. Charter schools serve a higher proportion of students with a first language other than English, students with limited English proficiency, and students from an economically disadvantaged background. In addition, students with special needs have seen significant gains in charter schools compared to their public school peers. Question 2 would give priority for new charter schools to the poorest performing school districts in the state, meaning that thousands of the neediest children in Massachusetts would have a chance to attend a quality school.
3. Question 2 will lead to more funding for public education
Question 2’s critics have claimed that charter schools take away funding from traditional public schools. This claim is completely false. In fact, the state government will continue to give traditional public schools funding for students who have left for a charter school for up to 6 years. This means even students not attending public schools will continue to have their education subsidized—and it means that public schools will actually see an increase in their per pupil spending. Since charter schools were introduced in Massachusetts in 1995, this subsidy program alone has provided  $700 million for public school districts. A “Yes” vote on Question 2 means more funding for our public schools.
So if you care about making sure that every child receives a quality education, if you care about the 32,000 children on charter school waiting lists, if your care about social justice, and if you care about putting more money into our public schools, vote “Yes” on Question 2 on November 8th.

W. Kent Haeffner '18, a government concentrator, lives in Quincy House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard College Honor Council recently released its first report detailing its actions during its inaugural year and its findings based on 115 reviewed cases. This comes one year after the Council assumed its duties, with administrators working hard throughout this time period to make the Honor Council and the Honor Code  central tenets of Harvard’s academic environment. We commend the Honor Council’s transparency in sharing these details, and hope that they lead to more effective means of combating academic integrity violations on campus.
Following shortcomings with how the Administrative Board handled academic integrity issues and the 2013 cheating scandal, Harvard College administrators introduced the Honor Code and the Honor Council in 2015. The Honor Council was created to uphold the standards of the Honor Code and foster a stronger sense of academic integrity at the College, as well as to address the need to include students in discussions of these issues. While we were originally skeptical as to the effectiveness of the Honor Code and the possibility of secrecy in Honor Council deliberations, the Honor Council’s report shows a commitment to accountability and clarity, and we praise their efforts to communicate their work.
Of the 115 cases presented to the Council last year, a majority were in the sciences and SEAS, and many of these involved problem sets. The Honor Council’s report notes that the greater prevalence of academic integrity issues in these divisions could be due to “ease of accessing solution sets and online resources, different collaboration policies across different courses, and considerable concern about grades by students.” While these are all reasonable conclusions, the report's most important point on this score is that science and SEAS classes based on problem sets simply have more assignments—and in turn more opportunities for cheating—than comparable classes in the humanities. Furthermore, the inherently collaborative nature of problem sets, different from the more solitary approach to papers, blurs the lines between collaboration and academic dishonesty. Problem sets can often more easily be screened for cheating, especially in classes like CS50, where algorithms to detect cheating have been in place for years.
The report’s observations also bring attention to plagiarism and time management as significant issues. Based on the cases brought before the Honor Council, it appears that many plagiarism cases were “substantive...and fundamentally deceptive”, which suggests a broader problem regarding writing with integrity at the College. Additionally, students involved in Honor Council cases frequently cited “significant time pressures” as an impetus for cheating. These issues are systemic not only to Harvard but many high-pressure academic institutions, and we appreciate the Council’s acknowledgement of them. We hope that, by acknowledging risk factors, our campus will find clear-cut measures to combat them and promote academic integrity.
Despite these illuminating findings, it is important to note that this report only consists of one year’s worth of data. More information over multiple years is needed before we can draw definitive conclusions, and we look forward to the Honor Council’s continued commitment to providing data.  Academic integrity is crucial to Harvard's academic environment, and the Honor Council is doing well at maintaining an informative, transparent relationship with students. As the institution moves beyond its inaugural year, we are hopeful that future reports will further elucidate patterns of violations so that our community can better address these issues.

Dozens gathered at the Law School Friday to discuss the importance of nutrition and to consider how people can gain access to healthy food in the United States.
The Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School partnered with Community Servings, a nonprofit nutrition program in Massachusetts, to host the fourth annual Food is Medicine Symposium. The evening consisted of two panel discussions and a lecture from keynote speaker Timothy S. Harlan, the executive director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University. The center is the first teaching kitchen opened at a medical school, according to the center's website.
“Food is medicine, and it plays such a big role,” Samantha L. Hooper, an executive at a public relations firm that works with Community Servings, said.
The first set of panelists discussed the role of food banks in solving the problem of food insecurity, the inability for people to consistently get healthy food. Kim Prendergast, a panelist from the non nonprofit Feeding America, said during the event that 12.7 percent of U.S. households are food-insecure.
The second panel focused on medically tailored food, which provides adequate nutrition for people with dietary restrictions because of a chronic illness. Community Servings, which was founded in 1989 to provide food for HIV and AIDS patients, provides medically tailored food to about 1,100 clients with 35 different illnesses, CEO David B. Waters said.
“I fell in love with the idea of feeding people who were sick and low income so I started at Community Servings when they were first founded,” Waters said in an interview after the event.
Harlan ended the night with a lecture about nutrition and his role at the Goldring Center. He livened the crowd with jokes and anecdotes.
“I changed the way I cook and became very interested in health in general,” Harlan said in an interview.
About 100 people showed up to hear the panelists. Phuong Ho, a volunteer at Community Servings, said she enjoyed the event because it focused on an issue she cares about.
“I volunteer with Community Servings and I am on their mailing list so that’s how I heard about it,” Ho said. “Food insecurity is a really big interest of mine so this was a nice connecting talk to go see these leaders.”

After two weeks of contentious debate, the Undergraduate Council narrowly overturned a bid to establish formal caucuses for underrepresented minorities on the UC after the proposed amendment did not receive a necessary two-thirds approval.
The Council first considered the bylaws amendment last week, but postponed a vote on the motion until Sunday evening. Under the legislation, groups of three or more UC representatives from an underrepresented group could have applied to the UC’s Student Relations Committee to become an officially recognized caucus. The caucuses would have had the authority to endorse legislation and release statements. 
Several representatives raised concerns about the three-representative requirement to form a caucus.
“We [would] have a two-tiered system,” Crimson Yard representative Arnav Agrawal ’20 said during debate. “Certain underrepresented groups will have an official caucus, and there may be a Native American caucus which will never reach eligibility because they have so few members at Harvard.”
Still, UC Rules Committee Chair Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 argued the legislation would not infringe on the powers of unrecognized caucuses.
“Just because we're institutionalizing these caucuses doesn't prevent unofficial caucuses from forming,” Khansarinia said.
Other representatives said the legislation would make the existing informal caucus system unnecessarily complex. Presently, there are no formal caucuses but there exist a number of unofficial identity-based groups within the UC, including the BGLTQ caucus, the black caucus, and the Latinx caucus.
“We are adding layers and layers to something that only needs one simple catalyst: a few members of the UC who care about their identity and how it integrates with their community,” UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 said.
After a lengthy debate, 26 representatives voted in favor of the legislation, 16 voted against, and three abstained. Thirty-one representatives voting in favor would have been necessary to reach the two-thirds supermajority required to amend the bylaws to formalize caucuses.
Toward the start of the meeting, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 also announced the College has offered $5,000 to the Council for a “Strike Community Building Fund,” in response to concerns presented by an ongoing strike by Harvard University Dining Services workers that began about three weeks ago.
The Undergraduate Council voted earlier this month to endorse HUDS workers in their efforts to strike. Since then, the Council has funded donuts and coffee for the workers, and used emergency funds to provide sandwiches for students.
Rather said the purpose of the community building fund is to “mobilize the community to build up energy that is somewhat lost in closed dining halls.” College administrators had previously expressed concern over how the strike could negatively affect House life, and the OSL and University President’s Office have funded events during the strike—often with food.
“We're happy to receive those funds, and happy to work with the OSL to return to some normalcy on campus,” Rather said.
At the start of the meeting, UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18 outlined the timeline for the UC presidential election this year. The candidacy declaration form opens Sunday night and is due next Sunday. Candidates must receive 150 petition signatures in order to appear on the ballot.
The presidential campaign officially begins Nov. 8, with voting opening on Nov. 14 and closing on Nov 17. In addition to voting for the next UC president and vice president, undergraduates will also be able to vote for referenda that receive either two-thirds Council approval or 670 petition signatures. The election and referenda results will be announced at 10 p.m. on Nov. 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office for the Arts aimed to alleviate mid-semester student stress—some caused by dining hall closures and the strike of dining hall workers—with a series of free "pop-up" events this weekend that included workshops on subjects ranging from pottery to dance.
The series comprised of four events. The first three—“Pinch Pot Pop-Up!,” “Get your KNIT Together,”  and “Expressive Motion!”—took place on Friday and attracted more than a dozen students each. Saturday’s scheduled event, “Cardio Dance Plus!,” did not occur because of low attendance. Each workshop, which also had free food, featured a trained instructor who offered students the opportunity to experiment with crafts or performances.
Cathleen D. McCormick, the Director of Programs at the OFA, said she organized the pop-up series with the aim of creating a creative common space for students affected by the ongoing strike of dining services workers.
“A lot of the dining halls are closed, and students aren’t seeing each other as much as they normally are,” she said. “It seemed like a good idea to put together some sort of community-building event.”
Thomas Lee, the OFA’s Director of Learning from Performers and Communications, also hoped the events could “foster community” in a time of stress.
“We hope this would help students at a time that is really stressful, not just with the dining hall situation, but with coursework and exams and the election,” he said, referring to an ongoing strike of dining services workers.
McCormick said she wished to give students who lacked exposure to the arts in high school a chance to try something new while also making sure that more experienced artists were still engaged. She emphasized the importance of the arts as an outlet for personal reflection.
“[Students] have so many things going on all the time that I think it’s actually good for the gray mass to focus on one thing, even if it’s just for an hour,” she said.
Amy G.  Zhao ’18, who attended the pinch pot event, described the event as a chance to participate in activities that are not typically offered on campus.
“I’ve always been interested in ceramics since middle school, so my blockmate and I decided this would be a fun event to go to,” she said. “I really did appreciate that the OFA is trying their best to host these sort of mini workshop events for students during this time of strike.”
Zhao expressed a desire to see more of these arts events throughout the year.
“It’s something I would continue even after the strike period has resolved,” she said.

University President Drew G. Faust commended Harvard’s global impact at an alumni event in Berlin Friday, the latest in a series of international trips she has made as part of the University’s ongoing capital campaign.
Speaking at the Deutsches Historisches Museum, Faust discussed Harvard’s societal role as a modern research university in front of alumni and Harvard supporters in Berlin. She has made a number of similar appearances as part of the “Your Harvard” series around the country and world, including in Beijing, Mexico City, New York, and Boston. 
“We are an inherently—and intentionally—global institution, and we are becoming more expansive in our reach and our presence throughout the world,” Faust said at the event, according to excerpts of her remarks publicized by the Harvard Alumni Association.
Beyond Faust’s remarks, the event also featured a discussion between Harvard professors. Mary Sarotte ’88, a visiting professor from Germany, led a panel on global migration with Juliette Kayyem ’91, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, and Werner Sollors, an English professor.
Faust’s trip to meet with European alumni comes in the midst of the University’s ongoing capital campaign. Harvard announced it had raised $7 billion in September, officially surpassing its fundraising goal of $6.5 billion, almost two years before its 2018 end date. While it has raised more than its total goal, the University is still seeking money for a number of individual initiatives, such as financial aid and House renewal.
During past appearances about the campaign, Faust has discussed specific fundraising priorities, including the campus in Allston.
In addition to the Alumni Association, several Harvard clubs in Germany sponsored the event, including the Harvard Club of Berlin, the Harvard Club of Hamburg, the Harvard Club of Munich, the Harvard Club of Rhein-Main, and the Harvard Club of Rhein-Ruhr.
The gathering in Berlin was the 12th “Your Harvard” event since the launch of the capital campaign, and the second in Europe—Faust visited London in 2014. Faust’s next stops on the “Your Harvard” tour will be Miami, in February 2017, Singapore the month after, and Minneapolis in June 2017.

Patrons sipped cups of mint tea as they sought to savor the final hours of Café Algiers, a restaurant that served up Middle Eastern treats for 45 years in Harvard Square.
Catching customers off guard, the local institution announced on its Facebook page late Friday evening that it was closing—Sunday night was the café’s last.
“Algiers will be closing, after many years of business, many years of hard work, and many stories,” the post read. “Please keep all our cooks, waitresses, and managers in your thoughts—and think of us when you next drink mint tea!”
Located at 40 Brattle St. in the same building as the Brattle Theatre and Alden and Harlow restaurant, Café Algiers was a frequent stop for Harvard students and faculty. The restaurant's menu offered a range of fare from falafels and hummus to coffee, to go along with their popular mint tea. Tiled walls and a second floor lined with manuscripts and books distinguished the café as unique among eateries.
Robert Chalfen, a local resident who has been a customer at Algiers for more than 30 years, described the special “ecosystem” that helped the café retain its character in spite of renovations.
“There’s nothing quite like it,” Chalfen said, lamenting what he called the corporatization of Harvard Square. “Sort of like being an endangered species in a habitat of some sort of overspecialized coral reef.”
Chalfen expressed dismay at what he deemed the homogeneity of modern café culture, especially with respect to the recent changes in Harvard Square. With Algiers now gone, he said Café Pamplona is the last Harvard Square café he enjoys.
“It’s going to upset my psychogeography rather dramatically,” Chalfen said.
Algiers is one of string of business in the Square that have closed over the past year, a list that includes Panera Bread, Uno Pizzeria, and Au Bon Pain. Some restaurants have pointed to rising rents as the cause for the closures. The exact cause of Café Algiers’ closure is unclear.
Cambridge residents were surprised by the announcement, and expressed sadness and disappointment over the closure of a longtime local mainstay. Patrons could be seen writing parting notes and contact information on napkins at the front counter Sunday evening around 9 p.m.
Some students who visited the café Sunday noted the melancholy atmosphere over the sudden closure.
Boston University senior Mehar Maju has frequented Algiers since her freshman year. She said the café’s shutdown for her marked a full-circle event as she prepares to graduate and move back to her native Los Angeles.
“With the closure of the café it feels like I’m getting a closure on my time in Boston,” Maju said.

In the last two times the Harvard women’s soccer team faced off against Princeton, a total of 12 goals were exchanged between the two sides. From the outset of their latest encounter on Saturday afternoon, however, heavy rain threatened to hamper the two high-flying offenses.
As it turned out, the wet conditions played a role in keeping the game low-scoring, but the performances of the two goalkeepers were more responsible for the tight affair. A 4th minute goal from senior forward Karly Zlatic after a scramble in the box proved to be the difference, as the contest ended 1-0 in favor of the Crimson.
“It was a wet and windy game and challenging for both teams to get their rhythm going,” said Harvard coach Chris Hamblin. “I’m incredibly proud of the team and how we were able to grind out the result today, on a day we didn’t necessarily playing our most attractive football.
With the win over the Tigers, the Crimson (8-3-3, 3-0-2 Ivy League) held onto its second-place standing in the Ivy League. It now sits just two points behind league leader Columbia after the Lions were held to a draw against Dartmouth at home. The two teams will have tough road matchups next weekend before clashing the following week, on the last day of the regular season.
Princeton (9-4-1, 1-3-1), meanwhile, continues to freefall after starting the season with a nearly perfect run of nonconference games. It has lost three in a row, and is currently tied for fifth in the conference.
The Tigers’ performance on Saturday mirrored that of its last two losses, as they dominated possession and enjoyed the greater share of chances. Just as against Brown and Columbia in the two weekends before this one, they easily outshot Harvard. For the second straight time, however, Princeton did not find the back of the net.
Crimson senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack was the main reason for the shutout, as she saved all seven shots that the Tigers fired on target. She was especially sharp at the beginning of the second half, when Princeton came out with a sense of urgency and peppered Durack’s goal.
In the span of 15 minutes right after halftime, Princeton earned three corner kicks and mustered four shots, all while holding the ball almost exclusively in its attacking half. Senior defender Haley Chow directed two well-placed headers at the net during this time, but Durack stood tall in goal and handled both.
“There haven’t been many times this season when we’ve been opened up in the back and needed Lizzie a whole lot,” Hamblin said. “But today, we did, and she came through for us with her handling and leadership. She played like the international goalkeeper that she is.”
The Tigers’ own international star, senior forward Tyler Lussi, led the charge for her team with five shots and three shots on goal. Both totals were game-highs.
On the other side of the field, the Harvard offense found relatively little success against a Princeton defense that keyed in on star senior forward Midge Purce. Only two Crimson players mustered a shot all game, and only Zlatic managed a shot on goal. Purce, meanwhile was held without a single shot for the first time this season.
“Midge is a unbelievably talented player, and she finds ways to help the team even if they don’t show up on the scoresheet,” Durack said. “But for us to still win this game shows how deep of a team we have this year.”
A red card for Tigers junior defender Katie Pratt-Thompson also helped the Crimson see out the shutout. After Princeton was reduced to 10 women in the 76th minute, it barely tested the Harvard defense. Chow fired a desperation shot from long range in the 89th minute, but that was the only attempt on goal by either team in the final 15 minutes.
“Princeton played really well, just as we expected them to,” Durack said. “We were still able to grind out the win though, as we’ve done and need to continue to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A third place finish in the New England Match Race Championships propelled the Harvard sailing team into a four regatta weekend. This, in addition to the team’s rise to national prominence as women’s and coed teams were ranked 15th and 20th, respectively in the Sailing World Magazine’s latest poll, contributed to a successful weekend, despite the weather.
OBERG TROPHY
In the 74th annual Oberg Trophy, the Crimson competed in the Northeastern hosted event on the Charles River in the face of sporadic rains and lower temperatures. The wind varied, beginning as a light breeze in the morning and built throughout the day, surpassing five knots.
Racing in NC Fireflies, the team finished in their strongest position of the weekend with a sixth place result out of 17 teams and totaled 281 points. Last year, the team placed a lower ninth overall with only 196 points. Of the Ivy League teams, only Yale placed ahead of Harvard, finishing third with 244 points. However, the Crimson edged out Brown, Dartmouth and Cornell.
Three divisions raced, each made up of a single skipper and crew. For Division A, sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz represented Harvard with a high sixth place finish and 83 total points. Junior skipper Dylan Farrell and co-captain crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj competed in Division B, earning 99 points and a ninth place finish. Division C also finished with 99 points, but a seventh place result as sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo and sophomore crew Divya Arya manned the boat.
“The team faced challenging conditions across New England this weekend,” Karnovsky said. “Sunday was incredibly windy which necessitated several personnel changes. Many of our boats switched to heavy-air combos instead of sailing without regular partners. While the team had mixed success overall, the changes made certainly helped us compete at a higher level."
FALL CENTRAL SERIES 6
Coming up in the middle of the pack, the Crimson team placed a balanced sixth out of 13 teams in the Boston College hosted regatta. Earning 58 points total, the group barely fell to Dartmouth who posted 56 points. Last year’s group placed fourth in the competition
Representing Harvard in Division A were freshman skipper Lucy Wilmot, sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo, and freshman crew Tancredi Castellano Pucci Di Barsento. The group posted a fourth place finish with 29 points. The Crimson sailors in Division B also complied 29 points but placed in fifth. This group was led by freshman skipper Victoria Marquez and freshman crew Juan Crestanello.
MRS. HURST BOWL
Improving on their eleventh place finish last year, Harvard sailing sent two team to the Mrs. Hurst Bowl, hosted by Dartmouth on Mascoma Lake and came back with a ninth place result. Against Ivy League rivals, the Crimson finished at the bottom the pack, as Brown, Yale and Dartmouth claimed third, fifth and seventh respectively. Competing in Z420’s, the groups gained a total of 286 points.
The A division did find some success, taking seventh in their pool with 143 points. The boat was manned by junior skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Kirstin Anderson. While Division B, staffed by junior skipper Taylor Gavula and junior crew Emma Wheeler, also tallied 143 points, the group fell to tenth in their division.
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
Mirroring last year’s overall result in the 18 team regatta, Division A posted a strong fourth place finish in their side of the race with 85 total points as Division B fell to 15th  with 141. Harvard placed tenth overall.
Hosted by Brown in Cranston, R.I., the Crimson tallied 244 points and edge out Cornell who finished with 374. However, division rivals Dartmouth, Brown and Yale finished out ahead of Harvard with 124, 155, and 172 points, respectively.
In Division A, junior co-captain, and skipper Nick Sertl, sophomore crew Christine Gosioco and freshman crew Jessica Williams, led the team to a strong finish, ahead of Yale. That finish was ultimately negated with 15th place showing by sophomore skipper Jackson Wagner, sophomore crew Catherine Tang, and junior crew Kevin Coakley.
“This weekend, we faced some difficult conditions with gusts up to 25 mile per hour on Sunday,” Coakley said. “I sailed in B division with Jackson Wagner once the breeze picked up. While we had a few good races, we had some difficulties with minor mistakes that were magnified by the difficulty of the fleet. Everyone had good boat handling and were fast in breeze, so sailing the shifts well was very important.”
Next weekend, the sailing team will compete in the Victorian Urn Trophy, the Schell Trophy, both hosted by the United States Coast Guard Academy, and the Nickerson Trophy hosted by Tufts University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 52nd iteration of the Head of the Charles Regatta, the black and white of Radcliffe Crew topped previous performances facing some of the toughest conditions in regatta history.  With tens of thousands of spectators weathering the elements, the crews benefitted strongly from the home field advantage.
The Radcliffe Heavyweight varsity eight pulled its way to a thirteenth position, eleventh among the collegiate boats, in the Championship Eight Event. On the lightweight side, the 130’s rowed away from the rest of the field to an eleven-second victory over local rival, Boston University, in the Lightweight Eight Event.
The lightweight win was an improvement over last year’s second-place victory and also proved to be an impressive margin over their Charles River nemesis, the Terriers, who trailed Radcliffe by less than a second in last year’s lightweight eight event. This victory was the first in the college careers of any of the three seniors, who had been runners up twice in the last three years.
The heavyweights, stroked by sophomore Raphaella Stalph, improved on last year’s 19th place finish. The varsity boat represented a younger face of Radcliffe, with co-captain Abigail Parker as the only senior in the crew.  Nevertheless, the youthful crew proved its ability to hang with the top competition from around the world.
Throughout the weekend, thirty to fifty mile-per-hour gusts plagued athletes on both days.  Oarsmen alternated between raging headwinds and ripping tailwinds as they navigated the Charles River’s notoriously windy course and narrow bridge arches. Both crews were supported by a large turnout. On Saturday, an alumnae reception at Weld Boathouse attracted many Radcliffe athletes of yesteryear, while clear conditions sustained a supportive fan base for the Sunday races.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tough five-set loss at the hands of Cornell capped last weekend’s slate of Ivy League competition, the Harvard women’s volleyball team got right back on track on Friday night.
The Crimson dropped the first set to Dartmouth in the Malkin Athletic Center, but responded by taking the next three to send the Big Green back to Hanover winless.
“We knew what we wanted to do against Dartmouth offensively and defensively,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “So we practiced all week.”
After splitting the first two sets, a 10-3 run behind three kills from junior Paige Kebe and two from co-captain Corie Bain that pushed the Crimson’s lead to 21-13 seemed to place Harvard (6-11, 4-4 Ivy) in a great position to take a one-set advantage over the Big Green (8-11, 1-7).
But point by point, the Crimson’s control over the frame became ever more tenuous.
Three straight attacking errors saw the lead shrink to five. The two teams would trade the next six points, putting Harvard within one point of victory. But three attack errors from the Crimson and a kill from Dartmouth’s Danielle Grinka brought the Big Green to within one point of tying the set, 24-23.
Then, in the most crucial moment of the match, it was freshman Grace Roberts Burbank who stepped up and delivered the decisive kill on a set from fellow classmate Erin McCarthy, taking a 2-1 lead that it would not let go of for the remainder of the contest.
“I’m excited about [the freshmen] are going to develop as a group,” Weiss said. “They’re getting so much great experience because we threw them right into a fire.”
After coughing up an 11-5 advantage in the fifth set against the Big Red less than a week prior, the squad made sure not to let that happen two games in a row.
“We do have a lot of youth on the team,” Weiss said. “We had to take the timeout and say you have to talk to each other too. It’s a big deal that they’ve got seven women on this little court. We need to communicate all the time so that’s what they worked on each point.”
The Crimson struggled to close out the third set, but the same could not be said about the next. Trailing 20-19, Harvard would only concede one more point for the rest of the frame. Two kills from sophomore Christina Cornelius and a myriad of Big Green errors later, the Crimson finally quieted the Big Green bench which had been boisterous all game long.
“I really don’t pay attention to the other side,” Kebe said. “Sometimes I’ll look over but it gives me fuel if I see them celebrating or doing something weird. [We can] just shut them down so they can’t do that anymore.”
Cornelius also anchored the defensive effort for the Crimson alongside Bain and freshman Maclaine Fields. Together, the trio tallied four solo blocks and six block assists en route to the team’s fourth Ancient Eight win.
In her second weekend back from injury, Kebe led the Crimson with an 11-kill effort. Burbank and Cornelius were right behind her, each tallying nine on the night.
While Dartmouth senior Emily Astarita—voted a member of the All-Ivy First Team last season—edged Kebe in kills with 13 on the night, the senior also had 9 errors, bringing her kill percentage down to 9 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There appeared to be a small-scale Harvard invasion of Princeton this past weekend, with four teams traveling to New Jersey to face off against their Ivy League rivals. The men’s soccer team, (8-3-2, 3-0-1 Ivy League) came from behind against Princeton (6-7-1, 0-3-1) on Saturday to bring home another win, and extend its win streak to seven game.
“We’ve had our struggles with Princeton over the last few years, and going into their place we knew it was going to take a full team effort and a full 90 minutes just grinding and battling through the game, and playing with all that passion and momentum we’ve had over the last few weeks” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “To do that and to come out with a result after being down 2-1 and going through a little bit of adversity in the first half, we’re really proud of the group.”
All of the action came in the first half, with all five goals being scored then. Princeton was set on defending its home turf, and made sure that Harvard knew that if it was to leave Roberts Stadium with a win, it would have to play just as physically as them. The Crimson responded quickly, pushing its way forward into the Tigers’ attacking third early on.
The offensive effort was due in part to freshman forward Taner Dogan, who once again set the tempo for the Crimson attack, scoring five minutes into the game. Just over four minutes into play time, the team found itself in the attacking third with an opportunity to score. Junior defender Justin Crichlow found Dogan on a long throw in, and Dogan hit it first time past Princeton goalkeeper Josh Haberman to score the first goal of the game, and his second in his Harvard career. Much like his first goal against BC, getting the early lead boosted the team’s confidence.
Princeton was not to be counted out though; and as hungry as Harvard was to get another goal, the Tigers were just as motivated to get the equalizer. Six minutes later, Princeton defender James Reiner connected with teammate Patrick Barba on a throw in; Barba headed the ball, which went to one of Princeton’s leading goal scorers, Greg Seifert. Seifert, off Barba’s header, headed the ball past Crimson junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks to scored the equalizer.
Harvard responded with several attempts on goal, but was unable to find a way past the Princeton defense.
After the Crimson’s last attempt off of junior midfielder Sam Brown’s corner kick, Princeton began a counterattack, and struck again 15 minutes after its first goal. Reiner and Barba teamed up again, with Reiner laying off midfielder Vikram Pothuri’s shot to Barba, who then put the ball away.
After two unanswered goals, it was time for Harvard to stage a comeback.
“Our reaction to going down was really great-- we came back and scored two more goals in that half so that was awesome,” senior defender Daniel Smith said.
Led by Brown and Dogan, the offense found multiple opportunities for shots, but none were able to get past Princeton’s Haberman. That is, until Freeman, the Crimson’s highest scorer, juked a Princeton defender at the top of the box and sent a low ball into the corner of the net.
The last goal of the half-- and the game -- came just before halftime, when junior defender Eric Gylling found a window and ripped a shot from 25 yards out, splitting the defense and past Princeton’s goalkeeper. With this goal, Harvard went up 3-2.
“We did a really good job of staying mentally focused and keeping doing what we were doing and we were able to fight back and get the 3-2 lead going into the half,” junior forward Tyler Savitsky said. “And then the second half was just a...performance. We were really compact and really hard to get through and we managed to hang on to [the lead]”.
For the rest of the half, and during the second half, Harvard fought hard to to shut Princeton out to hold on to its 3-2 lead. This is the first time the team has won against Princeton in three years.
“I think we’re really excited because this was another one where we were down early and fought back,” Smith said. “Everyone contributed from the younger guys on the team to the older guys. Everyone pitched in so it was a good team effort, and a good response from when we were in a bad situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wrapping up the autumn portion of its schedule, the Harvard women’s golf team traveled to the Mid-Atlantic to take part in the University of Delaware Lady Blue Hen Invitational. After three rounds of play, the Crimson secured a first-place finish, bookending the fall slate with a pair of championships.
The two-day event was held at the Rehoboth Beach Country Club in Rehoboth, Del. The 6,008-yard course played at a par 71 for the weekend. The course features four par three holes to go along with four par fives. Two rounds were held on Saturday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The final round took place early Sunday.
After rain cut short the last tournament Harvard played at Princeton, players were able to get in all 54 holes this weekend.
Harvard came out of the gate a bit slow, falling six strokes behind the hosts from Delaware and sitting in fourth place after round one. However, the Crimson was able to pick up the pace Saturday afternoon by firing a 299, the only round score below the 300 mark for any school at the invite.
Harvard would hold on to its position atop the leaderboard Sunday, shooting a +23 207 and cementing a 10-shot victory over runner-up Delaware.
“It was a very positive finish for us in what has been a challenging fall in terms of injuries,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “To have two tournament victories out of four makes me really proud of what the ladies were able to accomplish. Their talent really shined through with little margin for error in the lineup and plenty of adversity to overcome.”
The Crimson played particularly well on par five holes, shooting at +15, top among all participating schools. Harvard also led the pack in birdies and was second best on par four holes.
Other Ancient Eight squads present on the weekend were Penn and Dartmouth, who placed third and seventh, respectively. Seton Hall, Rutgers, Towson, Delaware State, and La Salle rounded out the 10 schools that entered into the invitational.
On the individual side of play, sophomore Anna Zhou was able to pick up her second championship trophy of the season. Her +10 223 bested Ashleigh Greenham of Rutgers by five shots. The Palo Alto, Calif. native’s round two total of 72, just one over par, was tied for the lowest of any player on the weekend with Ariane Klotz of Delaware and sophomore teammate Michelle Xie.
“This tournament and the end results we were able to come away with is really a nice confirmation that we have been sticking to working hard despite some unforeseen circumstances,” Zhou said. “We have all been focused on perfecting our individual games, and it’s nice to see that we seem to be moving in a positive direction as this half of the season wraps up.”
Xie finished as part of a tie for fourth place that also consisted of Seton Hall’s Cassie Pantelas and Harvard captain Anne Cheng. Xie’s 72 moved her 10 spots up the leaderboard on the final day of competition. Senior Nina Fairbairn finished as part of a three-woman tie for 26th out of the 60 entrants with Danielle Fuss of High Point and Towson’s Alexis Hios.
For the third consecutive tournament, freshman walk-on Ji Hae Lee participated on the scoring team for the Crimson. Freshman Chloe Belle Hooton has not been active for Harvard since the opening tournament of the campaign.
Harvard will have more than four months off from tournament play before next returning to the course over spring break in March.

“The break is extra helpful for us this year to come at this time,” Rhoads said. “We will be able to get rested, nurse some of these nagging injuries, and give the players more of a chance to focus on their academics and social aspects of life that they don’t have a ton of time for during the middle of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a successful showing at the Harvard Invitational last weekend, where the team swept all four of its games, the Harvard men’s water polo team (18-5, 3-2 CWPA) traveled to the west for the Rodeo Tournament in Southern California.
The tournament was a mixed bag for the Crimson. The team started the tournament with two close losses to No. 20 Loyola Marymount (8-13, 2-1 WWPA) and No. 9 UC Davis (18-4, 4-0), their first consecutive losses of the season. However, No. 10 Harvard responded strongly, posting two dominant wins against Fresno Pacific (8-15, 1-5) and No. 20 Santa Clara (13-16, 2-5).
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 14, HARVARD 13
In the first matchup of the Rodeo Tournament, the final result wasn’t decided until the final minute, where Loyola Marymount scored to secure a 14-13 victory. The loss snapped the Crimson’s four game win streak. Senior attacker Noah Harrison led the team with four goals, notching his 11th hat trick for the season; his three steals also led the team.
Senior defender Dan Stevens along with freshmen attackers Austin Sechrest and Charlie Owens scored two goals each for Harvard. Senior attacker Joey Colton provided an all around effort, collecting four assists, two swipes, and a field block.
“The first loss was the toughest loss for us for the weekend,” junior captain Harry Tafur said. “LMU is a good team. It was the first game of the tournament so we had to adjust to a different style of play [from the previous tournament]. We made some mistakes that they capitalized on; we had the opportunities to win but we didn’t put them away.”
UC DAVIS 7, HARVARD 6
The second game of the tournament was very similar to the first, as the Crimson fell by one in another tightly contested match. Both teams came out firing from the onset of the game, finding themselves tied 3-3 at the end of the first quarter. However, while UC Davis’ attack maintained its firepower, Harvard’s faltered, and the Crimson entered halftime trailing 6-4.
Harvard clamped down on defense in the third quarter, holding the Aggies scoreless and scoring a goal of their own to end the quarter trailing only 6-5. The Crimson scored again in the fourth quarter; however, UC Davis responded by scoring a goal of their own and eventually holding on for a 7-6 win.
Harrison and sophomore attacker Grayson Judge led Harvard with two goals each. Sophomore attacker Nick Bunn and Sechrest scored one goal apiece as well. Sophomore goalie Anthony Ridgley’s 10 saves led the Crimson’s defensive efforts.
“The UC Davis game is becoming a bit of a rivalry game because we play each other every year and the games are always close,” sophomore attacker Nathan Ondracek said. “I feel like it was a good experience for our team because we got to play 4 full quarters either up by one or down by one, which is amazing experience going forward for the rest of the season.”
HARVARD 18, FRESNO PACIFIC 8
“The coaches were proud we battled for four quarters in the first two games; we just missed a few things that could have brought it together for us” Ondracek said. “We needed to clean up a few mistakes. We need to play our game and play Harvard water polo.”
With those words from the coaches following their losses, Harvard responded in a big way, beating Fresno State 18-8 in a game that the Crimson controlled from the beginning. The 18 goals were a season high for the team. Six different players scored in the first quarter, helping Harvard get out to an early 6-1 lead. Harvard added seven more goals in the second quarter, going into the half with a 13-1 advantage.
While the Fresno Pacific attacked picked up in the second half, it never threatened the Crimson, who went on to win 18-8. The team was led in scoring by Ondracek’s three goals. Freshman goalie Nikhil Suri led the defense with seven saves.
HARVARD 12, SANTA CLARA 7
In the final game of the tournament, Harvard, led by 4 goals apiece from junior utility Colin Chiapello and sophomore attacker Nick Bunn, beat Santa Clara 12-7. The win was the Crimson’s seventh against a ranked opponent this season.
With early goals from Chiapello, Bunn, and Ondracek, Harvard raced out to an early 3-1 lead, eventually extending its lead to 8-2 as the teams headed into halftime. By riding the hot hands of Chiapello and Bunn, the Crimson continued its attack in the second half, going on to win the game 12-7.
“In the last two games, we were hungry to get a win,” Tafur said. “It had been a long time since we lost; I don’t think we had lost back to back games all season. People were motivated to get out of that losing streak and we played team ball and stepped up defensively. Both games we were up by significant margins at the half and we kept the intensity up for four quarters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Getting back to regular season action, both teams tried to find their strides in the first period at Thompson Arena in Hanover, NH. After the first 20 minutes went scoreless, a flurry of goals went in favor of Harvard as they went on to beat Dartmouth , 5-1.
The past two seasons, the Crimson (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) and the Big Green (0-2-0, 0-1-0) had split their season series and defended their home ice. But Harvard’s strong start Sunday afternoon broke with recent history, as a hat trick by Harvard captain Sydney Daniels and stellar net minding by senior goalie Brianna Laing did in Dartmouth.
“I thought it was a really good start to the season, especially playing away at Dartmouth,” junior forward Haley Mullins said. “We’ve had trouble playing at their rink, with their heavy fan base sometimes.”
The Crimson got off to a rocky start in the first period as it was outshot 10-4 and sent to the penalty box three times. Despite the lackluster start and errors, Harvard came out of the first period unscathed.
Just 3:50 into the second period on a power play, Mullins fed Daniels, who was standing to the side of the goal mount and knocked in the puck for the season’s first score.
A few minutes later, Dartmouth went on its own power play, where sophomore forward Tess Bracken converted her team’s only goal. This power play goal was the only blemish to an otherwise excellent shorthand effort for the Crimson, as they burned off five out of six woman advantages.
While the penalty kill was successful, the play that created these situations provide some cause for concern.
“I don’t think that our team wants to take penalties that are bad penalties,” sophomore forward Audrey Warner said. “I think the refs have really cracked down this year. We’re just playing tough hockey and going to take smart penalties.”
Harvard responded in stride, as junior forward Lexie Laing carried the puck from inside her own zone, slotting a backhand as she crossed in front of the net minder. The Crimson found success in its power play, capitalizing on two out of seven woman advantage situations.
The game would remain close going into the third period with Harvard leading 2-1, with both teams trying to convert opportunities at both ends of the rink. The Big Green generated several changes as they sought a goal to tie the game up. Its prime opportunity came 6:49 into the final period after an interference penalty led to a Dartmouth power play.
A strong penalty kill pulled the Crimson through that critical juncture and it went its way from there. Another slick backhand, this time from freshman forward Val Turgeon, went five-hole on Dartmouth’s senior goalie Robyn Chemago to put Harvard in a commanding position that it would never relinquish. This was a day to remember for Turgeon, who got her first collegiate goal in her first career start.
“Our freshmen are great,” Audrey Warner said. “I think that they’ll definitely be a big part of our team this year.”
Daniels topped off the afternoon contest with two late goals, with the last wrist shot goal from the point marking the second hat trick of her career. Daniels came into the season as the Crimson’s top offensive threat and shows no sign of slowing down in her senior year.
“She a really high-energy player so when she scores it gets the whole team pumped up,” Mullins said. “She opens the door for more scoring.”
This rivalry game is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the entire season, which goes at least until late February. But this strong start gives hints of a high-powered offense with young talent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Technically, Harvard football won last Saturday’s contest against Princeton.
More accurately, however, the Crimson survived.
Bedeviled by injuries, facing cold and slippery conditions, Harvard took a 14-0 lead in the second quarter only to let the Tigers stage a second-half comeback and tie the score at 17-all. Overtime followed.
Momentum, home-field advantage, and a crowd of nearly 10,000 boosted Princeton. But junior linebacker Luke Hutton and senior quarterback Joe Viviano boosted the Crimson, making a key third-down tackle and scrambling for a key third-down gain, respectively.
The victory was neither dominant nor pretty. But as much as any win in 2016, this one was gritty.
Four weeks remain. Penn and Harvard are tied for first. And still, the Crimson plays for the Ancient Eight crown.
SMALL GIANT
At 5’7”, sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott is the shortest player on Harvard’s roster by nearly two inches. Against Princeton, however, he played like the largest.
A string of injuries had kept Scott out of the first five games of the season. Even as a freshman, though, the wideout had routinely won end-of-practice sprints against the rest of the offense.
Little surprise, then, that coaches rehearsed a number of plays for Scott in the week before the Tigers matchup. It was high time to release the Crimson’s secret weapon—a 5’7” speedster that no one had previously scouted.
So much for that secrecy. Scott totaled 108 yards on 11 touches, including eight grabs. His first catch came on Harvard’s first down. Running a short route by the left hash marks, he juked a defender out of his socks and zoomed 34 yards to the Princeton 17-yard line.
Five minutes into the second quarter, he gave the Crimson a 14-0 lead when he caught a ball and tiptoed down the sideline for a 24-yard score.
“That kid, he had a tough road getting here,” Viviano said. “A lot of injuries. I knew that as soon as he got his opportunity to play healthy on the field, he was going to light it up.”
Scott’s breakout fit into a larger narrative about Harvard injuries. A wave of starters has missed game action. In last weekend’s loss to Holy Cross, the Crimson was sitting not only Viviano but also starting junior running back Semar Smith and sophomore leading receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley.
All three returned against the Tigers, but only Viviano played a complete game. Smith saw a lightened workload with seven carries, allowing freshman rusher Lavance Northington to rack up 40 yards on 13 tries.
And while Shelton-Mosley grabbed six balls for 82 yards—which, for anyone else, would signal full health—he didn’t play at full speed. For the second week in a row, the sophomore conceded return duties to fellow wideout Alex LaPolice.
TWO SCORES, NO MORE
At the end of the first half, the Crimson led 14-0—not bad for an away contest against one-loss opponent. Even so, a distinct air of frustration pervaded the Harvard sideline.
Four times in the first half, the Crimson offense started with the ball on its own 45 yard-line or better. One of these attempts ended in a touchdown; the other three ended in a punt, on downs, and with an interception.
Especially damning was a Harvard possession with 8:57 left in the second quarter. Less than a minute ago, Scott’s score had created a two-touchdown lead. A subsequent three-and-out gave the visitors the ball on the Tigers 43 and a chance to put the game out of reach.
Instead, on the second play from scrimmage, Viviano tossed an interception. He rolled right, spotted Shelton-Mosley near the right pylon, but misdirected the ball to the trailing Princeton defensive back.
“We got a little bit greedy at times,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Joe’s an extraordinarily aggressive guy, and he’s a great football player. He’s never seen a big play that he didn’t like…. It was just a great play by their kid.”
Many of the Crimson’s early opportunities came courtesy of the Tigers’ overexcitement. Noticeably amped up during warm-ups, Princeton looked jittery in the early going, losing a fumble and an interception in the first quarter.
Eventually those nerves calmed, allowing the Tigers to come back in the matchup. But after going down 14-0, Princeton never led.
