After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You’re from California? What high school did you go to?”
“I, uh,” I take a deep breath, “went to an online high school.”
“Online school?” A long pause. Then, the questions always come in a downpour. “Wait, that’s a thing? How does that work?” Finally, a faint whisper — “Did you have friends?”
For two years, I attended Stanford Online High School as a full-time student. To attend class, I walked from my bed to my desk in four steps. To ask questions, I pressed a button with the icon of a raised hand. The first time I met many of my classmates in-person was at graduation, after two years of sharing classes with them. Once I graduated, my adventures with full-time online schooling had ended.
Or so I thought.
On March 6, in the face of the growing COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Washington announced its decision to move all classes to virtual instruction. Other major institutions, including Stanford, Rice, and Princeton, swiftly followed. Days later, the axe came down at Harvard.
Virtual classes, time zone problems, breakout rooms — it felt like my online high school all over again. For everyone else, however, this was a new experience. I watched my classmates react to this change with dismay and despair. Students experiencing this transition around the nation bonded over the absurdity of virtual learning, with more than 150,000 members joining the Facebook group “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens” within a week. Many commented that online classes weren’t real classes — the semester might as well be over.
These reactions made me feel disheartened — in fact, my experience had taught me the opposite. From intense virtual seminar discussions to frog dissections performed in the bathroom, learning remained ferocious and fast-paced. Sure, there was a format difference, but my high school managed to instill and maintain rigorous academics, and I have no doubt Harvard will do the same.
Of course, there are issues with virtual learning. One thing I didn’t miss about online school was the regular video lag and audio disconnect: “Excuse me, your mic isn’t working”; “Your audio cut out halfway, could you repeat your answer?”; “Wait, your camera’s frozen — again.” And the technology issues will only multiply as the world continues to push the limits of bandwidth and Internet traffic.
The frustration of malfunctioning technology only touches the surface of what we lose. Replacing in-person schooling with virtual instruction also comes with a loss of expression — silent body language that always happened so naturally, like making eye contact across a room or fidgeting when we’re uncomfortable, is no longer natural.
Furthermore, there’s the root of everyone’s whispered question (Did you have friends?): the loss of social interaction. It’s a disorienting change from Harvard, where micro-level interactions govern our community: a quick “Hey what’s up!” when you run into a classmate in the Yard, a hasty wave across a crowded library, an eager dap when you spot a friend in the dhall. At home, the isolation can become stifling. You can’t hug your friends, or high five your classmates — it’s mostly just you. With nearly a quarter of the United States population now ordered to shelter-in-place, thousands of students are suddenly facing this isolation.
To overcome isolation, my high school classmates and I held study calls that spanned many hours and continents, dropping in and out as we wished. We held grade-wide movie nights, exchanged eRoses on Valentine’s Day, and celebrated birthdays. Over this spring break, I enjoyed meals with my Harvard friends over Zoom (bonus points if you have different individuals eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the same call!).
For our generation, a steep learning curve falls not on how to operate technology, but on how to use technology to maintain and deepen our relationships with others. Online schooling inspires students to develop creative and meaningful efforts to stay connected. As we undergo such chaotic times together, a virtual ecosystem gives us the chance to strengthen the bonds we’ve already forged in physical presence.
At the same time, we should use this experiment to identify gaps and opportunities to help students of the future. There are many issues to consider — unequal access to technology (e.g. computers, printers), disparate learning environments at home (e.g. Internet bandwidth, having a quiet room), lack of mental health resources, and other pressing inequities. As a community, we should brainstorm and develop solutions to address them. We shouldn’t merely view this virtual disruption as a setback, but also as an opportunity for Harvard to be an intellectual leader —framing national conversations on and initiatives for improving online learning infrastructure, access, and interaction.
I had two years of online schooling in high school which I am thankful for, so this crisis is an unexpected return to something I'm familiar with. For others at Harvard, this is something entirely new. Over these next few months, we must support each other, whether it’s through pixelated smiles or heartfelt text exchanges. And I hope, when we reunite on campus in the fall, we will be all the more eager to hug our friends, high five our classmates, and cherish every moment we spend together in person.

As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, so too will anti-Chinese sentiment.
President Donald Trump’s description of a “China virus” was immediately subject to criticism, both from the left and the right, but I think the critics are missing the point. Aggressively placing the blame for a crisis on another group whose imminent rise has been a major concern isn’t problematic because it is baseless, but because it is natural.
The narrative, however false, has practically written itself: A Chinese person ate something they shouldn’t have, and now thousands of us have a deadly disease. On top of that, they have the audacity to blame us for the virus! Boo them, go us!
What is important is that statements like these erode the great bulwark of American democracy, classical liberalism’s value of tolerance. It is in times like these — when democracy’s greatest defense is most vulnerable — that its maintenance is most necessary.
The foundational idea of liberalism is that the individual, not the family or society, is the main moral and political decision-maker. But this is not the way our brains are wired to think.
Humans are very good at parsing out “us” and “them”, disliking one another for no good reason; our instinct is to treat the individual solely as the embodiment of a group. We create “others” as naturally as we breathe.
I am not, after all, discussing the individual guilt, or lack thereof, of the first person who contracted the coronavirus, precisely because we tend not to focus on individuals. It is the “China” virus that plagues America, and the 5 million Chinese and Chinese Americans living in the United States who will become “other.”
Because of its emphasis on the individual, however, liberal democracy claims that group affiliation is only one facet of the individual’s existence. I am a Chinese American, a Hong Kong resident, and a Leverett House member. My affiliation with any of those groups does not make me responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. It doesn’t matter whether my affiliation is voluntary or not, or even if it is clear that some members of these larger groups have done wrong, because in American liberal democracy we decide moral blame and guilt on an individual basis.
This idea of individual culpability is not only codified in our own laws but is the hallmark of international relations. Article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention declares collective punishment, punishing a group for individual transgressions, to be a war crime.
I’m not trying to equate President Trump, or anyone who has or will blame everything Chinese for the coronavirus, with war criminals. My point, if anything, is to remind us that angry, frustrated, ordinary people can easily act in a regrettable manner against a group of people they perceive as “other”. Trump is not an anomaly; a successful liberal democracy is.
Liberal democracy doesn’t try to suppress our human instincts and reactions, but builds “hedges” to guide them. A successful liberal democracy isn’t about unseeing the other, but institutionalizing ways for tolerating differences.
However, these institutions of tolerance within liberal democracy in turn depend on a basic commitment from its citizens. The promises of liberal democracy cannot be upheld by illiberal individuals.
The danger to liberal government is greatest during times of crisis, conflicts, and mass fear because that is when we tend to default to our illiberal attitudes. When times are good, it is easy to tolerate the tolerable, or even condemn our past transgressions against groups. The question is how we will act when the chips are down.
During these times of crisis we need to cherish tolerance because our natural tendency for intolerance will only make things worse. John Locke, one of the greatest intellectual fathers of classical liberalism, wrote his “A Letter Concerning Toleration” at a time when bloody religious warfare was the norm, and being religiously other was a death sentence. His novel claim was that the best way for a religious sect to both spread its message and deal with the imminent threat of violence was not to take control of the government and prosecute a hostile group first, but to actively adhere to, and even preach, a doctrine of tolerance.
Today when we learn about Locke, liberal democracy, and tolerance, we think about (or debate) its potential: the vast amount of progress, or lack thereof, that we associate with a government dedicated to protecting “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. We should remember that tolerance is not just about our prosperity, but also about preventing us from destroying each other. Tolerance itself won't stop the virus, but it is the bare minimum of any successful solution.
America is such an advanced, liberal democracy that we are tolerant even of the hatefully intolerant. Indeed, you have every right, political or natural, to give in to anger, fear, and frustration; spew hate; or propagate any amount of us-versus-them rhetoric you like. But know this: It is you who are destroying what makes America great, not a China virus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In theory, when Harvard and other colleges closed their dormitories, going home — or petitioning to stay on campus — was a choice. As many demonstrated, you could just as easily board a flight to Miami, the Bahamas, or Cancun and live it up shoulder to shoulder — forget six feet — with college students from all fifty states. As one now infamous, then shirtless Miami bacchant put it, “If I get corona, I get corona.”
The impulse to party like there’s no tomorrow makes sense; this crisis — in light of climbing death tolls and a tumbling stock market — makes it easy to feel utterly unhinged. Yet it has now become abundantly clear that packed beaches have had dire consequences. In the wake of spring break — to take the most obvious example — Florida’s coronavirus cases surged, only adding to the terrifying acceleration in the virus’ spread. The United States now has more reported coronavirus cases than any other country; over three million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits; and hospitals, faced with staggering equipment shortages, have found themselves rationing care.
The only responsible way for us as young people to conduct ourselves during this crisis is to strongly limit our social interactions: to avoid going to restaurants, large gatherings, and to connect with friends and loved ones online rather than in person.
To begin with, we owe this to ourselves. While young people may feel invincible, we are still very much at risk. Recent data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention show that nearly 20 percent of those hospitalized for COVID-19 have been 20 to 44 years old. This week an infant died after testing positive for COVID-19. These tragedies should encourage us to commit fully to social distancing.
But we also owe this much to the populations most actively endangered: the elderly, those with preexisting conditions, and those with weakened immune systems. In particular, this is an opportunity to demonstrate the necessity of intergenerational solidarity. Just as coronavirus disproportionately leads to fatality in older age groups, there are issues such as climate change that will ultimately have a larger impact on younger generations. And just as we challenge older adults to take action to mitigate the risks of global warming, we must act to protect older generations from the threat of this virus.
Young people can be leaders in their communities. Those of us who’ve headed home return to communities with varying degrees of acceptance of this crisis. Though more than half of Americans are now under state or local stay-at-home orders, horror stories of people hosting coronavirus-themed parties and church services attended by over 1,200 people persist. Through practicing social distancing, we have the chance to lead by example in the communities we care about most.
We sympathize with students who want to maintain a degree of normalcy and freedom in their lives. These are weird and trying times. However, in light of an ethical imperative to modify our way of life, we’re tasked with finding other ways to stay sane and exercise freedom. Going on walks, experimenting with new recipes, and picking up an instrument are all still fair game. So is public service. We encourage students in search of something to do to consider assisting in or even starting a mutual-aid network and other relief efforts in your area. Such efforts may include donating to food banks and homeless shelters, assisting elderly and immunosuppressed neighbors in stocking up on necessities, and fostering vital lines of communication.
Coronavirus has forced us all to make choices that are far from ideal. Our individual, in-the-moment responses to this rapidly evolving crisis may not have been perfect. But we can all now take personal responsibility for mitigating our contribution to coronavirus’s spread. The moment demands this of us, and to do anything less would prove catastrophic. We can’t change the past, and the future, too, is uncharted and unwieldy. But we can each stay home and do our share today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new study conducted by Harvard School of Public Health researchers modeled how staggered intervals of social distancing could save more lives than the one-time social distancing guidelines issued by the United States government in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Federal authorities recently extended the advisory, which was issued March 16, until April 30.
A preprint manuscript of the study was published on medRxiv, a non-peer-reviewed source, on March 24. The research team — led by professor of immunology Yonatan H. Grad and professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch — demonstrated that if China were to lift its strict social distancing, the country could face epidemic peaks later this year with healthcare impacts similar to that of an uncontrolled epidemic.
The primary reason for that projection, the researchers argued, is that strict social distancing will not create the population-level immunity needed to fend off a virus that could resurface and continue spreading throughout a vulnerable populace.
Instead, the team proposed “intermittent” social distancing, in which authorities enforce distancing when cases rise above a set threshold and then lift measures when cases fall below a set threshold.
Using computational models, the researchers found that intermittently social distancing 25 to 70 percent of the time would build immunity in the population and prevent healthcare system overload.
That said, they wrote that some unknowns remain. Coronavirus could have seasonal peaks, like the common cold and the flu, which could affect the number of periods of intermittent social distancing.
The manuscript comes on the heels of other Harvard public health scientists’ research on controlling the virus. Earlier this month, biostatistics professor Xihong Lin co-authored a study analyzing the effectiveness of social distancing, quarantines, and other intervention methods in the outbreak’s first epicenter, Wuhan, China.
Projecting into the future, Lipsitch and Grad’s team considered different scenarios of how long the pandemic might stretch. They predict that under an intermittent social distancing program with no other interventions, the outbreak could last until 2022.
Without social distancing of any kind, the team argued the pandemic could be over as early as this fall — but with the high cost of far exceeding the healthcare system’s capabilities and considerable fatalities.
If the U.S. were to double its critical care capacity and an intermittent social distancing program were in place, social distancing could end by mid-2021, the team found.
Regardless of how the outbreak plays out, the researchers predict that the virus will continue to circulate seasonally, peaking in the winter, even after the outbreak has ended.
Clarification: April 3, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the School of Public Health study found that intermittent social distancing could save more lives than the one-time social distancing. To clarify, the research modeled how intermittent social distancing might do so.

Courts in Cambridge and Middlesex County have shifted their operations in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, hearing emergency matters virtually and postponing all other meetings to slow the spread of the virus.
Judges presiding over Cambridge District Court will hear “emergency” matters over video or telephone conference, according to a Massachusetts district court standing order that went into effect on March 18. Cambridge District Homeless Court, which usually holds its sessions in Harvard Square, will also move to virtual hearings.
The district court will hear emergency matters remotely, including abuse and harassment orders, arraignments of new arrests, search warrants, and mental health evaluations. The order also states that all cases with scheduled court dates will be postponed until at least May 4.
As a result of the standing order, all proceedings ongoing at the time of the outbreak have been deemed mistrials.
Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan said in an interview that the order disrupted a murder case her office had pursued just a day before the jury handed down its verdict.
“We had a murder case that we were very close to the end of. So obviously, for everybody on both sides of that case, it's been a long way to get there,” Ryan said. “And then we were within about a day or day-and-a-half of being finished. And we weren't able to finish.”
Still, Ryan said she believes the courts will continue their mission to keep order during what she described as an “unusual time.”
“Courts are open and they're functioning — they're just functioning in a different way than they usually do,” she said.
To slow the outbreak, Ryan also said her office has collaborated with the Middlesex Sheriff's Office to release inmates at the Middlesex Jail and House of Correction located in Billerica, Mass. As of Thursday, she said they had released roughly 60 prisoners, prioritizing the release of inmates with pre-existing medical conditions and non-violent offenders.
Cambridge District Homeless Court is also continuing its work using alternative means.
The court, which is designed to rehabilitate people experiencing homelessness, normally holds its sessions on the first Monday of every month in First Parish Church in Harvard Square. The court will postpone its next session to April 22, when it will hear roughly 30 cases by video or telephone conference, according to Harvard Law School student Libby S. Bova. Defendants will not be required to attend the virtual session, she added.
Bova, who assists the court’s defense attornies on cases, said she has been communicating with clients about both the status of their cases and their general wellbeing.
“I have personally been telling them to focus on their health and safety, stay inside, recognize they’re among the most vulnerable group to this. Especially because many of them have underlying health conditions,” she said.
Defense attorney Michael C. Hicks, who represents defendants before the court, also said he has told clients to focus on their health.
“I tell them don’t worry about the case — let me worry about the case,” he said. “I want to make sure they understand that they need to be extra careful.”
“We’re trying to do the best we can to help them,” he added.

Harvard's Title IX Office has fully shifted to remote communication and continued operations as usual in the wake of the University’s instruction for students and administrators to leave campus for the remainder of the semester.
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said in an interview Monday that her office has continued to receive and respond to disclosures submitted through its Anonymous Disclosure tool — a system which has functioned as an online resource for students since its debut in October 2019.
“We get a ping as soon as a disclosure goes into the system. And so we’re managing those in the exact same way that we would be if we were in the office — there’s no change whatsoever,” Merhill said.
According to Merhill, any delays in the time it takes coordinators to respond to student disclosures are due to information gathering rather than challenges posed by online communication.
“We’re adhering to our goal of responding to those within 24 hours — any delays to that would be really solely related to ensuring that we’re providing consistent information and responses,” Merhill said. “But that’s not impacted in any way, shape, or form by the situation that we’re in of being at home.”
With regard to non-anonymous disclosures from students, Title IX officers have also continued to receive those via email or by phone. Formal complaints will continue to be addressed as usual by the Office of Dispute Resolution.
“I think one of the benefits for both the Title IX Office and the Office of Dispute Resolution is that we both have, in advance of this, extensive experience working remotely,” Merhill said. “These tools were not and are not new to us.”
The Title IX Office will also continue its work developing online training modules, holding discussions with student liaison groups, and delivering “in-person” training for athletic coaches in real-time on Zoom.
However, not all of the office's plans have continued wholly uninterrupted. The Title IX Office, along with some Harvard faculty, planned to pilot a new bystander intervention program this spring, but will delay the project due to restrictions on conducting human subject research from afar.
But while the outbreak might pose an obstacle to the bystander training project, Merhill said the transition to remote communication also presents an opportunity to develop other aspects of programming from the Title IX office.
“I said to the team, let’s take advantage of this as an opportunity,” Merhill said. “We have to ourselves engage virtually. Let’s take the lessons learned of what’s working for us, what’s not working for us, and think about that as we’re designing online initiatives for our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee reviewing Harvard’s police department has scaled down its efforts to solicit feedback from Harvard affiliates as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, though the department’s leadership said it remains committed to an internal review launched in February.
Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley launched the review into his department following an investigation by The Crimson that found instances of racism and sexism within Riley’s department. In interviews and court documents, 21 current and former HUPD employees accused the department’s leadership of showing favoritism and retaliating against those who spoke out against an allegedly hostile work environment created by Riley.
In February, Riley appointed two national law enforcement experts to lead the assessment and selected five HUPD employees and a Harvard Human Resources representative to review the department’s policies and meet with Harvard affiliates. Riley wrote in an email to the department that the working group would periodically report to him and University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp and would share its findings with the department by the end of the academic year.
Working group member and HUPD deputy chief Denis Downing wrote in an email to department employees on Friday that the working group “has slowed down on the outreach efforts” due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
“We have, understandably so, had to cancel outreach events like Dean’s meetings, student group meetings, and other in person efforts,” he wrote.
Downing first shared various opportunities for members of the department to speak with the working group in another email to HUPD employees dated March 9. The following day, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Harvard would transition to remote learning and also asked students to vacate their dorms by March 15.
Though current social distancing guidelines prevent the working group from holding in-person meetings, Downing wrote in his most recent email that committee members remain interested in hearing from department employees remotely.
“Do not hesitate to reach out to any of the working group members if you’d like to have a conversation, and we will figure the best channel to do so, given the circumstances,” Downing wrote.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that the working group will continue to work in accordance with public health guidance.
“The purpose and goals of the review remain a priority for the Department, and the leadership team is committed to continuing the progress of the working group,” he wrote.
Catalano declined to comment on whether the information-gathering phase of the review is still on schedule to conclude by the end of the academic year.
The review faced some challenges, even prior to the delays. In March, the executive board members of the Harvard police union raised concerns with it, citing the review’s ties to the department and Riley. They called for an independent, external party to conduct the review.
While he did not directly reference the union’s concerns, Downing wrote that employees who wish to provide feedback anonymously can do so via a University-wide hotline, which is run by Navex Global, an independent, third party company.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With residents scattered throughout the world, Harvard’s undergraduate Houses are relying on virtual study breaks, movie screenings, and traditions in an attempt to recreate House life for their students.
With campus devoid of students, House leadership now largely relies upon Zoom — a video conference platform — to facilitate House-related programming.
Lowell House Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88 wrote in an email that Lowell will continue to hold regular activities, including entryway meetings, a weekly baking group, a watch party for the musical Sweeney Todd — which was supposed to be performed by the Lowell House Opera this month — and virtual bell ringing sessions hosted by the Lowell Society of Russian Bell Ringers. He also wrote the House is preparing for a virtual Housing Day, when freshmen will receive their assigned dorms.
“We are brainstorming for Housing Day, though we don't yet know the details about how this will be organized, so we are in the “green field” stage,” he wrote.
The shift in House life follows the March 10 announcement from University President Lawrence S. Bacow that mandated students to vacate their on-campus housing due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
Kelly A. Miller, a resident tutor in Lowell House, wrote in an email that she misses the “personal interactions” with Lowell students, but believes they are doing “an amazing job coming up with fun and creative ways” of staying connected.
Miller also wrote that one of her favorite virtual House activities is the House-wide Slack channel, where Lowell residents can post pictures of their pastries, their pets, and springtime views in their respective hometowns.
Kirkland House Committee co-chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 said Kirkland is also planning how to welcome new members in lieu of an in-person Housing Day . One option, she said, is a “Zoom storm,” where House members will connect with freshman blocking groups via Zoom to give their assignments.
“That's under construction, but basically it's surprising them in some way,” she said. “A lot of the fun in dorm storming is the anticipation involved, because emails are a little bit anticlimactic. Also, because then the rest of the house can get involved.”
Many Houses have chosen to set up “virtual dining halls” with a Zoom link open at all hours of the day for residents to connect.
Anh Tran, a resident tutor in Mather House, said tutors are “helping each other come up with various creative ways to execute certain programming virtually.”
According to Tran, Mather anticipates shifting all regular programming — study breaks, coffee hours, a talent show, senior thesis presentations, and more — to digital platforms.
Mather tutor Annie V. Dang ’16 said virtual programming is important to maintain bonds between House residents.
“The people are what makes Mather House a home, not the physical structure,” she said. “So as long as we stay connected, we will still have that sense of home and community.”
In Dunster House, some tutors are spearheading an initiative dubbed the “Story-Telling Project,” where residents can participate in House-wide brainstorming and writing sessions with professional writers. Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14 — one of the Dunster tutors heading up the project — said she hopes the project will encourage student participation during an “unprecedented” semester.
“Trying to find ways to bring together different people and interests and maintaining that connectivity, especially in a time when we're championing social isolation, I think it's really important to still find avenues to bring people together,” she said.
MaryGabrielle “MG” Prezioso ’13, another Dunster tutor leading the project, said that it, along with other House efforts, will be necessary to preserve the “communally focused” House experience, despite the fact residents now live off campus.
“I think that keeping as much normalcy as we can, in that respect, to give students some semblance of that Harvard experience is really important,” she said. "It is a really uncertain time and anything we can do to show support and love across Zoom is really important and really lovely.”

Harvard Forward — an alumni organization advocating for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry — endorsed six candidates vying to become Harvard Alumni Association Elected Directors.
With new members elected annually in spring, HAA’s board of directors is an advisory board that seeks to develop alumni volunteer leadership and deepen engagement with alumni worldwide. HAA is also responsible for nominating candidates for Harvard’s annual election for the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing board.
This spring, nine candidates are running for six available director slots. The HAA elected director candidates endorsed by Harvard Forward include Santiago Creuheras, Kelsey T. Leonard ’10, Michael D. Lewis ’93, Benjamin D. Wei ’08, Joyce Y. Zhang ’09, and Vanessa M. Zoltan. All of the candidates support “Harvard Forward’s platform of climate action, socially responsible investment, and inclusive governance,” according to a Harvard Forward press release.
The Coalition for a Diverse Harvard — an alumni group centered on increasing diversity at the University — also recently endorsed Leonard, Creuheras, Lewis, Zhang, and Zoltan.
Harvard Forward has also been running a campaign to elect a slate of five candidates to Harvard’s Board of Overseers. Earlier this spring, the group gathered signatures from roughly 4,500 alumni and successfully petitioned for its candidates to be put on the ballot.
According to the press release, Harvard Forward’s Board of Overseer candidates and the endorsed HAA elected director candidates together hold Harvard degrees from six of the University’s 12 degree-granting schools.
John E. Beatty ’11, one of Harvard Forward’s Board of Overseer candidates, wrote in the press release that, because elections for HAA Elected Directors and the Board of Overseers occur simultaneously, the group feels it “makes sense to collaborate” across the different elections.
“At the end of the day, our goal is to create a mandate to take action on these issues, and the best way to do so is by electing alumni who vocally support our platform to Harvard’s two highest elected boards,” Beatty wrote.
Harvard Forward Candidate Margaret “Midge” M. Purce ’17 wrote in the press release that the candidates are “fully committed” to the campaign’s mission.
“These candidates are fully committed to Harvard Forward’s mission, and we’re delighted to have them on our side,” Purce wrote. “The fact that a majority of HAA-nominated candidates agree with every point on our platform truly speaks to the broad support among the alumni community for more inclusive governance and bolder climate action.”
This year’s elections are scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19. All Harvard alumni can vote either online or by traditional paper ballot — except those in University instruction and governance positions as well as members of the Harvard Corporation, who are ineligible to vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of Harvard scientists — led by Harvard Medical School associate professor Sandeep R. Datta — found that certain cells in the nose express genes that facilitate COVID-19 infection.
The study’s preliminary findings — published March 28 on bioRxiv, an archive of life sciences preprint manuscripts that have not been peer-reviewed — may explain why some coronavirus patients reporting a less acute sense of smell.
Datta said his research was motivated by growing anecdotal evidence of patients losing their ability to smell upon developing COVID-19 in the press and in formal medical reports.
“There seems to be a strong association between the development of disturbances in smell and getting COVID-19,” Datta said. “It seems like this may be one of the hallmarks of the disease.”
Datta said he and his collaborators collected publicly available genetics datasets to better understand how COVID-19 potentially infects cells in the olfactory system and disrupts its function.
The researchers focused on genes expressed by cell types comprising the olfactory epithelium, which Datta described as “the part of your nose that is responsible for detecting the smells and sending the information to your brain.”
There are two proteins known to be receptors for the coronavirus, according to Datta. Cells expressing both molecules may be “uniquely susceptible” to COVID-19 infection.
Datta said the group expected to find that neurons responsible for detecting odors would be most susceptible to infection. Instead, they “got a surprise” and discovered it was actually the cells supporting the sensory neurons that expressed the vulnerable genes.
“That’s interesting because it might provide some potential mechanisms for how the coronavirus might actually cause a change in your sense of smell,” Datta said. “I think, at least at first pass, those mechanisms are not the ones we would have naively expected.”
Major medical societies have publicly stated that loss of smell can serve as a powerful diagnostic of COVID-19 infection.
The American Academy of Otolaryngology — the study of the ears, nose, and throat — proposed that anosmia and dysgeusia, or the sudden and unexplained total or partial loss of smell and taste, “be added to the list of screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection,” according to a statement published on the group’s website on March 22.
In the absence of other pre-existing respiratory illnesses, disturbances of smell and taste “should alert physicians to the possibility of COVID-19 infection and warrant serious consideration for self-isolation and testing of these individuals,” the group wrote.
Though Datta said extensive clinical validation is required to confirm the findings, existing medical records indicate that loss of smell seems to happen “very rapidly.”
“It’s a little bit like a switch being flipped, where one day you smell and the next day, you don't,” Datta said.
He added that while physicians and researchers have found evidence that loss of smell may precede development of COVID-19 symptoms, patients with pre-existing loss of smell due to genetic conditions or trauma should not worry.
“There are certainly genetic conditions that can cause you to lose your sense of smell or to be more without a sense of smell,” Datta said. “None of those puts you at increased risk of getting coronavirus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School will switch to a default satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading policy, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced in an email to the school’s students, faculty, staff, and fellows last week.
The Kennedy School will give satisfactory grades to students who earn a D or higher in elective courses and a B- or higher in required and core classes. Students have until April 24, during the penultimate week before classes end, to opt out of the satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system and receive letter grades instead.
Other Harvard schools have also recently altered their grading policies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has displaced most students from campus and forced the University to transition to online classes. Earlier this month, Harvard Law School announced it would shift to universal credit-fail grading, while last week, Harvard College switched to a mandatory “emergency” satisfactory-unsatisfactory system.
The school made the decision in part out of concern that remote learning would be “challenging for many students,” Elmendorf wrote in the email. But he also acknowledged that preserving the option to receive letter grades would be beneficial for students who need those grades to “satisfy various commitments” such as fellowships or military service — or who simply prefer a “more traditional evaluation of their work.”
Kennedy School student Diego A. Garcia Blum wrote in an email that some students still harbor concerns about equity in the face of online classes under the new grading system.
“Students could feel pressure to stay in the graded system despite having hard situations at home. This could take a toll on their responsibilities to their loved ones and their mental health,” he wrote. “Students applying to PhD and civil service jobs who are facing difficulties could be at a disadvantage by showing SAT/UNSAT grades compared to another student in a more comfortable situation who chooses to report grades.”
Garcia Blum added that he feels the issue is a “complicated” one, though he believes the school is “employing a smart behavioral strategy” to address concerns about students feeling pressured to continue receiving letter grades by making the system opt-out rather than opt-in.
Kennedy School student body president Charlene A. Wang said a universal pass-fail system has particularly tricky implications for international students, which led her to support the opt-out system.
“I think about like 40 percent of our student body is international students, so I think there was just a further concern that, you know, it might be the norm in the United States for a bunch of universities to go pass-fail, but it's unclear if that's the case abroad,” she said.
Wang added she has heard some students express “relief” about the new system of grading.
“My sense right now, given the relief that I've heard, is that most students will go ahead and take the default option,” she said. “I think there are still people who care a lot about their grades, so I could imagine some students opting to take the grades.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale appointed a COVID-19 Expert Advisory Panel that includes four Harvard experts, according to a city announcement Monday.
In a press release, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and DePasquale wrote that the panel first met on March 24 and will continue to meet remotely as needed.
The panel — composed of eight medical and subject matter experts from Harvard, MIT and the Cambridge Health Alliance — will advise the city’s planning and response efforts to the coronavirus pandemic. Assaad J. Sayah, CEO of the Cambridge Health Alliance and Cambridge Commissioner of Public Health, will chair the group.
The Harvard-affiliated panel members come from a wide array of medical and public health specialties.
Kirby Erlandson, a Cabot House resident tutor and fourth-year joint Harvard M.D.-MBA graduate student, has a background in outbreak response. Erlandson spent two years in Liberia designing public health responses to the then-ongoing Ebola epidemic.
Harvard School of Public Health professor Paul D. Biddinger is the director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and an emergency preparedness expert.
Epidemiology professor and Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics faculty member William P. Hanage has conducted research into pathogen evolution and how it fits into understanding disease epidemiology.
Karen Byers manages the biosafety program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, an affiliate teaching institute of Harvard Medical School.
The announcement of the panel comes off the heels of Cambridge’s first confirmed death due to COVID-19 complications. As of Monday, there are 78 confirmed cases in the city.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council greenlit a measure on Monday that encourages city landlords to give breaks to their tenants as residents bear the financial burden of the global coronavirus crisis.
The measure, which was adopted unanimously, does not mandate any action, but rather “requests” that city landlords forego rent increases for 60 days and that they not evict any tenants with a “demonstrated, substantial loss of income” due to the coronavirus.
“There has been a tremendous amount of job loss and diminishment of regular income due to the COVID-19 public health emergency,” Cambridge Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, a co-sponsor of the measure, said. “This is just to elevate and ask that Cambridge landlords really think about their tenants and see if there’s any way to mitigate rent increases at this time.”
The measure asks that landlords allow a 120-day grace period on rent payments for residents who demonstrate a substantial hit to their income.
The Council passed an additional resolution that calls on the state and the federal government to enact a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures until the end of the coronavirus pandemic.
Just two members of the City Council — Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. — were physically present for Monday’s meeting, with the rest of the body participating virtually. The public comments portion of the meeting took place via Zoom, as no observers were allowed inside City Hall for the gathering.
The Council also unanimously passed a measure Monday that requests the city manager explore providing internet access to residents who lack it as libraries and other public facilities remain closed due to the virus.
Councilors also debated a pair of measures that would have asked the city manager to look into closing some roads in order to give residents space to exercise, but the measure was tabled after several councilors raised objections.
“To now send the message that we want thousands of people, potentially, on Memorial Drive poses a great risk to a lot of people — especially the seniors,” Toomey said. “This is not the right time to be looking at doing this.”
Prior to debating measures Monday, the Council heard a presentation on the city’s plan to use the War Memorial Recreation Center as a facility to house homeless people amid the outbreak. City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s announcement Monday afternoon that the city planned to use the facility to help house homeless residents comes as some local homeless shelters are struggling to stay open. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter was forced to close its doors last week.
The city announced Monday that it would support the Phillip Brooks House Association’s Y2Y youth homeless shelter with $52,890 so it can remain open through at least April 15. Mallon said she was pleased with the allocation and encouraged the city to look at funding the shelter into the summer.
“I’ve volunteered and spent time in all of our shelters, and I can say that the shelter guests at Y2Y is a very different population,” Mallon said. “They’re very young adults, from 18 to 24, and have very different needs. They might not feel comfortable in this fieldhouse type setting with 125 other people.”
Claude Jacob, the city’s Chief Public Health Officer said the Recreation Center is the “best option” to house homeless residents because it provides for space to house COVID-19-positive people separately from those who are not showing symptoms.
“One of the reasons that made the fieldhouse so attractive was the ability to social distance that large group of people because of the ample space that was provided,” Cambridge Police Chief Branville G. Bard Jr. told councilors.
Jacob said the city plans to have 22 beds for homeless people showing symptoms or awaiting test results in the “quarantine quarters” of the facility, as well as 25 to 50 beds in isolation units for residents who have tested positive. There will also be between 50 and 100 beds in the fieldhouse, which will serve as an overflow space for other shelters, according to Jacob.
“It does make me sad that it takes an emergency situation like this for us to think this hard about housing our homeless,” Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said. “I hope that as we get through this crisis, we can find more permanent solutions to that problem.”
Some Harvard students have called on the University to use its now empty dorms to house homeless residents.
DePasquale, the city manager, said that Harvard and MIT “could not have been more cooperative” in the process. In a press release Monday, he said that the city has secured commitments from both Harvard and MIT to use classrooms if Cambridge public schools — which use the War Memorial Recreation Center — reopen later this spring.

In a time when social distancing is of utmost importance, we know it’s difficult to keep in touch with friends, especially in creative ways other than hosting Zoom meet-ups. Flyby is here, coming to the rescue, with an all inclusive list of the best ways to stay in touch with your blockmates, friends, the person you really wished you could have become friends with from section, and that kid from down the hall who you randomly make eye contact with on your way to the hall shower.
Blockmate Book Club
Even though Housing Day didn’t happen (yet?), this is a great opportunity for some inter-blocking group bonding. Create a list of books that you wish you had time to read, generate a lottery on some random generator website, and there it is: the first book you will be reading as a Blockmate Book Club. We also recommend hosting a Netflix watch party if the book you read is available on Netflix, but if not, go ahead and watch any movie or TV series of your liking.
Chopped, Zoom Edition
We know there is some food in the fridge that is on its way out and wasting food is a big NO. Create a Zoom chat along with four or five friends, designate a judge or two, grab any foods from the fridge that are at their last days, and create a delicacy. Even though your dish probably won’t compare to a HUDS gourmet meal, we’re sure it’ll come close. Can’t send your food to the judge who lives two thousand miles away from you? No problem! Just eat it yourself, you chef de cuisine.
_______ Themed Party
Being away from campus and friends doesn’t mean that the fun has to stop. Choose a party theme, grab your favorite going-out outfit and a speaker, and there you have it, a party just as good as anything thrown in the Mather JCR.
Join a Club Sport
We’re kidding. But grab a towel, some sort of heavy, liftable material that you find in that closet in your house that doubles as a garage, and start lifting! We know we’ve been sitting down for the past two weeks and that rest is key, but if you want to release some endorphins, hosting a Zoom barre or lift class is a go-to. If sweating is not your thing, then grab a towel, light a candle, play some zen music, and call up some friends for a nice meditation session.
Weekly Check-Ins
Following social distancing rules doesn’t mean that you have to be socially distant. Quarantining and self-isolation can be lonely, and checking in on anyone — from your friends to your pset buddies — is super important. Set a reminder on your phone to send out weekly “check-in” texts to your contacts to see how they’re doing and if they need support.

The coronavirus outbreak may cancel all of our summer plans, but we can still look forward to warm weather and the spring sun to cheer ourselves up. Not only does springtime bring clear skies and t-shirts (although sadly no Yardfest this year), it also gives us an excuse to redecorate our childhood bedrooms in the name of “spring cleaning.” Read on for some prime opportunities to bring that sophisticated spring aesthetic to your old room.
Plants
This one is obvious, but a tried and true classic. Get a couple of plants in cute ceramic pots and actually stick to your resolution of watering them this semester. Consider decorating your pot as a relaxing ~while in quarantine~ activity. Not only will they spice up your childhood room with foliage and greenery, but they’re good for filtering the air too!
Pastel Pillows
If you’ve seen nothing but dreary weather since you got home, you might have forgotten what blue skies look like. The solution? New pillows in pale blues, yellows, and pinks for an extra pop of color in your room. A light-colored throw blanket will help cover up any stains and is an easy way to transform your old, patterned comforter without buying a new one! You can even learn to sew your own pillow to fill your boredom when you’re not playing Chips and Guac on Houseparty.
Fragrance Plug
While you can’t always control the smell of your failed cooking, you can do your best to cover it up with the smell of flowers. Just pick your favorite scent, turn on your fragrance plug, and wait for the smell to diffuse across your room. It will make you forget that you’re social distancing and make you feel like you’re walking in the park with your friends.
Flower Wall Hanging (DIY)
If you frequented the First Year Art Room as a freshman, this decoration is for you. Buy a cheap bundle of plastic flowers and cut off a portion of the stems, leaving an inch of stem near the base of the flower. Next, take a length of twine and wrap it around each flower stem, securing it so that you have a piece of twine with flowers tied in every six or so inches on it. Repeat until you have five to six separate strands of twine with flowers attached. Take a wooden stick and attach each strand at six-inch increments to get a “veil” of flower-strands. Look here for more detailed instructions!
We don’t know how much longer we’ll have to stay inside for, but we might as well spruce up our rooms to wish away our boredom. And if none of these ideas work for you, finding a picture of a room you like and setting it to your Zoom background is always an option, too.
