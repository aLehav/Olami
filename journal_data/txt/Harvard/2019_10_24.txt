After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Caspian: The Elements” stands out among the Peabody Museum’s exhibits of anthropological artifacts. The selection of 27 photographs are part of artist Chloe Dewe Mathews’s year of photography work, which was later made into a book of the same name, and which was produced as part of the Peabody Museum’s Contemporary Photography Fellowship.
True to the fellowship’s stated themes, the art depicts the human condition through intimate portraits and landscapes found around the Caspian Sea. The photographs hang on three walls of a small room, where mural-sized photographs cover the walls themselves.
“You feel like you’re meant to feel the power of the landscape by walking into this space,” curator Ilisa Barbash said.
Inside the room, there are 27 photographs printed in different sizes and arranged in clusters along the walls. Outside, the last photograph, depicting what a caption dubs the “door of hell,” is exhibited in large format. The book version of “Caspian,” produced at the final stage of Dewe Mathews’s project, rests on a podium in a small corner in the room.
The entire process of the fellowship, from the selection process to the book’s finalization, takes about four years. The fellowship is awarded to upcoming photographers selected through solicited nominations and later evaluation of three projects of the final nominees. For her project, Dewe Mathews conducted an ethnography, couch surfing around the Caspian and engaging closely with the people that she met.
“She obviously had an interesting rapport with people,” Barbash said. “She said that she shared a lot of the photographs with people over Instagram.”
The contemporary photography exhibit stands in contrast with the rest of the museum. The Peabody Museum displays a small amount of its collection of artifacts, almost all of which are typical ethnographic and archeological materials from cultures around the world. One museum visitor, Jose Morinio, said that the presentation caught his attention.
“If the images don’t catch your eye, then you just pass by them,” Morinio said.
Harvard sociology professor Orlando Patterson also noted the exhibit’s modernizing and eye-catching instincts.
“The museum has been very embarrassed by its past,” Patterson said. “All over the world they have been doing this, but in America it’s pretty bad and explicitly racist. They’re trying to make up now.”

Harvard Square has just become a little more vegan-friendly — the California fast-casual vegan chain Veggie Grill recently opened a location on JFK Street. Offering everything from farm bowls to veggie burgers, Oct. 13 marked the opening of Veggie Grill’s first East Coast location. Veggie Grill’s dishes often incorporate the popular Beyond Burger beef, but some dishes stay completely vegetable-based. The pseudo-healthy menu at Veggie Grill attempts to make vegetarian and vegan options more accessible with creative meat substitutes, but their best dishes are the ones that wholeheartedly embrace the quality and versatility of their very namesake: veggies.
Founded in 2006 in Irvine, Calif., Veggie Grill initially aimed to center their restaurant around vegetables and grains, rather than traditional meats and proteins. Kevin Boylan and T.K. Pillan, the founders of what later became the largest vegan and vegetarian restaurant company in the U.S., sought to make vegetarian options more mainstream. Their current menu offers something for everyone — from the “Quinoa Power Salad” for the lifetime all-natural vegan expert to the addictive “Crispy Cauliflower” to satisfy the late-night fried food craving of any college student. In addition to health-conscious salads and bowls, Veggie Grill offers mainstream items like burgers, sandwiches, and burritos with a twist. Instead of meat, all their protein options are plant-based, from the fast-growing “Beyond Burger” beef substitute to “Gardein Chickin’,” a soybean and grain-based substitute. Originally focused on their health-conscious consumer base in California, Veggie Grill has lately implemented more mainstream fast-casual food into their restaurants.
Veggie Grill’s new Boston location matches the modern, welcoming feel of its California cousins, and sitting in the white-and-green themed, decorative plant-filled restaurant certainly reinforces the concept of clean, healthy eating. With its fall menu, including pumpkin spice cake and cheesesteak, the restaurant uses the limited-time hype to pull in foodies and mainstream customers alike. From their normal menu section “shares,” the crispy cauliflower satisfies any fried-food craving without leaving the unpleasant, heavy greasiness of french fries or mozzarella sticks. Most of the shared dishes cook traditionally healthy foods with not-so-healthy methods in the tastiest way possible, and are light and addictive enough not to be[ ]shared.
With its overwhelming range of options, choosing an actual meal at Veggie Grill poses a dilemma. After trying a vegetable heavy plant-based bowl and a Beyond Burger, the bowl left me far more satisfied. Veggie Grill’s fake meats are pretty convincing, but they are merely slightly-more-expensive substitutes for the real thing. While these substitutes are a healthier option, their efforts to appeal broadly and seem as similar as possible to real meat undermine the emphasis on vegetables that consumers expect at a place named “Veggie Grill.”
However, the dishes where Veggie Grill focuses its creative efforts on the versatility of the vegetables stand out. Well-cooked and liberally-seasoned vegetables are hard to beat, and Veggie Grill’s emphasis on fresh, local produce insures each bite combats the common conception of bland, underwhelming vegetable sides. The Californian health-conscious advertising, environment, and taste of the bowls and salads push forward Veggie Grill’s slogan: “More veggies, please!”
To top off this vegan meal, Veggie Grill offers slightly-healthier versions of common desserts. While their cookies and gluten-free brownies offer a sweet ending to your meal or provide a satisfying snack, the real star of the desserts is Veggie Grill’s carrot cake. Dairy-free creamy frosting with walnuts and a not-overly-sugary distinctly carroty cake, Veggie Grill’s carrot cake is a success: an unapologetically vegetable-based dish that tastes and feels different than its non-vegan original.
While Veggie Grill may not be the place to go grab a late-night burger or burrito (look towards Jefe’s or Felipe’s), their vegetable-focused dishes break the stereotypes around restaurant vegetables and encourage customers to explore the potential of the plant options they offer. The meat alternatives may certainly aid in attracting mainstream attention to the vegan option, but the dishes that emphasize the vegetables themselves remain the most memorable and likely to bring customers back. Delicious and healthy, Veggie Grill is making vegetables the talk of Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Annenberg may be an unconventional venue for old-school hip-hop. Yet, every morning, hungry students rush to the Berg for hot breakfast dished out to tunes like “Public Service Announcement” by Jay-Z, “Juicy” by Biggie Smalls, and “So Fresh, So Clean” by OutKast.
Though students are often divided on its food quality, pervasive head bopping confirms the generally positive reception of Annenberg’s music selection.
To Noah A. Jun ’23, the music is “a very uplifting and energizing mix” even though he doesn’t know the names of most songs played.
“It’s kind of like music you wouldn’t expect at a place like Harvard, or in the dining hall. But it certainly is something that’s relatable. I feel like most kids our age would know it, and even if it’s not something like what we grew up listening to, we still know the songs and they’re pretty classic,” Jun said.
Max G. Ingersoll ’23 said he is in a similar situation. Though he does not most of the songs played, he is nevertheless “neutral-positive” about the morning melodies.
But the dining staff’s opinions are comparatively opinionated. Dubbed “The Man on the Aux” by one of his colleagues, Annenberg storekeeper Damarcus D. Hardmon shared the origins of a dining hall staff division: “Sometimes, they want some country music on, you know. But you can’t really vibe to the country music,” he said.
Hardmon explained that though the younger staff listens to old school music, veteran employees are often unamused.
A comparable music dynamic exists among the chefs. As Annenberg general cook William G. Davis explained, there is a separate radio in the kitchen and the cook on first grill gets to choose the station.
“Some people take people up on that, some people don’t. There’s a lot of classic rock, lots of older music in general. It’s kind of, almost, a free-for-all. Whoever gets to the radio puts it on, whatever their taste in music is. If people complain about it, maybe they’ll change it,” Davis said.
Though there has never been a real “squabble” over music in the kitchen, volume is occasionally an issue.
“Some of the older guys are like ‘oh, let’s turn it down a little bit’ while some of the younger guys are like “let’s listen to it louder,” Davis said.
Both Davis and Hardmon have heard parental complaints over profanity. Though Hardmon usually plays “either 96.9, 94.5, or 103.3,” he occasionally has to “switch it up” to country or soft rock in order to “make the parents happy.”

That’s the thing about living within a bubble: the light rays reflect off its soapy exterior, triggering a concave distortion of one’s perception. If you live in a bubble, you lose perspective.
Harvard is a bubble — that much we know. A mirage of wealth and opportunity, of blurry vision and questionable decisions. Not that one could expect moral clarity from this place (which has investments related to private prisons and fossil fuels, and accepts applicants based on their family’s wealth) nor from the students who chose to come here, many of whom, perhaps even yours truly, will spend years shouting radical rants against the administration before quietly shifting to an equally unethical (but rather more lucrative) career in the so-called real world. Suburban real estate, Nantucket in the summer, bleached picket fence. Socially liberal but fiscally conservative. So it goes.
And yet, occasionally, our Garnier reality feels slightly too egregious, an overdone satire of itself. Something crosses the boundary from passive to active hypocrisy, from standard to excessive shamelessness. Something like Harvard’s Class of 2023 Day of Service.
Conceptually, the Day of Service is remarkably solid and progressive in character. It takes the vast majority of the incoming class (1,500 students this year) and sends them off to do a day’s worth of volunteering around the Boston area, aiming to help them develop a “civic orientation” that will guide them during their stay at Harvard and beyond. It purports to be a transformative educational experience that helps communities in need, a chance to create a more close-knit and socially conscious community.
It fails miserably.
Let’s start with the name, “Day of Service.” One would expect a university that takes such pride in its beloved honor code to resist the urge of deceptive marketing phrasing. So much for Veritas. For the “Day of Service” cannot be considered, by any reasonable standard, a day. Its very webpage asserts that students were only expected to “volunteer” for a grand total of (gasp) four hours, from 12 to 4 p.m. Even that, however, is a significant overstatement — my own trip ended up returning to campus an hour early, after a half-hour journey to the site itself each way, leaving us with two hours worth of volunteering — just as long as the “post-service dinner and ice cream party” lasted (you really can’t make this up). Not that the volunteering itself really needed a longer time commitment. Aside from a handful of groups who were assigned to something vaguely meaningful (such as unevenly weeding urban farms), most students had to perform tasks so ludicrous that they bordered on satire. In my case, that meant dragging dusty desks from on room to the one right across the hall as a school supervisor, painfully aware of the performative pointlessness of it all, chuckled and shrugged at our every attempt to figure out what to move and where to place it.
Yet the sheer inanity of the day wasn’t, in and of itself, the worst part. After all, in spite of the time constrictions, the absurdity of the trips, and the undeniable pollution created by aimlessly driving over a thousand people around Boston, the actions themselves probably had a neutral or even (slight) positive effect.
The real issue with the Day of Service, the thing that hinted damningly at its corrupt chore, was its self-congratulatory nature. The free t-shirts, “Harvard Serves” plastered on the back that we had to wear (God forbid that a single pedestrian fails to learn about our divine charity). The local news coverage, fawning over how participants “rolled up their sleeves and went to work.” The emails (before and after the fact) urging us to document our day, to “use the hashtag #HarvardServes,” because nothing says selfless like a selfie.
Parading our student body around Boston to satisfy some fetishized version of Victorian charity is not serving. For that matter, making a social event — a damn ice cream party — of urban poverty and homelessness isn’t either. Engaging with these issues superficially, having the privilege to find in them only a fun little field trip rather than an intractable problem, is, to say the least, tone deaf.
Harvard may be a bubble — that much we have settled. But perhaps we should, when engaging with the real world, make some attempt at regaining a distortion-free perspective.
Cancel the Day of Service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world is noisy. As students, we are tasked with juggling classes, extracurriculars, friends, family, a crumbling political landscape, and questions of our future — all at the same time. For every item worth our attention, there seem to be ten tantalizing pieces of junk that seek to win over our focus. How do we differentiate the two? And even when we can, how do we pick the right important items to focus our time and energy on?
Communication engineers have found the intuition to solve this dilemma over a hundred years ago without even knowing it. Say you want to load up a YouTube video on WiFi. A router is trying to send your phone electromagnetic waves with all the relevant data. However, there are millions of other electromagnetic waves going through the air at the same time, from cellular networks, to AM and FM radios, to Bluetooth. How do you find your wave?
Introducing the bandpass filter.
Most WiFi communications send signals out at a frequency of 2.4 Gigahertz (2.4 billion cycles per second). FM radio is at around 100 Megahertz, and Bluetooth at 2.45 Gigahertz. You can use a bandpass filter to select a specific frequency and throw away all the other information so that your phone will focus on just the WiFi signal. Only then can your cat video on YouTube play.
I’ve used the concept of the bandpass filter in many areas of my life. In the fall of my sophomore year, I grinded away at countless summer internship applications online — totaling over 150 submitted applications. Of the 25 employers that even responded to me, I managed to get an interview with six, and an offer from one. But those 150 applications were not top quality — they were good ways to fill up my time and convince myself I was doing something productive. The fact and feeling of progress are entirely separate. It wasn’t until my junior year that I changed my strategy by applying the simple rules of the bandpass filter. I reached out to five people, interviewed with four, and signed an offer. Less of the bad, more of the good.
Admittedly, this elegant framework for life often bites me back when I’m overzealous with the cutting. Harvard’s acquaintance scene can be summarized in one hollow, empty promise: “Let’s grab a meal.” The phrase still makes me cringe today. For a while, I vowed not to even suggest grabbing meals with others because I didn’t want to be that Harvard kid meeting with 50 “friends” each for 30 minutes on alternating weeks. I wanted a small group of deep, intimate friendships to make the backbone of my social life. Less of the bad, more of the good, right?
But bandpass filters don’t have clean cutoffs. Engineers struggle to design filters that perfectly reject 2.39 GHz, and perfectly accept 2.4 GHz. In reality, some of the noise from the fringes will make it through. Now, I see this as a feature instead of a bug. Nonideal bandpasses allow us to focus our energy on the things that matter most, but they also bring in just the right amount of excess to allow us to see something new. I’ve made some of my closest friends from a thirty minute lunch. And I’m willing to take in some noise if it means a shot at something new.
The rules of the bandpass are seen most clearly in my dorm room. My walls are bare, my windowsills empty, and my desk holds only what I’m working on at the time. My bed intentionally rests at the far end of the nook, blocking me from viewing the work on my desk. Physical spaces are manifestations of our inner state of being, but I’ve discovered that this is a two-way function: physical spaces also have the power to change our state. For that, I opt for the bandpass in my room. I opt for less is more.
A life of essentialism — or minimalism, or intentionalism, call it what you want — is not a life of deprivation, but rather a life of intentionality. As writer Joshua Fields Millburn puts it in the article “Essentials, Nonessentials, and Junk,” “The key, then, is to continue to question the things we bring into our lives, and to question the things we hold onto, because the stuff that adds value today might be tomorrow’s junk.” By navigating my time at Harvard through the framework of the bandpass, I’ve found more joy in doing and thinking less, and focusing more on what matters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Harvard Law School event earlier this month, Adam K. Mortara — the lead attorney for Students for Fair Admissions — the plaintiffs in the recent Harvard admissions lawsuit, spoke publicly on the ruling for the first time. Mortara challenged the ruling’s lack of explanation for how Asian American applicants receive lower personal scores in admissions ratings.“I guess there’s just something more personally appealing about African American and Hispanic applicants,” he said at the event.
After at least a dozen students in the crowd shouted their agreement, conflict ensued in student group chats, touching upon the comments’ legitimacy or lack thereof in the broader context of systemic racism and efforts to eliminate affirmative action. This conflict led Law School affinity groups to plan several joint discussion fora to promote further dialogue.
Both sides of this debate harbor legitimate and deeply felt concerns. We have previously urged Harvard to understand the implications of its internal studies on personal scores and have repeatedly defended affirmative action. But in order to fully understand the debate, we must acknowledge that arguments on both sides in this case are deeply personal. Feeling discriminated against and ascribed a personality on the basis of racial origin is a terrible experience, just as much as having one’s very existence at the University or other places of higher learning threatened and delegitimized. Such feelings understandably evoke strong emotions, and when so much is at stake for both groups, conversation can be difficult.
This difficulty is only exacerbated by the bad faith associated with the past political actions of individuals related to SFFA. Fisher v. University of Texas, a lawsuit that attempted to end affirmative action in 2016, was also brought by Edward Blum, SFFA’s president. Blum’s true aim, in this case as in Fisher, is clear — to end affirmative action in its entirety. But by portraying its goal in SFFA v. Harvard as helping Asian American students while working to undermine the mechanisms that empower racial minorities in the face of existing inequalities, SFFA conceals its aims under the benign cover of an imagined equality under meritocracy.
It is thus hardly surprising that this conversation has at times veered beyond the pale of open dialogue and good faith, with mistrust seemingly on all sides. Regardless, comments like those from the audience at the Law School event are unacceptable. Furthermore, explicitly saying so is a critical part of the difficult work of maintaining productive, respectful dialogue.
In light of this issue’s high potential for conflict, the extent to which the ongoing discussions have largely been facilitated within the institutional context of the Law School, should be hugely encouraging for those committed to defending such dialogues. In fact, the very existence of these respectful dialogues between students of both sides, each with deeply held beliefs but engaging with others in good faith, is itself a compelling argument for diversity on campuses of higher education.
When we share an institution, we have the opportunity to come together and engage each other in meaningful conversations. But without institutions that are comprised of students from different backgrounds, it is impossible for a diversity of viewpoints — each the product of a unique background — to accumulate at the same place and inform one another. Part of the critical work of affirmative action is precisely to preserve the place for students of diverse backgrounds to have these conversations, and that is why we must protect it.

Michael R. Kremer '85, who is the Gates Professor of Developing Societies, recently received the Nobel Prize in Economics alongside MIT professors Esther Duflo and Abhijit V. Banerjee for their “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.” The trio pioneered the use of randomized controlled trials to solve developmental obstacles; they wielded economics as a tool to address the everyday struggles of teachers, farmers, and villagers.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
​​​​​​
FM: What drew you to developmental economics? 
MRK: The issue of poverty in the world seemed like a very important problem; my interest in that predated [my time at] Harvard. My parents taught me about the responsibilities we have to other people. Some people say poverty is intractable and daunting, but there’s a sea of small investments that can make a big difference.
FM: How did your time at Harvard shape your interest in global poverty?
MRK: What Harvard [changed] was my perception of the problem and my approach to it. I had a fantastic Social Studies 10 tutor — I wasn’t an Econ major. I’m very glad I got the perspectives that came from Social Studies. For my senior thesis, I got the chance to compare two social policy programs: an employment guarantee scheme in India and a food subsidy program in Sri Lanka. That made me realize I should spend more time in a developing country. After I graduated, I wound up teaching high school in Kenya for a year. That was an opportunity to learn, to get a richer perspective [on global poverty] than I could ever get in a classroom or government office.
FM: How did you end up embracing randomized controlled trials?
MRK: After I finished my Ph.D. and got a job with a real salary [laughs] my wife and I went on vacation to Kenya. We visited some old friends of mine that had just been hired by an [anti-poverty] non-profit organization. They weren’t sure about the effects of their program. I said they could get at the impact of what they were doing if they tried different things in different places. If they phased programs in a deliberate way, they’d have the equivalent of a randomized trial in medicine.
There was a debate at the time over whether to charge for preventative healthcare measures for communicable diseases, for, say, mosquito nets. People argued that if we charged, we could get a sense of how many people were truly going to use them. But in my work at the Harvard School of Public Health, I found that even a small fee dramatically reduces the number of people who take advantage of mosquito nets. This is not only bad for their health but also for their neighbors’. I don’t want to claim it’s just because of the evidence, but in part, governments and nonprofit organizations now distribute nets for free. And there’s been a huge impact from that.
This was important intellectually because I believe there are some puzzles around poverty that are hard to put through standard economic models. Some people disagree, but I think some element of [a program’s success] has to do with behavioral economics. [Randomized controlled trials] force us to rethink our assumptions.
FM: What has surprised you the most in your work? 
MRK: One of the projects the NGO tried was distribution of textbooks. There was a debate in economics between people who thought we should spend more on education and people who thought we should improve incentives for students and teachers. I certainly thought textbooks would help, but when we looked at the data, we did not find a statistically significant increase in average test scores.
That was a big surprise, but maybe it shouldn’t have been. I knew from my year teaching in Kenya that kids would miss a lot of school to worms, malaria, and all sorts of issues. The kids who did well on tests before the program benefitted from the textbooks; the bottom three-quarters of the distribution did not. Subsequent research by Esther and Abhijit [suggested that] schools in developing countries often teach to the top of the class. Providing remedial education had a tremendous impact. In many contexts, very inexpensive programs can have significant impact on people’s lives.
FM: What are your plans for future work? 
MRK: One area I’ve been involved in is digital agriculture. Many people, even in very low-income countries, now have access to cellphones. Simple agricultural information can be really helpful to farmers, and it can be delivered via mobile phone. I helped found an NGO called Precision Agriculture for Development, and am working with the governments of Ethiopia and India to figure out the best way to deliver this kind of information.

When I meet Zephaniah “Zeph” Ozaroff of Cambridge Brewing Company and ask what possessed him to brew beer with sheep skulls, he gives me several answers.
He begins by explaining that the black metal band Gorgoroth, whose onetime lead singer Gaahl was an avowed satanist, gave the beer its name: For Those Who Hear The Whisper. Gorgoroth, Zeph says, became infamous in 2004 for a performance later known as Black Mass Krakow, which featured sheep’s heads on stakes, a variety of satanic symbols, and a large quantity of sheep’s blood, sprayed around the stage and into the crowd. Hence the sheep skulls.
Zeph, who sports short hair and a foot-long beard, next describes the technique for making this beer. He gives me a tour of the massive brewing equipment and the fermentation tanks then tells me about phenolic profiles and esters, compounds that generate a beer’s aroma. Zeph tells me that For Those Who Hear The Whisper has notes of cherry and dates from the Belgian candi syrup and a hint of chocolate-covered cherry from the esters. “The idea was to make a dark beer for people who don’t think they like dark beer.”
I am no expert, but the beer tastes good.
This October marks the 12th year of Cambridge Brewing Company’s Great Pumpkin Festival, which features pumpkin-flavored beer from around the country, as well as seasonal beers, like For Those Who Hear the Whisper, made by CBC’s own brewing staff. “For the most part the people around here aren’t, like, metalheads,” Zeph says. “But it’s Halloween, it’s spooky… it was a good time.”
Over the past 30 years, CBC has been a steady and reliable presence in Kendall Square; it is one of the oldest craft breweries in Boston. Will Meyers, CBC’s brewmaster, has been at the helm of the organization for 26 years and acts as a mediating force in the brewery.
“Will said, ‘I’ll let you throw the skulls in, but you cannot throw the whole heads in,’” Zeph says. “And I will say, retrospectively, I am grateful that he did that. Really, I am very happy with how this beer turned out.”
CBC’s sheep skull beer is far from the first beer brewed with meat. Zeph cites Earth Eagle Brewings in Portsmouth, NH as a personal inspiration: “The first time I had a meat beer from them it had calf hearts and livers in it. I had one that had an elk head in it… And those were surprisingly drinkable beers.”
Earlier this year, Zeph and Meyers also brewed a beer called Burnt Weeny Sandwich that incorporated hot dogs and hot dog buns into the fermentation process. That beer had been named after an album of the same title by Mothers of Invention. “Sometimes I would come up with a name, or a turn of phrase or a song title or whatever, and then that was the platonic ideal that I would try to build towards,” Zeph says.
Zeph has been a brewer at CBC for a year and four months. Before that, he worked as a baker and a cook, and brewed beer at home. And — no surprise — he’s played guitar in metal and hardcore bands since his teenage years.
“[Gaahl] refers to black metal as sort of a ‘war for those who hear the whisper,’” Zeph says. “If I had heard that turn of phrase when I was 15 and first, like, being angry and playing guitar, I would have been like ‘Oh that’s the name of my new song, I’m so mad!’ So now [this beer] is kind of a different way to funnel my creativity.”
I ask whether the sheep skulls change the flavor of the beer. Zeph says no, the skulls don’t really change the flavor. “But again, you know,” he says, throwing up a hand sign. “It’s metal.”

Despite being a soft-spoken lover of books, John H. Overholt is not your typical librarian.
Overholt’s official title at Houghton Library is “Curator of the Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson and Early Books and Manuscripts.” Responsible for almost all of Houghton’s pre-1800 materials, Overholt manages a great deal of the library’s collection.
But in his spare time, Overholt shares his knowledge of and experience with rare books to the rest of the world. In 2002, he went on national television to compete as a contestant on Jeopardy; he won, despite incorrectly answering the literature-themed Final Jeopardy question.
“Alex [Trebek] actually said, ‘Now you would expect John Overholt, being a librarian, would know this one,”’ Overholt says. “And I said, “Yes, you would expect that,” when they revealed the wrong answer.”
Overholt uses his Twitter account for outreach, and he has amassed over 20,000 followers and 46,000 tweets since joining the site roughly ten years ago. He usually tweets several times a day. His content ranges from the relatable (“It’s really lovely out today. I’d go outside more often if the wi-fi was better,” accompanied with a photo of a half-empty beer on a backyard table - @john_overholt, 10/13/2019) to the things that only a rare books librarian would say (“I whacked my knee hard into a marble column but I didn’t drop the medieval manuscript I was carrying. This has been my most curatorial tweet.” - @john_overholt, 10/19/2019).
Overholt says his presence on the site helps “demystify” the experience of visiting a library like Houghton and interacting with rare books and manuscripts.
“I really love sharing the things that I’m doing, not just with other colleagues, but with people who just think books are interesting, because I think they’re really interesting, too!” he says with a smile.
Overholt has worked with rare books since he was an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis. He started at Houghton in 2004, and in June of this year, his role at the library expanded dramatically, as he became responsible for most of the pre-1800 collection.
When making new acquisitions for Houghton, Overholt concentrates on finding unique copies of books –– such as those with annotations from early readers, or mistakes in a first edition printing –– which produce feelings of connection to the people who made and used them in their time period.
One of Overholt’s favorite items is known as The Little Gidding Harmony, or as he calls it, a ‘cut-and-paste’ Bible. In England during the 1600s, the women of a small religious community fashioned clippings from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John into one continuous narrative of the Gospel that better suited their tastes than a conventional Bible. They took great pride in the construction, even adding illustrations from other sources. The women then used the book in their everyday lives.
“That [book] feels so personal and powerful to me,” Overholt says.
He is also interested in materials that were not intended for preservation. For instance, cheaply produced and widely-disseminated publications might have sold thousands of copies, but because few people thought they were worth saving, such an artifact may exist in very small numbers today. Acquiring one of these unique pieces, Overholt says, can drastically increase the knowledge we have about culture at the time of publication. “I'm very interested in collecting that kind of stuff because it's got so much more opportunity to change what we know.”
Overholt emphasizes the importance of understanding Houghton’s materials as physical objects because their tangible qualities reveal just as much as, if not more than, their internal content. The design and layout of the books reveal information about the artifact’s time period and context, keeping in-person visits to Houghton relevant even as its materials become increasingly digitized.
Although Houghton’s publications are from the increasingly distant past, the library is facing towards the future. In an effort to make the library more accessible, Houghton is undergoing renovations until autumn of 2020.
For the past 77 years, Houghton’s lobby was devoted to displaying bookcases full of works written by upper-class white men. While Overholt notes the importance of these authors and their influence, he recognizes that exhibiting an unvarying collection of materials is no longer representative of Houghton’s vision.
“We’re putting in new display cases that will, instead of just being a spine, be designed to display individual pieces out and open, and to rotate them so that you’re constantly seeing new things every time you come into the library. I think that’ll give a much more realistic impression of what kind of place we are, what we do, and why you might want to keep coming back.”
“I want us to feel like a friendly place, a place that’s welcoming, and a place that’s excited to have you come in and have an experience with something neat in our collection,” he says. “Because we’re just as excited about it, too.”

When Olivia A. Benowitz ’09 sat down in a plastic folding chair in Harvard Yard on Commencement Day waiting to get her diploma, she felt hopeful. She expected to sit through a full program of speeches from University President Drew G. Faust, the class of 2009 Commencement Speaker Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, and her fellow graduates. Then, she’d celebrate the end of four carefree years at Harvard College.
But as soon as Faust began to speak, the arc of her day changed.
“We inhabit a new world — one of changing structures, assumptions, and values as well as changed resources. Few expect a return anytime soon to the world we had come to take for granted just a year ago,” Faust said, looking out on a packed crowd of seniors. “We graduate a class of seniors from the College today who, according to the New York Times, face the most difficult job market in decades.”
Benowitz says Faust’s words popped the bubble that she’d lived in for four years, reminding her she was about to leave Harvard’s campus and enter the real world — one without meal plans, financial aid, or advising. Faust continued her speech, calling on the graduates to fix the financial crisis that had wracked the economy starting in December 2007. But Benowitz said her words were cold comfort.
“The biggest thing I remember thinking is, how? If we’re supposed to be the ones like, saving the world, how do you expect us to go about that? I don’t know how to go about saving the world. I kind of would like someone to come and save me,” she recalls.
So Benowitz made a choice. She skipped the rest of the ceremony, packed her stuff into a car, and impulsively drove to Lynn, Mass. to adopt a Maltese-Pomeranian mix named Maisie. For the next 10 years, Maisie would follow her through interstate moves and past-due notices, surgeries and breakups, job applications and power outages. The two of them would weather the worst American financial crisis in a century, one that sucker-punched millions of college graduates.
For Benowitz and many of the other Harvard students sitting in the Yard on June 4, 2009, the financial crisis would radically change the next ten years of their lives. The class of 2009 entered Harvard as freshmen expecting to leave campus with job security provided by their Ivy League education.
But the recession challenged the class of 2009’s understanding of what it means to receive a Harvard degree. The shiny promise of soaring career paths, financial security, and public recognition draws applicants to Harvard. What happens when this post-graduate future isn’t guaranteed anymore?
Neither professors, nor parents, nor Faust could help the class of 2009 answer that question in the midst of an unprecedented and unpredictable economic climate. So they went into the world and figured it out.
The prospect of an economic disaster first occurred to Erik M. Lawler ’08 during his senior year in an MIT class on commercial real estate. Around late 2007 or early 2008 — Lawler doesn’t remember — a London bank executive spoke to the class.
“He literally painted this picture of like, the world was going to implode,” Lawler says, “We all looked around like he was nuts. Like, who is this guy? What is he talking about? At least I remember I was thinking that at the time. And then sure enough, like within a few months, the world started to fall apart.”
Rumors of the recession began quietly, first as whispers between Wall Street bankers. Lawler remembers the London bank executive telling his class, “‘I sit in my office in London, and my office overlooks a park. I look out my window, and everyone outside has no idea what’s about to happen.’”
During the summer of 2008 — even after the prominent investment bank Bear Stearns went under — Matthew D. Thomas ’09 interned at Fidelity Bank largely unaware of the crisis to come. While in retrospect the signs were clear, he thought it was a summer like any other.
“I wish I was more in tune with the world at that time, because I was right at the pulse. Everyone was shorting everyone, shorting banks, shorting — I remember particularly — Las Vegas hotels,” he says.
For a while, those trades didn’t touch Harvard. When the class of 2009 returned to campus in the fall, most students say they were thinking about finishing their four years on a high note. They had parties to attend, clubs to lead, and senior theses to write.
Though Thomas left Fidelity feeling fairly sure that banking wasn’t for him, he hadn’t settled on another plan. Still, he returned to Cambridge optimistic.
“I was playing football for my senior year and focused on senior spring, and just the college experience, and ignoring the fact that things were gonna be hard getting out of school,” he says.
And that fall before Commencement Day, Benowitz was similarly focused on enjoying her last year as a college student. “I was writing my senior thesis, I was directing a show that I really loved. I was on cloud nine. And I didn’t feel like it was going to touch me,” she says.
In fact, many students felt hopeful that fall, buoyed by the tide of national politics. Benowitz called those months “monumental,” not because of the crisis, but because of Barack Obama’s historic election on top of the excitement of senior year.
Off campus, though, economists and financial executives began to see glimpses of a crisis, especially those involved in the seemingly secure housing market.
The American housing market boomed all throughout the early 2000s, peaking in mid-2006. Believing the trend of rising prices would never end, financial analysts poured money into repackaged mortgage loans. Then, quietly, the market burst. Housing prices fell, homeowners couldn’t make their mortgage payments, and those same analysts began to panic.
This panic simmered until Sept.15, 2008, when the financial firm Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Then the panic boiled over. Lending froze. People feared that any bank could be the next one to collapse.
“That led to banks, who stopped lending to firms and then stopped lending to each other, and then stopped lending to customers and to households, and households stopped spending because they were becoming unemployed. And because houses were falling in value, and some of those forces made the economy go sharply worse,” explains associate Economics professor Gabriel I. Chodorow-Reich ’05.
In the fall of 2008, students like Thomas may have been mostly unaware of Lehman Brothers’ collapse — and the plunging stock market that followed — but Harvard staff at the Office of Career Services were watching.
OCS Director Robin I. Mount wasn’t surprised when the economy started falling apart. She had been helping students find jobs for a long time, through financial highs and lows. She witnessed companies almost cease hiring altogether in the dot-com bust at the turn of the century, when investors dumped money into internet startups assuming they would turn a hefty profit. Many of them didn’t, and investors and companies alike suffered serious losses. As a result, they stopped hiring. Mount was ready for a similar job-search fiasco when rumours of an imminent crash loomed.
“We were panicked. We were watching the stock market crash. Because so many of the employers that we work with — Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch — they were imploding, right? Bear Stearns blew up. And so we were just like, riveted [to the news],” she remembers. “But students were kind of clueless.”
At first, the class of 2008 didn’t think the recession had much to do with them. Everyone assured them that a Harvard acceptance letter was a golden ticket, practically guaranteeing financial stability and a postgraduate job. They watched class after class of students before them graduate mostly employed.
“I went through my undergraduate experience, just feeling all like, there’s all the promise in the world, and that everything’s going to turn out so great for you. Because, ohmygod, you go to Harvard. How could that not go great?” says Winslow Carroll ’09.
The recession became real outside Cambridge well before Harvard students even registered it. By August 2008, the national employment rate climbed above 5 percent, rising more than a percentage point from the year before. The rise in unemployment did affect some students outside of their Harvard lives, however. Joseph F. Quinn ’08 remembers first realizing the impact of the recession when his dad lost his job at one of the big investment banks that went under.
“[It] literally hit home for me,” Quinn says. “And so the impression that I was getting of job prospects, and the career world, was definitely colored by that.”
Still, some seniors felt so far removed from the crash that they even made jokes about the firms filing for bankruptcy in New York — especially Lehman Brothers.
In an Adams House suite one weekend, a group of seniors threw a faux-memorial for Lehman and Bear Stearns, decking the room with gravestones in the banks’ memories. They danced, drank, and blared music, while the ghosts of bankrupt companies loomed morosely on the walls in decorative tombstones.
“We didn’t understand it was going to have a catastrophic impact on the economy. It did seem like Wall Street was melting down, but it didn’t seem like it would matter for the rest of America at that point,” says Peter N. Ganong ’09, one of the hosts of the gravestone party. “It didn’t seem like particularly impactful in terms of getting a job.”
But as Ganong and his blockmates danced among the banks’ graves, the practical effects of the crisis crept towards Cambridge. Some students began to get calls from their junior summer internship coordinators telling them they no longer had job offers. Others participated in the mass ritual of senior fall — on-campus recruiting — only to find that the number of available positions had drastically decreased. Interview spots were down by 19 percent, and job offers were even scarcer.
Dara M. Wilson ’09 remembers walking into her friend’s room in Winthrop House in the fall of 2008 to find her distraught. Wilson’s friend was a star intern at Lehman Brothers, an obvious candidate for the job offer she got at the summer’s end. Then Lehman folded.
“There was this morbid power over the whole mood of the room,” she said. “You thought you had done everything to put yourself in a position where you didn’t have to scramble to figure out what you’re going to do with the rest of your life right out of school. All of a sudden, she was in the boat with so many of us who were still figuring that out.”
Most seniors knew someone who lost or was passed over for a job offer, even if they didn’t experience it themselves. And as economic conditions spiraled, affecting more and more employers and so more and more seniors, the mood of the class turned grim. The recession no longer felt far away from Harvard’s iron gates.
“There was almost like a hush, like somebody had died, everywhere you went,” Valerie Novacek ’09 said. “People would convene in common rooms and talk about what happened, who was affected, what does it mean?”
After winter break, when students returned to campus, Mount said their parents had given them a reality check. The OCS staff may have been the only ones watching the Dow Jones index in September, but by January their office was overflowing with panicked seniors.
In a late November faculty meeting, then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced an FAS-wide hiring freeze and stringent budget cutbacks, hoping to save $10 million. He asked department heads to pause their search for roughly 100 positions, citing financial forecasters’ estimates that the University endowment would suffer as high as a 30 percent reduction. Harvard’s endowment — the largest in the world — eventually plunged by 27 percent between the fall of 2008 and 2009.
Students may not have been paying attention to the changes in FAS, but at least one administrative austerity measure did affect them. In early May, Smith announced that the school would seek to reduce the cost of undergraduate room and board by 7.5 percent. To aid that reduction, he axed hot breakfast in the upperclassmen Houses — a change that, to this day, has not been reversed.
For seniors, though, their uncertain professional futures were more urgent than breakfast.
The percentage of seniors that had jobs waiting for them when they graduated fell 5 percent from the year before, according to the Crimson’s 2009 Senior Survey. Rescinded job offers and low recruiting numbers also impacted the class — the number of seniors entering finance and consulting fell from 47 percent in 2007 to 39 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2009. The traditional money-making jobs that many Harvard students counted on suddenly hired less than a quarter of the graduating class.
“In thinking about Harvard students, you’d want to think that a disproportionate number compared to college graduates nationwide go into finance, and the finance sector was very hard hit by the recession,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Jason Furman said. So, for Harvard undergraduates, the recession “could be worse in scale and in composition for employment.”
Falling numbers of Wall Street-bound graduates reflected lower hiring rates, but they also reflected a campus-wide suspicion of those firms as their roles in creating the crisis itself became clear to Harvard undergraduates.
“I know that the way people talked about Wall Street in the 80s, and 90s, it seemed really appealing as an 18-year-old,” says Thomas. “But then it, as I got older, it became something I didn’t want to be associated with personally.”
In fact, in the recession’s aftermath, some economic analysts blamed Harvard itself for the crisis. In particular, Harvard Business School. In 2017, business journalist Duff McDonald published a history of the Business School titled “The Golden Passport: Harvard Business School, the Limits of Capitalism, and the Moral Failure of the MBA Elite,” taking the school to task for teaching an immoral brand of business thinking.
Yet while some among them criticized financial firms, Harvard students undoubtedly had it better than many of their peers. Kemeyawi Q. Wahpepah ’09 says she recalls returning to the Bay Area to see her hometown upended by the financial crisis.
Others felt the difference most clearly when they compared themselves to friends from high school who did not attend Ivy League colleges.
“There are a lot of my high school friends [who] did not have jobs for a long time. They struggled. A lot of them went to very low paying jobs,” Novacek says. “I mean, the Harvard name absolutely gave you a leg up.”
Loyal companies still flew representatives to campus for recruitment and students still had a vast network of alumni to rely upon. Companies may have been hiring fewer college graduates, but if there was any school they were going to hire from, there was a good chance it would be Harvard. Mount even recalls new companies recruiting on campus that year that had never come before, because they saw the recession as a chance to hire a Harvard student.
“For a lot of people, the ability to get into a place like Harvard already represents having a safety net, a social safety net, that allows you to get the education and the opportunities that it takes in order to gain enrollment into a school like that. So those things in general, they don’t just disappear,” Wilson says. “They may shrink, because everybody’s everything was shrinking. But the safety net is definitely still there.”
While the Harvard safety net didn’t vanish, it shrank to the point that some students didn’t quite land in it.
Leaving her Quincy House dorm room with packed bags and her new puppy, Benowitz began a tough 10-year post-graduation journey.
Harvard was the most stable place she’d ever lived — consistent housing, free food, engaging classes. She worked in the FAS Development Office calling donors, she rode horses, she did theater, and she fell in love with the History and Literature program.
“I kind of thought that the Harvard name would insulate me, because it had been a place of safety and stability for me the whole time I was there.” she says. “And so I don’t think it really struck me that I needed to have a backup plan, and a backup plan from my backup plan, until it was way too late.”
In the two years following her graduation from the College, Benowitz estimates she applied to more than 100 jobs. She balanced working at Trader Joe’s and Sephora with internships in her dream field — arts administration. But when the theaters where she interned wanted her to devote more time, she had to say no in order to take shifts at other companies that paid her and provided her with health insurance.
Many of Benowitz’s friends had the benefit of family support and connections. And, though thousands of college graduates — including some of her Harvard classmates — were in similarly difficult positions, she felt alone.
“It was exhausting, and I felt like a total failure, and I just felt like I couldn’t catch a break,” she says. “I also felt like for whatever reason, I was the only one struggling that hard. I don’t think that was true. But that’s the way it felt.”
But Benowitz doesn’t blame the recession for her struggles. Thomas — the football player — says the same.
On Commencement Day, Thomas says he was unemployed and unsure how to occupy the months after graduation. Then he got a call from a family friend offering him a job coaching football at his high school. Over the next several years, he worked as a teacher, played football abroad, set up tailgate tents, and moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina — where the cost of living was lower. He says he only began a stable career around 2011.
“It didn’t hit me until probably 2011, when I was working and I was applying for jobs in North Carolina. I said to myself like, ‘Oh, yeah, no wonder it was so hard to get a job, of course it was,’” he reflects.
Lawler also struggled to acquire a job for more than a year after graduation. He had toyed with the idea of joining the Navy SEALs throughout his senior year, but once he saw the state of the professional job market, he felt that entering the military was his only realistic option. For the next year, he went through the long application and clearance process required to enter the Navy, only to ultimately be rejected due to a medical issue. By then, it was 2010, the economy was slowly starting to recover, and he got a job at Morgan Stanley.
“If you look at my resume, you could almost see, well, this is where the recession happened. And this is where things started to bounce back, which is when I got a job in finance.”
The term ’08 recession is a bit misleading. In some parts of the country, the economy started to go south well before Lehman Brothers fell; in others, it lingered for years after 2008. Benowitz, Thomas, Lawler, and some of their classmates didn’t just enter the economy at a brief year-long period of crisis — they entered a dark period that lasted long past 2008.
Harvard economics professor Karen E. Dynan says the U.S. labor market remained weak for half a decade after national unemployment peaked at 10 percent in 2009. She notes that only about five percent of college graduates ended up jobless during that period, but many more were underemployed — meaning they worked fewer hours than they wanted to.
“Wage growth was really soft at the time. Job openings had plunged to about half their pre-recession level,” she says. “It was a pretty grim situation that they were looking at.”
Though not every ’09 graduate felt the impact of the recession in the same way, many of them say it changed the way they viewed success.
“I guess the silver lining through all of this is that it just, I think it caused a lot of people to sort of reevaluate their priorities — the prospect of making you know, insane money, just fresh out of college and just sacrificing two years of your health and happiness to it,” Novacek says.
“I think it forced a lot of us to really think about what would make us happy. What does fulfillment mean? What is our role in this new future as the graduating class, entering this brave new world that’s just kind of been upended? How do we make it better? How do we find our place in it?” she adds.
After Alice N. Lee ’09 didn’t get a job through on-campus recruiting, she applied on a whim for a fellowship to work in a New Orleans community center. She got the job and spent much of the next decade pursuing community development.
Lee says that while she was an undergraduate, she believed that a job in management consulting was the best — or at least, most conventional — way to develop leadership skills. In New Orleans, she discovered that wasn’t true. Had it been “any other year,” she says she might have ended up at McKinsey or Bain. Instead, she spent a decade working on mayoral campaigns and in charter schools.
Mount also witnessed a change in the mindsets of the students she was advising. Suddenly, in higher numbers than years past, people were asking OCS about job opportunities in fields outside of finance and consulting. This shift came right as the office was instituting an initiative called “turning up the volume on diverse opportunities.” The pain of the recession aside, Mount was pleased with what she was seeing.
“The second that a lot of the big for-profit companies were struggling, students… were like, ‘Well, I’ve always had a passion for fashion,’” Mount remembers. “And so we saw students really gravitating [toward] and enjoying learning about all of these other pathways.”
A widely cited 2010 paper by University of Rochester economist Lisa B. Kahn found that college graduates who entered the job market during the 1979-1980 recession had much lower wages over the long term. Dynan says Kahn’s work sheds light on the long-lasting effects of graduating amid economic turmoil.
Several ’09 graduates said that, looking back 10 years later, they have now made peace with their post-graduation prospects.
“The thing is, you go through Harvard carrying these stories of people graduating and earning $100,000 after graduation, which is ludicrous. Or maybe it’s not, but it quickly became pretty ludicrous-seeming to even think that that was a possibility. And, you know, I’m probably nowhere near that, and probably never will be. And that’s okay.” Carroll says.
Today, Mount and her team at OCS are on the lookout for trouble once again.
“We’re reading the Wall Street Journal and watching the news every night because we have a pretty volatile economy at the moment,” she says.
During interviews for this story, several graduates asked, unprompted, if this topic was borne out of fearing another recession. The U.S. is currently experiencing the longest continuous rise in stock prices — what economists call a “bull market” — in its history, now stretching 10 years since it began in March 2009. It can’t last forever, right?
Just like the bank executives and traders murmured about a housing bubble in 2007, some economists are currently reading the tea leaves — or, more accurately, the sheaves of Excel spreadsheets — and seeing the signs of another downturn.
“Relative to five or six years ago, there’s more signs of things that could go wrong,” Chowdorow-Reich speculates. He points to political uncertainty, oil prices in Saudi Arabia, and trade policy as signs of an impending recession — a recession that bond traders fear will be so significant it will require cuts to the federal interest rate.
Then again, he says, perhaps those indicators don’t really mean much for the future of the American economy.
“On the other hand, the labor market has been pretty healthy so far. So something could happen, but it‘s a pretty good bet that nothing has pushed us into a recession yet.”
It’s unclear, even to Harvard economists, when a recession will next strike. But knowing that it will happen at some point might be enough to keep seniors up at night.
If it does, Benowitz has some advice — other than, of course, adopting a dog.
“My hope for the next generation of people who go through it is that they will be better prepared, because they’ll see it coming,” she says. “I’m sure there were some people who anticipated it, but it felt, at least from my perspective, like it came out of fucking nowhere.”
If 2009 is a guide, most Harvard graduates won’t be safe from the next recession. In fact, as in 2008, some of them might even contribute to it. But whenever it arrives, Harvard students of that time will have to make choices about the jobs they want to have, the places they want to live, and the people they want to become.
Faust, in fact, predicted those choices in her 2009 commencement speech, quoting the historian Caroline Walker Bynum: “Change is what forces us to ask who we are.”

On Thursday, Oct. 17, Judy Chicago, an artist nearly synonymous with the 1970s American feminist art movement, attended a ceremony in the main hall of Radcliffe Yard’s Knafel Center. The hall is oaky and high-ceilinged, and Chicago, purple-haired and draped in rainbow sequins, was its uncharacteristic centerpiece. She was there to celebrate the launch of the Judy Chicago Portal, the joint effort of three institutions to archive Chicago’s work. Harvard’s Schlesinger Library will store her papers, Penn State University will house her arts education collection, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, her art.
The event was surprisingly instructional, laying out the practical mechanisms for preserving women’s cultural production. Archivists and librarians described the various grants they’d received for feminist archival efforts and offered to share planning documents or preservation tips upon request.
Chicago and the archivists’ advice to young female artists: Document everything. As soon as you make the first piece you deem professional-level, keep index cards detailing all of your work and the context in which you made it. Photograph your process. If you’re lucky enough that the work sells, keep track of who buys it.
The project of protecting and representing Chicago’s life’s work is continuous with the essential goals of her art itself. She has spent her life working to write women into history, and now she is trying to ensure that her carefully documented work of the past sixty years does not disappear.
Take, for example, her best known piece, The Dinner Party, now permanently housed at the Brooklyn Museum. Chicago and 400 volunteers spent five laborious years building the installation, a monumental dinner table set for 39 historical and mythical western women. Chicago wanted to salvage their memories.
The piece was as much a work of historical preservation as it was artistic creation. It required rigorous inquiry into histories that barely existed, which often meant combing through the histories of men in search of incidental references to women. It was met with disdain in 1979 by mostly male critics who deemed it crass and didactic, and has more recently faced criticism for representing an exclusionary second-wave feminism centered on white and cisgender women — in other words, excluding those most vulnerable to historical erasure. Chicago has rebutted that the work in fact opened up paths for researching the lives of marginalized women that didn’t exist before. Speaking on the phone before the portal launch, Chicago told me, “I hope that it will be easier for young women to find me than it was for me to find my predecessors, before there was an Internet and before there was Google. I still found them, and it changed my life.”
Chicago’s career became inextricable from what is now known as the Feminist Art Movement when she founded the Feminist Art Project at Fresno State College — now California State University, Fresno — in 1970. The following year, she and he artist Miriam Schapiro relocated the program to the California Institute of the Arts, rechristening it the Feminist Art Program and bringing several of her Fresno students along. The program was the first of its kind.
“It’s always interesting to me when people talk about feminist art as if there is no such thing as masculinist art,” Chicago told the crowd at the Schlesinger. The masculinity in art, as she sees it, is often an emphasis on formal elements. “When you think about this in terms of the construct of femininity and masculinity, it makes total sense. What do we expect of men? To be strong to be unemotional… and so we go right from that to form! Shape! Color! Line!” She referred to a New York Times article written earlier this year about the sculptor Richard Serra, in which he described his latest exhibition as his “heaviest show ever.”
“I mean, can you imagine talking about art in terms of how much it weighs?” Chicago asked.
She argued that prioritizing form over the content of art creates an inherent bias in traditional university art classes — subject matter can be disregarded in critiques. In New Mexico in the 1990s, a male friend of Chicago’s, a professor, approached her about meeting with a young woman whose work he felt unequipped to critique. Chicago visited the student. She saw eviscerated torsos hanging up in the studio. Having encountered plenty of work that dealt with sexual violence before, Chicago asked, “Who molested you?”
The young woman burst into tears, Chicago recalls, and replied that when she had showed the work to her professors, they had discussed whether it might be better to hang the torsos from an I-beam. They ignored the subject matter. They also did not address, Chicago adds, “the fact that she was having a lot of difficulty creating a sufficient aesthetic distance from the subject matter to actually make art."
Men’s art, Chicago said, also receives special attention under the lens of academic study. “There's a huge amount of unknown work by women that is worthy of study, conservation, archiving, preserving and would be a contribution to the future, instead of writing another goddamn Ph.D. on Jeff Koons.”
The institutional commitment to archiving Chicago’s work is rare for women artists, especially the portal’s cross-institutional coalition, which she called “a feminist intervention… collaboration at an institutional level to make sure that my archives will be preserved.”
It’s built to last. “Harvard is never going out of business,” Chicago noted. Instead of her work’s longevity relying on the political commitments of individuals — who might change jobs, shift priorities, or retire — the portal has its roots in a network of collections, each accountable to the others. It can’t slip away.
Chicago said that although she tends to operate outside of institutions, she is naturally concerned with them because it is through institutions that art history is formed and culture passed on. There’s a difference between who gets to make art and who is included in the arc of art history, and for her, it is critical the two not be conflated. Even an abundance of exhibitions by women doesn’t ensure what Chicago calls “the permanent overcoming of erasure.”
“Young women artists have been operating on the idea that everything has changed,” she warned me over the phone, citing a study released last month by Artnet on the works acquired by major U.S. museums over the past decade. It found that only 11 percent of works were made by women, and only 3.3 percent of those women were African American. “That means that the changes are cosmetic, not institutional,” Chicago said. In forming art history,she believes that museum acquisitions, permanent collections, auction records, and monographs are more important than exhibitions.
The painter Christina Schlesinger, who moderated the portal launch, explained that in rotating exhibitions, the work has often not been purchased by the institution. “It’s not going to change the institutional commitment to women artists, or artists of color,” she said.
“That is something people really are going to have to begin to understand if there’s going to be change,” Chicago responded to Schlesinger. “It can look like change, smell like change, seem like change — and not be.”
At the question and answer period following Chicago’s talk, several women lined up to tell her about the bodies of artwork dwelling impatiently in their basements, made by their mothers and grandmothers, women they described as prolific and special artists in their own time. They asked for advice on how to share these womens’ artistic contributions with the world. Chicago was sympathetic but candid about how little she could do for them. She told one woman apologetically, “It has been all I can manage to take care of my own work.”

We’re stuck behind a cluster of middle-aged women clad in black tulle and felt witch hats. It’s early on a Friday evening in Salem, Mass., and after unsuccessfully trying to locate the Psychic Fair and Witch’s Market, which we traveled 26.2 miles to visit, we decide it’s a safe bet to follow the gaggle of witches. Sure enough, they lead us onto Essex Street, which is lined with vendors selling everything from dracula teeth to incense to beetles preserved in amber pendants.
Among the vendors are street performers dressed as every imaginable Halloween villain: a Frankenstein poses for a picture with his hands around two tourists’ necks, a green-faced warlock needles a passerby. “What? Are you scared?” he teases.
Almost all of the businesses we pass repackage Salem’s dark history of witch trials into cute, kitschy attractions. There’s a haunted house and a Museum of Monsters, both crowded with hordes of eager patrons. Multiple stores pack their shelves with decks of tarot cards, enchanted candles, and healing crystals. Many of the street vendors hawking face paint and henna tattoos have shown up expressly for the spookiest month of the year, though permanent establishments like Witch City Ink offer tourists a more permanent memento of their time in Salem year-round.
The energy of those working at the festival is matched by its patrons. There is no shortage of graphic tees emblazoned with witch-related puns — both draped across mannequins and sported by attendees. A bright-green souvenir shop offers “I Got Stoned in Salem” and “I Practice Bitch-craft” shirts. We spot one attendee wearing an orange tee boasting that she is, in fact, “100% THAT WITCH.” Some visitors even don full-blown costumes, including colorful wigs and dramatic stage makeup; the only thing distinguishing them from the street performers is the lack of a tip jar.
We approach three silver-haired witches, each wielding a broomstick, midway through posing for a photo next to a little girl. The photographer who accompanies the witches introduces the group as “Priscilla and the Girls.” The witches explain that they volunteer with other street performers, collecting tips to donate to local charities. “We engage the crowds: the tourists, especially the children — and we put some spells on some people we do not like,” Priscilla jokes. She points across the street and shivers: “Jason’s over there,” she says, referring to a performer dressed as the killer from “Friday the 13th.”
“I hate that mask. He scares me a little bit... and I’m a witch!” Luckily, there’s a supernatural solution for such a human response: “I could probably make him disappear!”
Throughout our conversation, the witches slip in and out of character. Priscilla shares that, during the rest of the year, she works as a minister; she’s going to Punta Cana to marry a couple in February.
The other essential player in this season’s festivities is the Psychic Fair. Housed in Witch City Mall, professional psychics give readings from curtained booths surrounded by spellbooks and charms. Their services are in such high demand that additional tables have been set up in the space between a New York Deli and a costume shop.
Visitors fish crumpled bills from their purses, happily parting with $40 for a fifteen minute glimpse into their future. We were skeptical that we could discern our entire futures in the middle of a shopping mall, but in the name of journalistic integrity, we found ourselves separated from one another and seated in folding chairs for our respective palm and tarot readings.
First up: me, Roey. I approach a palm-reader, a middle aged man in a plaid newsboy cap. He prefaces the reading with a reminder that the future is not set in stone, reassuring me that “you have more magic than any of us, because you have free will.” He proceeds to give the lines in my hands glowing reviews. He’s especially impressed by my heart line, which ends in the “holy grail” between index finger and middle finger, indicating a balance of idealism and narcissism. This clue, combined with what he dubs the steadiness of my life line, leads him to the mystical conclusion that, “you got your shit together, kid.” I’m too flattered to tell him that the inaccuracy of his prediction will surely make me a skeptic for life.
When I, Nicole, sit down for my tarot card reading, the psychic asks me to shuffle the deck of cards to infuse it with my energy. The psychic spreads out the shuffled cards in front of me, and I choose three. She places them between us, face down, and explains their significance: the first card provides insight into my last nine months, the second my ‘now,’ and the third, my next nine months. In our fifteen minutes together, she flips over each card one at a time, revealing first “The Lovers,” then “The King of Air,” and then “The King of Earth.” The descriptions she gives of my love life are eerily accurate.
We reconvene after our brush with the supernatural, feeling, if not wiser, then at least satisfied that we’ve partaken in the full Salem experience. As we head back to the train station, we share an affectionate smile at the sight of an older witch smoking a cigarette and dancing a jig with a warlock. Then, an email from our editor notifies us that we may not be reimbursed for our $40 fortunes, leaving us to wonder if Priscilla and the Girls put a curse on us.

Scientific research from Harvard’s Healthier Building Materials Academy is being used to reduce chemical presence in the building formerly known as Andover Hall, according to a blog post from the Divinity School Director of Operations Ralph DeFlorio.
The century-old building, now called Swartz Hall, is currently being renovated with an expected completion date in 2021.
The HBMA is a partnership between Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, public health, medical, and engineering faculty. Soliciting HMBA’s expertise was meant to ensure that renewed space is developed in a way that is sustainable and healthy for the school community, according to the same blog post.
“The Divinity School has long had a strong tie with the environment. Going back a number of years, we have had seminars about the physical environment and how that relates to spirituality,” DeFlorio said in an interview last week.
The renovations to Swartz Hall are projected to surpass baseline environmental standards set by the Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. The improvements will reduce energy consumption by 18 percent, indoor water use by 35 percent, and outdoor water use by 50 percent, according to DeFlorio.
DeFlorio also emphasized the school’s commitment to using healthy materials in order to create a more sustainable building. He noted the Divinity School’s efforts to find materials that meet accepted environmental standards.
“Something that has really emerged in the last few years has to do with healthy materials,” he said. “We’re taking a lot of the research that has been done.”
“If something is not healthy, we are moving on until we find a product that is,” he added.
Swartz Hall’s renaming came after a $25 million donation from James and Susan Swartz to the Divinity School, which amounted to the largest donation in the Divinity School’s history. James Swartz is the co-founder of the global venture capital firm Accel.
Amirah Fadhlina, a student at the Divinity School, said she is unsure whether the renovations will maintain the building’s historic character.
“I personally love the classic old characteristic of Andover, the building,” she said. “Now that it’s under construction, I kinda feel all over the place and I’m not sure how I’m gonna feel about it being modernized.”
DeFlorio said that the Divinity School tried to incorporate Harvard’s values into the renovations.
“What we’ve done in the area of sustainable design is very much in alignment with the values of the school,” he said.

The ongoing study of Harvard's Athletics Department will largely examine the department’s culture, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said in an interview Friday.
The review, first announced last month by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Claudine Gay, is being conducted by outside consulting firm Mercer. Scalise and other top administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana are on the advisory committee overseeing the study, which will also include input from students and staff.
Harvard is pursuing the study this year in light of the “rapidly approaching” centennial anniversary of the first Athletics director being named, which will take place in 2026, according to a joint interview between Scalise and Gay published in the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
Gay has previously denied that the study stems from the controversy surrounding former fencing head coach Peter Brand, who sold his home to the family of a prospective student. Scalise said Friday that Gay told coaches that the review is unrelated to the scandals.
Scalise also said the main topic of the study will be athletics culture, which can be positive or negative.
“With respect to the culture, there are some very powerful, positive things that get created when people work together to try to accomplish a common goal. There's a bonding that takes place,” Scalise said. “Sometimes, that can go a little bit sideways and there can be some negative elements.”
“What makes it go right?” Scalise asked. “What do we do if things are not on track?”
The review will work to determine how the Athletics Department can ensure its culture does not mirror athletics culture as it is depicted in pop culture, he said.
“The pop culture in our society has depicted — I'll call it frat boy, you know, jock behavior,” Scalise said. “We're trying to not have that here.”
Scalise said the study will also address both the structure of the Athletics Department and the “student-athlete experience.” Specifically, the review will examine the way varsity athletes navigate the dual identities of a student at a top-ranked university and a Division I athlete.
“What do we do that makes being a top-notch scholar and a top-notch athlete — what do we do that makes it hard to do both things?” Scalise said. “Because we believe that doing both is not mutually exclusive.”
The review will also look at how to increase interaction between athletes and other College students so that they can learn from each other.
“The beauty of Harvard is that we bring in people with all different backgrounds. There isn't just one size fits all that gets people into Harvard,” Scalise said. “What we need to do down the road is all to learn how to work together, to respect our differences, but then respect one another and work together to solve problems that are bigger than any one group or one of us can solve.”
Though Scalise will step down from his position on June 30, a decision he announced earlier this month, he will continue to advise Gay on the study.

California Institute of Technology professor Sean M. Carroll discussed recent advances and unsolved questions in the field of quantum mechanics, addressing a packed lecture hall Wednesday evening.
Harvard philosophy professor Edward J. Hall introduced Carroll, who researches theoretical physics. Carroll gave his talk as part of a promotion for his new book, “Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime.”
In his introduction, Hall highlighted Carroll’s ability to communicate his work to a general audience.
“I think his brilliance as an expositor comes not just from the fact that he knows the physics cold, and not just from the fact that he’s quite skilled in the use of thought experiments to draw out the implications of the physics, but from a motivation that he brings to the study of physics,” Hall said.
Carroll began his remarks by citing a lack of understanding of quantum mechanics among the general population, and a lack of motivation among physicists to understand quantum mechanics at a higher level.
“Professional physicists use quantum mechanics, as it’s the center of all of modern physics,” Carroll said. “And yet, they haven’t done all the work, not only to explain it to the rest of the world, but to even understand it in its own right.”
Carroll also discussed specific and current technical issues in modern quantum mechanics. He said there are many questions associated with the Schrödinger equation — a mathematical formula thought to govern most of the field of quantum mechanics — that remain unsolved.
“There are, these days, perfectly good answers to all these questions,” Carroll said. “Sadly, there is more than one set of perfectly good answers to these questions, and we don’t know which is right.”
Carroll concluded the talk by discussing the “many worlds hypothesis,” the idea that multiple worlds exist concurrently. The hypothesis is one of several concepts Carroll explores in his book, which is aimed at explaining physics to readers without a scientific background.
“The world is not duplicating, like in a Xerox machine, it’s being subdivided. It’s being differentiated,” he said. “But the width, weight, or the thickness of the universe is conserved over time.”
“I hope, if nothing else, this talk has lowered your amount of incomprehension when it comes to quantum mechanics,” he added.
After the lecture, several attendees noted Carroll’s ability to communicate complex ideas straightforwardly.
“He made it quite simple, easier to grasp, and that was his specialty,” Prabidhik Kc ’23 said. “I really liked it, and then some topics I really wanted to understand, I got to learn about today.”
Artist and Massachusetts College of Art and Design professor Barbara Bosworth also praised Carroll’s ability to synthesize information.
“I think it’s important to learn and talk about all sorts of things about the universe,” Bosworth said. “Sean is just someone who’s able to put that in a really understandable format.”
Albert X. Zhu ’23 said he admired Carroll’s efforts to further understand the intricacies of quantum mechanics.
“Even though — as Professor Carroll said — it’s probably almost impossible to understand it completely, it’s in our best interest to figure out as much as we can to understand the fundamentals of how our world operates,” Zhu said.

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 has collected more than $2.7 million serving on the board of directors for two pharmaceutical companies since being appointed as the University’s chief academic officer in 2011, according to company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Exelixis, Inc. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals confirmed that they paid Garber in cash, stocks, and options, which they indicated are normal compensation for board members. They wrote in emailed statements that Garber did not provide any additional services to the firms beyond his board duties.
Garber acknowledged the payments through University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and reiterated that the payments were limited to his board obligations.
Garber joined Exelixis’s board of directors in January 2005, when he was a professor at Stanford, according to the filings. He has earned a total of $2,346,579 for services on Exelixis’s board over his time with the company, with $1,602,132 of that coming since he moved to Harvard. Exelixis, which is based in Alameda, Calif., primarily develops kidney, liver, and thyroid cancer treatment medicines, according to its website.
He joined the board of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a Boston-based company that develops cystic fibrosis drugs, in June 2017. Vertex paid Garber a total of $1,189,085 between 2017 and 2018, according to the SEC filings. Data for 2019 is not yet available.
Exelixis Executive Vice President for Public Affairs and Investor Relations Susan T. Hubbard wrote in an email that Garber has never received compensation beyond his services as a board member. In addition to monetary compensation, Garber also received compensation for travel and expenses related to attending board meetings.
“As part of his overall compensation, he, like our other board members, have been granted equity in the form of stock options over the years, which is common practice for companies,” Hubbard wrote.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals spokesperson Heather Nichols wrote in an email that Garber receives quarterly cash payments for his board work from the company, as well as stock and option awards.
“Dr. Garber’s payments are the lowest on our board currently,” Nichols wrote.
Garber, who is a licensed physician, also serves as a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.
Swain wrote that Garber annually files conflict of interest forms with the Office of General Counsel that acknowledge his service on both companies’ boards.
The University requires its senior officers — including the Provost — to note conflicts that could “compromise or appear to compromise” Harvard’s academic values or business decisions, according to the policy. Such conflicts have the potential to “discredit Harvard’s good name and reputation,” the policy notes.
Any potential conflicts are adjudicated by the Office of General Counsel, in consultation with Secretary to the Harvard Corporation Marc L. Goodheart ’81.
Allen A. Nasseh, a part-time lecturer in Restorative Dentistry and Biomaterials Sciences at Harvard’s School of Dental Medicine, wrote in an email that he also files conflict of interest forms with Harvard to disclose payments he receives from a medical device company.
“It’s actually a very nice and detailed document that aims to discover any conflict of interest in our faculty or staff doing research and making sure outside financial bias is disclosed,” Nasseh wrote.
Nasseh added that he usually receives an email requesting that he fill out the form at the beginning of each academic year. Payments from industry are then discussed regularly on speciality forums and are public knowledge on government databases.
“People in my field are well aware of it,” he wrote.
Payments from pharmaceutical companies to physicians must be reported to the federal government under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which went into effect in 2013.
Garber came to Harvard in 2011 after 25 years on Stanford’s faculty, where his work focused primarily on health policy economics. He has been re-elected to the Exelixis board every three years since 2005, with his current term set to expire in 2022. His first term on the Vertex Pharmaceuticals board will expire in 2020.
At its annual meeting in June 2017, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals board recommended to voting stockholders that they elect Garber to the board for his “extensive leadership experience and knowledge,” according to SEC filings.
“The insights he has developed as an expert in health care policy and as an advisor to government agencies will provide our board important perspectives on the issues facing our company,” they wrote.

Hundreds of students, faculty, and alumni filled the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum to listen to panelists discuss the transition from traditional to modern American conservatism at an event hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on Wednesday evening.
The panel consisted of a variety of conservative figures including Kennedy School Professor Arthur C. Brooks, former senator and IOP Fall 2019 Resident Fellow Jeff L. Flake (R-Arizona), and political commentator George F. Will. CNN political commentator and IOP Fall 2019 Resident Fellow Alice M. Stewart moderated the panel.
The panelists opened the discussion by defining conservatism in their own words. Will began by outlining the government’s role in protecting natural rights as well as stating the importance of maintaining a separation of powers within the federal system.
Brooks expanded on the importance of protecting natural rights and said he believes opportunity stems from American conservatism.
“What attracted me to American conservatism was two basic concepts: one is the belief that there's a radical equality of human dignity, and that there's a limitlessness of human potential,” Brooks said.
Will said that these are the basic principles that have traditionally influenced conservative domestic and foreign policy.
Flake said that President Donald Trump’s recent foreign policy move to withdraw remaining U.S. troops from Syria reflected poorly on traditional conservatism. Flake reiterated that he did not support Trump when he ran for office in 2016 because he believes that Trump does not embody traditional Republican ideology.
“I'm glad that there has been the pushback ... perhaps I just wish that the President had listened to it beforehand,” Will said.
Stewart then asked the panelists to discuss modern conservatism and how it relates to populism.
Brooks said that populism can be found across ideologies and that he believes today’s rise in populism can be attributed to the most recent financial crises.
Flake said the rise of populism could be dangerous for the Republican party because of changing demographics. He cited Arizona’s recent election of a Democratic senator — the first Democrat to be elected to this office in 30 years — as an example of this change.
“I think the conservative message plays well for immigrants and every American, but you've got to get in the door,” Flake said. “The problem is politics today, for Republicans, the harsh tone and rhetoric and language used doesn't allow conservatives or Republicans to actually get that message.”
Before the event transitioned to a question and answer session with the audience, Stewart asked the panelists what advice they would give to young conservatives who are navigating today’s political environment. Brooks said people must distinguish between political theory and party politics.
“What I would recommend to young conservatives is the same thing that I would recommend to young progressives, which is to stay close to first philosophical principles and not core party principles.”
Attendee Benjamin A. Landau '23 shared his thoughts on the panel at the discussion’s conclusion. Landau — who said he is unsure of his political identity — said that one of his primary motivations for attending the forum was his interest in the development of American politics in recent years. He cited a lack of conservative discourse as another reason to why he wanted to listen to the speakers.
“I think on this college campus and on most college campuses you don’t really hear conservative points of view, and [the panelists] having this opportunity is great to just get them in the spotlight,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College officially institutionalized the pre-orientation program First-Year Retreat and Experience, which aims to orient under-resourced incoming students to life at the University, FYRE leadership announced Tuesday.
FYRE was first piloted as a pre-orientation program for the Class of 2022 after being introduced at a College town hall in spring 2018. The program features activities like “FYRE Family Time” and an opening dinner in Widener Library during which students receive personalized books from Harvard faculty and alumni. The program garnered praise from its inaugural class of participants.
“We’re incredibly thankful to all the students, alumni, and administrators who tirelessly vouched for the necessity of a pre-orientation program specifically designed for our community,” FYRE Co-Chairs Alyssa J. Britton ’21 and Lisette Leon ’21 wrote in an email sent over the FYRE listserv.
Britton and Leon declined to comment for this story.
One of the changes that comes with FYRE’s official institutionalization is a permanent source of funding.
“Previously, the money for FYRE had been coming out of the College dean’s special accounts, essentially,” said James A. Bedford ’20, a co-founder and former FYRE co-chair. “But now, it’s fully institutionalized and will be part of Harvard’s permanent budget as dictated by the Corporation.”
Bedford said that during its two pilot years, FYRE’s status was “not very much guaranteed at all.”
“We were really on tenterhooks for the first year to see whether it would be approved for the second, and then in our second year, to see if it was going to be successful enough,” Bedford said.
Because FYRE is designed and led by students, the program faced distrust from administrators in its early days, according to Bedford. Though FYRE steering committee leaders lobbied for institutionalization from the start, the decision to permanently fund the program was ultimately in the hands of administrators.
Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Acting Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alexander R. Miller wrote in an emailed statement that the College is “delighted” to offer FYRE as a permanent pre-orientation program.
“The First Year Retreat and Experience (FYRE) is one of many programs that offer new students at Harvard College a chance to engage with their peers, begin to build community, and strengthen the skills they will utilize during their time here at Harvard,” Miller wrote.
Though he is “thrilled” that the pre-orientation program he co-founded has now been institutionalized, Bedford also said he looks forward to expanding the program. He said he believes that some of the program’s greatest limitations are that it is restricted to a three-day program, lacks the funding to run in-semester programming, and can currently accept only about 100 incoming freshmen per year.
“I’m proud that the administration has made this one of its major commitments on diversity and inclusion over the last 10 years,” Bedford said. “I hope that administrative decisions will continue to push for more programs and larger programs like this.”

Two researchers discussed the potential for innovations in the use of artificial intelligence and digital phenotyping to advance social justice causes at a Harvard Law School panel Wednesday.
The panel, titled “Computational Justice,” was the latest installment of the Project on Law and Applied Neuroscience, an event series by the Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.
The goal of the panel was to help legal professionals “improve their paved route to justice” by using neuroscience technology to tailor approaches to individual cases, according to moderator Francis X. Shen, the executive director of the Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior.
Panelist Rediet Abebe ’13, a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Cornell and Junior Fellow at Harvard, discussed how she uses machine learning to study the way poverty, disease, inequality, and other factors impact underrepresented groups like pregnant women.
“A lot of the data is very hard to come by,” Abebe said. “It’s not collected in a sort of systematic manner, it’s not comprehensive, you cannot regularly sort of rely on it.”
“And what this does is it basically makes it very challenging to identify sort of gaps in our policies in terms of existing communities and also where there might be interest that we haven’t thought about,” she added.
Later in the event, Harvard Medical School assistant professor Justin T. Baker discussed his research on psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, explaining how he designs technological systems tailored to people’s specific behaviors and needs.
In one experiment, Baker used geospatial recording to track the locations of a patient with bipolar disorder for more than two years, monitoring when the patient ended up in the hospital and the patterns of behaviors they exhibited beforehand.
Audience member Lauren M. Chambers questioned that kind of surveillance in the discussion section of the talk. Chambers, who serves as a technology fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, referred to a hearing she attended at the Massachusetts State House to introduce a bill that would set a moratorium on the use of facial surveillance technology by the government.
“Some of the concerns that we have about facial recognition are that, as much as we might want to bring this objective algorithm into our systems to reduce human bias in decision-making processes, the technology is not up to those standards,” Chambers said. “How are you making sure that the things you’re measuring for these kinds of processes are free from different sorts of biases?”
Baker explained in response that researchers developing new systems for tracking and treating mental illness should strive to consider data sets “within a particular cultural context.”
“Part of the rationale for developing objective measures is to develop things that would be at least applicable across cultures,” Baker said.
He added that his tracking methods focus not on broad diagnoses, but on individual patients’ behavior and how it changes over time.
“In mental health especially, diagnosis may be of marginal value,” Baker said. “It’s really about detecting what someone’s state is, and then detecting how the state changes over time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are finally there. That familiar feeling has finally emerged from its slumber, exciting fans once again. This week marks the return of two separate yet important things that have recently been missing from my life: Emperor Palpatine to the Star Wars universe, and exclusive Ivy League conference games to college football.
I know what you’re all thinking: which one is more important? It’s tough to say. On one hand, both have already been back in theory. The Emperor made an audio appearance in previous trailers for the new Star Wars film, and Ivy League conference play has been going on for weeks. This week, however, offers two important caveats. In the cinematic world, Palpatine finally played a central role in the trailer, with the signature voice of Ian McDiarmid finally accompanied by what seemed to be the outline of his classic hooded figure. For many football fans, this commercial offered the most exciting event from this week’s abysmal Monday Night Football game. In the same vein (kind of), Ancient Eight football is finally completely central as well; no Ivy League team will play anymore non-conference games for the rest of the season. From this point forward, all of the games count for the conference standings and the race for the title.
Since we only saw an outline of a hood, I have no choice but to focus this article on football instead of a galaxy far, far away. I now only have four games to break down, so I’ll need to be accurate to keep my clearly impressive 22-4 record on weekly picks ahead of the curve.
COLUMBIA VS. DARTMOUTH
This past weekend, Columbia’s president allowed the band to return to action, but only from the stands. Snubbed at the last second, the band was told that they were not allowed to do their field performance at the half and must remain in the stands at all times. While the band was annoyed, maybe this wasn’t the worst idea in the world after all. The Lions slapped Penn around the field for a 44-6 beatdown at home this weekend, tallying their highest offensive and lowest defensive point totals on the season for their first league win.
While I admire the bravery of Columbia’s administration, it’s doubtful that any actions relating to the band will change the outcome of this game. Dartmouth has scored over 42 points in back-to-back weeks with dominating offensive performances, and the Big Green Defensive MachineTM has not given up more than 15 points this season, averaging a miniscule 8 points allowed per game at the halfway mark. The Lions can move their band into the stands, in the press box, even on the moon, and it likely would not be enough this week.
Dartmouth by 14.
PENNSYLVANIA VS. YALE
Pennsylvania is the only team to score more than 10 points on the previously described Big Green Defensive MachineTM, however, the Quakers’ poor performance against Columbia somehow saved the Eagles from having the worst weekend effort from a football team based in Philly. I would feel bad picking on the Eagles week after week, but I just can’t help myself. I’m sorry, but the Eagles just can’t stop doing totally Eagles things in the most Eagles ways possible. Right now, it seems the bug is being passed around the city. While Yale has emulated the Eagles’ model in its underwhelming first half after being tabbed league favorites, the Bulldogs are lucky to be far away from the City of Brotherly Love at the moment.
Yale by 3.
BROWN VS. CORNELL
I caught a lot of flack last week for picking Princeton over Brown by 63 points. Firstly, the rough draft of my column originally had the Tigers by 100 points. Secondly, I wasn’t that far off, Princeton just stopped playing defense once the game was won. Through two games, Brown’s average Ancient Eight game score is 54-18.
Last time around, my only missed pick that denied me the elusive undefeated week came by picking Cornell, who fell to the previously winless Colgate. I seemed so sure that a team with no wins could not possibly prevail. As these two squads battle it out in what I can only assume is the deep snow in Ithaca this weekend, one of them will leave the field with its first Ivy League win, while the other will leave with hypothermia. You can never be sure of anything in football, but you can be pretty sure that it will not be Brown.

HARVARD VS. PRINCETON
Yes, I originally picked Princeton by 100 last week partially because Brown’s team is a whole different type of historic awful, but I also added to the spread because the Tigers have a pretty good football team. Princeton is now ranked 13 in the country, but the juggernaut has shown weaknesses. Any defense that allows 22 points to Brown clearly has some sort of deficiency, and the high-powered offense, while still first in the Ivy League, has not been perfect, being held to 21 points against an inconsistent Columbia team.
While Dartmouth has clearly excelled, Harvard has also put together an impressive mid-season resume on paper. The Crimson offense trails only Princeton in points scored per game, and the defense has a penchant for rushing the passer and causing turnovers, keys to slowing down the Tigers’ vicious offensive attack.
Am I nitpicking? A little. But there’s definitely a strong chance this year that Princeton’s winning streak dating back to 2017 will not survive to the 2020 season. The upset could happen any week, now that the Tigers have already played Brown. But this is still a real good football team.

This weekend, the Harvard women’s rugby team (5-1) will host the Ivy League Championship. The Crimson has won its last four games, including a shutout of Notre Dame College, 105-0, and a dominant win over Ivy League rival Dartmouth, 50-32.
“It was super exciting for us to win against Dartmouth the first time we saw them,” said senior Emily Prentice. “It was such a fun, fast-paced, intense game. They’re a really good team so it was great to show everyone the feel of a competitive game.”
Last season, Harvard won the Ivy League Championship, defeating Dartmouth 12-3. But the team fell shortly after to Dartmouth in the NIRA championship, 19-14, further solidifying the intense rivalry between the two Ivy League competitors.
“The past few years we’ve always had a tough rivalry, so the win against Dartmouth this season shows that we can beat them,” said senior Robyn Beese. “Especially the fact that we beat them the first time we saw them gives us a lot of confidence for when we see them this weekend.”
The team’s only loss was its second game of the season on the road against Army West Point (5-1). The Crimson is looking to turn this loss into a teachable moment and learn from the errors made in this matchup.
“We had a really tough game against Army,” recounted Beese. “But I think ever since that loss, we have identified a lot of key areas to improve, so that if and when we see them again, we are able to give them a more even match. I think it will go really well.”
In terms of rugby-specific skills, the team has been focusing on improving its kicking strategy and defensive intensity. But, the team’s biggest challenge will be maintaining mental toughness throughout the postseason.
“I believe that we have the skills to win an Ivy Championship and even the National Championship, but the hardest part for us is the mental game,” said Beese. “However, I think that if we come out on the same page and do what we need to do, we can play some really strong rugby and be super successful.”
Harvard has been focused on working as a cohesive unit. The Crimson’s roster is incredibly deep, which means a lot of players see the field and the lineup is constantly changing throughout games.
“The depth of our roster has been a huge advantage,” said Prentice. “It is really exciting that we have so many players that can come onto the field and our level of play doesn’t drop.”
The team’s level of play has remained elite and competitive from last season, even though Harvard graduated eight important seniors last year. The fact that the team has seen this continued success is fairly remarkable and acknowledges the skills of the talented eight, new freshmen on the roster.
“We have a really large and talented freshman class this year,” said Prentice. “One of our main goals this year was just integrating them into the team and getting everyone on the same page going forward.”
Heading into a difficult and intense postseason, the team looks to maintain this integration and team cohesion. Harvard hopes to experience a strong home field advantage in which many fans come out to support one of the world’s fastest growing sports for women.
“This is the first time ever we’ve hosted both the Ivies and the National Championship,” said Beese. “It is an awesome opportunity, especially in my senior year, so I’m really looking forward to being able to play our biggest championship games at home.”
Harvard will attempt to win Ivies for the second year in a row this Saturday, Oct. 26, and will look to improve from last year’s Bronze in the NIRA Championship the following month on Nov. 17.

Cuffing season is upon us, but that doesn’t mean empty wallet season needs to be. Want to impress but don’t have the money to flex? Want to grab a meal but Tatte coffee just doesn’t work into your budget? Read on for some ways to make your date feel like a million bucks without actually having to spend a dime.
Find Love on the Courts
The first step to court-ing someone is to show off your athletic prowess. Pick up some rackets and head across the river to hit some balls. It doesn’t take a genius to de-deuces that you’ll both hit it off (without your bank account having to take a hit). Pro tip: Play tennis at Joan Lorentz Park where you’ll find bounding dogs and kids playing for some authentic off-campus wholesome vibes.
It’s All in the Stars 
Take an astronomy class to get that Science Center Observatory swipe access. With a blanket and the right playlist, we promise you’ll have them starry-eyed. If you have any astrology knowledge, you can use it to convince them that you’re astrologically compatible.
Show Them You Got Game 
Have a foosball/pool/ping pong tournament in one of the recreational areas in the houses! Take this as a cue to show off your fun and competitive side (even if you’re not currently not looking very competitive in the job market).
Improvise
Promised to bring them to a show but a quick peek at your bank account reveals insufficient funds? Improvise by taking them to a Harvard improv show! With their rapid on-the-fly jokes, the improv groups will have you looking fly rather than like a joke.
Fine Dhall Dining
Really want to spend your meals staring into their eyes but can’t stomach the bills? Propose a dhall marathon challenge: You want to try every dhall with them even if you’ve both individually been to all of them before. Really desperate? Expand the challenge to breakfast in every dhall and lunch in every dhall⁠ — the options are endless.
These options make a lot of sense because they don’t cost you any cents, but if all else fails, woo them with a romantic ballad (or perhaps a Shakespearean sonnet if singing isn’t your strong suit).
