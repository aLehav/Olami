BATA, Equatorial Guinea — It is a favorite pastime for every adult man I encounter to chastise me about finding Equatorial Guinean girls to help make my time here more “justified,” as they say. (Literally, “Hay que buscar una mujer guineana para justificar su viaje.”) While these comments can be laughed off casually the first four or five hundred times, after a while it really gets obnoxious. These incessant “jokes” reflect a culture towards women here that is far from desirable, at least from my Western perspective. 
It literally follows me everywhere. My contacts all offer me their sisters, nieces, friends, anyone they know, in a playful but actually serious manner, and casual encounters seem to be all the rage. I even get it with strangers: In a taxi yesterday, I was sitting in the front seat as we stopped to pick up a crowd of people. The driver made sure that a young female took the seat next to me (read: on top of me) and asked “¿Buena chica, no?” nodding his head furiously. He tells me I should take her home with me and that she’s a very beautiful girl (and she was). Talk about awkward. So I throw out my now-usual excuse: “Ah, amigo, lo siento, pero ya tengo una novia,” (I’m sorry but I have a girlfriend.) It works this time; he asks me if my girlfriend is black or white and I say white, an American girl. To which he responds, “Ah, eres Americano. ¡Obama!” 
The “I-have-a-girlfriend-back-home” excuse can sometimes backfire, as happened in Kogo in the south of the country last weekend. Suffering the usual barrage of offers and cat-calling to nearby females, I confidently apologized with my “already-taken” status. The men I was with simply replied, “So what?” I went on to explain that in America, it is not considered appropriate to cheat on one’s significant other (explaining the concept of “cheating” is another long story). This did not faze them: “But you are in Guinea Ecuatorial, not America.” 
A man I know here told me the following story, which he was very proud of: 
He was coming home from an evening drinking with friends, and got into a taxi that already had a pretty young woman in the backseat on the way to her destination. He got to his stop, paid the driver, and turned around and asked the stranger “Do you want to make love to me?” (That’s the tamest way I can put the translation.) The girl thought for a moment, and then shook her head as if it did not matter either way, then got out of the taxi and went off with him. He said that they spent a passionate night together and that he was very lucky because this woman had a very, very nice house (electricity and running water) and a comfortable bed to sleep in. The next morning, he paid her 12,000CFA as a gesture of thanks. Did I mention that this man is married and has four children? And that said wife knows very well of these exploits? 
As an American raised in the post-feminist world of women running for president and a generalized ideal of social gender equality (more or less), this story sounded ridiculous to me. And ready for the icing on the cake? This man did not even bother to use a condom. So, that was it. An unprotected sexual encounter between two strangers in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of the mere fate of taking the same taxi. And this man was proud of the night he was privileged to spend in better accommodations than his own. I did not know how to react appropriately, given his obvious pride and my obvious shock and concern. 
Naturally, America is nowhere near perfect when it comes to gender equality and any sort of idealized notion of fidelity. But regardless of whether or not it is followed, everyone in the U.S. generally accepts that it is “wrong” to be unfaithful to one’s significant other. In E.G. this is not the case. 
Basically, the male population here loves the beauty of women. All women. And that is to be commended. Sure, using women merely as objects or a means to an end of satisfaction is deplorable, but if the men here truly appreciate the importance of the experience in its fleeting magnitude, I don’t think I can blame them, given their circumstances. I do not know the true feelings of the women on the receiving end (and whether or not they have the luxury of sleeping with whomever they deem worthy, just like the men). But if they do, it is hard to argue for a rigid moral code of fidelity in this fourth-world context (and especially given our own cultural shortcomings in this arena—I’m talking to you, Governor Sanford!).  
Looking back on what I’ve written, I hope that I do not come across as defending male chauvinism. It is certainly not my dream to find an attractive girl in a taxi, take her home, and pay her $24 the next morning. But in a world where tomorrow could mean jail time for your mere thoughts, spending a night with a beautiful woman is hard to criticize.

KING’ORI, Tanzania — Before my arrival in Tanzania, I had a lot of preconceived notions about what Africa was going to be like. I thought it would all be savanna and that it would always be unbearably hot. I thought that I would see poverty at every turn, and that nobody would speak English. I thought I would stick out like a sore thumb because of the color of my skin—and on that count, at least, I was right.
But since I've been here, I've realized that there are many, many different sides of Africa. There's the barely-controlled chaos of
Arusha, where every taxi ride is a gamble for your life and flycatchers are waiting at every corner to follow unsuspecting tourists around, trying to sell them overpriced trinkets. In Arusha, you quickly learn that you will be overcharged for everything because you are a mzungu (a white person), and your bargaining skills sharpen quickly.
Then there are tourist attractions like safari and Zanzibar, where you can go for days without seeing any semblance of actual African life. Everyone speaks English, nearly everyone is white, and everything is catered to your needs. On trips to these places, where
I've been fortunate enough to travel on our long weekends, I have witnessed incredible things: baby elephants just outside our safari truck, lions resting with their morning kill, white sand beaches, and the sun setting over the Indian Ocean. But when I think of the thousands of tourists who come to Tanzania and see nothing but the Serengeti, Zanzibar, and the inside of an airport, I'm sad for them. They are missing out on what, to me, is the real Africa. 
To me, Tanzania will always be the six weeks I've spent living in King'ori village, home to 4,500 people halfway between Arusha and Moshi (ie, the dusty middle of nowhere). Village life is nothing like I expected: Poverty doesn't define it, and you don't see the disease and famine that you hear about on the news. It's here that I've experienced the generosity of the African family—how they will continue to feed you long after you're full, and how they will take in anybody, no matter how distantly related, if they need a place to stay or a meal. I've learned which "hotel" sells the best chapati-and-beans lunch, and made friends with a shopkeeper who now invites me in for chai. I've spent hours teaching in the primary schools, laughing as our students yell "semen" in Swahili at the top of their lungs while we teach about HIV transmission. I've walked around town wearing a paper hat and cape, spitting memorized Swahili phrases through a megaphone to encourage people to get tested for HIV, I’ve tried to barter with women selling maize at the market, telling them in my broken Swahili that I'll mind their stands while they go get tested.
Whenever I return to the village after a weekend off, it's like coming home. I see the same people on my walk back every day, and am greeted by my students in the marketplace. When another mzungu shows up in the village, I get protective of my turf. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to experience all the parts of Tanzania—the bustle of Arusha, the beaches of Zanzibar, the savanna of Ngorongoro. But it's the walk home to my house in the village after a long day of teaching, with sunflowers on my right and Kilimanjaro to my left, that will always be my Africa.

NEW YORK, NY — The Lower East Side (the area south of East Houston Street and west of the East River, with disputed boundaries to the west and to the south).YESTERDAY 
60: Percent of the Lower East Side's population that was Jewish in 1915 (the neighborhood's boundaries at that time stretched all the way up to 14th Street). 
1 in 3: Proportion of Americans of Jewish descent who have an ancestor who lived on the Lower East Side after arriving in this country. 
7,000: Number of working class immigrants from more than 20 nations who lived in a single, five-story building—97 Orchard Street—between its construction in 1863 and 1935. 
1901: Year in which the first indoor toilets were installed at 97 Orchard Street. 
1,000: Number of people who attended services during the High Holy Days at the Eldridge Street Synagogue, the spiritual home of the first Eastern European Orthodox Jewish congregation in America. Crowds were so great after the synagogue opened in 1887 that mounted policemen patrolled the area and people paid rent to reserve their seats in the pews. 
275,000: Circulation size in the U.S. of the Yiddish-language Jewish Daily Forward in the early 1930s, when its headquarters were located at 175 East Broadway, a 10-story office building with a facade featuring carved bas relief portraits of Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. 
121: Age of Katz's Delicatessen at Houston and Ludlow Streets, the oldest deli in New York City, and the only one where workers still cut the pastrami and corned beef by hand. 

TODAY 
4: Number of Oscars won by the film When Harry Met Sally, in which Billy Crystal's Harry sat with Meg Ryan's Sally while she faked an orgasm at a table in Katz's Delicatessen, where a sign now reads: "Congratulations! You're sitting where Harry met Sally." 
33: Length of the run (in years) of the legendary CBGB & OMFUG—"Country Bluegrass Blues and Other Music For Uplifting Gormandizers"—at Bowery and Bleecker Streets. The club was founded in 1973, and soon left behind its folksy name to become the home of a new kind of music, called punk rock, that was played in many clubs near Bowery Street by bands like New York natives The Ramones. It closed in 2006. 
1994: Year in which the tenement at 97 Orchard became a National Historic Landmark. It now houses the successful Lower East Side Tenement Museum, which has restored six of the building's original apartments. 
1 in 3: Proportion of Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States who have a relative who has lived in the Lower East Side. 
24: Percentage of Lower East Side residents who list Hispanic as their ethnic group. 
51.6: Percentage of Lower East Side residents who list Asian/Pacific Islander as their race. 
16,945: In dollars, the per capita income of the Lower East Side. The US per capita income in 1999 was $21,587."
2 dozen: Number of synagogues currently active south of 14th Street. 
1: Number of Romaniote (Greek Jewish) synagogues that remain in the Western Hemisphere. The lone synagogue is Kehila Kedosha Janina at Broome and Allen Streets. 
50-50: The probability, according to City Secrets New York City, that the young person sitting next to you at one of the many new hipster bars on Ludlow Street is either an artist recently profiled in The New York Times or a New York University student playing hooky. 
3: Kinds of wine—CHEAP, DECENT, and GOOD—that are served at Schiller's at 131 Rivington Street, the inspiration for novelist Richard Price's Cafe Berkmann in his acclaimed 2008 novel Lush Life, which explores the conflicting identities of the neighborhood through the murder of a Lower East Side hipster by a street kid. The influx of well-off young people has been controversial. The Lower East Side Jewish Conservancy derisively calls the changes "hipification" and "Yupification." 
Today on the Lower East Side, cultures new and old butt up against one another in an uneasy but (to the outsider) exhilarating whorl: a mere corner of a city block can contain a Mexican vendor selling sweet flavored ice, a Middle Eastern cart full of fresh mangoes, a Dominican cafe cooking spicy sandwiches, and an old Jewish deli hawking hunks of pastrami (all cheap, for the visitor). Some blocks resemble a World's Fair of bargain grocery stores, places of worship, and trendy bars. Red brick housing projects hide not far away. Even while standing at the base of a solid and impressive historic landmark, the outsider cannot escape feeling the juxtapositions in his gut. Novelist Price enjoys visiting Schiller's in part for the decor, which was taken from old warehouses. One of his comments captures a modern Lower East Side sensibility: "It's all a stage set," he told the New York Times, "and now it's, like, venerable."

ELYRIA, Ohio — It was two years ago this summer—the week ending June 22, 2007—that the first intimations of economic crisis hit Wall Street. That week, rumors, and subsequently figures, began to fly regarding a pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds that were heavily invested in complicated debt products.
I was interning at an asset management firm in New York, and by the end of the next month—once Bear Stearns had wound-down the funds as officially worthless—all of my colleagues, from the most senior money managers to the lowliest analysts, had sat through a number of crash courses in our conference rooms 40 floors over Midtown, covering the inner-workings of “mortgage securitization.” This process governs how a home buyer’s payments make it from Main Street to Wall Street, and what happens when the flow stops
Two summers later, I’ve decided to spend my time volunteering with the Legal Aid office in my home county in Ohio, with a special interest in foreclosure cases. 
Legal Aid is a nationally coordinated set of programs that provide civil legal services to people who can’t otherwise afford them. And in Lorain County, Ohio—which has been unwillingly “deindustrializing” and losing good manufacturing jobs for my entire lifetime, if not longer—there is plenty of need.
The transition from Wall Street to Main Street—in Elyria a Main Street on which commercial prosperity long ago gave way to dive bars, used furniture stores, and storefront churches—leaves a bitter taste of a boom that, for many, never was. 
The downtown of this city of 50,000 probably hasn’t seen any large-scale commercial development in the past two decades aside from a gleaming glass-and-steel hospital complex.  A similarly-styled seven-story “Justice Center” casts its shiny bureaucratic glory over the faded grandeur of the city’s original court house.
The big-time jury trial court rooms lie on floors three through seven, but most of Legal Aid’s cases don’t make it past the Justice Center’s second floor—Domestic Relations. The first floor, meanwhile, is the paper mill, absorbing and spitting back out the endless rounds of documentation composed, notarized, respectfully submitted, and acknowledged in cases like home foreclosure. 
The foreclosure cases we now see in the office are no longer the people who got connived into taking inappropriate mortgages—mortgages that encouraged the buyer to pay only interest and not build equity in the house, or that would reset in 2 years and double their payments. These days, the typical homeowner facing foreclosure seems more likely to have simply lost a job—in a steel plant or a bank or as an auto-mechanic—and fallen behind on payments.
And so on ground level the legal options available in such cases are discouragingly few. Lawyers can search for inconsistencies in the documents filed with a court in a foreclosure action, creating enough extra time for a homeowner to find a job or to work out an agreement to modify the mortgage.
Yet even as foreclosures continue apace, most of the cases the office handles—as well as those we’re forced to turn away due to our limited stock of attorneys—fit less conveniently into a narrative. A few types of cases make up the bulk of Legal Aid’s work even as, according to the attorneys in the office, the mix has changed with the downturn. Lost jobs tends to mean more domestic violence-related divorces and more claims from workers who are wrongfully denied unemployment benefits, as well as a greater need for papers requesting a court modify child support payments that a laid-off worker can no longer afford.
One client seeking the latter relayed that his steel plant told him they could take him back from furlough “when we get $4 gas again”: They make pipes for offshore wells.
Wrongful eviction and Social Security-related issues remain “popular” as well. The most noteworthy case I worked on involved a woman whose welfare benefits were terminated after bureaucrats determined that taking her mom to chemotherapy wasn’t a “good excuse” for missing a job training program; her case is still awaiting resolution.
Seeking to help out a little, and to zoom out from a perspective of the world as numbers on a page, I’ve run into more than I bargained for.

KYETUME, Uganda—After living in and traveling through Libya and Tunisia, where my paternal relatives are from, I accurately expected that rural, sub-Saharan Africa wouldn’t exactly be the mirror image of life in Cambridge, Mass. But what has struck me considerably about Uganda in the past several weeks has not been the random and frequent brownouts or the latrine we have to squat in every day. Instead, at the non-governmental organization where I’m working, I have been most struck—and irritated—by some native Ugandans’ acceptance of inefficiency for no reason other than T. I. A.—“This is Africa.”
Last Thursday, I helped drain a swamp that a village community uses for drinking and bathing water. The rainy season will start sometime next month, and so the villagers asked us to help clear out the feet-deep layers of sludge at the bottom in order for clean rainwater to accumulate.
When the NGO’s project leaders handed us worn-out jerrycans, shovels, and hoes to do the physically-grueling work, which lasted two days in total, I felt that invoking T. I. A. to cope with the situation—which the project leader did—was entirely reasonable. After all, no one would have had the right to complain that a shiny, yellow Caterpillar bulldozer didn’t pull up to the swamp alongside dump trucks and vacuum-powered electric hoses to get the job done within a few hours.
But when the project leader later told me that it was “impossible” for an African to adhere to schedules or to make plans ahead of time, when she said that it was “foolish” to set up an interview with the director of a microfinance program because “if it needs to happen, then it will happen on its own,” and when she concluded that the explanation was “This is Africa,” I refused to tolerate that excuse. Instead, I became incensed.
On the surface, my project leader had implicitly endorsed the stereotype of the “lazy African.” Her conclusions reeked of the historically racist beliefs that the African lacks discipline, is simple-minded, and relegates his or her fate to outside sources. (Enter everyone from missionaries to hegemonic Western powers right about now.)
Assuming that most people understand the moral implications of her excuse—regarding the African as a subpar human being with inferior mental capacities—I won’t argue why I find such an implicit characterization both inflammatory, especially as the son of a North African, and dehumanizing. What makes the characterization worse, however, is that my project leader is an intelligent graduate of Makerere University—the most prestigious institution of its kind in Uganda—who is considering furthering her education at the London School of Economics and says her ultimate goal is to work in policy.
As an educated woman, my project leader would no doubt find it far from “impossible” to keep to a schedule. But more importantly, she should also be able to perceive the other consequence that her mindset breeds: dependency.
There’s a difference between blaming slow progress on a legitimate lack of resources and excusing yourself for being “unable” to perform a task that requires little more than brainpower, simply because you’re African. If the fact that people come from this continent precludes them from being able to work efficiently and independently—following deadlines, organizing lists, and thinking through problems instead of allowing them to sort themselves out, for example—then who will do that sort of necessary work for the African people? The evangelical missionary? The corrupt politician? The outside philanthropist? The perhaps too-eager Harvard student? Whomever it happens to be, it won’t be the Africans themselves.
In June, while researching in Amsterdam, I had the opportunity to speak with journalist Linda Polman, the author of We Did Nothing: Why the Truth Doesn’t Always Come Out When the UN Goes In. Polman, who has reported on UN peacekeeping missions in war zones ranging from Haiti to Somalia, is critical of NGOs, especially when they’re charged with distributing urgently needed humanitarian aid. After publishing her latest book, With Friends Like These: Behind the Scenes of the Emergency Aid Industry, Polman said she’s earned the ire of some of these organizations. It makes sense why: She advocates completely cutting off funding to NGOs that distribute humanitarian aid, as the aid they distribute too often falls into the hands of the perpetrators—not the victims—of violence.
But it’s not just the issue of aid allocation that warrants a cessation of unconditional funding to NGOs, Polman said. She added that the “old” dependency argument—that, during peace time, assistance from NGOs often inhibits its recipients from becoming independent and self-sufficient—is a damaging effect of funding these organizations, as well.
As I nag daily at my project leader, urging her to dispense with her preconceptions, Polman’s argument seems applicable. Do my educated Ugandan colleagues at the NGO refuse to commit themselves to a minimal standard of efficiency because they know their slack will be picked up by one of the American, Australian, or Canadian workers here, or compensated for by funding from an international donor? This could be the case, considering that I eventually scheduled the interview with the microfinance director myself, without my project leader’s help.
Rather than pulling a Polman and simply refusing to invest my “intellectual” resources in the NGO, I think I’ve found a possible solution to my current dilemma. For my next project, I’m not teaming up with another Western worker. Instead, I’m helping design curricula for a local high school with a senior who attends it.
And as she works efficiently on deadline, the student will help introduce my project leader to a new version of T. I. A.—one that boasts, even among Africans, that something like This is Achievable.

MUMBAI, India — As the Copenhagen Conference approaches in December, the Obama Administration is aggressively trying to lay the framework for an international agreement to combat climate change through global diplomacy. Hillary Clinton’s visit to India a few weeks ago shows the challenge of constructing an effective agreement. While she emphasized the importance of protecting the environment, India flatly stated its opposition to accepting any form of binding emissions cuts. As a developing nation that has played a very small part in producing the climate mess that the world now faces, India’s lack of enthusiasm is understandable. This does not mean, however, that an agreement is out of the question. A treaty that includes clean energy technology transfers and investment from wealthy countries in return for mandatory environmental targets in the developing world would benefit wealthy and developing economies alike.
Climate change is an urgent problem facing our globe, but developing countries understandably show apprehension when it comes to cutting emissions, given their growth challenges. In India, over 400 million people still live in poverty, and energy has yet to reach wide swaths of the rural land. Indians argue that no one told the United States or England to use expensive, untested modes of energy when Western countries were in their “developing” states centuries ago. Emissions limits could stunt the growth of these nations. However, countries such as India and Bangladesh also have the most to lose from the effects of climate change. The developing world will face the overwhelming brunt of global warming’s repercussions, bearing the burden of everything from drought to flood, population dislocation, wars over natural resources, and border disputes. 
The United States can ensure that India and other countries in its position do not have to choose between higher growth and climate disaster by crafting an agreement that will provide energy investment in the developing world. Such an agreement would mitigate the high costs of an energy transition for poor countries while providing jobs and business opportunities to the United States and Europe, both in desperate need of economic revival.  In an era where American manufacturing is on the way out and finance has been rendered incapable of serving as a foundation for our economy, green technology provides an excellent business opportunity for the United States. China has already realized this, and is building the industry at a rapid rate. We can retake the lead by supplying clean energy to much of the developing world, and easing their transition to environmentally-friendly economies. To ensure that the treaty would be effective, the investment should mandate emissions cuts in developing nations—cuts that these countries would hopefully accept in return for Western funding of their energy transitions. 
Such an agreement would unlikely garner immense support in either wealthy countries or the developing world.  Westerners would complain about government spending going towards another country’s economy; those in developing nations would complain about mandatory emissions cuts. The reality with any international treaty is that every side has to compromise. But this proposal would provide enough benefits to all parties that it is an idea well worth pursuing.

TSIM SHA TSUI, Hong Kong — They bought flights for it, booked tours, braved injury, and shirked work. Some bathed in holy water; others prepared for a tsunami. Many waited on lines that stretched around the blocks that they always rushed by without a glance. A few bought welder’s plates and punched holes in cardboard. One woman forced her entire family out of the house at 5:30 a.m. to join the queue.
At 7: 15 a.m., I woke up—an hour later than planned. I ran with hair flying and reporter notebook pages as askew as my rumpled skirt, dashing through the metro tunnels out into the (possibly) blinding sunlight. I knew all about the dangers of “solar maculopathy” and was determined to not make eye contact with my subject—and usually, archnemesis—the sun. A hotline had been established in Hong Kong for the symptoms of eye damage—blurred vision, holes in visual field, afterimages, and reddened perception. Most people didn’t own the proper solar filters for dealing with the situation. If you look straight at the sun during a partial eclipse—like the 75 percent one that occurred in Hong Kong on July 22—the sun’s rays can penetrate and photochemically change the makeup of your retina, potentially causing permanent damage.
That was why hordes of people were coming to these solar observation parties, to get a quick look through a telescope or pick up some free eclipse shades and gaze at the sun, rather than being limited to stolen glances. Squinting and looking down, I probably didn’t make a very compelling image of the proverbial intrepid reporter. I saw the line winding around the space museum—the line I was supposed to be on an hour ago—and groaned.
Luckily, a press badge got me in even ahead of the earliest arrivers. I felt like a bit of a sham as I stepped in front of a chubby 11-year-old with glasses, braces, and a wide grin that never left his face. His grandfather spoke no English but hovered behind him and smiled toothlessly. They reminded me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as they carried the golden ticket of excitement through the nonchalant reporters piled onto the top deck, and were the first to look through the telescope that was about three times the size of the kid himself.
As the eclipse started, the people who remained waiting on line—unable to get onto the observatory deck with its fancy instruments and filters—abandoned caution and looked towards the sun with naked eyes. I was shocked that they would risk something so huge for something seemingly so unimportant. Nothing is worth irreparable eye damage. But I forgot my shock as I automatically turned with the crowd toward the perfect orange in the sky—eclipse shades luckily donned—and watched the moon ruthlessly vanquish it during the longest total eclipse to occur in Asia for 500 years.
Despite its status as only a partial eclipse in Hong Kong, people ooh-ed, aah-ed, clapped, and sighed with every rogue movement of a cloud or surreptitious inching forward of the moon. It was a show with no language and no tickets. I imagined, across the strip of land that was experiencing total eclipse, people turning in unison as the sky went dark and the sun billowed out at them around a deep black hole. There may be nothing tangible that can unite every person across that strip of land from Varanasi to Shanghai except, perhaps, the fact that for one instant of total eclipse they all lived where the sun chose to hide itself. I remember learning about how smiles are universal—a particular baring of the teeth occurs similarly across cultures and species even if they haven’t interacted with each other. I can imagine that the feeling you get when you turn to look at the sun, only to see it so obscured, is universal as well.
While staring at the sun was interesting off and on, the people who collected—and eventually dispersed—on the observation deck that day proved more intriguing. The high-heeled woman who took off work to watch the sun at 9 a.m. rushed back, and worked overtime. The little girl who jumped with glee as she faced the receding, glowing-red blob was hurried onto a school bus to sit behind a desk for the next six hours or so. People flowed back onto the escalators—letting themselves be moved instead of moving—to the next destination after destination, always looking forward and never around.
When the last curve of the moon moved out of the sun’s way, everyone clapped. That is, everyone but one. A six-year-old kid, who had sat videotaping the sky for hours, bawled. Maybe he was mourning the fact that everything was going to be the same again. We crave change, but we don’t make it happen: We expect it to happen to us.
And it does, for brief glimpses.
I left feeling I had witnessed something much more than astronomical alignment through pre-approved scientific tools. I had watched a coming-together, but it also made me sharply aware of a growing-apart, as the crowd that had so easily formed suddenly and easily dispersed. I was a little sad to return to my frigid office, with the constant background chatter of computer keys, and wrap up the event by writing my story. I wondered what it would be like to go to the moon instead, and look back on earth for that one day each century, to see the world eclipsed by the people coming out of their self-constructed havens in the tall city buildings to look up as one.

NEW YORK, NY – A stack of manuscripts, hundreds of them. Pages of white computer paper, formatted in that neat, double-spaced way, printed in Times New Roman. 12 point.
"Could you write rejections for these?" My boss asks. "I just don't think they're for us." I nod. It’s my job.
I spent the summer at a publishing house, working as an editorial intern. I mailed and messengered books, learned the ins and outs of UPS and DHL. I answered phones. I photocopied first-pass proofs and book contracts and signing checks. I also wrote rejection letters. I was taught by the very best. Sometimes, I got Thank You notes.
But I'll tell you the truth—rejection hurts, and not just the person on the receiving end.
I saw myself on every page. I've been rejected from high schools and colleges, from a capella groups and publications and summer opportunities. I know what it feels like to send a piece of yourself out into the silence. And I know what it feels like to get the thin envelope or the small package or the short email back.
And now, here I was, pairing “so I think we're going to have to pass” and “I'm not sure how to position this on our list” with compliments about “lush descriptions” and “compelling narrative voices.” I felt powerful, at first, but that soon wore off. I was left with a dull ache—it’s a mix of guilt and heartbreak.
An author wrote me back after one rejection. "Please be frank," she said. Then she asked if she should just give up.
Give up? I didn't know what to say. She was in her forties, or fifties maybe, and had spent a decade working on this novel. I wanted to shake her. I mean, what the fuck do I know? I'm just an intern. I don’t want to be responsible for crushing her dream, for crushing anyone's dreams.
On T.V. and in newspaper articles, they call us a coddled generation. Bubble-wrapped kids. We—Generation Y, Millennials, whatever—are told that we feel entitled to success. When faced with failure, we are meant to fold in upon ourselves, to give up.
And sure, I think about that sometimes. But as August rolls around and I prepare for senior year and for the real world, for a recessed economy and a shrinking job market, I prepare for the hundreds upon hundreds of rejections that lay ahead.
Because if I know anything, I know that after all the Nos, you only ever really need one Yes. (And thanks, Ecco, for saying Yes.)
But hey, why listen to me, anyway? I'm just an intern.

NEW YORK—The second suspect arrested in connection with the deadly Kirkland House shooting in May will likely not face charges in Massachusetts until at least September, because prosecutors have not yet obtained the necessary warrant to extradite him from New York. 
A court hearing on Tuesday morning to extradite Blayn "Bliz" Jiggetts, 19, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., was adjourned until Sept. 8. Jiggetts, who was arrested in Harlem on June 9, will continue to be held in jail without bail.
He has refused to return voluntarily to Mass. to face criminal charges which include first degree murder, accessory after the fact of murder, carrying a gun without a license, and armed robbery. Jiggetts already faced a similar extradition hearing last month, which was also adjourned.
Prosecutors from the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office are currently seeking a governor’s warrant, which requires the signatures of both the Mass. and N.Y. governors. The document would allow Jiggetts to be taken involuntarily to Massachusetts to face charges.
According to the Boston Globe, Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bennett said on Monday that Jiggetts, Jabrai J. Copney, 20, and Jason Aquino, 23, arrived at Harvard from New York on May 18. Armed with a 9 mm handgun, they met Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, 20, in the Kirkland Annex basement to steal $1,000 in drug money. 
The Middlesex District Attorney’s press office could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, and Alicia Maxey Greene, the Manhattan District Attorney’s director of public information, declined to comment. Jiggetts first refused to sign a waiver allowing him to be extradited two months ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hollywood television and film actress Ashley Judd recently enrolled in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Mid-Career Master in Public Administration (MC/MPA) program, according to her publicist, Cara Tripicchio.
The Kennedy School declined to comment on Judd's enrollment in the program, which launched on July 22, but spokeswoman Molly Lanzarotta noted that the degree often attracts public officials and non-profit activists.
The MC/MPA is designed to "increase the knowledge and skills of well established, high-performing professionals, who seek to enhance their public service careers or to move from the private sector to a leadership position in either the public or non-profit sectors," according to the program's Web site.  
Judd, born in Los Angeles in 1968, held key roles in "Heat," "Double Jeopardy," and "The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." She is also an active humanitarian, having served on the board of directors for healthcare nonprofit Population Services International since 2004. She was also Global Ambassador for YouthAIDS, the organization's HIV education and prevention program, and has traveled to a number of developing countries, including Thailand, Madagascar, and Rwanda.
Judd has spoken before the General Assembly of the United Nations about human trafficking, and VH1, The National Geographic Channel, and The Discovery Channel have aired documentaries highlighting her humanitarian activities.
The Boston Herald first reported Judd's enrollment at the Kennedy School last week.
Past recipients of master's degrees in Public Administration at the Kennedy School include Mexican President Felipe Calderon, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
Judd graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2007 with a degree in French after returning to the school to complete required coursework following a 17 year hiatus.—Staff writer Molly M. Strauss can be reached at mstrauss@fas.harvard.edu.CORRECTION: An earlier online version of this article incorrectly stated that actress Ashley Judd graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1990. In fact, though she left the school that year, Judd did not finish all the requirements for a French degree until 2007. The article has been updated to reflect this correction.
