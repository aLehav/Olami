After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The inevitable joke to be made about Canadian director Denis Villeneuve’s new film “Prisoners” is that there is certainly an exceptional movie locked up somewhere within the two-and-a-half-hour production, but unfortunately, it remains a captive. The movie, which centers on the stock plot of a missing daughter and her vengeful father, Keller Dover (played mercilessly well by Hugh Jackman), begins as a taut thriller that is brutally effective in its ability to inspire terror. However, the final hour tests its own plot more than its audience, attempting to squeeze back into the obvious, platitudinous storyline that it so successfully avoided in the first two acts.
The setting is suburban Pennsylvania, which has never looked more sinister as frost settles on the woods that seem to encroach on the clapboard houses. It seems always on the verge of becoming a true wilderness, a sense that is sharpened by the subtle insinuations that the town has slumped into economic despair. This feeling of bleak survivalism finds its human counterpart in Dover, a man whose apocalypse-ready attitude is revealed in his introductory words to his son: a warning to be ever-prepared to act in any potential disaster. This is the instruction that he himself will follow to the gory letter as the film progresses.
 
Dover’s young daughter Anna and her friend Joy are abducted on a rainy Thanksgiving afternoon. The immediate suspect in the girls’ disappearance is Alex Jones (played by a perfectly cast, just-creepy-enough Paul Dano), a glassy-eyed and disturbed young man who offers up meek, quavering whispers in response to the questioning of the dogged Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Jones, not having been charged with any crime, is released from custody, and Dover descends on him almost immediately, planning to torture him into revealing the location of the missing girls. The best parts of the film center on this triangle of men—Dover, Loki, and Jones—as the clock continues to run on the girls’ disappearance (Dover obsessively mentions each passing day, becoming more haggard and rabid as he does so).
 
While none of the men are especially unique characters, their competing motives snarl into a tense and truly frightening storm of power and violence.  Dover is a heavy-bearded, ruthless man who, once having introduced his view of the world, completely refuses to adapt. The extent of characterization for Loki seems to have been slapping a compass tattoo on his neck and a few self-done pieces on his hands, although Gyllenhaal adds in the compelling physical tic of blinking hard in moments of stress, while Alex’s cracked, high pitched voice and awkward, wide-framed glasses do a fair amount of work for the wildly-skilled Paul Dano. It’s no secret that the film is dealing in types when it comes to these men—they feel like familiar mechanisms more than intriguing characters, but this utilitarian approach to characters is not an amateurish mistake. The strength of the piece is the way these types interact—how extreme men respond in extreme conditions—and to its credit, the film is unflinching, even as it discovers the gruesome reality of what a man like Dover can do to a man like Jones. 
 
However, the film breaks off from this devastating study in the last hour and falls into a steep decline. Suddenly, a movie that has been sleek, bloody and—most importantly—surprising begins to feel like an extended episode of Law & Order, cashing in on tricky plot twists and unexpected motives to become ironically mundane. Aaron Guzikowski, the screenwriter, seems to have made a complete about-face by the end of the film. He goes from challenging and leading his audience confidently in the direction of their yet-unrealized nightmares, to playing to their expectations and offering up a storyline that pretends to be complex while pandering to the amateur crime-solvers in the theater. 
 
Villeneuve spends the first two thirds of this film building what could have been a truly special example of a tense thriller, but he throws this momentum away in the final act in favor of a more predictable finish. All this is not to say that “Prisoners” isn’t worth your time—it certainly is, but just an hour and half of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tony Award-winning actor Courtney B. Vance ’82 revealed on Wednesday that he wasn’t always certain of his career path. Vance spoke frankly at an intimate lecture in Winthrop House’s Junior Common Room as part of the Perini-Woods Memorial SCR Speaker Series. In a talk entitled “From Harvard to Hollywood,” Vance retraced his career trajectory to roles in “The Preacher’s Wife” and as Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver on the TV series “Law and Order: Criminal Intent.”
“When I arrived, everyone else knew what they wanted to do, and I felt completely alone and incompetent,” Vance said of his freshman year at Harvard. “It was a really rough first semester because I was running track and not enjoying it.”
It wasn’t until his sophomore year that Vance decided to give acting a try.  “At first it was just a way to meet new people,” he said. “After my fifth show my family said, ‘you might want to consider this as a career.’” Vance starred in the 1980 Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club production, “Spring’s Awakening,” as the Man in the Mask. In an interview with The Crimson, Vance said he remembers forgetting his lines at one point during the show. “I don’t remember anything about the character…. We were talking about something, and I went blank. I mean, I dried up like Arizona.”
Despite this momentary lapse in memory, Vance’s performance was well received. During his time at Harvard, Vance appeared in a number of shows, including the 1981 production of “Doctor Faustus” and the 1980 adaptation of “Story Theatre.” He continued to pursue theater seriously in the Boston area while in college as an actor for the Boston Shakespeare Company. After graduating Harvard, Vance studied at the Yale School of Drama, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts.Vance has since played many historically important African American characters, including Corey in “Fences,” Jim in “The Adventures of Huck Finn,” and a lieutenant in the movie “The Tuskegee Airmen.”  He says he intentionally sought out the role of Jim to dispel doubt of his ability to convincingly portray an uneducated character given his Harvard background. Vance also appeared in the film “The Hunt for Red October.”
Vance’s 1996 performance as the leader of a struggling Baptist church in New York City in “The Preacher’s Wife,” opposite Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington, was a memorable experience for him. Vance says that witnessing Houston’s deterioration and struggle with substance abuse was extremely painful. “She had the voice of an angel and [was] the voice of a generation,” Vance says. Speaking of the media coverage of celebrities, he says, “the tragedy for artists is losing your private life.”
This year, Vance received a Tony Award for his work as “Hap” Hairston in “Lucky Guy,” a drama about journalist Mike McAlary, played by Tom Hanks. Vance’s success in the role was the surprising result of a professional gamble: his decision to return to Broadway after being away from it for over two decades. “It was nothing short of miraculous,” Vance says. “[My wife] Angela said, ‘you’re not going to make any money doing this,’ and it was a major family decision that involved moving to New York for six months,” Vance says. After the talk, a student actor in the audience asked Vance for his advice on training for an acting career. “In theater, you have to go back to kindergarden. Acting is problem solving,” Vance said, referring to the actor’s need to develop his or her techniques and continually  refine the basics of the craft. He encouraged audience members to seek inspiration in their daily life. “Life happens on the way to the theater—you have to use that.”

“No, I do not think I’m familiar with it,” Daniel W. Erickson ’14 says of James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake.” It’s a strange statement, given that Erickson is performing a one-man stage adaptation of the work—titled “Here Comes Everybody”—to open on Thursday in the Adams Pool Theatre. But since Joyce’s novel  is such a challenging work of fiction, only a select few can ever profess to be familiar with it as one would be familiar with a novel, song, or sitcom. 
The text of the book is uniquely challenging; it employs some 20 different languages, often using multiple languages in a single sentence—or word—to form cross-lingual puns.
The simplest way Erickson can describe the essence of the book—and, of course, his show—is that it captures the dreamscape of a man’s mind as he sleeps. Erickson’s adaptation does not root the story’s slippery plot to something as concrete; on the contrary, he intends to avoid concreteness. 
In fact, he’s been trying to eliminate his take on the novel altogether from the performance. “These last few months I’ve been trying to think of ways to present this text to the audience, to give them some kind of key in a way that doesn’t force them down certain paths that I like,” he says. 
Erickson is aware of the work’s perplexing nature. He doesn’t expect his audience to understand it; his goal is to build appreciation.
“My favorite result of putting this piece on would be to just have everybody in the audience try to read ‘Finnegans Wake’ in the next 30 years and get through 10 pages without being just so fucking annoyed!” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a man who runs loose on the streets of New York City. His chest is muscular, toned, and bare, and an acoustic guitar hangs by a star-spangled strap from his neck. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, tall brown boots, and white briefs. He is the Naked Cowboy.
The Naked Cowboy is a staple of the Times Square street performing scene—a tall, brawny, and most conspicuous man who struts around and smiles for pictures in the world’s tourist hotspot. Robert John Burck is behind the character. Burck works hard at his job and does well for himself (the Naked Cowboy’s yearly income averages over $250,000).
Burck’s career as the Naked Cowboy continues to involve bizarre episodes: He became an ordained minister in response to fans who asked him to preside over their weddings, he has an oyster dish that a Long Island oyster company named after his street act, and he opted to run in major political races like the 2009 New York City mayoral election and the 2012 presidential primary. Burck finds time for four hours of reading each day, claiming Nietzsche and the motivational author Anthony Robbins among his key influencers. Burck is energized and optimistic about his career trajectory and believes in his future. "I am going to be the greatest success story of all time," he said in an interview.
When Robert John Burck was an undergraduate at University of Cincinnati, sitting in his graduation gown and waiting to obtain his political science degree, what could he have been thinking about his future? Was he thinking, “When I grow up, I want to play the guitar every day in Times Square in my underwear!”? I don’t think that he was.
The closer undergraduates get to graduation, the more frequently we get asked to state our life plans. Some people have known what they aspire to do career-wise since high school or even before. Others have been diligently plodding through the steps of self-discovery and still have no idea what turn their working lives will take or where they want their careers to go. A significant number of us don’t even know what we want to start working on when we leave Harvard in eight months’ time.
The first week of school this year I had lunch with a friend, also a senior, and we chatted about our summer internship experiences and our thoughts about what might loom in our futures after graduation. My friend said she doesn’t know what she wants to do with her life. She has enjoyed her time at Harvard, made friends, studied hard, experienced growth, but she doesn’t feel that her Harvard education has built toward anything that will help her discover a meaningful career.
Conflicted and frustrated, my friend told me that her strategy is just to play it safe and apply for jobs that will keep her options open—careers that are transferable and relevant no matter what she decides to try next. But, she says, she finds this unexciting and uninspiring. Even since she started to tell me about it, her tone has gotten more serious and her voice lower, as if she’s embarrassed to admit that this is her plan. My friend says that she doesn’t want to go into banking, but at the same time she doesn’t know what other options could exist for someone like her.
Similar to my friend, Robert John Burck probably didn’t know what he wanted his career to build toward when he was leaving college, and if he did I am willing to bet that being Times Square’s Naked Cowboy was not among his stated plans. But unlike my friend, he didn’t decide to play it safe by finding a job that seemed versatile. Burck went into super-modeling right out of school, had trouble breaking into the industry, and ended up street performing instead to pay the rent. He took a plunge in a direction that excited him, took a big fall, then recalibrated.
Taking the plunge might mean trying out human rights work abroad, getting a job at a small startup, or heading to Hollywood. In some cases, taking the plunge can also mean going into consulting or banking. Plunging is finding a path that seems invigorating, challenging, meaningful, and a whole lot of fun. We each have jobs that will fulfill these criteria for our particular set of skills and interests. We can’t be afraid to look for them.
My column this semester will look at Harvard alums who took big plunges after graduation—people who had unconventional aspirations or, in some cases, no aspirations at all. These alums took significant risks in their early post-grad years and periodically throughout their working lives, and they have ultimately found work that suits their passions. They remind us that the working world is far more diverse than we can possibly imagine. We have options. We should commit to searching for them and taking the plunge.

As sad as it is to say, the story is tried and true. Politician makes a grievous personal error and then denies it until enough evidence surfaces to make him admit the truth. Then comes the series of public apologies, perhaps a resignation, a period of “rehabilitation,” and finally a resurfacing as a new and changed man.
Of course one cannot think of modern political scandals without thinking of the 1998 Monica Lewinsky scandal. In that case, former President Bill Clinton’s attempts to conceal his in-office affair not only resulted in his impeachment, but also met heavy public scrutiny. Surprisingly enough, Clinton received his highest approval ratings during this seemingly tumultuous time.
More recent politicians have not been as lucky. Following his 2011 sexting scandal, which, like Clinton’s, sparked a media frenzy, Anthony Weiner effectively resigned from Congress and took a two-year hiatus from politics. In April 2013, he was back in the game and announced his decision to run for New York City mayor. The following July, however, it was revealed that Weiner had continued sending inappropriate pictures and messages a few times after his previous resignation. In contrast to the Lewinsky scandal, Weiner’s public appeal did not fare well amid this news. The month before the recent photos and messages surfaced, Weiner was leading in the polls. After the scandal broke, however, his favorability dropped more than 20 points. On September 10, he lost the mayoral primary, securing less than five percent of the vote.
Similarly, Eliot Spitzer’s 2008 prostitution scandal had dire consequences for the former New York governor’s career, who also resigned after the scandal broke. In the midst of his campaign for New York City comptroller, Spitzer’s August 12 approval ratings were less than promising, with 59 percent of voters sill viewing him in a negative light. Although his was a much closer race than that of Anthony Weiner, Spitzer too lost the September 10 primary to his component Scott Springer.
The question remains, then, as to what accounts for the disparity between these approval ratings. Why were Americans more willing to forgive Clinton’s indiscretions as opposed to those of Weiner or Spitzer? After all, Clinton could very well have been held to a higher code of conduct as the president of our nation. Ultimately, however, America was able to exonerate Clinton’s infidelity because, as president, he entered into the scandal with more supporters than Weiner or Spitzer could ever hope to secure as congressman or mayor.
As such, Clinton’s multiple apologies were enough to talk his way back into the nation’s good graces. In the case of Weiner and Spitzer, however, issuing an apology or taking a temporary hiatus from politics did not and will not suffice in securing the trust of Americans, especially so soon after their indiscretions. In the midst of his recent campaign, for instance, Weiner stated, “People who know me are still going to vote for me.” Unfortunately for him, many do not care enough to get to know him beyond his misconduct.
What these politicians don’t seem to understand is that Americans cannot and should not separate a personal indiscretion from political performance. Americans did not forgive Clinton because they felt his infidelity had no effect on his presidency, but because they were willing to rally behind their nation’s leader, believing enough in the sincerity of his apology to extend a second chance. With the release of recent inappropriate messages, Weiner has already violated whatever second chance he may have had. Spitzer attempted to play the second chance card, but ultimately needed to do more in order to make amends for his actions.
Recently, Spitzer has stated that “the public will not only forgive you but they will say, ‘Move on.’” While this may be true, I personally am not ready to forgive him or Weiner after a few apologies and a few short years of silence. Judging by the recent election results, the American public feels the same. Then again, were these men as critical to our nation as President Clinton was during his administration, perhaps they could have secured the public’s forgiveness in greater haste.
As for what the future holds, however, forgiveness is certainly not out of the question. Provided that no more scandals surface, Weiner and Spitzer’s images could continue to heal in the eyes of the public. Whether they chose to run again is another story. Who knows, for instance, whether Weiner’s decision to flip off a reporter immediately following his concession speech is an indication that he has thrown in the towel.
Even if Weiner and Spitzer continue their attempts to govern our people, I hope that their scandals mark a turning point in the conduct of our nation’s leaders. Moving forward, perhaps the cycle of political transgressions will no longer be tried and true. After all, I think I speak for many Americans when I say that I look forward to the day when elections focus more on a candidate’s vision for the country than their defense of an already-sullied character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, as many as 400 students shopped Folklore and Mythology 128: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature,” a Gen Ed class with a capacity of 31 students. For the second consecutive year, the course’s professor had to lottery the class’s precious seats to 31 lucky students.
The overcrowding problem of “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature” is far from unique. Due to lack of qualified teaching fellows and classroom size, students have to compete for class spots. In departmental electives, professors can require students to submit an application, sometimes giving preference to students who are more prepared or simply have a higher GPA. But a one-for-all application that focuses on prior experience goes against the mission of the Gen Ed program to introduce students to a broad range of academic pursuits. It is also impractical that Professor Tatar, or professors of other popular Gen Ed classes, should read hundreds of applications.
Given these constraints, a lottery seems like a fair and painless solution. However, the solution is anything but fair. Those who plan to spend their careers on stem cell research, for instance, face the same competition as anyone who wants to take Government 1093: Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature simply because it is an easy Gen Ed. Any fair distribution of class spots should take student interest into consideration.
Being an unabashed capitalist, I initially had the idea of establishing a price for spots in competitive classes at Harvard. Those who are willing to pay more in tuition can have priority in choosing classes. Those who do not wish to pay more still have access to the non-lotteried classes. The system is fair in the sense that those who demand a better education will pay a higher price for it, but I will leave it to the reader to decipher why such a solution is morally repulsive.
Alternatively, the administration can introduce an incentive system without monetary exchange. Consider a system where students receive 100 “class points” upon arrival at the college, which they can use at their disposal to “bid” for classes. If a class is capped at a fixed number, such as 45, the highest 45 bidders will gain enrollment in the class. Each enrolled student will pay an amount in class points equal to the lowest amount bid by an enrolled student. In other words, the “price” of a spot in a class is determined by how many class points students are willing to use.
Unlike the lottery, the point system ensures that each competitive Gen Ed class is filled with students who have the greatest interest in the class. The system is also fair, in the sense that students have equal access to all Harvard classes, even though access to a specific class may be limited if the student is not interested enough.
The point system could also be a useful tool for the administration. The price of a class is a reflection of the imbalance between the supply and demand of a particular class or Gen Ed category. The demand for Gen Ed classes is difficult to change, but the administration can change the supply of Gen Ed classes in the future by increasing the number of Gen Ed classes in the same category or working with other Gen Ed professors to improve the quality of their class.
Of course, this system could be stressful and dissatisfying in other ways. The remorse from bidding one point too low is perhaps greater than the remorse of not getting into a lotteried class. Distributing classes between years and Gen Ed categories can also be tricky, especially for students with broad interests. After all, the point system depends on the ability of students to plan wisely, in order to collectively solve the administration’s impossibly difficult allocation problem.
Ultimately, Harvard must create a sensible Gen Ed program that takes student interest into consideration without sacrificing its mission of educating students in broad disciplines. Harvard also needs to guarantee the quality of teaching in the Gen Ed program. Before such tasks are accomplished, students will inevitably flock to well-taught classes with enrollment caps. There will necessarily be a scarcity of resources. We can give the pretense of blind equality by treating all demand equally, or we can use the greatest tool of economics—incentives—to allocate these scarce resources. I believe the latter is a more efficient and fairer solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing a federally conducted and unreleased study, the Department of Homeland Security has claimed to have found no evidence of racial profiling at Boston’s Logan Airport. But the study remains undisclosed, and all it currently proves is that there is no reliable data on racial profiling in airports. The Department of Homeland Security should publicly release its study, the Transportation Security Administration should keep records of every detention it makes and be able to justify those detentions, and no detention should ever be made based on race or ethnicity.
According to the DHS, the study was conducted after allegations surfaced last summer that Logan was the site of egregious racial profiling. In conducting the study, a federal watchdog interviewed 84 TSA employees and reported that only one described an instance of racial profiling.
This conclusion is inherently suspect despite its laudable appearance. The study is faulty primarily because it is partial.
Furthermore, the TSA fails to keep data on travelers’ races, which the American Civil Liberties Union has noted makes it nearly impossible to know if certain racial or ethnic groups are unduly targeted.
Crucially, DHS’s study itself remains unreleased—meaning that concerned citizens cannot draw their own conclusions from the data. Instead, they have to rely on the government’s statements.
In order to better understand the phenomenon of racial profiling such that it may be eliminated, the TSA should keep detailed records of every single detainment, and it should be able to justify any one of those detainments without relying on race or ethnicity. Statistical summaries of those records should be available to the public, as should be any study conducted by government and related to racial profiling. If the government truly wants a clear picture of the prevalence of racial profiling in Logan or in any airport, it should use better methods than those it appears to have used: A random sample of passengers should be sampled so that the study’s results will be less prone to bias. Until measures such as these are taken, we cannot truly know whether racial profiling is prevalent in our airports—we cannot trust the DHS when it refuses to even publish its study.
Understanding the prevalence of racial profiling in our airports is of paramount importance because the practice itself is anathema to both liberty and equality. Benjamin Franklin said that those who are willing to sacrifice liberty for the sake of security in fact deserve neither. No person should be denied equal treatment under the law based solely on the color of his or her skin—even if security may be gained from the practice. Racial profiling must be abolished wherever it occurs.

As part of a discussion series celebrating the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers’ 25th anniversary, three professors argued that the declining strength of unions has in part caused the deterioration of America’s middle class. Panelists each began their segments of the discussion, entitled “What’s Happening to the American Middle Class?” by reflecting on their own personal experiences with HUCTW. Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economics professor, first laid out what he believes to be the three main problems facing the middle class: the fallout from the recession, bad conditions for young people and the unemployed, and long-term structural labor market changes. Lisa M. Lynch, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, recalled the vote that created the union 25 years ago. “I remember the whispers of, ‘Oh, they’re not going to last,’ so congratulations on lasting!” Lynch said. Lynch then went on to cite the decline of unions—and the subsequent lack of a group watching out for and protecting workers—as the number one reason for the deterioration of the middle class. “We’re moving to a new tipping point because of a breakdown of the norms that helped ensure that the rising tide raised all boats,” she said. “Now we’re  finding that as the tide goes up, it’s a tsunami and we’re all getting wiped out.” Ann Bookman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said she agreed about the importance of unions. “Without people having a voice about the conditions of their work, they’re going to be only fragily attached to the middle class,” Bookman said. The panel is one of four discussions organized by HUCTW. It will be followed by three similar discussions—on health care, higher education, and the U.S. labor movement—that will take place in the coming weeks. According to HUCTW organizer Marie Manna, the event was the first time the union had organized discussions open to Harvard staff, both HUCTW members and non-members, students, faculty, and the wider community. She said that the union wanted to have an inclusive event to expand the discussion about significant issues facing both the Harvard community and the country as a whole. HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that the anniversary sparked some introspection within the union. “We wanted to mark the birthday proud of what we’ve accomplished, but also in a forward looking and broadly inclusive way,” he said. Union member Heidi L. Morgans, a publications coordinator at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that she came to the event because she was interested in the topic. “I do appreciate the fact that the union put on such an informative event for us so that we can learn for our own benefit,” Morgans said. —Staff writer Christine Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University alumni and donors from around the world are flocking to Harvard Square this weekend to celebrate Saturday’s public launch of The Harvard Campaign—widely predicted to be the largest fundraising drive in University history.
As the two-year “quiet phase” of intense internal planning comes to a close, many prominent donors have said that they are optimistic about the launch of the campaign.
“I think the launch...is going to be a spectacular Saturday in Cambridge,” said Sidney R. Knafel ’52, a longtime donor whose most recent public donation was a $10.5 million gift to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
In an emailed statement, University President Drew G. Faust said that she was also excited for the launch and the arrival of many visitors from afar.
“I look forward to engaging members of the Harvard community from across the globe as we celebrate the campaign launch and reaffirm Harvard’s commitment to be at the forefront of creating knowledge and deploying that knowledge in service to the world,” the statement said.
During Saturday’s events, University leaders will announce the campaign’s monetary goal and disclose the amount of money it has raised thus far, highly anticipated numbers that have been kept secret.
Typically, universities complete a large portion of their intended fundraising before publicly launching a capital campaign. A number of campaign gifts—some larger than $10 million—have already been announced. In addition, many of the Campaign’s University-wide priorities—such as house renewal, development in Allston, and a campus center—have been made public.
Later this fall, individual schools will also hold public launches, announcing their own priorities and goals.
Knafel, who is a Campaign co-chair, said that the total target would likely be very large.
“I think it’s going to be a big figure, and I think we’re going to go beyond it,” he said.
Knafel added, however, that the University would be careful not to set a goal that it could not meet.
“You certainly don’t want to fall shy of it,” he said. “I think they’re being very careful about getting the right figure.”
Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, a Campaign Co-Chair and longtime donor who gave generously to Quincy House renewal, said that the campaign goal would set records.
“It’s a tremendous amount,” he said.
Daniel H. Rothenberg ’04, who is participating in the campaign as an alumnus for the first time, also said that he has heard the quiet phase “went very well.”
“They put a lot of thought into this,” he said, referring to the priorities set by Harvard administrators, faculty, and fundraisers.
In an email to “members of the Harvard community,” Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 announced that Saturday’s programming would be available to the public through a live video feed on the University’s website.
Those events will begin at 1 p.m. with a faculty panel discussing the “future of knowledge” and moderated by Harvard Law School and Kennedy School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain. Panelists will include Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson, Biology professor Hopi Hoekstra, Philosophy professor Alison Simmons, and Medical School professor Peter K. Sorger ’83.
A conversation between former Harvard student Bill Gates and Campaign Co-Chair David M. Rubenstein will follow the panel, followed by Faust giving a speech in Sanders Theater at 4 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dunkin’ Donuts window where Matt Damon slammed a phone number and asked, “How do you like them apples?” will no longer house the coffee chain. The joint Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins store at the corner of Bow St. and Mass. Ave—noted for being featured in the 1998 film “Good Will Hunting”—is set to close next week.
“Dunkin’ Donuts at 1 Bow St. in Cambridge will close on Thursday, September 26, as we are in the process of looking for a new location,” the franchise’s owner David G. Carvalho wrote in an email to The Crimson.
“All crew members will be transferred to three other Dunkin’ Donuts stores in Harvard Square located at 65 JFK St., 61 Church St., and inside of the Harvard Square MBTA train station,” he wrote.
For students who frequented the shop at 1230 Mass. Ave, the closure signals the loss of a convenient cup of coffee and donuts along with 31 flavors of ice cream.
“It’s very upsetting just because I’m in there at least once a day to the point where the people behind the counter know my order,” Joe R. Mazur ’15 said, adding that the Dunkin’ Donuts is “a staple in the morning class culture at Harvard.”
He said one of the store’s employees told him that the owners “decided it wasn’t worth the lease” to keep the location open.
Although the store is survived by three other Dunkin’ Donuts in Harvard Square, Mazur said the inconvenience of the remaining locations compared to Bow Street may be a deterrent to loyal Dunkin’ patrons, particularly among the student body.
Matthew R. Shuham ’15 said the coffee shop was “almost like a second home.”
Shuham said the store attracted a mix of Cambridge residents, police officers, and Harvard students, particularly from nearby Houses like Leverett, Dunster, and Dewolfe.
Dunkin’ Donuts has shared the Bow Street property with several companies since it first opened at the location in 1971. While occupying the space with the Bow and Arrow Pub in January 2000, the store faced the threat of closure when IDM Inc., the development company controlling the property, wanted to limit the lease to a single occupant.
The shop closed in August that year to allow for renovations to the building, which was operated by the Harvard Cooperative Society. The combination of Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins then reopened in September 2003, but after 10-years of partnering coffee and ice cream, both retailers will leave the location.
The lease of the 2,425-square-foot location, which expired this year, is currently being sold by Colliers International.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alternating between laughter and tears, Evelynn M. Hammonds stood at the front of a crowded faculty room in University Hall Thursday afternoon as former administrative colleagues and fellow faculty members paid tribute to her five-year tenure as Dean of the Harvard College.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, serving as master of ceremonies, led several dozen faculty members and staff in formally thanking Hammonds for what he characterized as her distinguished service to the College community.
Pointing to Hammonds’s contributions to the House renewal project, the recent expansion of research opportunities for undergraduates, and high rates of student satisfaction during her tenure, Smith said his former University Hall colleague leaves behind a record of achievement as she returns to full-time scholarly work.
Following Smith at the microphone in turn, University President Drew G. Faust, history of science professor Allan M. Brandt, Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, and a former member of the Board of Overseers reflected on Hammonds’s achievements as dean. Flanked by her partner, Hammonds listened as they named accomplishments ranging from the development of January Term to the beginning of House renewal to the expansion of common social spaces.
Neither Smith, Hammonds, nor any of the afternoon’s speakers made mention of the Government 1310 cheating case or the subsequent email search scandal that marred much of Hammonds’s final year as dean.
News broke last March that administrators had covertly searched the email accounts of resident deans in connection to the Government 1310 case, and as Hammonds’s role in the secret investigation became clearer, some Harvard community members called for her resignation.
On Thursday, dressed in a dark pinstripe suit, Hammonds addressed the crowd from a podium just a few feet from where she last spoke publicly about the searches last April. It was then that she told faculty members that she had authorized an additional round of covert searches of a single resident dean’s email accounts without Smith’s consent, violating FAS policy. Many have speculated that those searches, executed last September, may have cost Hammonds her job, a claim Hammonds refuted in May when Smith announced that she would be stepping down.
On Thursday, she told colleagues that she felt honored to have served as the head of the College for the last five years. In remarks that lasted just a few minutes, she thanked staff, the Harvard University Police Department, and members of the faculty for making her feel a part of the Harvard community during her tenure.
The event was not the first held in Hammonds’s honor since Smith’s announcement in May or since Hammonds officially left University Hall on July 1. College staff and House Masters have honored Hammonds on a number of occasions already, including a BBQ last spring and an evening at the Queen’s Head, Eck said in her remarks.
But Thursday was the first time since Hammonds concluded her run in University Hall that the full faculty had a chance to recognize her work. Over cocktails and hors d’oeuvres, professors—including interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister—chatted with Hammonds and shared hugs. An extended applause in Hammonds’s honor followed the afternoon’s speeches.
Hammonds, who is on sabbatical for the 2013-2014 school year, is expected to launch a new initiative on the study of race and gender in science and medicine in coming months, to be housed in the recently unveiled Hutchins Center for African and African-American Studies. Hammonds is also expected to resume her teaching duties in the History of Science Department and the African and African-American Studies Department next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard Yard has traditionally been home to pedestrians, cars, and wayward bicycles, the Harvard University Police Department introduced a new means of locomotion this spring to the Cambridge and Allston campuses: the T3 Patroller, a three-wheeling vehicle with zero emissions, a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour, battery life for up to 12 hours, and the capacity to captivate throngs of curious passersby.
HUPD currently operates two T3 transports, with 10 to 15 officers volunteering to man the vehicle between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. each day of the week, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Officer Brian Spellman, one of the officers operating a T3 Thursday, said that the response to the vehicles has been “entirely positive.”
Officer Thomas F. Karns Jr, another T3 driver, agreed with Spellman.
“I have worked here for 11 years, and I have never had so many conversations started by a piece of equipment,” he said. “People just come up to you and want to talk about it. They want to know what it is. They compare it to the Segway.”
HUPD Sergeant Wilmon D. Chipman compared the response to the introduction of the HUPD bike patrol, a program first started in the spring of 1996 and one that continues today.
Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the vehicles, officers noted that the T3s also face certain limitations, particularly in regards to the weather.
“You cannot ride in all conditions,” Chipman said. “Sometimes it gets really slippery.”
In order to drive the T3s, officers must first undergo a mandatory training course that can take up to four hours, Chipman added.
Catalano said that the T3s were bought as part of HUPD’s efforts to become a more environmentally friendly police force. The purchases were  sponsored by the Office for Sustainability’s Green Revolving Fund. According to Colin B. Durrant, a spokesperson for the Office for Sustainability, the use of T3s has allowed HUPD to produce “almost zero emissions.”
Durrant said that vehicular change “speaks to both the Chief’s and the Police Department’s leadership, in terms of really taking on the University commitment to [addressing] climate change seriously.”
Officers said that the use of T3s has also made HUPD more accessible to the students and tourists of Harvard Yard, a statement which was supported as a crowd of tourists gathered around the two vehicles early Thursday morning to pose with the officers and take pictures.
While the program has been successful so far, Catalano said that HUPD does not have any plans to expand the number of T3s in the near future. “At this point we really want to run them for awhile and see how it goes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a controversial portrayal of gender culture by an article in The New York Times, members of the Harvard Business School community criticized the paper’s coverage for representing only a small fraction of student experiences and for misrepresenting gender-related initiatives at HBS.
The article, which was published in The New York Times on Sept. 7, detailed cases of reported gender imbalances at HBS and explored initiatives that the school undertook to correct perceived inequities.
The publication of the article prompted two op-eds in The Arbus, HBS student newspaper, both of which criticized The New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor’s depiction of students at HBS.  Critics focused especially on the depiction of the school as a hostil environment for females.
Assistant professor Pian Shu, who arrived at HBS in 2012, said that her experience at the school does not resemble the one described in the article.
“The article cherry-picks one experience and highlights it. That’s a very particular experience,” Shu said. “The New York Times article implies students are here to be jerks; but that is not true. Everyone is here to have the best time. There is a learning curve for students and faculty, but everyone has the best intentions.”
For Professor Janice H. Hammond, who has been at HBS for 29 years and was involved in changes the school made to address gender inequities, the article’s primary problem was its portrayal of the school’s gender-related initiatives. She criticized the way the article—and subsequent letters to the editor—that The New York Times published implied that the increase in females graduating in the top 5 percent of the class was artificial.
“There is the suggestion that somehow faculty has been told to grade women more easily,” Hammond said. “That is not true. I have been to faculty meetings. I have talked to my colleagues. Those women earned it.”
While Hammond acknowledged that there are some gender imbalances at HBS, she said that those imbalances are not unique to the school.
“I have at times had concerns about the culture for women in our classrooms and schools, but I don’t think we’re unique in having a problem. Society has a problem in recognizing women, and I don’t think it’s surprising that would show up at our institution,” she said. “We are trying to be conscientious of these things, and we are looking at steps we can take, in a very earnest way.”
Eric B. Lonstein, a second-year student at HBS who authored one of the two op-eds in The Arbus about the Times story, acknowledged that the article raised some important challenges that HBS and the business world face, but added that it was ultimately an unfair representation of HBS.
“I also believe that there were important aspects of HBS culture that were not discussed in Ms. Kantor’s piece, and I hoped my article would help create a more complete picture of what the student body is like at HBS,” Lonstein said.
In a letter to the student body at HBS after Kantor’s article was published, Senior Associate Dean Youngme E. Moon encouraged students to take the opportunity to discuss issues of gender and create change in the culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sarah Rankin, the administrator who expanded programming aimed at educating students about sexual prevention and awareness, will depart Harvard at the end of the month to fill the recently created position of Title IX Investigator for MIT.
“While this is without a doubt a loss for Harvard, it represents a great new opportunity for Sarah, and I am delighted for her and this exciting new experience,” director of Harvard University Health Services Paul Barreira wrote in a late August email to colleagues announcing Rankin’s departure.
Rankin leaves Harvard after seven years as director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. At various points during her time as director, issues surrounding sexual assault and Harvard’s associated policies were the focus of heated debate and discussion on campus.
In an email to The Crimson on Thursday, Rankin highlighted her work with OSAPR peer educators; Response peer counselors; and individuals involved in Consent, Assault Awareness, and Relationship Educators, or CAARE.
She wrote that she will miss working with those groups when she leaves Harvard.
“It was a joy getting to know those smart, passionate, and thoughtful students who spend their precious free time volunteering to make the world a better place,” Rankin wrote. “They inspired me every day.”
Undergraduates praised Rankin for her accessibility and ability to connect with students.
Sally M. Castillo ’14, a member of CAARE, commended Rankin’s passion for her job and for students.
“She really has students’ best interests at heart, and she has true empathy,” Castillo said.
Castillo added that she believes Rankin regarded her role on campus as more than “just a job.”
“She also really, really cares about everyone who calls her, about every instance of sexual assault, and she will do whatever she can to help the students on campus,” Castillo said.
Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said she has communicated with Rankin multiple times, discussing issues including the referendum on Harvard’s sexual assault policy that undergraduate voters approved last fall in the UC presidential election.
“In all of my interactions with her, she’s been extremely open to having a dialogue with students, and I think conveys well that she cares a lot about the work that she does,” Raghuveer said.
Those who worked with Rankin said they expect her legacy to be long-lasting. In his announcement email, Barreira wrote that Rankin will “leave behind a legacy that will continue well beyond her tenure at HUHS.”
Raghuveer said she hopes Rankin’s accomplishments will carry on beyond her departure.
“My hope is that the programming that she leaves behind will continue to move in the direction of progress that she’s pushing towards,” Raghuveer said.
For her part, Rankin wrote that she hopes her legacy will be “the strong peer education program” she leaves behind at OSAPR.
According to Barreira’s announcement email, administrators will conduct a search to fill the OSAPR director position, though he did not specify a timeline for that search.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been over 30 years since the Harvard football team has flown to play a game, but that drought is about to end. On the current squad’s first-ever flying road trip, the Crimson will board the plane to San Diego, where it will open its season against the Toreros on their home turf.
“It’s the first game, so everyone’s always excited,” junior quarterback Conner Hempel said. “We’ve been playing all preseason against ourselves, we’re really looking forward to playing another team.”
The meeting between the two teams will be just the second ever. In last year’s contest, Harvard fashioned a fourth-quarter comeback against San Diego to hold the sole victory of the series, 28-13.
Toreros’ play-caller Mason Mills caused problems for the Crimson defense last year, finding receiver Logan Smith in the end zone late in the third quarter to give San Diego a 13-7 lead.
Then the Harvard offense turned on the engines, showing why it was the Ancient Eight’s most prolific squad in the 2012 season. The Crimson scored 21 unanswered points, beginning with a strike from quarterback Colton Chapple to tight end Kyle Juszczyk and ending with two scoring runs from tailback Treavor Scales.
But when the team faces San Diego this year, it will be doing so without Chapple, Juszczyk, and Scales, each a key element in last year’s firepower offense.
After a preseason competition during which he edged out senior Michael Pruneau, junior quarterback Conner Hempel will line up under center Saturday to start his first game for Harvard. Sophomore running backs Paul Stanton, who backed up Scales last year, and Zach Boden look to fill the gap left by Scales, who led the league in touchdowns in 2012.
The receiving corps has lost Juszczyk—now with the Baltimore Ravens—but Murphy is confident this year’s group will pick up any slack despite having a relatively inexperienced quarterback.
“In the end, to some extent, the offense and the quarterback is only as good as the guys around him, so while that may seem a question, we’ve got a couple of good running backs, we feel,” coach Tim Murphy said. “I feel like we’ve got two-deep at the receiver position. At tight end, [we have] guys like Cam Brate, wide receiver guys like Andrew Berg, Ricky Zorn, Seitu Smith, Andrew Fischer. So we feel like the pieces of the puzzle are there, we just have to put them together.”
On the other side of the ball, junior defensive end Zach Hodges and senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu will lead the defense against Mills, who threw for over 350 yards passing and set a school record for pass completions in last year’s contest.
The loss of players like former captain John Lyon and Grant Sickle opens the door for more inexperienced defensive linemen like sophomore Dan Moody and junior Obum Obukwelu, but also raises questions about the line that boasted the Ivy’s League’s top rushing defense in 2012.
The Toreros will be playing their third game of the season. But to make up for the disparity in playing time, Harvard has been playing an increased number of inter and intrasquad scrimmages to prepare for the season-opener.
“Coach Murphy, he’s a genius. He has a system in place where we try to match the number of games they play through scrimmages,” Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “We try to make our scrimmages game tempo, game environment to make sure guys are acclimated to the whole environment of playing in a game. So by the time we get to our first game we’re kind of even keeled almost, not sort of behind them in terms of conditioning or mental toughness.”
San Diego is holding on to a 13-game home winning streak and is coming off of its first victory of the season, but Hempel is confident that the team will be ready come Saturday afternoon.
“They have some type of alumni reunion coming back for the game, and that’s a pretty long home streak without a loss, so it’s going to be a tough game,” Hempel said. “But I think we’ve prepared well these two weeks and all preseason, and we’ve made big strides this week, so I think we’ll be prepared for a good game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Making predictions about the upcoming Harvard football season is a lot like reviewing a movie before stepping into the theater. We know we can trust the director, coach Tim Murphy, and several actors have played starring roles before. But with the wide release just hours away, we still haven’t even seen as much as a preview.
So let’s start with what we know with certainty about the 2013 team.
The list begins and ends with captain Josh Boyd. The third straight captain to play linebacker, Boyd is one of the hardest workers on the team, the leading tackler from a year ago, and a high school valedictorian to boot. Murphy has been calling him one of the best linebackers in the Ivy League for nearly two years now.
But after Boyd come questions.
Junior Zach Hodges and senior Nnamdi Obukwelu should be formidable on the defensive line, but will they be as dominant without John Lyon alongside them and lacking the depth that allowed them to stay fresh last season? While Boyd returns, the next four most accomplished linebackers won’t be with him Saturday. Three graduated and junior Jacob Lindsey is battling a hamstring problem, according to Murphy.
Then there is the biggest question mark of all: quarterback. Murphy ended a protracted battle by naming junior Conner Hempel the starter a week ago. Murphy sided with Hempel because he had more experience than senior Michael Pruneau, who missed last season with a knee injury. Hempel has thrown 24 passes in his college career.
In 10 of the last 12 years, the Crimson signal-caller has earned at least All-Ivy honorable mention. Hempel will have to outshine more experienced competition if he wants to continue the trend. Six of the seven other Ivies return their leading passer from 2012. Columbia, the only team that doesn’t, brought in Brett Nottingham from Stanford to compete for the job. ESPN ranked Nottingham as the 12th-best QB in the high school class of 2010. Hempel was ranked 65th.
Five Ivies also return their top runners. Harvard, on the other hand, has to deal with the loss of its top two. In their absence, two sophomores carry the load.
Of course, all the new names don’t ensure failure for the Crimson. We’ve seen players step up and shine before.  Answers, either good or bad, should come quickly as Harvard’s linchpins will be asked to prove themselves early in the year.
In its first Ivy matchup, the young Harvard offense will face Brown, the league’s top defensive squad last year. Then, the Crimson travels to Cornell. In Ithaca, Harvard’s secondary, which finished fifth in pass defense in 2012, will have to stop NFL quarterback prospect Jeff Mathews and the league’s most prolific passing offense.
And it doesn’t get much easier from there. In late October, Princeton comes to Cambridge a year after stunning Harvard, and Columbia has a chance at revenge in week seven after getting trounced, 69-0, last year. The Lions won’t lose by that many again this year; coach Pete Mangurian said so himself.
That leaves Penn and Yale for the final two weeks. Penn is the only Ivy that can boast a winning record against Murphy, and they’ll be just as tough this year as quarterback Billy Ragone returns for what must be his 12th season. And Yale, well, Harvard will probably beat it again.
Last year, the bottom-dwelling Elis’ only league win came over conference champion Penn.  With so many stars returning across the league, the Ancient Eight will be even less predictable this year.
Media members chose the Crimson to finish second in the preseason poll. It was a safe pick. Harvard has taken first or second in the league in 11 of the last 12 seasons. For over a decade, Murphy’s team has been the given in the Ancient Eight.
But this year, who knows? With so many questions, Harvard might be the least sure bet of the lot. If you want more insight than that, call me when the credits roll. For now, enjoy the show. It should be one of the most unpredictable in years.

SAN DIEGO--In its first-ever trip to Torero Stadium, the Harvard football team put an end to San Diego’s 13-game home winning streak.
Over 3000 miles from home, the Crimson never relinquished its lead en route to a dominant 42-20 victory. Junior quarterback Conner Hempel answered many questions in his first game as Harvard’s starter. Aided by an offensive line that allowed zero sacks on the day, he totaled 383 offensive yards—345 passing and 38 rushing—and four touchdowns with no picks.
“The line did a great job,” Hempel said. “I think that’s a strong point in my game—getting out of the pocket, seeing what happens down the field, and the receivers today did a great job getting open.”
Down by 15 points with 3:50 remaining, Toreros quarterback Mason Mills was picked off by junior cornerback Norman Hayes. Three plays later, Hempel found sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer, who weaved his way into the end zone to put the Crimson solidly ahead, 42-20.
“There’s a ton of room for improvement,” coach Tim Murphy said. “But we know we have a quarterback, and I thought that Conner more than anything played with a lot of poise and discipline, and made plays. Some of it was good execution by everybody, and some of it was good improvisation.”
Hayes also had 12 tackles to lead the defense, followed by senior DJ Monroe, who nearly picked off Mills twice and tallied eight tackles.
With the offense sputtering on its first drive, the defense scored Harvard’s first points of the year. With 5:22 left in the opening quarter, junior linebacker Conner Sheehan pressured Mills into coughing the ball up at the 47-yard line. Junior defensive end Zach Hodges scooped the ball and sprinted down the sideline for a score to give Harvard the early 7-0 lead.
“Coach Murphy always preaches playing through adversity,” Hodges said. “Two plays before that, I kind of caught a cramp, so I was like, ‘Oh, here’s adversity,’ so when I saw the ball, I was just hoping, ‘Please don’t get walked down,’ but we knew it was going to be a fight. We like a fight.”
After totaling just three offensive yards in the first quarter, Hempel showed why he won the starting job on his second drive.
In his first start as Harvard’s play-caller, the junior showed flashes of his dual-threat ability, scrambling for 30 yards and passing for another 29 on the Crimson’s first offensive scoring drive.
Sophomore Paul Stanton danced his way through defenders into the end zone to finish the drive with a touchdown. His scamper came just plays after a big run of his was brought back on a penalty. The score gave Harvard a 14-3 lead.
The Toreros answered back with ten unanswered points to close out the half. Montell Allen pushed his way into the end zone to bring the Toreros within four, and then a failed fake punt attempt following a three-and-out gave the Toreros the ball back at Harvard’s 30-yard line.
San Diego settled for a field goal before the teams headed into halftime with the Crimson up, 14-13.
After a slow start in the first half, the Crimson came out firing. With a 14-13 lead, Hempel drove the team down the field, finding Andrew Berg down the left sideline for a 34-yard gain before hitting Fischer in the back of the end zone to give the Crimson a 21-13 lead.
“[The touchdown] was huge,” Murphy said. “It started the momentum, and we really just never came off of it.”
The Crimson then went on a 14-0 run, with Hempel finding both sophomore tight end Ben Braunecker and senior Ricky Zorn for scores.
Mills, who finished with 293 passing yards and one touchdown, moved his offense efficiently up the field in the first quarter. The Toreros came close to knotting the game at seven apiece with a 3rd-and-goal at the four-yard line, but the Crimson stood its ground at the goal line, deflecting a pass and forcing a field goal to hang onto a 7-3 lead.
The defense kept pressure on Mills throughout, sacking him twice and forcing errant throws. A coverage sack by seniors Austin Taylor and Jack Dittmer led to excellent field position for Harvard, setting up the touchdown that would give the Crimson a two-possession lead.
Turnovers ailed both teams, with each coughing up two fumbles. Up by eight in the third quarter, Hempel found a wide open junior receiver Seitu Smith for what appeared to be a touchdown, but Smith fumbled the ball out of the end zone. On the ensuing possession, the Toreros returned the favor as fullback Joe Ferguson lost the ball at the goal line.

CORRECTION: Sept. 21, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of passing and rushing yards that junior quarterback Conner Hempel had against San Diego on Saturday. In fact, he had 345 passing yards and 38 rushing yards.

Harvard has once again reached that heralded moment in democracy: the time when students vote for their Undergraduate Council representatives. Although the freshmen candidates have been enthusiastically campaigning, most students have been underwhelmed by their options so far. Neither the professionally printed posters nor even the creative use of a disco ball by one candidate have bolstered student confidence in the abilities of their classmates. Thankfully, the international community has heeded the call for help, and several new candidates have thrown their hats into the ring at the last minute.
This fall, several world leaders have set their sights on Harvard, and they want more than a gig at the IOP. The unique experience and perspective that these candidates bring will surely bolster the strength and capabilities of the UC. In no particular order, we present the newest crop of candidates and, if they were running, what they might say to promote their candidacies to Harvard students.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: The former Iranian President is currently unemployed, and he hopes to take his talents to Cambridge. Not only was he originally trained as an engineer and teacher, but his experience as the party chief of the “Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran” will bring a completely new take to student organizing. Furthermore, when Ahmadinejad says the university must pay for students’ printing needs, you can take his threats of force very seriously.
Vladimir Putin: Russia’s president has been a bit preoccupied lately with Syria’s chemical weapons, but he’s not concerned with the extra commitment of a seat on the UC. In fact, this former KGB officer is one of the few people who can realistically claim to have eyes everywhere. For students who want a strong voice on the council, Putin offers an iron commitment to his principles and won’t back down from any intimidation. Should Harvard students get into trouble with the Ad Board, Putin has the unique ability to offer political asylum in the motherland, something no other candidate can match. Don’t pull an Obama and underestimate this guy.
Beyoncé Knowles: International sensation Beyoncé can do anything—sing, dance, act, and now even campaign. Beyonce has been all over campus recently, helping sophomores study in Lamont, serenading star-struck freshmen in Annenberg, and even helping some of Harvard’s more awkward students get down at the Rush Hour dance. She brings elegance and swag to a campaign that up to this point has been dominated by cold and dirty politics. If Beyoncé can’t persuade university administrators to improve dining hall hours, then no one can. She’s inspiring, she’s the closest thing to perfection we’ll experience in our lifetimes, and if you vote for her then maybe, just maybe, she’ll perform at Yardfest.
Barack Obama: We all know the troubles President Obama has recently faced. Struggles with congressional Republicans, leaks from within his own administration, and multiple crises in the Middle East have all undermined Obama’s agenda. The commander-in-chief has not been doing so well lately, and his bid for the UC is a redemption story in the truest sense of the phrase. Being the leader of the free world is stressful, and President Obama wants an opportunity to start anew on a smaller scale. He is ready to sacrifice the White House for Canaday, even if it means risking handing the nation’s reins over to Joe Biden. Obama knows how to campaign; he’ll only face his first real test if the Quad goes through with their plan to secede from the University. If you see the President desperately rubbing John Harvard’s foot, don’t be alarmed.

Harvard may have come in a dismal second place in the 2014 U.S. News and World Report’s ranking of the nation's top colleges, but our esteemed University came out on top in another recent list—but instead of for our glowing academics, this honor comes for having the sexiest college club in America.
And, no, it's not The Crimson—it’s Harvard College Munch, a kinky sex discussion group that Harvard officially recognized last fall and got the University a lot of attention in the media (though maybe not the kind of attention your parents want for your institution of higher education). The Ivy League had an impressive showing in the roundup, with Columbia’s Conversio Virium taking the second-place spot.
The rankings come from The Smoking Jacket, a Playboy-affiliated site. It may not be U.S. News, but hey, we’ll take what we can get.
 
This week, the Admissions Blog conducted interviews with students who applied early to several highly selective schools. Each of them had varying reasons for why they chose to apply early, and each had several insights to share.
Name: Gabe Cummings
Class Year: 2017
School: Columbia University
Application Type: Early Decision
Why did you decide to apply to your college early?Having lived in New York City all my life, I always knew I wanted to go to Columbia for college. Thanks to the counselors at our school, I was able to start smartly researching college options as early as sophomore year. The more I read and discovered Columbia, the more I realized that it was the perfect match for me. I was particularly attracted to its financial engineering and operations research majors. I visited Columbia regularly and had great conversations with professors, students, and even alumni. By junior year, some tourists mistook me for a student, because by then I knew almost every nook and cranny of Columbia's area in Morningside Heights. By the time I reached senior year, applying early to Columbia was a no-brainer. I remember sending in my application a month before the deadline!
What were the risks you considered when you chose to apply early?The biggest risk I had to consider was the possibility of there being another school better suited to me and my academic interests. Because I was so focused on Columbia all my life, the chance that I was missing out on another school. To 'counter' this though, I did my best to research not just Columbia, but a bunch of other schools as well. My college visits brought me to around eight schools I had my eye on, but ultimately, Columbia was the best for me!
Name: Katy Thompson
Class Year: 2015
School: Wesleyan University
Application Type: Early Decision II
Why did you decide to apply during the second round of Early Decision applications instead of the first?I decided to apply to Wes early because after visiting, I knew that this was the place for me. I applied early in the hopes of improving my chances of getting in. I applied ED II as opposed to ED I simply because I included an arts supplement which was not ready for the ED I deadline.
Name: Elliot S. Safo
Class Year: 2017
School: Harvard University
Application Type: Early Action (athlete)
How did you go about applying early as an athlete?I emailed the Harvard jumps coach around September 2012 to ask if there was any chance of me getting accepted. He asked for my grades and my track and field achievements, and about a month later he flew me over for an official visit and interview. The interview was surprisingly calm. There were no academic questions. The interviewer was just trying to get to know who I was. By December, I received my likely letter. I couldn't believe it when I got accepted.
Name: Richard Yue
Class Year: 2016
School: Brown University
Application Type: Early Decision
What timeline should students applying early follow?Finish taking all your standardized tests before the start of senior year. Finish the Common App and draft the supplemental information form in the summer before you apply. Finish up the supplemental information during the school year.
How did you find out you got in and what was your reaction?Since I was too nervous to do any work that day, I decided to play some basketball with some friends to get my mind off it. When the time came, I checked my phone and was ecstatic. Many friends congratulated me and I couldn't stop smiling till I fell asleep.
Name: Ines Diaz
Class Year: 2017
School: University of Pennsylvania
Application Type: Early Decision
Some schools have EA as opposed to ED, how did you choose between the two?For me, it came down to Yale, an EA school, and Penn, an ED school. While I was very much in love with Yale, a counselor told me that they don’t appreciate their early applicants as much as Penn does—there was no significant statistical advantage in applying early versus regular for our high school. Penn, on the other hand, welcomed ED applicants with an acceptance rate that was over double the regular decision acceptance rate.  And while that may account for a stronger, more college-ready pool, applying ED demonstrated my interest in the school more genuinely than any “Why College X” supplement I could’ve written.
Is there anything about the early application process you didn’t particularly like?The what-ifs. Definitely the what-ifs. To this day, I wonder what would have happened if I didn’t look at the statistics and sent my early application to Yale instead. Second to that, I sacrificed one more standardized testing opportunity. My SAT II was nowhere near where I would’ve liked it to be and another shot at it would have quelled my anxieties, but the quantitative side of the application feels a lot less relevant on the other side of the acceptance letter.
Name: Michael Keppler
Class Year: 2017
School: Reed College
Application Type: Early Decision (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
Why did you end up choosing to go to to a different school than the one you applied early to?When I was in my freshman year of high school, my father sat me down and made me read the entirety of the 2010 Fiske Guide To Colleges. I closed that book with one school in my mind: Reed College. When the college app season came around, I obviously knew which college would be on the top of my list, however, it was not the one to which I applied early. I applied early to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, partially because of its excellent programs, and mostly because it was a safe bet for me. But I ended up choosing to attend Reed College because it had been my dream school since freshman year and because I felt like I would benefit more from going there than any other school.
Name: Arielle Basich
Class Year: 2015
School: Stanford University
Application Type: Early Application (Deferred)
Given that your early application was deferred, how did you deal with the wait?I applied EA to Stanford along with my twin brother. It was the only school we had in 	common, and we were also legacies, so I felt a lot of pressure to get in. However I also accepted 	the fact that it was pretty unlikely that I would, and that backup choices were necessary. I was deferred. I wasn’t particularly upset, I was mostly just angry. My mom took me 	out to dinner that night and she gave me some really great advice: “just pretend you got 	rejected, and focus on all the other great opportunities out there!” So I did. I put Stanford 	completely out of my mind, to the point where sometimes I really forgot that I wasn’t actually 	rejected. I finished the rest of my applications, chose a new first choice, and waited. I actually got really 	excited about the schools I was looking at, and when I got an acceptance letter from my new 	first choice I screamed. When I found out about Stanford, I was almost sort of numb. Not 	that I wasn’t happy, but I had literally convinced myself that I had been rejected, and then 	suddenly I had a whole new future in store. It was a lot to process. In a couple days though I did make my decision for Stanford 	and all of the excitement and happiness I’m sure I would’ve felt if I had been accepted early 	came rushing towards me. I know I made the right choice.
