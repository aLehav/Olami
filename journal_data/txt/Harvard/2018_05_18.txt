After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One hot Los Angeles summer, a series of strange and unexplainable events coincide: A string of dog murders plagues the city, and billionaire Hollywood mogul Jefferson Sevence goes missing. Meanwhile, Sam (Andrew Garfield, with a fluidly American accent), a 30-something year old in a bout of unemployment-provoked lethargy, spends his days loafing around in pajama pants and evading his landlord in an East L.A. apartment decked out with pop culture paraphernalia. Sam meets Sarah (Riley Keough), the girl next door who brings her dog to the neighborhood pool. When Sarah goes missing the next day, a strange, double-diamond symbol painted on the wall of her empty apartment, Sam takes it upon himself to find out where she went. With the help of the sheltered, local author (Patrick Fischler) of the eccentric ‘zine he reads, Sam unwittingly uncovers the conspiracy that underlies not only that summer’s mysteries, but sex, fantasy, and pop culture as he knows it.
“Under the Silver Lake” is a pretentious amalgam of male paranoia, teeming with dreamy desperation to discover the secret rules and hidden codes of the world around us to understand one’s place in the world. Director David Robert Mitchell lays solid groundwork for a tragicomic neo-noir, a Lynchian palimpsest that promises to reveal the dark rot under the surface of perennially sunny Los Angeles days. Mitchell’s imagery simmers evocatively, refreshingly trippy—though it all seems to gesture at a statement that he hasn’t clarified, even to himself, like a string of blissed-out, drug-addled musings he scribbled while half-asleep. What’s left is a film that quickly devolves into pretension by its second act, unraveling faster than the mystery at Sam’s feet.
At the center of “Under the Silver Lake” is a cluster of male anxieties about female sexuality, and the desire to control it. Mitchell’s characters seem to at least be partially self-aware of it: “All these holy trinities of women, turning like ants under the magnifying glass of the male gaze,” a girl says, monotone, at a party. And there are more than a couple: There’s Keough’s Sarah, who prances around in a white bikini, accentuated by purposeful camera zooms on her backside, or in a “Something’s Got to Give”-inspired dream sequence, completely nude by the pool. There’s the unnamed Actress (Riki Lindhome) who occasionally visits Sam for casual, distracted sex in a cartoonishly “sexy” costume from the pages of the Party City Halloween catalogue. There’s Millicent Sevence (Callie Hernandez), the billionaire’s daughter, a classic film-noir beauty. But perhaps by parading these women around, each in a costume skimpier than the last, “Under the Silver Lake” reproduces the very repression it intends to critique.
But “failure to critique” isn’t a shortcoming that can be reasonably applied to “Under the Silver Lake,” which in a 139-minute runtime manages to critique every Hollywood institution under the dependable Los Angeles sun. More than a few characters, including Garfield’s progressively more unstable Sam, launch into infuriated tirades about everything from entertainment to pop music, from capitalistic wealth to the homeless. At the forefront of these is a diatribe about the superficiality of Los Angelean glamour and success, and the misplaced hope of the young people who hunger for a place in it—as well as the corporate greed underlying the glittery promises of the Dream Factory. When Sam stumbles into the stucco mansion of a famous and elusive songwriter, full of pop culture memorabilia, he expects to find the answers to the puzzles he’s been chasing down, the revelation at the end of the tunnel. He’s shocked to find out that the proprietor of Kurt Cobain’s original guitar is markedly cynical: “I don’t care what’s fashionable or cool,” says the songwriter (Jeremy Bobb), whose piano-playing rapidly switches tack from one iconic anthem to another, the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” to Joan Jett’s “I Love Rock n’ Roll.” He continues, “It’s all meaningless. When you were 15 and rebelling, you were doing it to my music. There is no rebellion. There’s only me earning a paycheck… Everything that you hoped for is a fabrication. Your art, writing, pop culture, is a shell of another man’s ambition.”
Sexuality, culture, myth: All is eroded as Sam begins to uncover the truth about his world, the secret codes in pop songs that become progressively elusive the more he tries to hunt them down. As Sam becomes increasingly embedded in the conspiracy, it becomes harder to ascertain what’s dream and what’s reality, until the two meld together in one psychedelic, unhinged string of loosely connected events. A nightmare about a gutted dog and a zombified Sarah, feasting on the entrails of a dead man, closely follows a surreal vision of a squirrel dropping dead from a tree and landing in a bloodied splat on the pavement. A coyote leads him on a wild chase to another glitzy party. There’s a statement here, about spirituality and sex and fame, but it’s elusive and just out of reach, slightly too surreal to be anything more than a string of resonant images. Meanwhile, the landlord’s irritation at Sam’s incompetence builds. But Sam could care less about responsibility, indulging in the pursuit of the riddles, hellbent on cracking the code at any cost. It is, after all, the only thing that gives him purpose. The City of Angels was never so full of demons.

In Gaspar Noé’s “Irréversible,” a man is pummelled to death with a fire extension, his killer mistaking him for the rapist who savagely brutalizes a young woman in a scene that lasts a full 10 minutes. In “Love,” which premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Gaspar Noé explores sex in all its 3D glory, from a threesome to a shot of a male ejaculating right into the audience. This time, Noé explores the effects of drugs on a dance troupe snowed into their rehearsal space, an abandoned building, in his entry into this year’s Directors’ Fortnight competition, “Climax.” The film opens with a chilling shot of a woman dressed in black, her arms bloodied, running hysterically in a field of endless white snow. Then, like a classic, pre-“Star Wars” film, the opening credits roll. The film is purposefully misleading, starting off as a well-choreographed dance sequence that devolves into an equally well-choreographed collective psychotic breakdown as the drug kicks in, initially unbeknownst to its consumers. What follows is a trippy prism of an arthouse film that succeeds in its attempt to destabilize its audience into the same debauchery as its characters, though at times the actors and director, too, fall into the easy trap of overdoing it.
Before things get too crazy, though, Noé introduces us to his characters first in an interview-style tape recording, then in a few dance sequences that speak to his technical prowess. The camera moves back and forth, left and right, up and down, flawlessly mirroring the dancers’ effortless movements. First is a carefully choreographed dance, the actor’s practiced and precise movements belying what is to come. Then comes the intoxication, the camera lingering a little too long on the bowl of sangria the dancers incessantly drink from, and it’s here that we meet our cast.
We have a semi-incestuous brother/sister duo, a German blonde named Psyche (Thea Carla Schott) whose (ex?)girlfriend Alaya (Alaia Alsafir)—a miniature version of her—wants something more, and Omar (Adrien Sissoko), who eventually becomes a victim of the troupe’s savage group decision to kick him out into the cold to freeze, among others. Sofia Boutella stars as Selva, the troupe’s leading dancer (though just like her acting, her dancing barely emotes). Souheila Yacoub is her companion, their conversation alluding to her dreaded pregnancy: “You ever had an abortion?” she asks. Selva elusively answers, “It’s good to have a choice, don’t you think?” Unfortunately for them and the other dancers, there is no choice as they unknowingly drink LSD-laced sangria, launching them into chaos.
As music blasts throughout the whole film—Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, etc., as several title cards somewhat obnoxiously inform the viewer—the film rolls into its second half, where Noé perpetually keeps us guessing when we will finally reach “Climax”’s climax. It’s not when Psyche pisses freely on the floor, fully clothed, in front of everyone, or when a woman accidentally gets lit on fire in her attempt to salvage the remainder of her cocaine, or when Selva runs away from David (Romain Guillermic), who is obsessed with her, right into Alaya’s arms. But it is in this process, this gradual degeneracy, that Gaspar’s restraint slowly disintegrates, the movie becomes a mashup of green, red, blue empty hallways, dirty bathrooms, and unkempt bedrooms that drag out the film unnecessarily. For Noé, this is the point. After all, “Life is a collective possibility,” and “Death is an extraordinary experience,” as more incomprehensible title cards read.
But what Noé does not realize is that he needs neither the pomp nor the pop to simultaneously denounce drug abuse and concoct a horrifically distorted ideation of the mother in the entertainment industry. He succeeds in the devastating depiction of Emmanuelle’s (Claude Gajan Maude) depraved motherhood to her son Titos, who she locks in an electric room full of cockroaches before losing the key, his screams for his mother reverberating as each character passes by; in the vicious mob mentality that overtakes the drugged crowd, when Souheila Yacoub’s character is brutally beaten, driven to cutting herself in her insanity despite not having drunk anything in her pregnant condition, which almost everyone denies; in Noé’s less successful, perhaps unintentional homage to Andrzej Żuławski “Possession,” splitting Isabelle Adjani’s famous subway scene into Boutella’s pantyhose entrapping and Yacoub’s implied miscarriage. Noé’s depiction of both potential and actualized motherhood in entertainment is an unexpectedly irksome commentary on the unsuitability of children for a woman trying to make it big. “I’m protecting him from all of you,” yells Emmanuelle to justify her son’s fatal imprisonment. But what Titos really needs protection from is Emmanuelle, and the drug-ridden world she finds herself in.
As the film finally climaxes to anticlimactic results, mitigated by the growing anticipation built throughout, you’re left wondering what the point was. Was it to warn against the danger of drugs, particularly of LSD, the drug implied to have been spiked in the sangria? Was it a statement on how mob mentality can be pushed to the deadly extreme in the short amount of time it took for the dancers to devolve into mania? Did Noé intend to paint such a bleak, hopeless image of women dancers—and never men—questioning the role children can have in their lives? Or was it just an exercise in restraint for the director, one he doesn’t always pass?
Regardless, it looks at the very least like Noé is finally starting to learn when to pull back on the extremes of his cinematic vision, barely controlling himself until he too can no longer hold off on exposing the climax within him in the camera’s loops and bounds throughout the warehouse.

Not too long ago, the superhero was a punchline, considered appropriate for children’s entertainment and not much else. Superheroes were largely confined to comic books and campy movies (think “Batman and Robin”). The idea that the major movie of the year might be a Marvel Studios superhero movie that serves as a more-or-less direct sequel to eighteen other such movies would have seemed like a joke, though perhaps too unrealistic to be funny. But the superhero movie is so dominant at the box office today that it resembles nothing so much as the golden age of the Western.
These thoughts are a little vague for an 800-word review. But it is hard to watch “Infinity War” without noticing, at the very least, the weight of its task: balancing the characters, subplots, and settings of eighteen prior movies while still delivering an entertaining spectacle that will keep people coming back for more. The film sags a little under such a burden, but perhaps any movie would. Maybe this review should primarily consist of praise for not collapsing completely.
Marvel movies traditionally stand on three legs: witty dialogue, computer-generated set pieces, and a reassuringly reliable character arc towards romance, friendship, and the assumption of great responsibility for whatever great power the protagonist has. The primary innovation of “Infinity War” is to kick out the third leg, relying on past audience goodwill for their stable of pre-developed characters. The resulting film, at best, is a nonstop back and forth between witty dialogue scenes and superhero fight scenes.
By and large, this approach sustains “Infinity War” for its 2 hour, 40 minute runtime. The dialogue is reliably and genuinely funny, with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) emerging as startling leaders in a movie-long race to the funniest quips. All of the actors, however, perform with the reliable charm we have come to expect from Marvel movies. And most of the action scenes are expertly crafted, with various superpowers being used against each other in surprising ways. One battle across New York City is absolutely electric, for instance, demonstrating incredible control of tempo, tone, and special effects.
The fights and the quips are what audiences have come to expect from Marvel movies, and they were done well here. But for better or worse, the Marvel movie consisting entirely of fights and quips has not yet been produced, and the choices made to fill in the gaps are unsatisfying ones.
The problems largely center around Thanos (Josh Brolin), the villain of the sprawling film, a large purple man who wants to wipe out half the universe’s inhabitants in a population control plan that suffers from a basic misunderstanding of exponential growth. In order to do that, he needs to collect six glowing jewels with which to decorate a very large glove. By virtue of the film’s structure, Thanos receives more screen time than any other character, but it is hard to overlook the fact that his character is very silly.
This silliness is somewhat unavoidable. The comic books Thanos was pulled from were often silly, frequently by design. Unfortunately, the directors and writers (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) decided to respond to that silliness not by leaning into it, but by attempting to make this large purple man the most villainous villain that ever did villainy in the Marvel Universe. So Thanos kills people, and he kills superheroes. A lot of them. But “Infinity War” overshoots the mark, killing so many that the response becomes numbness, not horror, and a cynical skepticism that most of these people will actually stay dead.
The film opens with an extended sequence in space introducing Thanos that should have been cut altogether—it added nothing to the plot that was not mentioned later, did not develop any characters, and was not colorful (especially unforgivable in a film like this, since most extraterrestrial locations are presented as riots of color, exotic foreign lands for a globalized age). But worst of all, it simply was not fun. The movie has a number of such sequences—torture scenes, execution scenes, exposition scenes almost as tortuous as the first two. Most of them should have been cut. It is as though the writers were warned that movies had to include more than jokes and action, but barely remembered how to do anything else.
And yet, despite it all, “Infinity War” is exciting every step of the way. Something fun or unexpected is always going to happen in the next few minutes. Your favorite character might not get enough screen time in this movie, but you can always see him or her in the next, or the one after, or the one after that. And if the history of the Western is any indication, there may be many more of these films to come. But like any genre, superhero movies are at their best when they can conjure up compelling new worlds and characters. “Infinity War” creates nothing. Once the credits start rolling, the show is over.

Five years after the release of their critically acclaimed and commercially successful album "AM," the Arctic Monkeys are back with a new album—one that is a far cry from the thumping bass of "AM" or even the high energy rock and roll of  "Suck It and See" (2011). "Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino" boasts vintage sounds, pianos galore, and Alex Turner's sexy, dark drawl. It is an entirely different world for this English rock band from Sheffield, who first rose to prominence in 2006 with their debut rock album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not." Surprisingly, the sound of this album closely mirrors that of lead singer Alex Turner's collaboration with Miles Kane, "Everything You've Come to Expect" (2016). Though this is a departure from what the Arctic Monkeys have done in the past, this new album is a refreshing and much more experimental step for them—though perhaps not as sleek and put together as "AM.”While some of their older albums like "Humbug" (2009) seem to lack consistency in style,  "Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino" in some ways feels more cohesive—perhaps even a bit too much so as each record bleeds into the other, with no way of knowing when each song ends and when the next begins. Overall, the whole work sounds almost like one extended, languid track. Each features a heavy amount of piano and a smoldering space rock sound that is reminiscent of spaceships, the 1970s, and California deserts. This strange amalgamation works quite well as a steadily flowing drowsy cocktail held together by Alex Turner's stunning stream-of-consciousness vocals. His voice features more prominently here than on any other Arctic Monkeys record, such that it sometimes comes off as more of a solo work than a collaboration. Bassist Nick O'Malley and drummer Matt Helders get much less attention, but do what is necessary to carry each song through. Having said that, guitarist Jamie Cook does get a few guitar solos peppered across, including a particularly vivid one on the strenuous political track "Golden Trunks."  The rest of the band also helps Turner create the album's lonely, eerie mood through falsetto background singing. For the most part, this pared-down style is almost necessary as it allows listeners to concentrate on the wonderfully bizarre fusion of the cosmos and vintage LA vibes which are no less spirited then their past records.Turner has penned much more opaque lyrics for this work than in any others. Gone are Sheffield pubs and sweaty nightclubs. These songs touch on everything from politics (like in "Golden Trunks") to fame (like with "Star Treatment.")  More than anything, there is a large focus on sci-fi ("Science Fiction" and "Four Out of Five") and technology ("Batphone" and "The World's First Ever Monster Truck Front Flip.") The lyrics largely don't follow any logic and, more often than not, they trip on their own muddled metaphors and allusions, but Turner is the first to acknowledge this lack of cohesion: "Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought." Turner also expresses his derision towards the growing use of cellphones as on "Batphone" when he croons: "Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole / Through a handheld device?" The lyrics of many of the records feature incredibly tongue-in-cheek phrases ("The exotic sound of data storage / Nothing like it, first thing in the morning") and images ("Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form") that call to mind the candor and dourness of their earliest works, but for the most part these wild, imagistic phrases serve to mark the band's change and progression. This is not an album about falling in love or painting portraits of hometown characters, nor is it a critique of our modern day habits either. The lyrics are much too unrooted to do such topics full justice, but they speak to this world nonetheless, and explore the conceptual idea of time in a fascinating way. While fans of "AM" will not necessarily fall over for this psychedelic style and even older fans will continue to miss the old, aggressive guitars, "Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino" is a strong and remarkable work. It might take a few listens to get into its noir-esque groove, but it is easy to slip into its cracks and find yourself marveling at its strange lyrics and jazzy style. The Arctic Monkeys should be delighted that they have created an album that is definitely equal to if not more than "Four Out of Five."—Staff writer Aline G.

“That’s the problem with flooding—flooding doesn’t stop, it doesn’t recognize boundaries,” Doug P. Brown says, his words bouncing off the auditorium’s concrete walls.
His audience sits upright, captivated, their folding chairs creaking in unison. “It only recognizes elevation—higher wins, lower losses,” Brown continues.
Brown advances the slideshow projected behind him. A map fills the screen, its segments divided and labeled to represent Cambridge’s neighborhoods. Dashed blue lines bleed across West Cambridge and over Fresh Pond. “This is the floodplain,” Brown adds.
Sharp inhales rise from the Cantabrigian audience assembled in John M. Tobin Elementary School, which, at only four meters above sea level, sits squarely within the floodplain. These residents, most of whom are elderly and have lived in Cambridge for decades, are members of the Fresh Pond Residents’ Alliance, a group that is currently drafting a citizen’s petition to the Cambridge City Council calling on the council to better safeguard the community from the impacts of climate change. This meeting centers on that petition.
“Incursions have been made into the open space floodplain to the point where it could be at the tipping point unless we curb [development] now,” Ellen Mass, a local environmental activist, says at the neighborhood meeting. By “incursions,” she means a 299-unit apartment complex in the Belmont Uplands, partially constructed on the 15 acre Silver Maple Forest in 2015.
One of the provisions of the petition aims to instate more requirements on the acquisition of Special Permits for development on floodplains. These new requirements would make it harder to build new infrastructure on land that is prone—and almost guaranteed—to flood.
“It’s a matter of when, not if,” says Daniel P. Schrag, a Geology professor who directs the Harvard University Center for the Environment. Schrag, a climate change specialist and a former member of President Obama’s Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, predicts that rising sea levels will intensify the impact of flooding following a strong storm—unleashing unprecedented devastation across the Boston area.
“The problem is not that sea level rise will come and flood everything by itself,” Schrag clarifies. “It’s a nor’easter.” Schrag anticipates that a nor’easter could create a storm surge that tops the New Charles River Dam, flooding vulnerable neighborhoods like Back Bay, Allston, and West Cambridge. An event on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would mean “ecological devastation” for the Charles River, which would be completely inundated with saltwater, and would also destroy homes and power grids across the floodplain, he says.
Cambridge is currently protected by the Charles River Dam and the Amelia Earhart Dam on the Mystic River, which help mitigate the flooding Cambridge receives, according to John Bolduc, Environmental Planner at the Cambridge Community Development department.
“The kind of high-tide flooding you saw in Boston and elsewhere on the coast this winter did not affect Cambridge because the dams kept the water at bay,” he says, referring to the 13-foot tides that flooded over 8,000 residences in Quincy in early March. “Our studies indicate that those dams will continue to be very effective in protecting Cambridge from that kind of flooding for a few more decades, so we think it becomes a significant risk closer to mid-century.”
The Cambridge Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment, a city-sponsored initiative that seeks to identify the ways that the community will become vulnerable to climate change, states that the Alewife-Fresh Pond area is at greatest risk of storm surge flooding by 2070. The city has already taken steps to protect Fresh Pond, a drinking water reservoir, from flooding.
One such landscape improvement project involved building hummocks to shield the reservoir from the projected 2070 storm surge, according to Bolduc. Meanwhile, parts of Harvard’s campus, including the Yard, sit at a much higher elevation and are at a lesser risk of being flooded.
The city has taken steps to plan for climate change and its associated flood risks, according to Bolduc— In one example, Cambridge has developed plans to install berms in strategic locations along the Mystic River and large underground storage tanks in the Port neighborhood to reduce flooding. In another, the city is collaborating with regional climate task forces in Boston.
But for Schrag, projects like the CCVA fail to implement specific measures to protect the city from the impacts of climate change. “I’m a little frustrated, personally. In my experience, there’s a lot of planning going on, but they’re not actually doing much,” he says.
“It can take months – sometimes years – to collect necessary the technical analysis and engage the community around the City’s most pressing needs, but careful and deliberate planning is necessary for guiding the future development, growth, and resiliency of Cambridge,” Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, wrote in an email.
“Planning is great, but, ultimately, action matters,” says Schrag.
That’s where the citizen’s petition comes in. While citywide projects like the CCVA have “studied the problem,” the petition outlines the “the concrete steps of what would actually change to yield the results that they proposed up to this point,” explains Brown, who co-authored the petition with fellow Cantabrigian Mike Nakagawa.
The citizen’s petition, titled “Zoning Amendments for a Flood and Heat Resilient Cambridge,” proposes specific amendments to improve city open space, infrastructure, and stormwater management. It expands existing zoning requirements to improve overall climate resiliency and community health and safety, according to the cover letter Brown and Nakagawa sent to the city council.
Specifically, the petition urges restricting the placement of flood barriers around properties—a move that can endanger neighboring plots of land. These raised barriers, including berms and floodwalls, effectively keep water out of the properties they surround—but at the cost of pushing water into adjacent ones. The petition proposes a system under which developers would have to seek a special permit prior to building berms and only allows berms to be built on the condition they have no adverse impact on neighboring properties.
“One of my fears for the long term is that just like housing, just like economic opportunity, there’s a social justice component to climate change as well,” Brown says. “Some people are gonna win and some people are gonna lose.”
At the meeting, one resident mentioned the perception that the petition may harm plans for developing affordable housing in Cambridge. The allegation is often raised by developers, who claim  the environmentalists are motivated by a “not in my backyard” mentality to argue against affordable housing.
In response,Brown affirmed that the petition is “housing-neutral.” The petition does not  restrict the amount of square footage or number of units available for housing. Rather, it is concerned with “future-proofing” the community so that affordable housing is not  developed on property that will likely become flooded within a decade. “When we look at the development here, we want to make sure that it’s responsible and that going forward, it’s resilient; that we’re not, in effect, putting people in harm’s way,” says Brown.
Many residents speak about this issue in terms of winning or losing; in terms of battle. As the meeting adjourns and people file out of the school and into their Priuses, Ellen Mass insists that they’ve been on the ground for years.
“We know the land,” she says.
Maybe it is time to get to know the water.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust sent a letter Wednesday to a bipartisan group of lawmakers advocating on behalf of those affected by the Trump administration’s rollback of Temporary Protected Status protections.
TPS is a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters, including El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan. Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush first instituted the program in 1990.
Over the past few months, the Trump administration announced plans to end TPS protections for people from El Salvador, Nepal, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Sudan, leaving hundreds of thousands of  individuals’ legal status in limbo.
Faust’s May 16 letter—co-written with Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber—is addressed directly to Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, House Judiciary Committee chair Bob Goodlatte, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler. The letter asks the lawmakers to “act quickly to advance legislation that provides TPS recipients with continued status to live and work in the U.S.”
“Unless Congress acts, hundreds of thousands of TPS recipients, including many who contribute as employees at our institutions, will soon lose their ability to work legally in the U.S. and will become subject to deportation,” Faust and Eisgruber wrote.
The terminations could have ramifications for a number of Harvard and Princeton affiliates protected under TPS, according to the letter. Dozens of University employees currently have TPS status.
“Several dozen of these individuals work across multiple departments at our universities and are highly valued and productive colleagues,” Faust and Eisgruber wrote. “We should recognize and celebrate the contributions of these individuals, who have made a home in the United States and benefitted  our economy and our nation.”
Faust and Eisgruber added that providing protections for these individuals would be the “fair, just, and right thing to do.”
The letter does not mark the first time Faust has raised concerns about TPS terminations. Faust met with lawmakers in Washington in March to discuss legislation meant to prevent lapses in TPS protections, she said in a March interview. Faust added that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senator Michael Bennet, and Rep. Rosa DeLauro were “very helpful” in those discussions.
Faust also penned a letter to House and Senate leadership in February emphasizing the contributions of Harvard employees protected under TPS. That letter came a week after 50 TPS-holding workers and their allies rallied outside Massachusetts Hall and delivered a petition calling on Faust to write to lawmakers on their behalf. Affiliates of universities across the Boston area joined Harvard students and workers for another rally in March.
Faust has been an outspoken advocate for undocumented students and immigrants at Harvard and in higher education more broadly. She has recently signed letters, appeared on national television, and met with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to voice her support for immigration reform.
