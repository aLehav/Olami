After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 27, 2012, an op-ed in the New York Times by Joe Nocera brought attention to Temi Fagbenle ’15, a star basketball player who has been barred by the National Collegiate Athletic Association from playing at a college level. Her crime? Repeating her junior year after transferring from the United Kingdom to the United States and for taking the General Certificate of Secondary Education, a required examination for all British students around the age of 15.  As a result of a technicality of the rules of the NCAA, her actions have kept her off of the court. After making four separate appeals and retaining a lawyer with the help of Harvard, Temi eventually decided not to pursue plans to sue the NCAA for violating state antidiscrimination laws. Harvard, however, should have taken a stance for Temi Fagbenle not only to protect a student who has been grossly wronged, but also to help ameliorate wider and more endemic problems with the NCAA.
Temi has managed to rack up a significant number of titles and awards in her high school basketball career, including being named a McDonald’s All American and ranked number 13 overall and fifth at forward in the 2011 class by ESPN HoopGurlz. But her ability to continue her outstanding successes at Harvard has been curbed by seemingly reconcilable issues. The NCAA has mistakenly declared the GCSEs the graduation exams for British students. In fact, British students take GCSEs two years prior to A Level exams, which are taken in the year of graduation. Temi also repeated a year while studying at Blair Academy in New Jersey, which broke an NCAA rule dictating that British high school graduates enrol in university within two years of sitting the GCSEs. However, American students who repeat one or even two years of high school are still eligible under NCAA rules. In short—Temi is being punished for doing something that many other high school athletes do across the country, with no consequence, because of her different education. No student should be prohibited from playing because she studied in a different country.
One of its students has been treated unjustly and Harvard needs to step up.  It should make use of its vast resources and high visibility to pursue NCAA and call attention to these sorts of systemic problems with the organization. The NCAA is rife with problematic rules, like the 1.6 rule, a controversial policy opposed by the entire Ivy League.  Harvard may have already helped Temi retain a lawyer, but it needs to push forward and follow through with the suit.
Harvard has successfully provided legal help to students in tough situations in the past, as in the case of Eric Balderas. Surely the same logic should apply to athletes who have been unfairly treated. Harvard may not appear to be the most influential of athletic schools, but the college has an impressive array of prominent and respected coaches such as Kathy Delaney-Smith, Tim Murphy, Tommy Amaker, and Katey Stone who have influence in the NCAA. What’s more, Harvard can use its name recognition to take the issue one step further and make discrimination against students who come out of different systems or follow unorthodox careers a prominent feature of campus discourse around the country.
Harvard made a mistake in not helping Temi fight for her right to play basketball at this school. But it is not too late for this institution to take up the responsibility of protecting Temi and to campaign for change in the NCAA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its uniquely chaotic way, the Graduate Student Council began a process of self-examination last night. Prompted by a proposed resolution to express solidarity with nonviolent protests at universities across America, we started to address the question of whom we represent and what kinds of protests we consider appropriate.
The GSC is a body of students representing the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Department administrators generally appoint representatives on a volunteer basis—in other words, there is no formal or standardized election process. The primary job of the GSC is to allocate research and travel grants supported by the mandatory $25 fee assessed to every resident GSAS student in the fall of each academic year. Like us, many student representatives are first-years who are new to the University and have not yet had an opportunity to collaborate with other students in their departments. In addition, many departments have several representatives that attend the meetings on a rotating basis, so there is often a lack of continuity in representation between meetings.
For the most part, it is reasonable to state that GSC votes have largely been noncontroversial and unknown to the majority of the graduate student body. However, as reported in the Crimson on Thursday, we have begun a discussion over the last two months about whether the council should adopt the role of making political statements. Let us be clear, this debate is not about the proposed resolution to stand in solidarity with nonviolent protests. As a social worker and a nurse studying health policy, we are dedicated to issues of social justice. This debate, however, is about whether GSAS students want the GSC to represent them in this manner. Though this debate was triggered by the proposed resolution on nonviolent protests, it could have just as easily been started by a group presenting a resolution asking GSC to condemn the eating of animal products on campus, asking the GSC to stand in solidarity with pro-life groups, or even asking for an endorsement for a candidate of a political party. We believe the GSC should be as politically active as its voting members desire. And to ensure that this goal is met, we invite all GSAS students to the March meeting, when we will discuss these issues further. The meeting will be held March 7th in Longwood Medical Area in the TMEC Building.
In particular, we will discuss and vote on the following resolution: “GSC representatives shall be empowered to vote on issues of a political nature not uniquely related to the graduate school or graduate students.” There are 57 graduate divisions, departments, and committees in GSAS—each with its own delegation to the GSC—yet a mere 38 votes were recorded on last night’s resolution on nonviolent protests. It is obvious that this is not a clear majority. We have much more to discuss, and if last night’s meeting was any indication, it promises to be a lively discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan 31st, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation announced their decision to stop funding cancer testing and prevention at Planned Parenthood clinics. Komen is the largest breast cancer organization in the country, and funds research and advocacy as well as health services to fight breast cancer. Its pink ribbon has become a nearly ubiquitous sign of the organization’s successful marketing and awareness campaign.
Komen has funded Planned Parenthood for years, and funded over 100 thousand clinical breast exams through PP. Happily, the financial effects of Komen’s declaration on Planned Parenthood are shrinking every day, due to a spike in donations in protest of Komen’s decision. The most lasting consequence may in fact be the popular backlash that has shed light on Komen’s many vices and Planned Parenthood’s many virtues.
For one, Komen has unwittingly provided Planned Parenthood an opportunity to clarify the true scope of healthcare services they offer. Despite claims by conservative politicians, abortion constitutes only 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides. The remaining 97 percent include sexually transmitted diseases testing, cancer screening, and a wide variety of other primary healthcare services essential to women’s health. Additionally, Planned Parenthood mostly serves low-income and uninsured women from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds, exactly the population shown in public health research to have the lowest access to breast cancer screening programs.
In fact, Planned Parenthood’s breast cancer services are so vital that Komen’s Denver branch has announced that it is breaking from the national organization’s decision. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains has singlehandedly detected nearly 20 percent of all cancers that have been found through use of Komen Denver funding.
Ironclad results like these reveal the self-destructive nature of Komen’s defunding decision. Massive popular backlash aside, Komen has, in an instant, crippled their own ability to provide cancer screenings to women in need.
This debacle is merely the latest public embarrassment for the Susan G. Komen Foundation, an organization rapidly becoming known for accepting any corporate partnership that will generate press or money, regardless of its compatibility with a mission of ending breast cancer.
Most memorably, Komen recently launched the “Buckets for the Cure” alliance with Kentucky Fried Chicken. While the campaign probably generated money for both Komen and KFC, it also represented a surrealist pairing of cancer awareness and cancer-causing fried food. Sadly, this embarrassment was not an anomaly, as the organization’s willful ignorance of science was made clear by their repeated refusal to recognize the link between Bisphenol A and cancer. This suspiciously mirrored the strategy of the public relations departments of Komen’s corporate funders, Coca-Cola and Koch Industries, both of whom sell products containing BPA. These campaigns ignore true risk factors for cancer and run the risk of having an adverse effect on many underprivileged women while focusing instead on brand, image, and profits.
Although Komen has funded many worthwhile and important breast cancer programs, it has failed to maintain its commitment to public health and instead fallen prey to corporate and political interests. Sadly, this situation is far from unique in the non-profit world today. Increasing corporate influence and commoditization has distorted both the values and the methods of many non-profits. That money is used, among other things, to pay exorbitant salaries for executives who are increasingly disconnected from the communities that they purportedly serve. On average, chief executive officers of large non-profits in the USA took home close to $300,000 per year.
Indeed, members of Komen’s leadership seem focused on an agenda unrelated to cancer prevention and treatment. For example, Karen C. Handel, Komen’s new Senior Vice President of Public Policy, has had her eyes set on defunding Planned Parenthood for years. As a gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, she made defunding Planned Parenthood part of her political platform. She is also on record speaking out against Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender equality. If she continues to have influence at the highest leadership levels in this organization, it is harrowing to consider who else may be excluded from Komen’s breast cancer services in the future.
If Komen continues with irresponsible corporate partnerships and cuts essential programs over political disagreements, we must question whether this organization can be trusted to promote women's health. Its program of partnerships with corporations seems like a case of social conservatives and large corporations colluding to bend the non-profit sector to meet their own beliefs and line their pockets.
In contrast to Komen, Planned Parenthood has emerged from this debacle as a shining example of an organization providing basic women’s health care to the uninsured. Perhaps this distinction will allow donations to Planned Parenthood to increase while donations to Komen decrease. After all, pink spatulas can't actually screen for cancer. You know what can? Doctors at Planned Parenthood.

As Hollywood’s awards season builds to its glamorous finale, actress Meryl Streep has garnered critical acclaim for her role in The Iron Lady. In the film, Streep portrays the groundbreaking and controversial former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who has been characterized through the years by her staunch conservatism as much as her trademark hairstyle. Perhaps in part due to the film, the polarizing and decisive Thatcher has regained a place in both the popular and political consciousness, most notably in the Republican primary race, where candidates have held up Thatcher as an ideal leader. Thatcher’s career was shaped by conviction politics, meaning that she campaigned and governed with an emphasis on principle and adherence to ideology regardless of the cost. A brand of politics similar to the one she espoused has resurged, especially within the Grand Old Party. Such politics have their benefits, among them bolstering the support of a party’s base. But as Thatcher’s example shows, and as Republicans would be wise to take note of, conviction politics have their limits.
During her short-lived campaign, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann used Thatcher as a paragon of conservative female virtue, voicing her aspiration to be America’s own Iron Lady. Bachmann’s references to Thatcher had the added obvious benefit of tying the former candidate to a high-profile, accomplished conservative woman who held her country’s highest office. Thatcher is the figure that Bachmann’s supporters wished she had turned out to be: a smart, tough, and galvanizing conservative woman, poised to lead conservatives out of their latest wilderness.
Other Republicans have also praised Thatcher for her conservatism. They use references to her as a simple way to attach themselves to a proud conservative tradition, replacing “Reagan” with “Thatcher” when the former name seems overused. Of course, Bachmann’s prolific references had limited success in producing electoral victory using Thatcher’s legacy. Nonetheless, it is easy to see why Republicans on a larger scale have gravitated to the Iron Lady, who earned her nickname from her tough opposition to communism and underscored it with firm leadership through the 1980s.
The primary race is now devoid of a possible American Iron Lady, but much of the GOP still wants a comparable male nominee to oppose President Barack Obama in November. They want someone with a consistent record as a constitutional, fiscal, and social conservative who is unwilling to compromise right-wing principles in any context. This largely explains why the relatively liberal Mitt Romney has not yet been able to wrap up his party’s nomination. Despite his proven ability to fundraise, organize, and present a platform likely appealing to general election voters, he has faced continued opposition from those like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who are seen as more unapologetically conservative. The rest of the Republican field has appeared more proud and forthcoming than Romney in their respective political convictions, including the libertarian ones of Ron Paul, and they have all benefited from preaching the gospel of conviction politics, gaining support and slowing what had once been seen as Romney’s all but guaranteed run for the nomination.
Conviction politics carry appeal with a large segment of today’s Republican voters, but they are unlikely to have such a strong resonance with general election voters. That is not to say that conviction politics can never win races. As the 2010 midterm elections demonstrated with the influx of Tea Party-associated candidates into Congress, displaying unwillingness to compromise can bring electoral success. But this success is often highly limited, particularly when it comes to actual governance. Conviction politics are at the heart of major problems with how the US government, specifically Congress, works. Lack of compromise between the two major parties has resulted in less effective legislation being passed and the popular perception that the parties are too wrapped up in politics, bickering, and ideologies to listen to the American people and do what is best for the country.
There is no doubt that Margaret Thatcher was a bold, trailblazing leader whose controversial legacy will live on. Her relentless dedication to conservative values both drove her rise and prompted her downfall, creating divisions between her, the British people, and her own party. Conviction politics in the right place at the right moment can excite an electoral base and sweep a party into power. But they have their limits as well. They can be polarize, stall legislative progress, and create the kind of political environment that we have today. As Republicans look to Thatcher and other conservative lions, they would do well to recognize that there is more to effective governance than unwavering adherence to an ideology. Compromise is vital.

UPDATED: Feb. 3 at 4:09 a.m.
Harvard professor Homi K. Bhabha won one of India’s highest civilian honors this week, according to an announcement made last Wednesday by the Indian government. Bhabha, the director of the Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard and an acclaimed author on post-colonial studies, was one of 27 recipients of the Padma Bhushan this year.
“I was totally surprised,” said Bhabha, who said that he didn’t find out about the award until a cousin called him with the news.
Bhabha attributed his honor to his work exposing people around the world to post-colonial studies, a field that explores the relationships between European countries and their former colonial domains.
“It might also be because my work has been both international and interdisciplinary,” said Bhabha, who has published books on literature, philosophy, and other subjects.
Bhabha, who has lived and worked in the United States for years, was among the minority of recipients this year who do not reside permanently in India. 
“I think [the Indian government] is beginning to understand India not only in the national context, but in the diasporic context as well,” Bhabha said.
Students and faculty said that they have been impressed by Bhabha’s work at Harvard.
Divisional Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen said that Bhabha has been influential in the humanities and the University at large.
“He’s had a transformative effect as an interlocutor and convener, a visionary, and a brilliant intellectual,” she said.
“He has an air of erudition, but he’s also a friendly person,” said Amrita S. Dani ’13, who took a class taught by Bhabha during her freshman year. “He’s very good at making things accessible.”
She said that Bhabha’s course influenced her decision to concentrate in history and literature with a focus on post-colonial literature in the Middle East.
The Padma awards recognize Indian citizens for “distinguished service of high order” in a variety of fields. Bhabha won in the “Literature and Education” category. Other Indian-Americans who have received the award include Fareed Zakaria, who will speak at Harvard’s commencement later this year.
Bhabha said that he was “deeply honored” by the opportunity that the award affords him to further his work.
“It gives you a platform,” he said. “I just hope that I use it judiciously, and that I use it generously.

UPDATED: Feb. 4 at 3:58 p.m.
The U.S. Department of Education is currently investigating Harvard’s undergraduate admissions in response to a complaint that the process discriminates against Asian Americans, according to a Department of Education spokesperson.
In August, a student whose undergraduate application had been turned down by Harvard filed a complaint against the University, alleging that the rejection was based on race. The Department of Education decided to investigate the claim last month, according to the spokesperson, who asked to speak anonymously based on Department of Education policy.
The same student also filed a complaint against Princeton University, according to a report in Bloomberg News.
In a statement, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that the University could not comment on the specifics of a complaint currently under review.
“Our review of every applicant’s file is highly individualized and holistic, as we give serious consideration to all of the information we receive and all of the ways in which the candidate might contribute to our vibrant educational environment and community,” Neal wrote.
Ivy League universities have previously been investigated based on allegations that their admissions processes discriminate against Asian Americans. Jian Li ’10 filed a complaint with the Department of Education in 2006 after being rejected from Princeton, according to a 2008 story in USA Today. That case prompted a broader review of Princeton’s admissions practices.
Harvard’s undergraduate admissions office website says that “[t]here is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard” and that the “Admissions Committee does not use quotas of any kind.”
This type of “holistic” approach—which the College has employed for decades—has been cited by the Supreme Court as an appropriate way to consider race in admissions.
“In short, an admissions program operated in this way is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,” wrote Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the majority decision of the 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.
Law School professor Martha A. Field ’65, an expert in civil rights, said that the outcome of the current case would depend on the applicant’s evidence, pointing out that admissions officers look beyond numbers when making their decisions.
“For a long time people have talked about [Asian American discrimination] as a potential problem. It’s about time that we look into it,” Field said. “I really don’t know what will happen.”

Cambridge City Clerk D. Margaret Drury plans to retire in February after serving in the position for 20 years.
In her role as clerk, Drury dealt mostly with commonplace record-keeping for the city, but she once had a chance to make history.
In 2004, Drury officiated at the first legal same-sex marriage in the country. At midnight on the day same-sex marriage was legalized in Massachusetts, 10,000 people gathered in front of Cambridge City Hall to celebrate, Drury said.
“All day long at City Hall, there were marriages,” she said. “Marriage equality groups were there with a wedding cake from Rosie’s [Bakery] and giving out pink carnations.”
“I was mayor during the gay marriage stuff, so I saw how much it meant to her,” former Mayor Michael A. Sullivan said. “I was very proud of the way she handled it, the way she made sure it would go well. And you could see it in her face. You could really see the brightness in her eye, the lilt in her voice.”
Drury grew up in Randolph, Mass., and graduated from Suffolk Law School before she started working for the city in 1982.
When the City Council made the controversial decision to not renew the contract of her predecessor as city clerk, Joseph E. Connarton, she applied for the job.
“I thought, ‘Oh, I’ll try this for a couple of months.’ And that was in 1992, and I’ve been here ever since,” she said.
City Councillor E. Denise Simmons developed a relationship with Drury over their mutual “love of parliamentary procedure,” Simmons said. Simmons was interested in the procedural workings of the Council, and Drury was an expert. “The Council does its work as well as it does because of Margaret and her experience and attention to detail.”
Robert Winters, who teaches at the Harvard Extension School and writes an online journal about Cambridge politics, has called on Drury’s services many times.
“She’s been a great help,” he said. Winters once asked Drury to find records of all the people who had been city clerk since the city’s founding in 1632, a chore he said was the hardest task he ever asked of her.
At the Council meeting on Monday, he joked with Drury about pulling a bunch of records in her last month as clerk, but decided to save it for her successor.
“She’s a wonderful, wonderful person,” Councillor Craig A. Kelley said. “We will be sad to see her go.”

Threats to tie federal funding to the cost of university tuition are unlikely to affect Harvard, Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. said on a conference call with members of the media Thursday.
“Net tuition and financial aid will count...so that Harvard’s tuition could be going up, but because the fact of the matter is that the net tuition—what students are actually paying—may be going down, there would be no penalizing,” Biden told The Crimson.
“You’re safe at Harvard,” he added.
In his State of the Union address last week, President Barack Obama identified the rising cost of higher education as a key issue for middle class America and proposed tying federal funding for universities to the price of their tuition.
“So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down,” Obama said during his address to Congress.
Obama’s plan calls for increasing campus-based aid programs to $10 billion, directing that money toward programs like Perkins loans and federal work study.
Universities that are able to keep tuition costs in check while maintaining a high-quality education will be rewarded with additional federal funding.
During the conference call, Biden said that the amount of money allocated to institutions will be determined based on a “fair formula” that takes into account whether the university has a relatively low price tag and robust financial aid program.
He pointed out that the financial resources at most colleges are not comparable to those at Harvard, whose endowment is the highest in the country.
“Harvard has been a leader in addressing concerns about the cost of higher education,” Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations Kevin Casey wrote in a statement. “There is bipartisan agreement that access to a college education should be broadly available and we generally support measures that would make higher education more affordable.”
Harvard’s financial aid program is often praised as one of the best in the country, covering the full cost of tuition for students whose families earn less than $65,000 a year. About 60 percent of Harvard students receive need-based financial aid.

Members of Harvard’s three sororities stood in clusters alongside the Charles River chanting and cheering in the cold Thursday evening. At 5:15 p.m. the soon-to-be sisters, waiting a distance away, opened their bid letters and rushed over, screaming with excitement, to join their new sisterhood.
At this year’s bid day, sorority leaders extended bids to 199 Harvard women, 27 more than were offered last year. Both Delta Gamma and Kappa Kappa Gamma extended bids to 66 Harvard women, while Kappa Alpha Theta extended 67 bids.
After accepting their new members, the three sororities separated to hold their own celebrations.
Araba A. Appiagyei-Dankah ’12, vice president of recruitment for the Panhellenic Council, said that the coordinating body for campus sororities makes an effort to “try to accommodate as many girls as possible into each chapter.” Appiagyei-Dankah, who is also an inactive Crimson arts editor, added, “We don’t like to release girls who go through the process.”
This year about 250 Harvard women rushed sororities, a figure just under last year’s record-breaking rush class of 268.
But of the roughly 50 women who registered for rush and were not extended bids, Appiagyei-Dankah said the “vast majority” withdrew voluntarily during rush week. Appiagyei-Dankah declined to provide the number of women who withdrew from the process.
With the rise in popularity of Greek life on campus, some students are advocating the creation of a fourth sorority.
“At most schools the rush process is about finding a place that fits for you, rather than a competition to get the very small number of spots,” said new DG member Harleen K. Gambhir ’14. “I think a fourth sorority would make [Harvard] more of the former.”
Helen C. Clark ’15, a new Theta, said she thought a fourth sorority would open the doors for more women to join a sisterhood.
“It’s sad that some people weren’t able to participate in Greek life, not because they weren’t fantastic people but because there just wasn’t enough room for them,” Clark said.
Thursday’s events marked the end of a nearly week-long process, which included a series of meet-and-greets at the Sheraton Commander Hotel. Appiagyei-Dankah said that all events were moved off campus, including bid day, to avoid any conflicts with University administration, which does not recognize the groups on campus.
Last year, bid day was held outside the Science Center. Appiagyei-Dankah said it “didn’t really go over well [with the administration], so we moved everything off campus this year.”
This was the first year bid day was held on the grass beside the John W. Weeks Bridge.
Appiagyei-Dankah said that the sororities would like to gain recognition from the University, but are not dependent on it.
“We’re okay with doing everything off campus. We all have our spaces now,” Appiagyei-Dankah said, referring to the off-campus spaces each sorority has now acquired.
Kappa President Sarah L. A. Erwin ’13 and Theta President Molly A. Wehlage ’13 declined to comment for this article.

In light of the recent violence in Egypt, panelists expressed their concern about a security vacuum in a fast-paced panel discussion at the Institute of Politics Thursday night.
Both Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian-American columnist, and Tarek Masoud, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that they agree that the military regime deliberately set in place a security vacuum to emphasize the need for strong government.
They said that Wednesday’s riots at Port Said soccer stadium that killed 79 people were evidence of the failure of the security sector.
“There was a problem and the police stood by and did absolutely nothing,” said Eltahawy.
Looking at the current government’s actions, Eltahway said that the structure created by Mubarak has remained intact.
“The Mubarak regime has not been removed. Mubarak has been removed” said Eltahway, referring to the current military government in power.
“We replaced one Mubarak with 19 other Mubaraks.”
Forecasting the future of Egyptian democracy, Masoud said that with Islamist parties controlling 65 percent of Egyptian parliament, a liberal, secular government is unlikely.
If non-Islamist parties are to secure a stronger position in Egypt, they will have to reach out more directly to the needs of the primarily conservative Egyptian population, Eltahawy said.
Still, Masoud said that he remains cautiously optimistic.
“This is the first time in Egypt’s history that it had a parliament that actually represents the will of the people,” Masoud said. “The next few months will be really critical, but we can’t say yet that the Egyptian revolution has failed.”
Despite the country’s progress, Elatahawy said that women still face significant discrimination in post-Mubarak Egypt.
According to Elatahawy, she was sexually assaulted by riot police last November and said that her situation was not unique.
“Hundreds of Egyptian women have been specifically targeted by the security forces and soldiers...but despite this systematic assault aimed at silencing and shaming us, Egyptian women continue to be out there on the streets,” Eltahawy said.
“We are out there every day...to tell parliament that we will hold them accountable just like we kept Mubarak accountable.”
While they said military rule and sexual discrimination still plague the country, the speakers discussed potential solutions to the country’s problems.
They said that options could range from letting the young revolutionary movement naturally produce its own leaders to raising a new generation of journalists willing to take risks to expose the flaws of the current system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some of Harvard’s romantically-minded freshmen gathered together Thursday night for the College’s second annual speed dating event, “Sex, Love, & Harvard.”
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Center for Wellness and the Freshman Dean’s Office, was complete with free Bolocco burritos, cookies, and representatives from different campus support groups.
“The idea was conceived last year because we wanted to do some programming around sexual health but we also thought it would be fun to host a speed dating event,” said Rory Michelle Sullivan ’09, the Director for Residential Education and Arts Initiatives at the Freshman Dean’s Office. “So in the end we thought, why not combine both?”
The result was a social event that also provided students with information on available support and resources for related topics on campus. A variety of student organizations, including Contact Peer Counseling and Radcliffe Union of Students, distributed information to students at the event.
In between the two rounds of speed dating, a panel of upperclassmen reflected on their own dating experiences at Harvard.
The event attracted over 50 freshmen, who said that they decided to attend for a variety of reasons.
“I am frustrated with my dating situation right now and I am here for an outlet and to meet a woman,” said Michael A. New ’15. “I am tired of random hookups.”
Others said that they were just happy to enjoy the relaxed environment.
“I am here to have a good time. I am not here because I need to be here, I am here because I want to be here,” Anneli L. Tostar ’15 said.
Nathan H. Pointer ’15 said that he shared similar expectations. “I don’t particularly expect to meet someone, but it’s fun to try,” Pointer said.
Although those who attended the event said they enjoyed it, only half as many people attended the event as last year. However, Sullivan said that she had expected that the turnout would not be as strong as that of the previous year.
“The freshman formal is tomorrow so we are having to compete with that in peoples’ weekend plans,” Sullivan said.
However, she said that there are benefits to having fewer attendees.
“It might be nicer that it is a small event,” she said. “This way, people will really get a chance to meet everyone in the room.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of some of Harvard’s most preeminent professors—including deans of four graduate schools—traveled to Israel last month, where they met with Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
The one-week visit, from Jan. 7 to Jan. 15, was the second annual trip coordinated by the Harvard Business School’s faculty immersion program.
The program, created by Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, was modeled on the school’s International Experience Program for students. Last year, professors visited China through the program.
“The idea is to educate the faculty as much as the students about what’s going around the world, so that the ideas we’re teaching are responsive to the world,” said Business School professor Arthur I. Segel ’73, who helped organize the trip to Israel.
According to Segel, the trip was geared toward examining how such a small nation with few resources and a volatile security situation successfully encourages large-scale innovation and attracts venture capital.
During the trip, the deans of the Business School, Law School, Graduate School of Design, and Graduate School of Education traveled with University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp and a group of Harvard professors. The cohort met with Harvard alumni and a host of leaders in Israeli and Palestinian government, education, and business.
Two representatives of the Boston nonprofit Combined Jewish Philanthropies also joined the team for the journey.
Nancy R. Katz, CJP’s director of Israel advocacy, proposed the idea of a trip to Israel.
“My job is about exposing people to Israel—and Israelis—and showing people how phenomenal it is,” Katz said. Katz, a former Harvard professor, and Gil Preuss, CJP’s executive vice president, went on the trip.
For the business scholars on the journey, Katz said that Israel was an intriguing destination.
“We wanted to understand why it is that Israel has more startups on NASDAQ than any other country outside of the United States,” Katz said.
During the weeklong trip, the travelers shared their interdisciplinary expertise.
Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi commented on the architecture of Israel’s Supreme Court building; Graduate School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney met with the heads of universities in the West Bank; and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow conversed about human rights with a Palestinian official.
“It really was an honor to have people from across the University come, because they asked questions I wouldn’t have even thought about,” said Business School professor Elie Ofek, an Israeli military veteran who led the  trip with Segel.
The participants also met the leaders of companies that are discussed in Business School case studies.
At a dinner with Peres, the party conversed about the importance of education and the tension of supporting an ultra-religious community in a largely secular population.
“President Peres was very inspiring,” Ofek said about Peres’ views on Israel’s ongoing search for peace.
“At one level he seems naive, but you have to be a believer and a dreamer, because if you don’t think like that it won’t happen.”
The group also met with Fayyad, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority.
At that meeting, Fayyad commented that the Arab Spring has drawn attention away from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, according to one of the trip participants.
“After speaking with Fayyad, the message we all left with was that the important thing is to have a big vision, while recognizing the importance of solving smaller obstacles along the way to get there,” Ofek said.
The group also met with members of an elite naval commando unit of the Israel Defense Forces, who described the controversial mission in May 2010 in which they boarded a flotilla of boats trying to break through the blockade around Gaza.
The Harvard administrators said that they came home with a new perspective on Harvard’s growing international presence.
For example, the participants talked to the president of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology about the school’s plans to partner with Cornell to build a new engineering campus in New York City.
“It was interesting for us and for [Lapp] to think about how a campus approaches expansion,” Ofek said. “This is something that people discuss at the highest levels of the University.”
Despite an 11-item pre-trip reading list, along with panel talks, meetings, and a reception for Harvard alumni during the journey, the participants found time to see national landmarks, visiting the ancient fortress Masada, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum, the city of Nazareth, and the site of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.
“It really was a whirlwind,” Segel said. “All of us came away having learned something new.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On its path to the nation’s Top 25 this season, the Harvard men’s basketball team has increasingly acted like a big-time program. Take away the intellectual brand and the lack of historical success, and the top-flight players now wearing crimson in packed arenas make the program seem more like a member of the Big East than the Ivy League.
As Harvard’s program emerges on the national stage and receives more media scrutiny, head coach Tommy Amaker has assigned his assistant coaches to monitor what players on the team are saying on their personal Twitter accounts.
“Just like we like to monitor their whereabouts, monitor their academics, we need to monitor their Twitter accounts as well,” Amaker said to The Crimson in December.
Harvard women’s soccer coach Ray Leone requires his team to go without Facebook during Ivy League play, though Leone says that a desire for his athletes to focus, not a worry about negative publicity, spurred his decision.
But Assistant Athletic Director Kurt K. Svoboda says he does not approve of policies like Amaker’s. “I don’t believe in monitoring what our student athletes are saying,” he says.
It seems most other Harvard teams have followed Svoboda’s preferred model. A number of coaches have taken to educating their teams about the risks of imprudently tweeting and posting on Facebook, but none of the other 10 coaches interviewed for the story said they have any policies in place for monitoring players’ online activity.
At Harvard, then, Amaker’s rule might seem strict. Yet compared to the regulations at other universities, Amaker’s monitoring policy is less formal than many.
BRAVE NEW WORLD
During the last two seasons, several basketball programs, from St. John’s to Missouri, have banned Twitter use by their players, a method of control that dates back to the early days of Facebook in 2006.
In March of that year, Northwestern University suspended its women’s soccer team after photos of alleged hazing appeared on Facebook.
While Northwestern’s administration stated that it could not bar students from using Facebook because of free speech and privacy laws, other schools did just that to protect their brands.
Back in 2006, rights advocates protested, and several schools called off their initial bans.
But then came Twitter, and with it, a rebirth of the debate. After dealing with Facebook for years, Harvard was more equipped to handle a burgeoning social network this time around, Svoboda said. But some people felt that Twitter required a more watchful eye than earlier online outlets.
Last June, the NCAA criticized University of North Carolina officials for inadequately monitoring athletes’ activity on social networks. That ruling had potent implications for all college athletic departments, putting schools in the same conundrum they found themselves in five years ago. Across the country, athletic departments have been forced to decide between potentially being cited for “failure to monitor” and upsetting rights groups for monitoring or banning social media use by their players.
BIG BROTHER
Many schools have decided to regularly monitor their athletes’ social media use—and several private companies have popped up to help those schools at the task.
Kevin Long is the CEO and creator of UDiligence, a service that monitors Facebook and Twitter posts made by college athletes.
After a sports team or an entire athletic department signs up for Long’s service, athletes are instructed to install an app on Facebook and Twitter. A computer program then filters through the players’ past and current posts and tweets, searching for over 400 keywords such as “stripper” and “shotgun.” When even a photo caption or comment contains one of the keywords, it is added to a list of alerts that is sent daily to the athlete and periodically to the athletic department.
Big-name institutions such as the University of Texas at Austin, Louisiana State University, and the University of Florida have signed up for the service, which launched in 2007. Long said that three Ivy League schools have contacted him about the service, though none have signed up yet.
These days, business is booming for UDiligence.
“As more and more incidents [occur] where athlete posts things that end up in the media, it certainly has increased the interest in making sure athletes are responsible about what they are posting,” Long said.
According to Long, UDiligence has seen a significant increase in the number of inquiries since the NCAA’s decision to rebuke UNC.
Rights advocates have raised concerns that monitoring services such as UDiligence may chill students’ speech. Moreover, some have raised doubts about the effectiveness of such services. Once something has already been posted on a social network, it is impossible to completely retract, as somebody else may already have taken a picture or saved a copy of the offensive text or photo.
According to Bradley Shear, an attorney who writes a blog about social media law, lawyers have at times dissuaded universities from signing up for such services due to liability issues. If a student were to write a post online about committing a crime, the school could be blamed for negligence if it failed to take action after seeing that information via social media monitoring.
Nevertheless, UDiligence and other products like it are increasingly popular.
BACK TO THE FUTURE
In keeping with the rest of the Ivy League, the Harvard athletic department at present does not rely on the aid of one of these services or enforce any across-the-board rules regarding athletes’ social media use.
The absence of departmental policies puts the onus on coaches to determine protocol for their teams.
Harvard football coach Tim Murphy has chosen to educate rather than monitor. Instead of policing the online action of his 100-plus players, a daunting logistical feat, he reminds his players that they represent more than themselves, and he turns to examples of social media use that have hurt other programs to drill his point home.
He said that he is no fan of social media use. “From my standpoint, the less you put out on social networks, the better,” he said in an interview with The Crimson during the football season.
For Amaker, preemptive education is not enough. He sends his players to a workshop on social media led by the athletic department at the beginning of every year, but he said that he has also enlisted his assistant coaches to make sure that what the players say represents the school and team well.
Co-captain Keith Wright said he was in favor of the team’s current practices, especially in contrast to the more restrictive policies in place for the teams that some of his friends play for. He said he would also support an outright ban on social media if the coach felt it were appropriate.
Junior point guard Brandyn Curry said that Amaker has expressed a desire to let basketball players keep their Twitter accounts active as long as he does not have a reason to act otherwise.
Amaker’s adversary at Yale has a similar monitoring policy. Starting this year, Bulldog basketball coach James Jones has begun visiting the online pages of his athletes to monitor what they are saying.
“We’ve become a cyber society, and more and more, everything is getting online, so we monitor and make sure guys are following the line,” Jones said.
Jones’ new policy debuted six months after Yale star Greg Mangano turned to Twitter to voice his displeasure about losing out on the Ivy League Player of the Year Award to the Crimson’s Keith Wright.
Princeton Associate Director of Athletics Jerry Price said that proper education and reinforcement should be sufficient to forestall problems. He said that Ivy League teams have players who understand the ramifications of what they say.
But as Amaker, Jones, and coaches at higher-profile programs push the boundaries, Svoboda acknowledged that the common Ivy League laxity about online monitoring may not last.
“We have constant discussions. Social media networking is here. It’s current. It’s something that’s always on the forefront of our minds,” Svoboda said. “Schools have to maintain constant discussion on these fronts to make sure they are evolving with how people consume information.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Davos-Klosters, Switzerland to attend two days of the World Economic Forum’s proceedings and meet with Harvard alumni earlier this week, according to a statement by Christine M. Heenan, the University vice president for public affairs and communication.
The World Economic Forum is “an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas,” according to its website. It attempts to achieve these goals by advocating collaboration between the public and private sectors.
The Forum releases a series of annual reports on significant global issues. These publications cover a wide array of topics, such as sustainability, financial systems, education, and health. The 2012 Davos proceedings lasted from Jan. 25 to Jan. 29.
During the conference, Faust shared her views about the overlap of three major fields when speaking at a panel discussion titled, “The Education-Employment-Entrepreneurship Nexus.”
Faust also attended the Global University Leadership Meeting hosted by the World Economic Forum. At this event, which lasted half a day, Faust exchanged thoughts and opinions with other university presidents.
In addition to connecting with leaders from other schools, Faust had one-on-one meetings with members of Harvard’s international community. Alumni from five different continents attended a Harvard reception hosted by Faust.
During her trip, Faust also attended an event hosted by Forbes Magazine and Ernst and Young designed to celebrate women on Forbes’ annual list of “The 100 Most Powerful Women.” In 2011, Faust was named number 83 on this list. The event, hosted by the two organizations, also celebrated nine other women on the Forbes list including Arianna Huffington, Sheryl Sandberg, and Margaret Hamburg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks largely to an injury-riddled backcourt, Jeremy Lin ’10 has continued to receive playing time this week for the New York Knicks.
One of those injured is veteran point guard Baron Davis, who has been sidelined so far this season with a herniated disk in his back. Davis was expected to return earlier this week, but lingering pain in the inflicted area has pushed back his season debut for at least one more week.
Lin was quick to take advantage of this situation.
Against his former team—the Houston Rockets—Lin tallied a season-high 20 minutes of playing time, launching nine field-goal attempts. He made three of those shots and sunk three free throws, giving him nine points for the night.
The former Crimson standout also nabbed three rebounds, one steal, and a career-high six dimes.
In a home game Tuesday night against the Detroit Pistons, Lin posted another solid effort, tallying four points, four assists, one rebound, and one steal in only six minutes on the court.
According to ESPN, Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni praised the second-year guard, saying, “He shows he can run a pick and roll and he's got some instincts of a point guard, and maybe we'll look at that a little bit more and see where we're going because that's what we need.”
With both his coach’s approval and his recent play in his back pocket, things are definitely looking up for Lin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team hosting Cornell on Friday night, we caught up with The Cornell Daily Sun’s Scott Chiusano over email  to get the inside scoop on Big Red basketball. Check out what Chiusano had to say below:
The Harvard Crimson: What can Harvard expect from Cornell on Friday? 
Scott Chiusano: Coming off a big win at home against Columbia, I think we'll be coming in with some much-needed confidence, since we're finally playing good basketball after a tough five game losing streak.
THC: Harvard fans have yet to see Shonn Miller in person. What makes him dangerous?
SC: I watched him in our first home game of the season put up 19 points including two ridiculous dunks, and against Columbia on Saturday, he literally took the ball out of one of their guys' hands on a layup. He's good, don't take him lightly.
THC:  How many times per day do you visit the Cornell Basketball Blog?
SC: Way too many, it'd be embarrassing to say.
THC:  What's been going on with Chris Wroblewski this year?
SC: Yea, he's struggling a little from the field, not putting up the big numbers he has in the past, but he scored 19 points Saturday and is definitely about to turn it up. He hit a seventy five footer from the opposing three point line at the halftime buzzer on Saturday, and even though it didn't count, he knows and we all know that he's back and he's going to continue to lead the team.
THC:  Who has a better mid-range jumper: Winthrop IM basketball star (and former Magazine chair) Mark Chiusano or Drew Ferry?
SC: Well, considering Winthrop IM basketball stud Mark Chiusano has struggled quite a bit beating his little brother in one-on-ones lately, I'm going to have to go with my man Drew on this one.
THC: When Harvard fans go up to Ithaca in a couple weeks, what should they order from the Hot Truck?
SC: If you're going to Louie's lunch truck (which despite the name, is open until like three in the morning), my favorite is a peanut butter milk shake and the buffalo chicken sandwich. If you're going to the hot truck grab a PMP.
THC: Final score prediction?
SC: Since our team tends to love either winning or losing by five points or less pretty much every game, I'm going to say 68-64 in Cornell's favor. I think it's going to be a great game either way, though.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week was “shopping week” for Harvard undergrads, who got to try out their classes and see what they thought before committing to taking them. In a way, last weekend was likewise a shopping week for Ivy basketball fans, who got a little taste of each of the teams in a head-to-head format and were able to make some early judgments.
But unlike work in classes you don’t end up taking, these games actually mattered. And though we didn’t learn anything we didn’t really already know—Harvard is really good, Dartmouth is really bad, and everyone else falls somewhere in between—we did discover some worthwhile information about the Ivy hoops scene.
After struggling in games at Fordham, Monmouth, and Vermont earlier this year, the Crimson was surprisingly dominant in what should have been a much tougher road environment in New Haven last Friday. Harvard’s offense executed on all cylinders, finding the open man time and time again, while its defense held Yale to fewer points than the Crimson football team scored in The Game.
Harvard currently ranks third in the nation in scoring defense, though that’s a mostly useless stat because it doesn’t take into account pace or adjust for opponent.
Still, the Crimson has nonetheless proven to be an outstanding defensive team, and—thanks to a quartet of freshmen that keeps getting better every week—a much deeper, more balanced offensive one than last season’s. Whether it’s Steve Moundou-Missi’s energy, Corbin Miller’s shooting stroke, Jonah Travis’ toughness, or Wes Saunders’ athleticism, these rookies continue to impress.
We’ll discuss the rest of the league below, because after a dominant 6-0 record last week, I’m ready to jump right into the picks.
CORNELL (7-11, 2-2 Ivy) at HARVARD (18-2, 4-0)
Two years ago, an outstanding Big Red team came into Lavietes Pavilion and, behind 27 points from Ryan Wittman, demolished the Crimson in what had at that time been deemed “the biggest game in Harvard basketball history.”
There have been two more “biggest games in Harvard basketball history” since, and things now are very different from that evening two years ago.
Just this week, Jeremy Lin ’10—Wittman’s former competitor for Ivy Player of the Year—became a Madison Square Garden fan favorite following 26 successful NBA minutes. Similarly, Wittman led his Washington Wizards to a 102-99 win over the Charlotte Bobcats.
Wait, what?
Oh that’s right, that was his dad, Randy!
Ryan Wittman, for his part, became a Timberwolves fan favorite after his 26 successful hours working in Morgan Stanley’s Minneapolis branch. Here’s one to add to ryanwittmanfacts.com: Ryan Wittman retired so quickly, I didn’t even have time to finish writing this joke.
I only kid because it was disappointing to see a great talent like that give up so soon.
But in any case, the Crimson is now the Ivy League’s main dog at long last, and tonight it has another chance to prove it—just like Cornell did in the same arena two years ago.
Pick: Harvard 74, Cornell 60
PRINCETON (10-9, 1-2 Ivy) at BROWN (7-14, 1-3)
Brown shocked the Ivy basketball world by upsetting Princeton in each of the past two seasons, but if it wins tonight, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise.
The Bears played the Crimson tough last week, fighting back to stay in the game on a number of occasions. Sean McGonagill and Stephen Albrecht form a talented guard duo, though they can get a bit trigger-happy at times, firing up threes like they’re the twin sons of Ali Farokhmanesh.
The Tigers, meanwhile, continue to struggle, and have already lost as many Ivy games as they did all last season.
Pick: Brown 67, Princeton 62
COLUMBIA (12-8, 1-3) AT DARTMOUTH (4-16, 0-4)
Put it this way: You could take a team of the five least athletic Lions of all time—let’s say Matt Millen, Snagglepuss, the Cowardly Lion, Joey Harrington, and Lionel Mandrake from Dr. Strangelove—and it would still beat Dartmouth.
Pick: Columbia 66, Dartmouth 63
PENN (11-9, 3-0) AT YALE (13-5, 3-1)
This is the best game of the weekend by far, with enormous implications for the only two other squads with legitimate postseason aspirations this year (you know, assuming Yale doesn’t decide to go on spring break again instead).
The two Player of the Year frontrunners and Ivy scoring leaders, Yale’s Greg Mangano and Penn’s Zack Rosen, will be going head-to-head. And while Quakers are supposed to be a peaceful people, emerging from Yale with a win is going to require a lot of fight.
Penn, which starts four guards and a 6’8” freshman forward, simply doesn’t match up well inside with the Bulldogs. The 6’10” Mangano and 6’9” Jeremiah Kreisberg should dominate inside, and though Rosen will try, that’s something he won’t be able to overcome.
Pick: Yale 72, Penn 67
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
The best teams are often the ones that are most disliked, and that’s something the Crimson is quickly starting to learn this year.
In a ridiculous column written in the Columbia Spectator this week, one writer urged readers to “hate” Tommy Amaker, comparing him—one of the most genuinely kind people I’ve encountered—to sports figures such as O.J. Simpson.
Clearly upset about being denied an interview with Amaker, the writer resorts to claiming that the coach has had a journey to “scandaltown.” His source, of course, is the 2008 New York Times article that reported Amaker guilty of NCAA recruiting violations; the writer, fittingly, decides not to mention that the coach was later cleared of any serious wrongdoing by the NCAA and found merely to have committed an “unintentional secondary violation.”
The writer then encourages Columbia’s athletic department to promote the idea of a Columbia-Harvard rivalry—because as every sports fan knows, all true rivalries start with people working for the team telling their fans to make it a rivalry.
Here’s the problem, Columbia: rivalries have to go both ways, but you just don’t matter enough to have a rivalry with.
Just look at your sports culture: Your team color is baby blue. Your students need to ride the subway across the city just to go to your football games. Speaking of football, your band received national media attention for making fun of its own team, which finished a pathetic 1-9. That’s almost as bad as you did in men’s hockey and men’s lacrosse. Oh wait, that’s not true, because you don’t even have teams in those sports. There are like seven fans on your entire campus, the majority of whom apparently spend their time debating which fictional villain the opponent’s coach is most similar to.
So sorry, Columbia, find someone else to hate. Since you love superheroes so much, perhaps try Underdog. Because that’s what you always will be.
Pick: Harvard 76, Columbia 59
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
Big things are supposed to be good at basketball; the Big Red and Big Green are not. In fact, Cornell’s not very big at all; it’s two leading rebounders are the 6’7” Shonn Miller and 6’0” Chris Wrobleswki.
The squad badly lacks frontcourt depth, and that should allow Gabas Maldunas and company to give the Big Red some trouble in the historic “voluminous pigments” rivalry.
I could definitely see Dartmouth making a run at an upset here—they’re due for one sometime soon, and this is the type of game where Cornell loves to play down to its opponents. But I think it’s a bit too early for the Big Green’s annual one conference win of the year.
Pick: Cornell 64, Dartmouth 60
PRINCETON AT YALE
After last week’s embarrassment, it’s clear that Yale is much further from competing for a championship than we thought. That’s largely because they have no point guard after losing Porter Braswell to graduation. I’m not sure how they’ve been so successful without one, but the Bulldog offense was a mess Friday night.
That being said, they’re still better than Princeton. And though Doug Davis returns to the arena where he hit “The Shot,” there shouldn’t be any opportunities for another miracle this time around.
Pick: Yale 74, Princeton 66
PENN AT BROWN
Zack Rosen clearly plans to will Penn to his first Ivy title or die trying. The senior point guard has already taken 266 shots this season—just 14 less than he took last year, but in almost 400 fewer minutes.
How long Rosen will be able to find success in the Greg Jennings “team on my back” role remains to be seen, but it should be more than enough to beat the Bears.
Pick: Penn 78, Brown 71

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming back to Bright Hockey Center last Friday on the tail end of an eight-game winless streak, home ice proved to be quite sweet for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
The Crimson gained five points in the standings in four days with two dramatic wins over Yale and Brown and a come-from-behind tie against Dartmouth. In the process, Harvard leapfrogged from a tie for sixth to a tie for third in the standings.
The Crimson will look to continue its recent run of success Friday night in Hamden, Conn., where it will face off against Quinnipiac in a contest with serious standings and playoff implications.
It will be Harvard’s only game of the weekend, as the team will take time off in preparation for Monday night’s Beanpot opener.
The Crimson (6-6-9, 5-4-7 ECAC) currently sits just three points ahead of the Bobcats (13-8-5, 5-5-4), who haven’t seen any game action since Jan. 14. Because the teams drew, 2-2, in the Nov. 5 matchup, the victor in Friday night’s contest will come away with two vital points in the standings and, perhaps more importantly, the season series.
And since the results of season series serve as a tiebreaker, a win for either side could be the difference in earning a first-round bye in next month’s ECAC playoffs.
Harvard has never won at Quinnipiac.
“It’s a really important game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “It’s a nice test for us against a good team that should be well rested.”
“There’s a bunch of teams breathing down our necks,” junior forward Marshall Everson added. “We only get one game this weekend, so we have to make sure to get two points out of it. And just from a confidence standpoint, we need it going into the Beanpot.”
The Harvard attack may receive a timely boost from the return of junior forward Alex Fallstrom, who sat out the last four games due to injury.  A key component of the Crimson frontline when healthy, Fallstrom has averaged nearly a point per game played this season.
“We’re hopeful that [Fallstrom] will play,” Donato said. The nature of that injury is that there’s a bunch of testing that needs to go on. Some of it has taken place, but hopefully, we’ll have him available for us on Friday.”
But even in his absence, Harvard has managed to find the back of the net, especially on its power-play. Having scored at least one power play goal in 19 of 21 contests, the Crimson leads the nation with a 31.1 percent success rate on the man advantage.
That power-play prowess reared its head twice in the past week in critical moments for Harvard. Against Yale, Everson scored a power-play goal to give the Crimson a critical third-period lead. Four days later against Dartmouth, freshman forward Colin Blackwell, who has temporarily replaced Fallstrom in the first shift, found the back of the net on a 5-on-4 to force a program-record ninth tie.
“We’re not afraid to share the puck to make sure everybody is potentially dangerous out there,” Donato said. “We’ve gotten [goals] from a pretty good spread of guys, and I think that’s the key.”
Crucial to the power play’s success is Harvard’s leader in both goals and points, senior forward Alex Killorn. One season after scoring a team-high 15 goals in 34 games, Killorn has taken his game to a new level this season, scoring 14 times in just 21 games. His 26 points are good for fourth best in the league.
“From game one, he’s been our best player,” Everson said. “When we need a big play, he’s usually the guy to step up.”
And step up Killorn has. After his goal helped the Crimson tie a tough Cornell squad on Jan. 21, the senior nailed back-to-back game-winning goals against Yale and Brown en route to his second ECAC Player of the Week nod of the season.
But the late-game theatrics are a team-wide phenomenon. Time and time again the squad has mounted third-period comebacks in games to tie or, in some cases, to seal victories.
“It’s just a resiliency in this group of guys,” Killorn said. “It’s kind of a different mindset than we had last year, whereas we might’ve put our heads down and sulked a little bit if they started scoring. I think this year, we kind of take that as a challenge.”
The Crimson will face off against a Quinnipiac squad that, in addition to having one more point in the national rankings than Harvard, boasts the third best offense in the division. Sparking the attack are two of the top offensive threats in the ECAC: forwards Connor Jones and Jeremy Langlois.
Compound that with nearly a month off, and the Bobcats offense could be tough act to slow down.
In the background for the Crimson sits Monday’s first-round Beanpot matchup with No. 3 Boston University. Harvard upset the Terriers in a 5-4 thriller in last year’s Beanpot consolation game.
“Obviously the Beanpot is exciting. It seems like the city stops for those two weeks,” Killorn said. “But we’re not looking forward to that right now. We’ve got a game against Quinnipiac and two huge points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing one sport at Harvard is difficult. Playing two is almost unheard of.
For freshman Zach Boden, playing two sports at the varsity level is a challenge he is excited about and ready to take on. Boden excelled this fall as a running back on the Harvard football team. Now, he is taking to the field as an outfielder for the Crimson men’s baseball squad.
“Zach likes challenges,” his mother Margo Boden said. “He likes pushing himself and seeing what he’s capable of doing. That’s just his personality.”
Growing up in Atlanta, Ga., Boden developed a love for sports at an early age. He played in various youth football and baseball leagues and then moved on to compete for his high school. The genes for athleticism certainly run in the Boden family: Zach’s father, Bill Boden, was also a two-sport athlete at the college level, playing both football and baseball for the University of Virginia.
“He is a natural, raw athlete,” Mrs. Boden said of Zach. “We just let him play sports. We saw from an early age that he could run fast, [and] he had great hand-eye coordination. He had the heart; he was dedicated and did what he had to do.”
Boden was recruited to Harvard for football. The freshman running back competed for playing time on the varsity team and emerged as a true talent. Twice named Ivy League Rookie of the Week, Boden scored six touchdowns throughout the season and ran 79 times for 484 yards, averaging 6.1 yards per carry.
“The football coaches were the ones who recruited Zach and laid the groundwork for him to come to Harvard,” Mr. Boden said. “Football has always been his first love.”
Boden had many options when he was deciding what school to attend and what sport he would pursue. He was recruited to some schools specifically for baseball, but he was drawn to the Harvard program.
“Coach [Tim] Murphy talked to me about what Harvard football is about: the commitment and dedication and the winning tradition,” Boden said. “That really sold me.”
But in the back of his mind, Boden held on to the thought of playing baseball. It was only over Christmas break that he sought to turn this possibility into a reality. Following in his father’s footsteps, Boden poured over the training schedules for each team, determined to find a way to follow both his passions.
“He realized that this would be the first time in his whole life that he wouldn’t play baseball in the spring,” Mrs. Boden said. “I think he saw that he would miss it because it is all he has ever done.”
Boden noted that the baseball coaches have been accommodating about his scheduling conflicts with football training. He came to Harvard for football, and it remains his primary commitment. Boden will even miss baseball games for football practices.
“When you give a commitment to someone, you stick with it,” Boden noted. “Baseball is something I’m doing on my own time…. Football is a job.”
On a typical day, Zach is up by 5:15 a.m. and heading to morning lift for football across the river. His meals and classes are sandwiched between another workout: baseball practice in the afternoon.
“During football season, he was fine with scheduling lifts and class; he was not overwhelmed,” Boden’s roommate Sergio Morales said. “But this semester, it’s going to be a little harder. He figured out that baseball was not going to interfere with football, but that means he is working out or doing athletics for at least four hours every day.”
After all of this exercise, Boden is in bed somewhere between 7:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. every night.
“He’s very into his health and nutrition, [and] he’s very disciplined,” Mrs. Boden said. “I admire him.... He chooses to feed his body healthy food and fuel himself with good nutrition so he can be the best he can be.”
Boden’s self-discipline extends outside of just his diet. He is meticulous about most facets of his life, ranging from the cleanliness of his room to the way he spends his rare, free moments.
“He has the strongest will,” Morales said. “He literally won’t eat ice cream; he won’t have any soda. He has never had a drop of alcohol in his life. He doesn’t even have coffee or tea. He is religious about his eating and drinking habits. That also translates into his sports—he’ll work out as often as he needs to. He’ll push himself.”
But even an athlete as dedicated as Boden has his weaknesses. Boden’s one vice? Halo 3.
“I can’t play as many video games this semester,” Boden said. “But it’s OK, I can live with it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming out of the locker for the third period down a goal, the No. 7/8 Harvard women’s hockey team skated to center ice as the loudspeaker in Bright Hockey Center blared the Black Eyed Peas’ 2004 dance hit, “Let’s Get It Started.”
Fergie’s dulcet tones must have inspired the home team, as the Crimson (15-7-1, 12-4-1 ECAC) fired three goals in the first half of the period on its way to cruising to a 4-2 victory against Quinnipiac (15-11-2, 10-5-2 ECAC).
“We’ve dug ourselves a pretty decent hole sometimes this year, and we’ve been very fortunate to comeback,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We have that kind of ability, which is nice, but you never know if that’s going to run out.”
The Crimson took control early, outshooting the visitors, 8-4, but after failing to find the back of the net in the first frame, Harvard gave up two goals on defensive mistakes in the second.
An offense sparked by sophomore Lyndsey Fry led the Crimson back into the game, and the defense found its form again to hold on to the late lead.
Harvard suffered a drawback early, as junior Kelsey Romatoski was sent to the box in the first two minutes for hooking. But as with the Bobcats’ other three power plays in the first period, the Crimson dropped back and disrupted Quinnipiac’s offensive flow.
In fact, it was Harvard that looked more dangerous when down a player, as freshman forward Samantha Reber hit the pipes and sophomore Kalley Armstrong beat Bobcat goalie Chelsea Laden, but slipped under defensive pressure before shooting wide.
The Crimson would regret those missed opportunities, as almost eight minutes into the second period, Quinnipiac grabbed the lead.
A slip in the back by junior Josephine Pucci allowed the Bobcats to apply the offensive pressure, and when Pucci recovered the puck, her forward pass was picked off by Bobcat forward Kelly Babstock. Crimson keeper Laura Bellamy saved Babstock’s first shot, but the rebound fell to Amanda Colin who slotted it past Bellamy for the game’s first goal.
And after Harvard found itself down a player three minutes later, Quinnipiac made its fifth power play count. Bobcat defender Regan Boulton’s shot from a distance was deflected in front of the net and slid under Bellamy, who couldn’t locate the puck. After a confused scramble, Quinnipiac’s Breann Frykas found the puck first and knocked it home to take a two-goal advantage.
But the Crimson would not go into the locker room empty handed, as Fry picked up the puck on the left wing, skated through the Bobcat defense, and pulled Laden out of her goal enough to flip it behind for her 12th goal of the season.
“I think Fry’s goal in the second got us going,” Stone said. “We gave them two opportunities; their two goals were [the result of] really bad positioning. And so that goal fired us up.”
Down a goal, Stone knew her team could produce more.
“We weren’t sharp,” Stone said. “That was the conversation between the second and third periods: It’s time to step up, get a little more intense intense, and see what happens.”
Fry believes the late goal gave the squad’s forwards some much-needed confidence.
“The goal showed everyone we could burn their defense,” Fry said. “After that period, we talk about that a lot as a forward group, and we knew we could do that without a problem.”
And Harvard’s forwards came out firing, as junior Kaitlin Spurling charged down the ice from the faceoff, barreling towards goal and getting a shot on target before knocking the goal of its bearings.
It was that intensity that typified the Crimson’s third period, as less than a minute later the game was tied.
Fry once again provided the spark, as she worked down the left wing and slipped a pass to the onrushing Jillian Dempsey, who beat Laden with a one-timer.
Harvard now looked like the team that beat Yale 8-0 last weekend, and Quinnipiac’s offense could not muster a response.
Eight minutes later, with the Crimson on the power play, Pucci atoned for her earlier slip when she linked up with Fry for a 1-2 move that opened up the Bobcat defense, allowing her to put away her fourth goal of the season.
And 90 seconds later, the game was iced, as Reber found Dempsey in front of goal, and the junior slid the puck through Laden’s legs to give the Crimson the 4-2 edge.
“We’re fighting for home-ice advantage going into the playoffs,” Fry said. “We know what were playing for, and we knew we had to get it done.”

Jan. 31, 1953: College Considers Tuition Hike of 100 to 200 Dollars
Tuition rates may jump to an all-time high of $700 to $800 a year, the CRIMSON learned yesterday. The Administration is considering a move to hike students' bills by $200 sometime in the near future.
"The proposal has not yet reached the Corporation and no official action has been taken," Edward Reynolds '15, administrative vice-president, said last night.
President Conant first hinted at the possibility of the rise in his report when he pointed to a 50 percent increase in the University's expenditures during the past 12 years.
Jan. 28, 1970: It's Open...But Does It Mather?
With construction workers still noisily at work, Mather House—Harvard's tenth House—officially opened yesterday.
About 85 Mather men moved into the low-rise section of the $8 million complex yesterday, making exhausting treks through snow, mud, and debris to cart their belongings.
There is still a lot of work to be done in the low-rise section; the dining hall, library, common rooms, Master's residence, and House offices will not be completed until the beginning of March. The 20-story tower, which will accommodate an additional 146 men, should be completed by September.
Feb. 2, 1978: State Claims Sacco-Vanzetti Documents
A Massachusetts official said yesterday the state may take Harvard to court if the University does not recognize the state's claim to ownership of almost half the "Sacco-Vanzetti file" of documents released to the public yesterday.
John J. McGlynn, state supervisor of public records, said many of the documents found among the papers of former President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, are "part of the public record" of the trial and conviction of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two self-proclaimed anarchists executed for murder in 1927.
Lowell chaired a commission that investigated the case and upheld the convictions.
