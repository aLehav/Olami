After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve never considered myself a huge fan of Michael R. Bloomberg — quite an unenviable position for someone trying to enter a dying media market. His political career always struck me as less than ideal, his troubling past statements as, well, extremely troubling. He’s hardly the kind of person I’d envision as the ideal Harvard donor, let alone the main funder of an entire, extremely influential University program.
So when the former New York City mayor and graduate of Harvard Business School decided to expand his philanthropic commitment to our school last month, I knew the donation was worth inspecting. The donation in question? A massive $150 million to create the Harvard Bloomberg Center for Cities program, building on the work of the year-long Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative that offers leadership training for mayors across America.
It's worth prefacing any analysis of Bloomberg’s donations with a basic overview of the controversies that have defined his public figure. The mayor has a turbulent past, rife with questionable decisions. There is, for example, the ‘joke’ book once compiled by his former colleagues, a collection of 90s-appropriate (and hence utterly sexist) zingers attributed to Bloomberg, including gems such as “if women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they’d go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale’s.” Of more impact and significance was his tenure as mayor of New York City, during which Black and brown youth were terrorized through millions of barely justified police stops known as “stop-and-frisk,” a tactic that only ceased after a federal court ruled it violated the constitutional rights of New York’s minority groups.
But while these concerns make the case against Bloomberg's reprobate past, they don't offer a persuasive reason not to benefit from his wealth. In fact none of them, despite their moral relevance, form as convincing an argument against accepting massive donations as the billionaire’s most recent, unsuccessful endeavor: his 2020 run for the Democratic nomination.
Bloomberg’s time as a presidential hopeful was distinctly oligarchical in flavor, featuring conflicts of interest with his own media empire (which has a policy explicitly prohibiting any coverage of his “wealth or personal life,” and lost some of its top editors to the billionaire’s political team), and self-funding to the tune of more than a billion dollars.
Bloomberg also found other ways to translate wealth to political capital — including through his ties to Harvard.
It was the Bloomberg City Leadership Initiative at Harvard that facilitated contact between Bloomberg and dozens of mayors across the country, allowing him to tailor an entire generation of city leadership to his personal political preferences, or to at least expose them, through July retreats to his orientation weekend in New York, to his own views on a range of pressing issues. When the primary came, a majority of those endorsing a candidate chose Michael Bloomberg. Our university had accidentally given Bloomberg a transformative machine, one that sucked in dollars and spit out at least 23 invaluable presidential endorsements. The episode showcased just how much a donation can be worth — not to us, but to the donors themselves.
But does any of this — a past rife with racist policies, sexist jokes from past decades, an over-the-top attempt at becoming president — disqualify Bloomberg’s work as a philanthropist? Is it enough justification to turn down his mountains of money?
Not everyone thinks so.
To understand why, I spoke to Andrew Loh, a former Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership fellow who spent last summer working with Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. Andrew was familiar with the reluctance to enter the Bloomberg network; in fact, he knew “a few friends who did not apply” to the program precisely because of its sponsor. But as an international student less aware of such concerns, Loh successfully applied to the fellowship. He spoke favorably of his experience, adding that elected officials did so too: "When you speak to the mayors who are the ultimate beneficiaries or target of this program, they actually are very appreciative."
Loh’s work offers a glimpse into the tangible, positive impact of the Harvard Bloomberg joint initiative. As a fellow, he was focused on Covid-19 response as the pandemic's impact worsened. That meant, among other things, compiling data on how the nation’s 50 largest metropolitan areas were responding to the health crisis in order to nudge Oklahoma City's city council to implement a mask mandate.
The effort was a massive success: Within four days, Loh’s research helped empower Mayor Holt to instate a mask mandate in his city. Its impact went beyond Oklahoma City, Loh adds, stating that his boss made sure to share his “homework” so that other regional officials could benefit from its insights. Days later, Tulsa’s mayor used Loh’s findings to pressure his city council to approve a mask mandate too.
The experience convinced Loh that, pragmatically speaking, the Bloomberg donation was likely worth it: “In the real world, I am much much happier that money is being spent in this way, in trying to make the world better” rather than “being hoarded for money’s sake,” he says. Others would likely agree — including, presumably, many of the multiple beneficiaries of Bloomberg’s $1.6 billion-dollar-worth charitable efforts in 2020 alone.
So what exactly are we to make of this split image? Is Bloomberg a noble philanthropist, on a heroic journey to help America? Or is he the overly ambitious, casually sexist billionaire willing to buy his way to the top?
The (annoyingly nuanced) answer is that he's neither, not completely.
Bloomberg, despite his best efforts to idolize himself — what kind of boss gives new employees a copy of his self-serving autobiography? — is nothing more, and nothing less, than another deeply flawed human being. Granted, he's infinitely better than your average replacement billionaire, perhaps even better than most of us would be at managing an immense fortune responsibly. He has no ties to tyrannical regimes, a fortune that wasn’t built on a lethal epidemic, and has never tacitly supported America’s far-right. As far as I know, he has never chosen a numerical name for a newborn, and has, despite his past, contributed enormous energy and resources to worthwhile causes.
But because he’s only human, Bloomberg can also be a self-interested agent, one vulnerable to flaws, excessive ambition, and stamp-your-name-on-everything narcissism. He is a perfect example of the dangers of overly concentrated power, of how massive wealth can excessively enable the whims of a single individual.
As for the donation: For the first time since I started writing this column, I feel inclined to support Harvard’s acceptance of it. Now, as any occasional reader might know, I’m hardly a fan of the entire philanthro-capitalist model. Yet the program seems a net positive worth continuing in an age of poor governance, and the potential downsides have been minimized: Bloomberg, at 79 years old, is likely won’t run for office again. Should he do so, I only hope that yet another exceptional Harvard affiliate will show up and pop his gold-plated bubble.
But let this be a cautionary tale: Donations are rarely one-sided gifts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end seems near. Hazy, but near.
After over a year’s worth of awkward Zoom silences and tops-only dress codes, a return to normal, face-to-face interaction is the closest it has been since the pandemic’s onset. Vaccination rates across America are rising rapidly, allowing for cautious optimism: a timid hope that we might soon go back to our simultaneously riveting and mundane in-person lives.
Harvard also seems optimistic: Two weeks ago, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay announced that the FAS expects “a full return to campus,” complete with in-person learning, for College students in the fall of 2021.
Normalcy is in sight, and we couldn’t be more thrilled. The ability to be real students once again — to indulge in the small wonders of campus life — elicits elation.
This news is also particularly well-timed; a much-needed glimmer of hope for students emerging weary-eyed from midterms, denied a spring break, and stripped of any real opportunity to unplug and connect. Now more than ever, we miss our dearest friends. We miss our crowded dining halls. We miss our libraries filled with hushed laughter and chatter. We miss the people, places, and spaces that have helped turn Harvard into home.
And yet amidst the intoxicating blend of cautious hope and unbridled excitement, we foresee the growing pains that our return will inevitably entail.
When we return to campus, we may feel distant, jaded by a year of uncertainty and loss. Almost all of us will emerge from quarantine as contorted outlines of the people we were just over a year ago, unable to slip seamlessly into the life we left behind.
We will need the College to extend a grace period — both in the literal sense of time set aside to physically reorient ourselves, as well as in a metaphorical sense of being understanding as we mentally and emotionally readjust — and we need to grant ourselves the same mercy.
We must be patient with ourselves and each other as we re-establish rapport with one another, seek to bridge the virtual-physical divide, and rediscover what it means to live in a community. We will encounter massive cultural, social, and institutional knowledge gaps which will take time to fill in.
But all of this is all okay — perhaps even a good thing. Life on campus has always been far from perfect, and as we wrote about last spring, our return may be one of the most opportune moments to re-imagine campus life. We should conceptualize our homecoming not merely as a return to “normalcy,” but instead as a hard reset: a chance to forge ahead with a new, enhanced mode of communal and collective living.
To that end, we all have a part to play as we move forward together.
To our faculty: Reach out aggressively with resources and advising. You will be engaging with juniors who are really freshmen, seniors who are really sophomores, and sophomores who don't know where your department building is. Students will need all of the personal connections, advisors, and sources of direction that they did before, but multiplied by lost time.
To our administrators: Provide opportunities for students to grapple with lingering feelings of grief and loss. We cannot proceed as if nothing has changed, or as if being back together resolves all pandemic-related woes. Continue to communicate with us as early as possible (we appreciated this update), and listen to students’ voices detailing the campus they hope to return to — one where they can heal and thrive.
Finally, to our peers: Embrace and revel in one another. Push against Harvard's busy culture. Take what you’ve learned from the pandemic and apply it; make time for people, be present, and be grateful. Seniors in particular have a responsibility to set the tone for the College’s culture, combining their favorite parts of the Harvard they remember with aspirations for the Harvard they wish to create: a responsibility to preserve the best parts of the student body’s institutional memory.
Let’s make Harvard a place of its own potential. Let’s imbue our campus community with warmth, health, and vitality like it has never encountered before. Let’s make the College a home that students cannot wait to share in, where we can all enjoy unmatched levels of safety, inclusion, and support.
We’re up for the task of reopening our campus. Are you?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past couple months, there has been an increasing amount of controversy concerning widespread Big Tech suppression. Many conservatives feel that their opinions are being stifled on the internet due to left-leaning bias within social media companies. To them, Donald Trump’s ban from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and almost every other popular social media platform was extremely alarming. Personally, I felt a little torn about the event. Though I wholeheartedly think the removal was deserved and the majority of claims of the suppression of opinions is overblown, the underlying implications of the ban were somewhat worrying and highlight a growing issue of political division in our country.
Twitter, Facebook, and other large social media corporations each have the right to control who’s allowed on their platform. They all have terms of service, and if they feel that an individual or group of individuals has violated those rules, they all reserve the right to ban those people from their platform. However, while these private companies are acting well within their rights, their platforms are critical areas for public discourse. Politicians use Twitter and Instagram to publish political statements and debate their fellow elected officials. By deciding who can and cannot speak, social media can effectively control the public narrative on many discussions.
Furthermore, these corporations’ first priority isn’t to create a perfect space for political discourse — it’s their own profit margins. If these two goals happen to align, they’ll act in a way that benefits all, but it might not always transpire that way. These companies haven’t been “elected”; they have no democratic accountability, and so the public’s well-being holds limited weight in their decisions.
In spite of this, it is a massive overreaction to call this extreme censorship. Trump, by the time he was removed from Twitter, had violated its terms of service multiple times. It also does not make sense to accuse these companies of collective censorship because this was an isolated incident; we haven’t really seen anyone with such power silenced on such a large scale before.
Additionally, what would the alternative option even be?. Would we rather have social media sites with no terms of service? Or have the government play a role in these forms of media? These are complicated questions to which we are still developing the answer. Ultimately, the more pressing issue is the growing aversion to open discussion.
Across social media, advocating for an unpopular standpoint or even just asking a question can garner massive amounts of hate, even if there was no malice intended. Such reactions ostracize opposing viewpoints and push people to congregate within echo chambers that magnify hate and mute dissent. We saw this with Parler, a social media platform that devolved into a place for extreme right-wingers to spread misinformation, form conspiracies, and even plan insurgencises. The app was filled with Proud Boys members, Holocaust deniers, and white supremacists. Yet, on Nov. 8, during the presidential election, the Parler app was among the most downloaded apps on the internet. And while some extremists might’ve joined the community to spread hate and conspiracies unchecked, I don’t think that was the selling point for most people. The company framed itself as a place to “speak freely and express yourself openly without fear of being ‘deplatformed’ for your views”, playing on the growing fear of cancel culture. And so people flocked to the app, exposing themselves to many of these insane theories and throwing themselves down this rabbit hole.
Now, I know it is a somewhat privileged idea to want to have these discussions, as not everyone wants to engage with opposing views, especially when sometimes it is their own existence that is being questioned. Additionally, not all opinions should have a platform. Some speech is just blatantly hateful or false, and this rhetoric should not have a place to exist. However, blocking out entire belief systems forces people to speak only amongst themselves, and thereby become more entrenched in what they believe.
As someone who leans heavily towards the left, this is the worst thing possible, as no change can occur until more of our voting population comes together on certain issues. There will always be those who don’t listen, but we must strive to curb the trend of polarization. As Harvard students, we sometimes fall into this trap, forming our own echo chamber and not giving opposing views a place. Listening shouldn’t come at the expense of one’s mental health or well-being, and not everyone is open to discussion. But, if conceivable, instead of pushing a differing opinion away, we should try to spend some time understanding where the speaker is coming from and respectfully offer our own opinion as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College accepted 3.43 percent of applicants to the Class of 2025 — 1,968 students out of the 57,435 who applied — marking the lowest admissions rate in College history in a year that saw an unprecedented surge in applications.
This year’s record-low admissions rate is down from the 4.92 percent of students admitted to the Class of 2024 and eclipses the previous record-low 4.50 percent of applicants admitted to the Class of 2023. The College saw a record-high number of applicants this year, surpassing the previous record of 43,330 applicants to the Class of 2023 and increasing 43 percent from the 40,248 students who applied to the Class of 2024.
The Admissions Office notified 1,223 applicants of their acceptances in the regular decision cycle at 7 p.m. Tuesday evening. They join the 747 students admitted through the College’s early action program in December. Alongside several peer institutions that saw a similar jump in applicants this year, Harvard pushed its regular decision notification date back by a week.
In a Tuesday interview, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 described the admitted class — the first to go through an entirely virtual admissions cycle — as “heroic” and having “unprecedented diversity.”
“We have the most diverse class in the history of Harvard this year, economically and ethnically,” Fitzsimmons said. “This is an incoming group of students who’ve had experiences unlike any experiences first-year students have had in the history of Harvard or history of higher education.”
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in a Tuesday press release that the College chose to admit a full class despite the 349 students accepted to the Class of 2024 who deferred their admissions.
“Harvard is committed to opening the doors of opportunity to all talented students, even if it means confronting the challenge of accommodating more students on campus next year,” Gay wrote.
Fitzsimmons said the decision to admit a full class marks a “watershed year” and demonstrates Harvard’s commitment to maintaining a sense of normalcy in the composition of the Class of 2025.
The percentage of Asian American admits increased to 27.2 percent compared to last year’s 24.5 percent, with Asian Americans remaining the largest minority group among the admitted cohort. African American or Black students make up 18 percent of the admitted class, a significant increase from the 14.8 percent of the previous class; the percentage of Latinx admits rose slightly to 13.3 percent, from 12.7 last year. The percentage of Native American students decreased slightly to 1.2 percent from 1.8 percent in the previous class, and the percentage of Native Hawaiian students increased to 0.6 percent from 0.4 percent in the Class of 2024.
Women comprise a majority of the admitted class at 52.9 percent, an increase from last year’s 51.6 percent.
“The fact that we’re nearly 53 percent female is a great milestone, something that — when we first started out in the early ’70s trying to make Harvard better — was really only a dream,” Fitzsimmons said.
This year’s admitted class also includes 19 veterans and 40 students interested in ROTC, compared to 13 veterans and 47 ROTC prospects last year.
The admitted Class of 2025 represents students from all 50 states and 94 countries. Roughly 20.4 percent of the admitted class hails from Mid-Atlantic states, followed by 19.8 percent from the South, 17 percent from Western and Mountain States, 16.4 percent from New England, and 11.9 percent from the Midwest. Students from U.S. territories and abroad make up 14.5 percent of the admitted class.
The Admissions and Financial Aid office projects that 55 percent of the admitted class is eligible for financial aid, with an average expected family contribution of $12,000 annually. Of the admitted students, 20.7 percent are first-generation students and 20.4 percent qualify for Pell Grants, which are typically awarded to low-income students.
“It’s very gratifying — this is the first time that Harvard has broken 20 percent in terms of first-generation college students. And it’s the first time we’ve broken 20 percent for Pell Grant recipients,” Fitzsimmons said. “The economic diversity is certainly something we’ve never seen before on this scale.”
The College plans to introduce the admitted class to life at Harvard through an online, weeklong Visitas — a remote program similar to the month of Virtual Visitas events held for the previous year’s admitted class.
Although Harvard announced last month that the College plans to house all students in University housing and teach classes in person in the fall, final plans will not be released until May.
Asked about what the incoming freshmen should expect this fall, Fitzsimmons said, “I wish I had a crystal ball.”
“We are hopeful,” he said. “The way the world looks on April 6 could look very different on May 6. We’re doing the best we can to plan for all the possibilities that would be in front of us in the fall.”
Fitzsimmons added that he believes the remote admissions process was effective, and that he foresees maintaining some virtual aspects in future admissions cycles, such as recruiting students through Zoom.
“Zoom actually provided an enormous amount of convenience,” he said. “There’s no question we will continue to use Zoom and to refine the use of Zoom.”
Fitzsimmons said he hopes the unprecendented diversity of the incoming freshman class inspires future applicants.
“Success begets success,” he said. “You admit people from a new high school, and it gives all the other students at that high school the idea that maybe they, too, can come to Harvard.”
Admitted students have until May 3 to accept or decline their spot in the incoming freshman class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Widespread disparities based on gender, ethnicity, and other factors of identity persist in undergraduates’ experiences in computer science at Harvard, according to a report published Friday by the student advocacy group Harvard Women in Computer Science.
The 2020 WiCS Advocacy Survey Report aimed to assess how “gender, ethnicity, and other aspects of identity” inform College students’ experiences within Harvard’s Computer Science department.
The survey asked undergraduates “from all disciplines and backgrounds” questions concerning their previous exposure to and academic engagement with computer science. The survey, which received more than 300 responses in fall 2020, also asked questions related to discrimination and representation.
Among Computer Science concentrators, the report found a large gender disparity between students’ comfort level participating in class.
Of survey respondents, 64.9 percent of non-male Computer Science concentrators indicated that they disagreed with the statement “I feel comfortable asking or answering questions during lecture,” compared to only 23.3 percent of male concentrators.
The report also found non-male computer science concentrators reporting facing discrimination at a higher rate than their male counterparts — a disparity that the report found across all concentrations but one that was heightened within the Computer Science department, per the report.
In addition, underrepresented minorities concentrating in Computer Science were more likely to report ethnicity-based discrimination than their white and Asian peers.
No Hispanic or Latinx Computer Science concentrators reported that they feel a “sense of representation among the teaching staff.” According to the report, 69.2 percent of Black or African American concentrators disagreed.
To strengthen belonging among underrepresented minority students, the report recommends the department “prioritize representation among the student teaching staff for CS courses during the hiring process, especially for foundational courses.”
Computer Science chair Eddie Kohler wrote in an email that the department is “grateful” that Harvard Women in Computer Science conducted the survey and that faculty will meet with the student-led group to discuss the report further.
“CS and SEAS care about diversity, representation, and supporting all our students,” Kohler added, referring to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in which the department is located.
Kohler also noted that the department has implemented initiatives designed to diversify its teaching staff, including “inclusive TF training and outreach to broaden TF representation.”
Cassandra Kane ’21, lead author of the report, said quality of advising was a crucial factor in concentrators’ experiences within the Computer Science department.
Both non-male and first-generation low-income concentrators are less likely to pursue, or even consider, a graduate degree in computer science, per the report. Only 15.2 percent of male Computer Science concentrators had not considered applying to graduate programs, compared to 37.5 percent of their non-male counterparts.
The report builds off a previous advocacy survey report the organization published in 2015.
“There were some pretty significant ways that inclusivity within this department had improved compared to the results we found in 2015. That was certainly an encouraging result,” Kane said.
The 2020 report showed a marked improvement in gender parity in computer science exposure and course enrollment.
The 2015 results found that most Computer Science course categories did not see non-male enrollment above 40 percent, and that non-male Computer Science concentrators had fewer years of background in the discipline.
The 2020 results, in contrast, found that many Computer Science course categories have more than 50 percent non-male enrollment — though they noted that result was likely affected by sampling bias — and that there were no significant differences between when male and non-male students were first exposed to computer science.
Kane noted, however, that the survey found that there is still a “shocking amount of disparity” present on the basis of gender, ethnicity, FGLI-status, and BGLTQ identification.
Computer Science concentrator Maegan Jong ’23-24 said the report’s finding that non-male students are less comfortable participating in lectures “resonated” with her. She explained that she is sometimes hesitant to ask questions in lecture due to her perception that she has had less prior exposure to computer science than her peers.
“CS wasn’t something that I was completely unfamiliar with, but I was definitely not at a point where I was super confident in my abilities,” she said.
Computer Science concentrator Sarika Chawla ’23, who identifies as a disabled woman of color and a member of the BGLTQ community, said she would benefit from seeing more people like her in teaching roles within the Computer Science department.
“Seeing more people represented like myself who make it very clear that I can reach out to them — as well as just creating more explicit pathways for people who have just not had the chance to have as much experience in computer science, like me, due to being part of marginalized groups — would really be helpful in kind of bridging this gap,” Chawla said.
Kane said she believes the report surfaces inequalities within computer science at Harvard that have not received sufficient attention.
“There are some that I’m aware that this department already has a sense of and is working towards, and there are others that I don’t think the CS department, to my knowledge, has really thought about or identified as an issue area,” she said regarding inequities in computer science. “I think the 2020 report really uncovered disparities that hadn’t really previously been studied.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer discussed the complexities at the intersection of the “authority of the court” and the “peril of politics” at the Law School’s annual Scalia Lecture on Tuesday.
John F. Manning ’82, Dean of the Law School and a former clerk of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia, said during opening remarks the lecture is “personally very meaningful” to him and described Scalia as a “deeply influential justice” who brought about “new and productive conversations” about the law.
“He understood and respected the law with complexity,” Manning said. “I was always struck by the framed embroideries kept in chambers that said, ‘Nothing is easy,’ because he knew that nothing is easy. He loved debate, discussion and disagreement — he thought it was exhilarating, and it was how he learned.”
Breyer said through his lecture, he sought not only to provide historical context to the evolution of American law and the Supreme Court’s authority, but also to encourage individuals to think critically about how the law can be changed.
“What I’m trying to do is to make those whose initial instincts may favor important structural change or other similar institutional changes — such as forms of court-packing — think long and hard before they embody those changes in law,” he said.
Breyer also spoke about the various disagreements between justices relating to the interpretation of the law, which he argued are usually “not political in nature.”
“Different jurisprudential views lead to different results — nearly all judges use the same basic interpretive tools,” Breyer said. “They consider and they read the statute’s text, its history, look at the relevant legal traditions, precedents, purposes, values that underlie the words, and the relevant consequences.”
Various judges, Breyer said, may “give different weight” to one or several of these “interpretive tools.” He cited Scalia as an example of an individual who prioritized “text and precedent,” whereas others put more weight on “purpose and consequences.”
Breyer also argued the altered law would not always directly translate to reality, no matter how historic the court ruling. He cited Brown v. Board of Education as one such example.
“What happened in 1955? Nothing, or virtually nothing. What happened in 1956? Just about nothing again — Congress did nothing, the President didn’t do much, and the South complied only minimally with the court’s ruling,” he said.
Regarding politics, Breyer said justices' political views are more nuanced than simply with which political party they identify. He admitted, however, it was at times difficult to “separate what counts as the jurisprudential view.”
“Politics is not just about voting for a particular person or a particular legislative program,” he said. “It is also about basic political philosophy, and it is sometimes difficult to separate what counts as the jurisprudential view from what counts as political philosophy, which in turn can shape views of policy.”
Despite a traditional understanding of Supreme Court justices as politically unbiased and impersonal, Breyer said it was only natural his personal history and identity influenced his decisions on the court.
“Of course it matters — I cannot jump out of my own skin. No one can,” Breyer said.

Harvard Environmental Health and Safety, a department of Campus Services, advised University affiliates to suspend use of hand sanitizers containing the human carcinogen benzene, including one brand purchased by Harvard, in a Monday email.
The guidance comes after pharmaceutical testing company Valisure published a March 24 citizen petition identifying brands of hand sanitizer that it found contain benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer in humans.
Though temporary U.S. Food and Drug Administration policies during the Covid-19 pandemic currently permit the concentration of up to two parts per million of benzene in hand sanitizer products, HEHS Managing Director William VanSchalkwyk issued a notice in the email to Harvard affiliates to forgo use of hand sanitizers containing any detectable amount of benzene based on Valisure’s data.
“Harvard University has learned through recent press coverage that a private pharmaceutical testing company has detected benzene in some brands of hand sanitizer,” the email reads. “Although the FDA recently allowed low levels of benzene in hand sanitizer, certain batches of these brands have been found to exceed those interim limits. Long-term exposure to benzene has been linked to an increased risk for certain types of cancer.”
VanSchalkwyk wrote that Harvard affiliates should “stop using and distributing” the hand sanitizer brands listed in the Valisure report “out of an abundance of caution.” Harvard Campus Services and HEHS will collect the products.
One of the brands containing benzene — artnaturals — was purchased by Harvard as part of its Covid-19 response, according to the HEHS website. The University is working to notify the departments that have purchased this brand from the University’s Campus Warehouse.
“The FDA has not issued a recall of these products, however, when Harvard learned that one brand of hand sanitizer in question, artnaturals, had been distributed on campus, out of an abundance of caution, we asked the University community to stop using it and made arrangements to have it collected,” Harvard Campus Services spokesperson Michael Conner wrote in an emailed statement. “This process is ongoing.”
Harvard is currently testing alternatives to artnaturals hand sanitizer, per the HEHS website.
“Harvard University is working to test alcohol-based hand sanitizer in its Campus Services Warehouse before issuing replacements for the artnaturals product,” the website states. “In the interim, it is recommended that you use other brands or use soap and water to clean your hands.”
Artnaturals did not respond to a request for comment.
Some schools, including the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and the Harvard Kennedy School, in addition to Harvard University Dining Services, do not have hand sanitizer containing benzene in use, according to their respective spokespeople.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Graduate Council elected Harvard Medical School student Peter Choi and Harvard School of Public Health student Himaja Nagireddy as the new president and vice president of the Council, respectively, during a virtual meeting Monday evening.
Since last year, the Council has conducted its elections virtually, with each of the 12 graduate schools allowed one vote. Choi, a first-year in the Medical School’s Master of Bioethics program, assumes the presidency after serving as Vice Chair of Governance. Nagireddy formerly served as Chair of Operations.
Chanthia C. Ma, the outgoing Council president, said she has “really high hopes” for Choi and Nagireddy’s ability to helm the organization in the months to come.
“They’ve worked as a really amazing team together as the Operations team this past year,” Ma said. “They’ve been really hard-working, taking over not just their respective roles, but above and beyond setting up all sorts of meetings and initiatives.”
In their speeches prior to voting, both Choi and Nagireddy emphasized the importance of deepening relationships with organizations and bodies across the University in the months to come. Nagireddy said a primary objective for the coming year will be to increase the efficacy of the Council’s advocacy initiatives, which are usually achieved through resolutions.
“Oftentimes, these resolutions will just get posted to our website,” she said. “There isn’t much of a guarantee that the resolutions we’re putting out are actually reaching the audiences that they should be reaching — the people in the central admin who make decisions around some of the resolutions that we’re putting together.”
Nagireddy also said that deepening relationships with organizations and bodies on campus — including The Crimson, the United Automobile Workers-Harvard Graduate Students Union, and the Office of Financial Strategy — will allow for an increased knowledge base and swifter communication from the Council.
“When you have that working relationship, first of all, you hear about news a lot faster,” she said. “You can be more proactive — and reactive — as a Council to the needs of the student body, and it also helps with creating that ‘One Harvard’ feeling that we strive as our mission to uphold.”
Choi said he hopes to leverage Harvard’s influential name to push advocacy initiatives.
“When we make a bold statement, particularly on a controversial topic, it becomes something where people want to listen to us,” he said. “That is a very powerful position for young people to be in.”
Ma said she predicts the marked continuity of executive board members will allow for a more cohesive workflow and increased institutional knowledge.
Tara Bassi, Joshua J. “Jo Jo” Freundel, Estefania Garcia Zapata, Xavier I. Sayeed, and Nima D. Shariat were also elected to executive positions. Bassi and Freundel serve on the current executive board as Vice Chair of Communication and Vice President, respectively.
Given recent violence against Asian Americans, Choi said he is particuarly proud to have been elected to the Council presidency.
“It’s a tense moment for Asian Americans,” Choi said. “As a South Korean-born Asian American immigrant, it means a lot to me that the constituency of Harvard graduate schools were willing to put me into office,” he said. “That’s an incredible honor.”
Choi also said he is, to his knowledge, the first openly gay president of the Council.
“If being elected to the Harvard graduate student body presidency as an openly gay man is able to inspire others, and hopefully pave a way for change, I’m very proud to be a part of that,” Choi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said during a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday that Harvard plans to experiment for the remainder of 2021 with incorporating more opportunities for remote work into employees' schedules.
Bacow announced in late March that the University is aiming to welcome back faculty, staff, and researchers to their on-campus offices on Aug. 2. He clarified during Tuesday’s meeting that while all faculty and staff will be “free to return to their offices” on that date, some individuals may choose to continue working remotely.
Though he recognizes many Harvard affiliates are eager to return to on-campus operations, Bacow said the University is considering how aspects of remote work may be carried forward into fall 2021 and beyond.
“We have learned a lot this past year about the capacity of people to work remotely and to do so quite productively,” Bacow said. “There have been a number of studies that productivity has improved due to remote work over the course of the pandemic. Faculty have long enjoyed greater flexibility in their work but staff have now had this opportunity as well.”
“While we recognize that while many of us are anxious to return to our pre-pandemic work life, others have enjoyed the flexibility of working from home and may seek to continue to do so,” he added.
Per Bacow, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp has been working with administrative deans across Harvard’s schools to develop “options for people to permit greater flexibility in how they work.”
He added that the University will experiment with “different models for accommodating remote work” during the remainder of the calendar year, with the goal of developing formal policies regarding remote work by the start of 2022.
Expanding telework opportunities has long been a priority of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents more than 5,000 employees at the University.
During the same meeting Tuesday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to establish a new Quantum Science and Engineering graduate program.
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Evelyn L. Hu, who initially presented the proposal at last month’s faculty meeting along with Physics professor John M. Doyle, spoke briefly before the vote about the development of the new program during an unprecedented year.
“The past year was a time when we all faced necessary changes in lifestyles, teaching, and scholarly endeavors — a time when we needed to learn and adapt,” Hu said. “As we look outwards to a return to some new normal, I’d like to think that this program might be a wonderful example of how — during a ‘quiet time’ when we focused our efforts inwardly — we were able to re-examine, re-create, learn broadly, and emerge with new opportunities for education and learning at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro discussed the effectiveness of wellness days and the rise in anti-Asian attacks across the country in an interview Tuesday.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences instituted wellness days — five days throughout the semester when Faculty of Arts and Sciences courses do not meet — to replace a traditional spring break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These sporadic breaks have received mixed reviews from students, with some deeming them “relaxing” and others viewing them as “more time to do homework.”
Though she said she believes Harvard affiliates are “making the most” out of wellness days, O’Dair said she hopes this semester is the only time the College will have to forgo the typical week-long spring break to reduce travel.
“I think students and staff with whom I’ve spoken to understand why we need wellness days, but no one really loves wellness days — they would prefer to have a week of spring break,” she said. “I hope this is the only time that we have to replace a week of spring break with wellness days. Perhaps there will be other times where wellness days will be something additional.”
O’Dair and Mauro also spoke about the recent rise in anti-Asian violence across the United States. In the past year, roughly 3,800 anti-Asian attacks were reported, according to the center Stop AAPI Hate.
Mauro said it was “really important” to acknowledge the roots of this increase in violence.
“Many other residential communities hosted conversation circles and opportunities for people to be in dialogue about a range of responses, and members of the EDI team, among other colleagues, were helpful in supporting the race relations tutors, who really convened a lot of those spaces where people took their raw emotion or came to learn more about histories of violence,” she said. “For some people, we know that they're learning about this as a historic phenomenon for the first time.”
Maura added that the DSO is thinking of ways to support Harvard affiliates as they try to understand these events.
“We’ve been thinking about ways to be present in the moment and hold space for people to process immediate feelings,” she said. “But then also what would be some ongoing ways that we would respond to —not only this violence — but also to the oppression that lingers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Mathematics postdoctoral fellow who alleges he was detained by the Harvard University Police Department last week said the terminology HUPD used in its police log to describe his stop — a "field interview" — inaccurately understates the officers’ actions and misleads the public about how the department, which frequently describes its operations using the same language, conducts itself.
Arnav Tripathy ’11 said he was crossing through the Radcliffe Quadrangle on his way home from his office around 10:30 p.m. on March 29 when a HUPD officer approached him and asked him questions, such as what he was doing in the area, in relation to an ongoing incident. A second officer then arrived who asked Tripathy to stay to answer further questions, according to Tripathy.
Tripathy said he asked the second officer whether he was being detained and the officers responded in the affirmative and said he was not free to go. The officers allegedly told Tripathy he matched the description of a suspect who had chased two undergraduate women into their dorm earlier that evening. He was informed the suspect was wearing a hoodie, like Tripathy was.
After at least 30 minutes, Tripathy said, a third officer arrived and informed him that he was free to go.
The third officer allegedly told Tripathy that the suspect was actually a white man dressed in all black. Tripathy said he did not match this description, as he is a “darker-skinned” individual and he was wearing a navy hoodie and light blue-jeans.
The incident was later recorded in HUPD’s public crime log as a “field interview.”
“Officers dispatched to a report of an individual following two other individuals in the area,” the log reads. “Shortly afterward, officer located an individual and conducted a field interview. Following the field interview, the individual was sent on their way.”
Tripathy said the phrasing in the log — a transparency measure required by law — is misleading, and does not accurately represent his encounter with HUPD.
“That’s just a complete lie,” Tripathy said of the log entry.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that HUPD officers have “discretionary authority” to stop individuals if they have reason to believe the person “has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.”
“These interactions are commonly referred to as ‘field interviews’ and are inherent to any effort to protect a community and offer the HUPD more context through which to evaluate situations,” Catalano wrote. “It is important to note that very rarely field interviews rise to the level where an individual is placed in custodial detainment, i.e. arrested or placed in custody for their safety/the safety of others.”
HUPD commonly uses the term “field interview” in its public logs, with nine such interactions documented since Jan. 1, including one that ended in an arrest for an active warrant.
Several law enforcement experts said consensual “field interviews” are a common practice employed by police departments, but that in practice, and in some states by law, a “detainment” — during which an individual is not free to leave — is a step further than a field interview because it is no longer consensual.
In most large California jurisdictions, for example, any instances in which a person is detained, or restricted from leaving by the police, must be reported to the state under the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015, whereas field interviews are “explicitly NOT RIPA reportable stops” because the individual can leave at any time, according to Emily G. Owens, a criminology professor at the University of California, Irvine.
“Field interviews and Detainment are certainly different things, and the phrase shouldn’t be used interchangeably,” she wrote in an email, though she noted that the line between the two can be “slippery and subject to legal wrangling after the fact.”
A close partner of HUPD, the Cambridge Police Department, also differentiates between the two terms.
CPD defines a “field interview” as an interaction “limited by a consensual encounter” that “does not escalate to a formal stop and/or frisk,” according to department policies posted online.
CPD notes in its policies that field interviews are “extremely important methods” used by police to intervene in situations where there is insufficient evidence for a formal stop.
“The line between a field interview and an investigatory stop, however, is a fine one, and is necessarily fact specific,” CPD’s policies read.
CPD's policy notes that an officer can approach an individual to strike up a conversation, ask an individual to identify themselves and their business, note an individual’s physical description, and request permission to take an individual’s photograph, though permission may be denied.
“An officer, however, may not employ words or conduct from which a reasonable person would conclude that he/she is not free to leave,” CPD's policies around field interviews states.
Robert Kenter, the director of law enforcement field engagement at Yale’s Center for Policing Equity, said after hearing Tripathy’s account of his interaction with Harvard police officers that he believes HUPD conducted a field interview on Tripathy. Still, he said the stop may have gone beyond a typical field interview because it was not consensual.
“It is certainly a field interview and considering the circumstances, it may be a Terry stop or maybe a investigatory detention,” Kenter said. “It was obviously nonconsensual because he wasn’t free to leave, so he was being detained.”
Similarly, the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, a professional association made up of more than 4,000 police executives at higher education institutions, differentiates a “field interview” from a formal stop, which they call an “arrest.”
“An individual has been arrested when he or she is not free to go, regardless of whether formal words of arrest have been used,” IACLEA’s accreditation requirements, a list of rules that must be followed by schools that wish to become members, read.
HUPD is not an IACLEA-accredited agency. The independent review of the department set in motion by University President Lawrence S. Bacow last year, however, recommends HUPD “compare and update HUPD policies and practices in light of various IACLEA standards.”
In a page on its website outlining affiliates’ “rights and responsibilities,” HUPD does not define the terms “field interview” or “detainment.” HUPD's website, however, notes “it is occasionally necessary for HUPD officers to stop members of the University community and ask for information.”
Kenter said it could be helpful for HUPD to provide an index of terms in its daily crime logs to clarify its policies to Harvard affiliates.
“That may be helpful if they offer that," he said. "What’s the difference between a field interview and someone who’s detained?”
Though he said he was “relatively unaffected” by the incident, Tripathy said this incident with HUPD confirms his belief that police are often dishonest.
“I’m still in a position of privilege where I don’t need to be terribly worried, but I do want to put forth the evidence that, yes, this is just a common thing that typically happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-sexual assault student activists expressed concerns about the process behind Harvard’s decision to merge its Title IX Office and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Harvard announced on March 24 it will join the two offices under a new Office for Gender Equity. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates that plans for the new office and the dissolution of OSAPR emerged after “thoughtful comments from many students, postdoctoral fellows, staff, and faculty.”
In a March 24 article published in the Harvard Gazette, University Title IX Coordinator Nicole M. Merhill — who will helm the OGE — said input from student organizations, including anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, was a factor in the University’s decision to merge existing offices.
But members of Our Harvard Can Do Better said though the consolidation has the potential to improve direct services for students, it is not a change they recommended.
“We never endorsed this and have some pretty grave concerns about what it could mean going forward,” member William M. Sutton ’23 said. “I wouldn’t say that we can necessarily stamp this as a bad decision — it’s certainly nothing we called for, and we would have probably rather had just seen way more investment in OSAPR.”
Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, another member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said Harvard’s plan to implement restorative justice practices into the OGE’s services are a “testament” to years of student advocacy that pushed for such services. As part of those practices, the new office will include counseling for individuals who have caused harm.
Still, Mahajan said Harvard should continue to solicit suggestions from student activists and expand OGE services to include transformative justice practices ahead of the new office’s launch.
“Inclusion of that language is not of itself something that Harvard can just sit back and congratulate itself on,” Mahajan said. “They need to continue investing in prevention- and community-based responses that are part of restorative and transformative justice, and should continue to take students’ lead in terms of supporting the work that we’ve been doing on the ground and not just co-opting it.”
University spokesperson Nate Herpich wrote in an emailed statement that the changes were “driven by the extensive and thoughtful input provided by our community members.”
“Community feedback combined with the data from the 2019 AAU Harvard Student Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, which showed a need to improve upon community knowledge of the resources and services available, as well as the Report of the External Review Committee, solidified our need to make significant changes to better meet the needs of our community members,” he wrote.
He added that “all resources and services” previously offered through the two offices will “remain in place” at the OGE, in addition to “expanded resources and services committed to direct services, education, and prevention.”
Some experts and advocates said the new office has promise, but cautioned that merging Title IX reporting processes with an office that includes confidential services could deter survivors from seeking out the OGE.
“I think it can be really helpful, theoretically, if Harvard goes through this in a very intentional way that is based on the needs of student survivors,” said Emma Grasso Levine, a campus organizer with the Title IX advocacy group Know Your IX.
Cari S. Simon, a Title IX attorney, said many schools have moved to merge their Title IX offices with other discrimination prevention resources, including disabilities discrimination and Title VI — which bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. She said, though, that merging a Title IX office with an office such as OSAPR is an uncommon step.
“The benefit would be that these both are serving the same populations and ultimately address the same issues,” Simon said.
But she said merging such offices has the potential to deter survivors from seeking help.
“Having a separate sexual assault office is a place where people often go for confidential resources that are not the reporting side of things,” she said.
Harvard Law School lecturer Diane Rosenfeld expressed the need for separation between confidential sexual assault counselors and Title IX coordinators.
“It should be geographically separated so that you don’t pass people in the Title IX Office when you want to go talk to your counselor,” she said. “That’s kind of a privacy violation.”
Rosenfeld, who directs the Gender Violence Program at HLS, noted Harvard does not necessarily have a legal obligation to physically separate the resources within the OGE on the basis of their level of confidentiality, but said “it would just be a best practice.” In its current plan, the University will place confidential counselors and Title IX coordinators in different spaces at the OGE.
Still, Rosenfeld said she liked the University’s decision to impose more stringent qualifications in its search for new counselors. The Sexual Harassment/Assault Resource Education counselors in the OGE will require master’s degrees, clinical experience, and more extensive training than the 40-hour certification required for OSAPR counselors.
“They’ll be trauma-informed and not administrators, so I think there’s a real benefit to having them as clinicians because schools must prevent institutional trauma, and students so often say that their experiences with Harvard or other schools were worse than the initial assault — that the institutional betrayal, as it’s called, causes more trauma,” Rosenfeld said.
“While schools might not be able to prevent all rapes, they absolutely can and must prevent all second rapes, because they’re the ones who are causing the harm,” she added.

Attorneys defending former Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber, who was charged with lying to federal authorities examining his ties to China, said during a status conference last month that Lieber’s cancer diagnosis and deteriorating health call for an expedient trial.
As the trial looms, legal experts spoke with The Crimson about Lieber’s possible defense strategies, which might implicate Harvard and draw attention to University policies around foreign funding disclosure.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber in January 2020, alleging that he made fraudulent statements to officials investigating his funding sources. Lieber reportedly lied to the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health about ties he allegedly had to China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a talent recruitment program.
Last June, a federal grand jury indicted Lieber on charges of making false statements, to which he pled not guilty. The next month, Lieber was additionally charged with four tax offenses for failing to report income he allegedly received from Chinese sources.
Marc L. Mukasey, one of Lieber’s attorneys, said in a Feb. 26 hearing that Lieber had eliminated the potential of a plea deal and would be pursuing a trial.
“At this time, Your Honor, there is no possibility of a plea and there will be a trial,” Mukasey told Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts at the February status conference.
At the March 26 status conference, Mukasey argued that the case is time-sensitive due to Lieber’s deteriorating health condition.
“Professor Lieber frankly does not have time for delay, procrastination, and stalling,” Mukasey said. “This is known publicly: he has a very advanced form of lymphoma, his PET scans are lighted up with cancer, and conventional treatments have failed.”
“He is fighting for his life while also fighting the government,” Mukasey added in a Tuesday statement. “He is eager to show the world at trial how the government has it wrong.”
In a public letter released last month, 41 professors — including seven Nobel laureates — from several American universities questioned Harvard’s decision to not recoup Lieber for his legal costs, especially after he had been diagnosed with “an incurable lymphoma.”
“Our efforts are all the more urgent as Professor Lieber is fighting for his life on another front,” the letter reads. “Instead of devoting what may be the final months of his life to fulfilling his scientific and educational calling, he is tackling the monumental task of restoring his reputation.”
Lieber filed suit against Harvard in Middlesex County Superior Court in October 2020, alleging that the University broke its contract with him by refusing to reimburse him for his criminal defense.
Previously, Harvard officials have pointed to provisions in the University's indemnification policy excluding individuals who have been “determined not to have acted in good faith” as justification for refusing reimbursement.
In the status conference, Mukasey said indemnification was necessary for Lieber’s health.
“We’re fighting Harvard in state court so that Lieber can afford experimental treatment to keep him alive,” he said.
Kristen M. Schwendinger — a senior counsel at Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP specializing in practices including federal grants and compliance matters — said Lieber’s health condition would not stop the government from pursuing its case.
“I don’t think that usually stops a trial from occurring entirely,” she said. “I do think it absolutely factors into sentencing.”
Derek Adams — a partner at Potomac Law Group in Washington who regularly defends clients facing Department of Justice investigations — said based on case filings, Lieber’s defense team will likely contend that Lieber was “sucked into” the federal government’s pre-existing efforts to combat intellectual property theft by Chinese state actors.
“The defense is going to be very focused on the bigger picture — the anti-China movement that’s happened over the last three or four years — and try to take the focus away from the specific statements and more generally paint this as part of a broader brush that the government has been taking,” Adams said.
“This case has been painted as an espionage case and a case about theft of intellectual property or other materials from the U.S., when in fact it's just about allegedly a false statement to the government,” he added.
A federal charge for making false statements allows for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.
Schwendinger said that there are “pretty standard defense arguments” for false claims charges.
“Usually it tackles whether or not the statement was done knowingly and willfully,” she said. “There’s another standard defense, and that’s when you respond ‘no’ to something in a very quick response, but you unpack what the question was and what the answer really meant at the time.”
Adams added that the false claims charges against Lieber allege that Lieber willfully lied when he informed the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health that he was “not involved in a foreign talent plan in any way.”
“One of the defenses is going to be that there’s so much ambiguity in terms of whether somebody is truly a member in a foreign talent program or not, that it could have just not been clear to Charles Lieber what the question was being asked and whether his answer was accurate or not,” Adams said. “They’re probably going to take the position that he thought his answer was accurate.”
In the March status conference, Mukasey alluded to how a trial might implicate Harvard in the Lieber case, saying there are those “who do not want their own misconduct to be laid bare at trial.”
“The indictment references Harvard 33 times,” he added in an emailed statement. “It’s hard to imagine a trial where Harvard will not be at the forefront.”
Peter R. Zeidenberg — a partner at Arent Fox specializing in espionage-related offenses and trade secret theft — said many universities do not clearly delineate guidelines for reporting foreign collaboration.
“Relationships like the Thousand Talents Program were something that universities thought were a good thing, and they were encouraged,” he said. “Then you have a complete lack of training by either the granting agencies or the universities to their staff on what the rules and requirements are of disclosure, and very vague definitions and explanations of what needs to be disclosed.”
Though he declined to comment specifically on the Lieber case, Zeidenberg said it was “completely unfair and unjust” for the Department of Justice to “change the rules in the middle of the game” in enforcing disclosure.
“[The Department of Justice is] going back in time, and they’re looking at disclosures made in 2016, ’17, ’18, and even further back and saying, ‘You didn’t do this,’” Zeidenberg said. “It's a retroactive application of new standards.”
Schwendinger said Lieber could argue he was not fully aware of the required disclosures in his situation.
“One of the things that could be part of his overall defense is to say: what you're talking about happened in an era where it was not clear what I needed to share,” she said.
Adams said Harvard would “come into the trial one way or another” due to its role in facilitating Lieber’s grant applications to the National Institutes of Health.
“[Harvard] definitely could come in, in terms of the way that they go about their due diligence on statements like this and on their internal policies and practices as it relates to foreign disclosures,” Adams said.
However, both Schwendinger and Adams said they were wary about the efficacy of such a defense.
“He actually may have violated some of Harvard’s policies that are more clear,” Schwendinger said. “It’s easier to make an argument that you might’ve been confused if it’s very clear that you were making an effort to follow all those policies.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment for this story.
Adams and Zeidenberg said they would like to see a shift in how the Department of Justice handles cases of individuals failing to disclose foreign funding. Zeidenberg specifically said the China Initiative — a Department of Justice task force targeting intellectual property theft by China — had “gotten badly off track.”
“It’s going after people who have not even a hint of allegation that they transferred any technology or intellectual property to anybody,” he said.
Mukasey maintains Lieber had no involvement in transferring proprietary knowledge.
“Through the DOJ’s China Initiative, the government wanted to root out spies and those who might be compromising American knowledge, intellectual property and intelligence,” he wrote. “There is nobody on earth who thinks Charlie Lieber was involved in that kind of activity and there is not a speck of evidence in that regard.”
Adams said, however, that a shift in policy around enforcing foreign funding disclosures would be unlikely to affect Lieber’s case.
“I hope we see some shifts to there being less criminal cases and more issues dealt with at the administrative or civil level under the new administration,” he said. “But this case has already been charged; it's already moving forward.”
Schwendinger said the trial would prove instructive for future cases alleging academic espionage.
“It's incredibly unfortunate that things have to go to a full trial, but I think all of us involved in this challenging era area of law will learn a lot from his outcome,” she said. “There is no precedent for a trial like this, and so we'll all learn a lot from its outcome.”
Mukasey wrote that the U.S. government had overzealously executed its China Initiative, and in doing so, unfairly targeted Lieber.
“The entire prosecution of an innocent man dying of cancer is ghastly, barbaric and unnecessary,” he wrote.
Elizabeth O. McCarthy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts, declined to comment, citing the pending trial.
Lieber’s next pretrial status conference has been tentatively scheduled for April 28.

You’re larger-than-life and the absolute life of the party! You want to be friends with every person you meet, and everyone who meets you thinks that you’re super friendly. Even if you seem pretty easy going at first though, you’re also complex, and very interesting . There’s also a good chance that the number of Instagram followers you have is probably higher than the number on Elon Musk’s paycheck.
Lab
Chances are you tend to keep people in your company for hours at a time. Small talk doesn’t exist to you — you appreciate longer, in depth conversations with people. You’re not afraid to challenge others with deep questions or hot takes, and any time spent with you is generally rewarding.
Section
Unlike the Lecture personality, you thrive in more lowkey social settings. You love getting to know people up close and personal, so you like to keep your circle of friends small to get to know each person better. People are free to talk to you about anything on their minds, and you’re always there to add some context to conversations, or give an interesting alternative point of view in a discussion.
Seminar
Thoughtful. Well-read. Insightful. An ~intellectual~ if you will. You are a walking Shakespeare, if Shakespeare liked to binge TikTok and wore Vans. You possess deep knowledge of the world around you and love to share it with others. People love to learn about different quirky topics from you.
Office Hours
You are the problem-solver and the person people run to when they have issues or problems they need figured. Whether they can’t figure out no. 3 on this week’s pset, have no idea what to write in the second paragraph of their essay or they just broke up with their significant other for the third time this week, you are always there to lend a helping hand to the needy and desperate. Where would your friend group be without you?
