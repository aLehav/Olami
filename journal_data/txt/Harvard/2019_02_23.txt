After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


If there is anything that today’s constant barrage of comic book adaptations has taught the modern viewer, it’s that superhero stories are repetitive. There are only so many times viewers can stomach another movie or show about a superpowered golden boy who pursues justice — while mourning the death of his beloved parents, of course. For this reason, new contenders have to be truly weird to stand out. Fortunately, weirdness is exactly where “The Umbrella Academy” excels.
Take the very first scene, for example. What starts as an innocent flirtation between a Russian woman and a charming young man, ends with the former becoming spontaneously pregnant and giving birth in a pool. If that’s not weird enough, the show makes sure to take it up a notch with each episode — from the introduction of a talking chimpanzee butler to a scene in which two time-traveling assassins accidentally get high and burn down a medical supplier. Showrunner Steve Blackman is fully aware of the suspension of disbelief inherent to this genre, and he pushes this concept to the very limit. Beneath all of this wackiness, however, are poignant themes of trauma, abuse, and familial love.
Based on a 2007 comic series by Gerard Way (yes, that one), “The Umbrella Academy” follows a dysfunctional family of former superheroes. Each of the seven super-powered children in this family was born on the same day and subsequently collected by an eccentric billionaire named Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore). Rather than lovingly raising these kids, Hargreeves chooses to assign them numbers and train them to be the best team of superhero children the world has ever seen.
At the start of the series, the now grown-up siblings have left their dangerous lives of superheroism to pursue their own passions. Super strong Number One/Luther (Tom Hopper) is now an astronaut, Number Two/Diego (David Castañeda) has put his knife throwing abilities to use as a vigilante hero, Number Three/Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman) sets aside her powers of persuasion for a life of fame and luxury, Number Four/Klaus (Robert Sheehan) turns to drugs to cope with his ability to speak to the dead, and completely ordinary Number Seven/Vanya (Ellen Page) has a semi-successful career as a violinist. Numbers Five and Six, meanwhile, are missing and dead, respectively.
Naturally, the only thing that can bring this dysfunctional group of misfits back together is the death of their adoptive father and the return of the formerly presumed missing Number Five, who warns of an impending apocalypse. If that’s not bizzare enough, the mentally 50-year-old Number Five is now stuck in a 13-year-old body (Aidan Gallagher) and chased by time-traveling assassins (Cameron Britton and Mary J. Blige).
Accompanying these misadventures is a carefully crafted soundtrack that should serve as a lesson to all films and shows from this point forward. Somehow always perfectly complementing the scene at hand, the diverse tracklist features everything from a “Phantom of the Opera” medley to They Might Be Giants’ “Istanbul” — and that’s just in the first episode. In what is possibly the most iconic scene of 2019 yet, each of the siblings dances alone to Tiffany’s incredibly appropriate “I Think We’re Alone Now.” Not only does this scene show off some hilarious dance moves from the entire cast, but it also reflects the isolation that plagues each sibling, despite seemingly being surrounded by support.
While the obvious solution to this loneliness may be for the family to work together, there are a number of barriers which stand between the siblings, including Luther’s sense of betrayal for being left alone, as well as Vanya’s feelings of rejection due to being the only “ordinary” child. Accordingly, scenes in which the characters are involuntarily compelled to work together are often the most powerful: The forcible breaking down of these barriers reveals deep seated insecurities and unresolved trauma. In spite of all the excitement and flair of its superhero genre, “The Umbrella Academy” is ultimately a show about the effects of abuse. Far from the benevolent Professor X-esque mentor one might expect, Reginald Hargreeves is a cold, selfish man who valued the publicity of running a superhero team over the mental health of his lonely, developing children. As more and more of Reginald’s secrets are revealed, it becomes clear that he is a greater threat than any possible supervillain. Not only do his abusive actions emotionally stunt his children, but they also have quite literally earth-shattering consequences on the world altogether.
The brilliance of hiding a complex commentary on mental health and abusive relationships under the appeal of heroics and weirdness is exactly what TV needs right now. Rather than copping out and espousing the same old lessons as previous films and TV series, “The Umbrella Academy” dives deep into the more unpleasant side-effects of superheroism. Most importantly, these important themes are packaged in a genuinely enjoyable experience. This is not to say there are no missteps, but that the occasional awkward adopted sibling romance or confusing time travel plot is made up for by a very wholesome birdwatching-centered romance and young Aidan Gallagher’s uncanny ability to act like a 50-year-old man. Ultimately, “The Umbrella Academy,” like sweet, neglected Vanya, turns out to be far from just ordinary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night in which Harvard rolled to a 98-55 romp — good for easily the Crimson’s biggest margin of victory in Ivy League play — over Brown at Lavietes Pavilion, junior guard Katie Benzan added another personal milestone to a quickly growing list.
A month after she became Harvard’s 20th 1,000 point scorer (a list that is also soon likely to include co-captain guard Madeline Raster, who has scored 991), the Wellesley native hit her 262nd career three pointer early in the third quarter, breaking a Crimson record long held by Erin Maher ‘93.
“I didn’t even know I was close to that record,” Benzan said, “So it was a surprise. I was taken aback. I didn’t know until it was announced and all of my teammates came and gave me the biggest hugs, so I was shocked. It was nice that I was able to get those hugs from my teammates and my coaches, because they are the reason that I broke that record.”
Benzan’s 19 points on 7-of-9 shooting led Harvard on Friday, but she was hardly the only standout performer for the Crimson. All five starters were able to crack double figures in scoring despite spending much of the second half with the game having been long since decided.
Three weeks ago in Providence, Harvard (13-9, 6-3 Ivy) and Brown (9-16, 1-8) traded blows throughout a frenzied first half and entered the break 48-48 before the Crimson pulled away in the second half. This time around, Harvard made it obvious from the opening tip that it was the superior team, jumping out to a 20-3 lead and going into halftime up by 25.
Raster may not have reached the 1,000 point mark against the Bears, but the South Bend, Ind. native did everything else on Friday. She dove after countless loose balls, played stifling defense, and started a number of fastbreaks with steals or quick passes ahead after rebounds. The co-captain finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists in what was one of her better all-around performances of the season.
When Raster was subbed out with 8:20 to go in the game and the Crimson up by 40, it looked as if she had seen her last action of the night. But coach Kathy Delaney-Smith put her back in with 4:26 left in the hopes that she would get the two assists that would have given the senior her first career triple double.
“I didn’t have the scorers out there, but I wanted Madeline to see if she could get the two assists,” Delaney-Smith said. “This was the [Raster] that we know and love. She was phenomenal on both ends of the court tonight.”
Harvard looked early and often to capitalize on its clear size advantage. Junior forward Jeannie Boehm and sophomore forward Jadyn Bush established themselves early on, scoring eight points apiece in the dominant first quarter and adding eight total rebounds, including four on the offensive end. Boehm also set the tone defensively, blocking Brown star junior guard Justine Gaziano’s first shot and finishing with three total blocks and stellar all-around rim protection.
Bush scored 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting despite playing just 16 total minutes, including only four in the second half. She looked unstoppable down low, scoring with ease and gobbling up offensive rebounds.
The Federal Way, Wash. native’s 16 minutes were lowest among the starting lineup, but not by much. The other four starters played between 23 and 24 minutes as Delaney-Smith was able to rest her key players ahead of Saturday night’s crucial showdown with Yale.
Overall, the Crimson was dominant in every facet of the game. Unlike in Providence, Harvard took its time offensively, refusing to get into a track meet with the offense-first Bears. The Crimson shot 55%, largely because it was able to drive to the hoop or dump the ball into the post and get easy layups. Harvard ended the game with 44 points in the paint to Brown’s 14.
Against fast-paced Brown, the Ivy League’s worst defense, the offensive explosion was to be expected, especially after the Crimson scored 100 points in Providence three weeks ago. The difference Friday was Harvard’s defensive effort. The Bears’ scoring output dropped from 83 in the first meeting between these teams to 55, as the Crimson was able to shut down Gaziano — Brown’s main offensive weapon — particularly when the game was in doubt.
Playing near her hometown of Natick, Mass., Gaziano was unable to match her 28 point performance against Harvard the first time around. The 19 point-per-game scorer end up with a respectable 16 points, but most of those points came long after the game had been decided. In the first half, Brown’s leading scorer put up just four points on 1-of-5 shooting.
“I thought we did a good job of finding #4 [Gaziano] sooner and playing her a little tighter,” Delaney-Smith said. “We did a good job on her this game.”
The Crimson’s stifling defense clearly had an impact on the Bears’ shot selection from the opening tip. Brown was forced into one contested shot after another and had far more ugly-looking shots than makes early on. The Bears shot just 7-of-29 (24%) from the floor and 2-of-13 (15%) from three point range in the first half.
Aside from Raster’s brief four minute cameo and two minutes for senior guard Nani Redford, Harvard’s starters were able to watch the fourth quarter from the bench, allowing seldom-used players like sophomore forwards Maddie Stuhlreyer and Maria Guramare, sophomore guard Matilda Salen, and senior guard Kelsey Bogdan to get real playing time and to score a combined 16 points in the final frame as the Crimson extended its lead to its eventual 43 point margin of victory.
Harvard’s key players will presumably get a more normal share of playing time Saturday in a crucial game against Yale (15-9, 5-4), which is coming off of a surprising two point loss to Dartmouth on Friday night. The Crimson will be looking to exact revenge after the Bulldogs won a heartbreaker in New Haven three weeks ago on a buzzer-beating three. With a win, Harvard would also earn its first weekend sweep in league play and all-but clinch a spot in the Ivy League tournament, which will take place in three weeks in New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March 6th, 2009 - that was the last time Harvard men’s basketball had lost a game to Brown. But nearly 10 years later, Coach Mike Martin secured the Bears’ first victory over the Crimson in 20 tries, as Brown clung to a 10-point halftime lead in the final minutes to secure a 88-79 victory.
Harvard (13-9, 6-3 Ivy) was fresh off of a weekend sweep at Penn and Princeton, just the 14th team to do so in history, but started sluggishly and were unable to overcome the turnovers and deficit on the road. The Crimson were lead by a career-high 28 points from freshman Noah Kirkwood, who drilled 5-of-9 from beyond the arc and only turned the ball over just once. But the Bears (16-9, 4-5) refused to be denied on their home court, led by 30 points from sophomore Desmond Cambridge.
“Cambridge is a tough cover for anyone in this league,” said Kirkwood. “I felt like I could have put a bit more emphasis on my defense.”
Cambridge, last season’s Ivy League player of the year, was completely shut down by Harvard’s Justin Bassey, scoring a season-low four points on 1-of-13 shooting. Bassey, one of the Crimson’s most important all-around players, picked up an injury early in Friday night’s contest, and only played 15 minutes.
In the absence of the Denver, Colo., native’s presence in the Harvard lineup, Cambridge was able to expose the play of Kirkwood and other defenders. The Hun School product shot 5-of-8 from three-point territory, and was visibly fired up early and often, exalting the Pizzitola Sports Center crowd to rise to its feet.
“I thought that Brown played with a tremendous amount of energy,” said Harvard Coach Tommy Amaker. “They defended us very well early.”
Despite whatever momentum Harvard brought into Friday night’s contest, the visitors were repelled by pesky defense by Brown. The Crimson had a slew of turnovers early and often, and fell to 1-6 when trailing at halftime. For a Harvard team that entered play 343rd in the country out of 353 Division I programs in turnovers, losing the ball 19 times was a recipe for a third conference loss of the season.
With Bassey out, Coach Amaker relied upon an unorthodox rotation that included freshman Kale Catchings. The first-year scored seven points, on 3-of-3 shooting from the field, but fouled out in just 11 minutes, committing several ill-advised fouls with the Bears in the double bonus. 
“Playing really hard, competing hard, trying,” Coach Amaker said of Catchings’ performance. “That comes with being a freshman and this environment, we would hope to have older guys lead the way for him, but we’re not in that position, but I’m really happy and proud of how he played.”
Friday night’s loss was an unenviable start to a crucial weekend road-trip, as the Crimson will travel to New Haven to prepare to take on first-placed Yale on Saturday night. If Harvard hopes to defeat the Bulldogs for the second time this season, it will hope to have a healthy Bassey to guard Yale’s Miye Oni. 
Last weekend’s hero and Ivy League Player of the Week, Bryce Aiken, struggled in Providence, scoring 17 points on 6-of-16 field goals. The junior guard’s difficulties came from three-point territory, where he had excelled in his last four games. The Randolph, N.J., native was able to knock down just 1-of-7 triples, turning the ball over four times in 35 minutes of court time.
Aiken will need to be as fresh as possible for Saturday night’s duel in New Haven, in a potential preview of an Ivy League championship that would be held on Yale’s campus. Aiken and the rest of the Crimson struggled mightily beyond the arc, knocking down just 11-of-32 three-pointers. Despite leading in assists, rebounds, and bench points, the visitors were unable to take a lead in the second half, and fell for the first time in 10 years to their Rhode Island rivals.
Standout junior forward Chris Lewis was another player who failed to make his presence felt through much of the game, coming alive late to finish with nine points. Lewis and Aiken’s struggles Friday night doomed a Harvard time that relied upon Kirkwood’s performance to stay close.
With Yale looming on Sautrday night, it will be essential for the Crimson to hit the reset button, with a chance to sweep the season series from their biggest rivals.
“We barely even talked about the game,” Kirkwood said. “We’ve got to kind of forget about it, because tomorrow’s an even bigger game, so you can’t really dwell too much.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team hosts Yale on Saturday night and will celebrate the achievements of its six-man senior class after the rivalry bout. The No. 17/15 Crimson (15-8-3, 11-6-2 ECAC) is proud to boast an accomplished group of fourth-years having won 76 career games, captured the ECAC in 2017, tripped to a Frozen Four, and seized a Beanpot title.
Taking two crucial conference points from the Bulldogs (13-10-3, 11-7-1) will not be easy for Harvard. Yale swept the season series last year and drew the Crimson, 3-3, early on in the 2018-2019 campaign. The visitors wield a potent senior of their own in forward Joe Snively (26 GP, 13–17—30), who has burned Harvard in past matchups.
Follow the action live from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center as two longtime adversaries battle for supremacy in their season series.
