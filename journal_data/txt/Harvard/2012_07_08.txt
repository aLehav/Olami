After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Contract negotiations between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the University that began in early April failed to reach an agreement by July 1, the day after the old contract was set to expire.
According to a letter from the union’s executive board and organizing staff to its members, the old contract, which went into effect on July 1 of last year, will remain in place until the negotiating parties reach an agreement.
“We’re disappointed and determined at the same time,” HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said. “Our union has been trying to approach the negotiations in a serious, vigorous, constructive way, and we’ll keep trying that.... It’s a frustration that we haven’t finished on time, but it’s not a tragedy.”
The letter to HUCTW members—a group including more than 4,600 non-faculty staff at Harvard—expressed the union leaders’ resolve to reach an agreement that is favorable for workers.
“Although it can be hard to maintain momentum on the Harvard campus in the summer months, HUCTW leaders are strongly committed to utilizing all of the organizational energy and creativity necessary to reach a fair and progressive new agreement as quickly as possible,” the letter said.
Harvard University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations but wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the negotiations have been productive so far and that the University is optimistic that negotiators will come up with a contract that is beneficial for both parties.
The letter listed three areas in which reaching an agreement had been particularly difficult—a salary increase program, health care, and the bargaining unit, which involves deciding which jobs are “exempt” and can or cannot be included in the union.
Jaeger said that the union leadership has noticed “growing frustration and concern” among its members, but that they have received “great input” and are confident that they are moving in the right direction.
“There’s a lot of strong feeling among our membership about economic issues—about raises and about health care,” Jaeger said. “I think our members would rather have the right agreement than a quick agreement.”
A failure for the union and Harvard to agree on a new contract on time is not unprecedented. Jaeger said that the one of the longest delays occurred when the contract that was scheduled to be ratified on July 1, 1992, was not agreed upon until the following January.
This year, both sides seem hopeful that another six months of negotiations will not be necessary.
“On the one hand, the issues are tough,” Jaeger said. “On the other hand, we’re a really good union and this is a great university, and there are things we ought to be able to figure out. So we’re going to keep working hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First team All-Ivy standout. Harvard basketball co-captain. Not selected in the NBA Draft. Dallas Mavericks summer league team.
Keith Wright ’12 continues to follow in the footsteps of Jeremy Lin ’10.
The Mavericks on Friday announced that they had invited the former Crimson center to play for their summer league squad next week in Las Vegas, giving Wright an opportunity much like the one Dallas provided Lin with two years ago. From there, of course, Lin outplayed No. 1 overall pick John Wall and within 24 months had become one of the most popular athletes on the planet and earned a $30 million contract.
While duplicating his former teammate’s path will be near-impossible, Wright is just happy about having the same chance to show what he can do as his fellow Leverett House alumnus was granted.
“Who would've thought I would have the opportunities that I have now?” tweeted Wright, who averaged 10.6 points and 8.1 rebounds per game this year. “Chasing my dreams and getting ready to play in the NBA summer league!”
In Vegas, the former Crimson center will be on a team with the Mavericks’ three draft picks—guard Jared Cunningham, forward Jae Crowder, and center Bernard James, who Wright held to five points in Harvard’s November win over then-No. 22 Florida State in November. Other teammates include former Bob Cousy award winner Dee Brown and New Mexico star Drew Gordon, brother of Harvard women’s basketball sophomore Elise Gordon.
Also partaking in the summer league next week will be Penn’s Zack Rosen, Wright’s successor as Ivy League Player of the Year, who will suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers.
The Mavericks will play five games from July 15-21. On July 20, Dallas will face the New Orleans Hornets, against whom Wright could have the chance to faceoff with National Player of the Year Anthony Davis.
And while on paper it would appear Wright would be no match for the No. 1 overall pick, well, that’s also what was said about a certain former teammate of his—and things turned out pretty well in that case.
