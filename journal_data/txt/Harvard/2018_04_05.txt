After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is one passage from Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen: An American Lyric” that I have been unable to forget since I read the book cover to cover one hazy, sweltering afternoon. It was July in Cambridge and I remember feeling weary, mostly from the heat but also from the state of the world around me. That year everything bubbled over. There were names on top of names on top of names, names that filtered through my body as I chanted and marched on Massachusetts Avenue and in Boston Common. Sandra Bland had died, and the next day I found myself turning 19. I suddenly could not understand the very fact of my being and did not know what my body signified to other people.
Rankine insists that the black body often finds itself in a zone of precarity, one bounded by transgression rendering useless all efforts to move forward and keep going:
“Yes, and the body has memory. The physical carriage hauls more than its weight. The body is the threshold across which each objectionable call passes into consciousness—all the unintimidated, unblinking, and unflappable resilience does not erase the moments lived through, even as we are eternally stupid or everlastingly optimistic, so ready to be inside, among, a part of the games.”
Attempts to combat racism are often predicated on the purposeful forgetting and assimilation of one’s racial and gendered body. One thinks of the oft-repeated suggestion to pull oneself up by one’s bootstraps, as if the body will not longer be objectified or treated as abject if one finds a way to just simply stand up straight. Like Rankine, I find this instinct to “play the game” correctly—that is to engage in the politics of respectability—both naive and exhausting. In “Graft and Ash for a Three Monitor Workstation,” currently on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, media artist Sondra Perry engages in the discourse around racial uplift through a clever manipulation of technology, while providing incisive commentary on the hidden labor black bodies are constantly asked to perform.
Perry “appears” in “Graft and Ash” in disembodied form, specifically as an animated head that floats in and out of virtual space. Although constructed from her image, the visible avatar is a collective and representative we, definitively separate from the “real” Perry. This “unified” Perry addresses the viewer and surrounding gallery space in both automated spoken word and movement, its eyes and head spanning three screens arranged as a triptych. The multiplicity of Perry’s form reveals an underlying struggle to be embodied, to become grounded in a physical self that eventually finds itself disrupted and undermined.
Exhaustion, for Perry, becomes an emphatic space of provocation and intervention. The formal linchpin is the Pantone-orange exercise bike mounted beneath the trio of monitors, taken from a station designed to help workers “incorporate physical activity during their workday.” The viewer must physically contort their body in order to fit inside the machine, which allows Perry to directly interfere with—and therefore complicate—their physical relationship to the gallery space as well as the work of art. This discomfort also places the viewer in a position of vulnerability,  a state critical to maintaining the stakes of Perry’s political and artistic claims.
Tucked awkwardly into the “workstation,” peering into Perry’s eerie head, I thought about black people’s relationship to embodiment across time and space, in the past, present, and future. The fact that mourning in black life seems hinged upon a profound desire to return Home—home being one’s body—is no great surprise. The very idea of blackness began across the Atlantic—that vast and incomprehensible body of water—and the black body has found itself fragmented and commodified ever since.
Citing a 2015 study in the “Journal of Behavioral Medicine” on the effect of “the just world belief” on psychological responses to perceived discrimination, the Perry avatar criticizes that black people must constantly prove their worth and reach their full potential through hard work. “Productivity is painful and we haven’t been feeling well. Just being who we are is extremely risky, she explains. Working to appease, to not stand out, not only requires a massive amount of effort, but is also linked to higher rates of chronic illness. Labor, framed as productivity, is then akin to violence.
Perry’s work asks what happens when black bodies interact with technology and virtual representations. Emerging software and hardware may offer new possibilities, but also continues to perpetuate existing biases and subjectivities. Hand-dispensers have difficulty recognizing dark skin. Reports suggest that predictive analytics software used by police officers is based on programmed predilection for blacks. And when constructing the virtual model for “Graft and Ash,” Perry found that her body type was unavailable as an existing template.
What if the futuristic black body—as cyborg, bot, or avatar—wasn’t predicated on optimism, and instead, as with Perry and her workstation, functioned as a corrective and disruptive force? “We are not as helpful or Caucasian as we sound,” the Perry avatar says toward the end of the video. In another moment, it proclaims that “we are a DIY, not all a representative thing, which makes being a being impossible, or whatever.”  The ambivalence of this “whatever” feels so right, and perfectly sums up the weariness, tenacity, and dejection that come with inhabiting a body.

Pursuing a law degree at Harvard Law School is an extraordinarily expensive undertaking. For the 2018-2019 term, tuition is set at $63,800. It is no surprise, then, that 73 percent of last year’s Law School class graduated in debt, or that those debts averaged $162,672. Debts of this magnitude are more than just worrisome; they can disincentivize careers in the public sector, where average salaries are often substantially smaller. In the 1970s, Harvard was the first law school in the nation to establish a “Low Income Protection Plan” for graduates who work full-time in government, the public sector, or academia.
LIPP helps Law School graduates manage their financial obligations. Enrollees pay a percentage of their salary toward their loan payments, and the program covers the rest. This is commendable, but there is room for improvement yet. While we commend the Law School for instituting LIPP, the program needs to be expanded to meet the needs of today’s graduates. A broader, more comprehensive LIPP would help low-income undergraduate students resist the pressure to enter a lucrative field directly out of school and instead consider a career serving the public interest.
A recent open letter, published in The Harvard Law Record and supported by 37 Law School student groups, outlines a set of reasonable strategies for expanding LIPP. These include changing the amount participants in the program give from their salaries by altering the participant contribution scale, increasing transition time in order to eliminate risk of losing coverage when Law School alumni are moving between jobs, and improving family and dependent leave programs. Additionally, the student groups recommended that LIPP lift caps on eligible undergraduate borrowing and retirement asset protections to enable more working class individuals to utilize the program and allow more graduates to save for their futures, respectively. We hope the Law School takes the letter seriously, and that the school communicates any reforms to potential applicants, who might otherwise be unaware of LIPP and other sources of financial aid.
The Law School is, of course, not responsible for pay gap between the public and private sectors. Money aside, some students simply find the public sector uninteresting, unappealing, or unrelated to their skills. There is nothing wrong with this. However, the Law School has a responsibility to our national and global societies to empower students who care about positively affecting the world and the people who live in it. If financial issues are preventing students from pursuing their dreams of helping others, the Law School should strenuously work to alleviate them.
The Low Income Protection Plan is, in some sense, a statement of intent. It represents the Law School’s commitment to legal study in the public interest. The current program, however, is not enough. LIPP, at present, stands to more adequately protect students engaged in the selfless pursuit of the public good. A protected and expanded LIPP would help the Law School break down the financial obstacles that prevent students from pursuing careers in the public sector.

John Locke, father of the social contract.
David Hume, great skeptic of the 18th century.
These are the names that appeared in the slideshow in front of me on my first day of “Introduction to African-American Studies.” I saw them, and I flashed back to hours spent with World History II flashcards my sophomore year of high school, methodical memorization of their seemingly enlightened theories that left my head spinning at a beautiful new world of ideas. I relived hours spent poring over debate cases back in my hometown, reciting these names in front of panels of judges, taking these concepts that were so new and exciting and molding them to fit the world that I saw around me.
As my eyes refocused on the projection in front of me, I was jolted back to reality. John Locke, David Hume: racists, eugenicists, conceivers of bigoted ideologies that pervade to this day.
As I struggle like so many other first-years at the College to select a major, I find myself drawn more and more to the social sciences. The unique blend of skills that it requires and the incredible potential to shed light on new solutions to old problems is inarguably appealing to me. Despite this, I find my classes tainted by a history that no one wants to talk about—in fact, one that I heard mentioned only in passing until enrolling in a course specifically dedicated to tracing the path of racism through modern-day society. The reality that we need to face is that many of the disciplines that we consider today to be our most powerful tools in the fight towards equality have roots in hate, fear, and prejudice.
This should not come as a revelation to anyone. Anthropology, the study of people, has long been used as a sophisticated tool to reinforce racial biases. Sociology, as we saw this fall when Charles Murray visited campus, has similarly been used to oppress. And yes, even those whom I first encountered as the gatekeepers to philosophy years ago are so canonically racist that their texts are assigned in Harvard’s introduction to African-American Studies as required reading for understanding where eugenicist ideas started.
And yet, there I sat, shocked by this revelation. I didn’t consider myself an expert on these philosophers by any means, but I assumed that somewhere in one of my high school courses, someone would have mentioned their troublesome past, if only to give us an idea of the broader framework that was informing their ideas. Believe it or not, it is possible to acknowledge someone’s contributions to a field without excusing or erasing their troublesome paths.
My classes have just brushed the surface of this topic in the past few months, and I can’t for the life of me determine why that is. This part of Western history is something that we are generally pretty awful at speaking about—we like to paint ourselves in the best light possible, as one would imagine. Some might protest that if we were to have this conversation about these prominent figures, we would end up having this conversation about all of our prominent figures because—you guessed it—white people have been racist for a long, long time. This is a conversation that we need to have. If we are going to achieve any kind of progress towards the racial tension that obviously still pervades in America and beyond, we must have this conversation, and we must have it early. In my sophomore year of high school, I was old enough to learn what the social contract is. I was certainly also old enough to learn that the man who thought of it also wrote explicit justifications for slavery.
To the teachers and professors out there at all levels designing courses in history, philosophy, economics, or anything else: In addition to reading Locke, let’s read something that, instead of fitting into our worldview, challenges it. Let’s read something that goes into issues of racism, of black and brown struggles and of white flight, a topic that would’ve been very relevant indeed in my suburban public school. I focus on social science because that is arguably the field where this is most intense, but the reality is that we need to expand the diversity of our syllabi in every subject. Let’s read black and brown authors—not a radical idea by any means. Let’s institutionalize them, give them a voice in our canon, rather than pushing them to the margins for students to discover years after they graduate high school, years after they become eligible to vote.
I am not the first person to write this. I will still enter the social sciences, and I will use them to work towards a better world for all of us, no matter what race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, gender identity, ability, or any other possible basis for discrimination. But I will do so while informed about the social scientists who came before me, racism and all. With this knowledge, I will seek out DuBois, and Frazier, and the many other social scientists who have earned and deserve so much more space in mainstream social science classes than they get. And ultimately, it will make me a better student, a better activist, and a better person.

What are your summer plans?
The question’s been floating around dining halls and classrooms for a few weeks now, slowly and stealthily infiltrating its way into those conversations that necessitate small talk. It’s an innocent question, especially for those who have booked flights, confirmed internships, or received job offers. But to those without concrete plans, to those who have missed deadlines or didn’t get the offers or acceptances they hoped for, that question is bound to cause a little anxiety: it’s a reminder that the end of the semester is fast approaching. Summer’s right around the corner—What are you going to do?
When I started planning my summer, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of opportunities Harvard had to offer. Teaching, traveling, interning, researching—for the first time in three years, I had the chance to do something besides working in fast food. Browsing the seemingly endless options felt almost like a betrayal to the restaurant in which I’d spent so much time. I halfheartedly submitted applications to internships I was barely interested in and would later get rejected from, conflicted by the opportunity to do virtually anything I wanted and an irrational desire to return to making sandwiches. When I left that job last August, I never would’ve expected to miss it.
I know it sounds crazy, but if you’re still trying to decide how to spend your summer, I recommend fast food.
Seriously: I owe a lot to that job. It afforded me the savings that now pay my tuition, and it inspired the essay that got me into Harvard (true story—I wrote about a chicken sandwich). But, perhaps more importantly, it taught me life skills and values that I probably wouldn’t have learned at such a young age. I left a better person, wizened to the ways of the real world—or at least the world beyond the coddling walls of high school. There’s something truly valuable about working long hours for minimum wage.
Fast food will teach you so much. First, you’ll learn humility. You’ll feel just the slightest bit degraded wearing a nametag that says “Sandwich Artist.” Every time you catch a glimpse of yourself in a stainless steel appliance, you will cringe at your garish matching visor and polo (although you will be given many polos, none will be in your size). Your work appearance will be a great ego check.
You’ll learn to be patient. When the line of customers is out the door, the 25 seconds it takes to toast a sandwich is an absolute eternity. All eyes will be on you. Annoyance will rumble through the ever-growing line of customers; you will be blamed for being unable to condense time. You’re not allowed to show even a flicker of frustration, though, or the customer feedback surveys will be brutal.
Fast food is a great lesson in anger management. You will get yelled at, and frequently. People will insult your intelligence, if only because you work in fast food (also a good ego check). You will want to yell right back, but all you’re allowed to do is muster a fake smile. Later you will take out your anger on trash bags by throwing them into the dumpster a little more aggressively than usual.
You’ll learn to multitask. One customer is asking you for an extra packet of mayonnaise, one is trying to pay for his sandwich, one is telling you that the toilet is clogged. The oven, toaster, and microwave are all beeping, the dish water is running over, you just ran out of chocolate chip cookies, your coworker has mysteriously disappeared, and an entire high school football team just walked in the door. After a while, though, this won’t scare you anymore.
Finally, you’ll become grateful. At the end of the day, you will relish the feeling of finally sitting down in your car, alone, in the quiet. Your clothes are covered in various sticky sauces and rogue pieces of lettuce; after a few weeks, your car will begin to smell like a much more stale version of the restaurant you work in. But there’s something very satisfying about being able to put your feet up for the first time after a long, demanding workday, and something even more satisfying about opening up a paycheck you worked very, very hard for. It won’t be a huge check, of course, but you will treasure it.
These are only a few of the skills I learned from that job. I look back now and wonder at how much I grew in an environment I expected nothing of, but I guess that’s the beauty—if you can call it that—of fast food. I really encourage you to give it a try for the summer. You’ll be surprised that you can learn all this from simply making sandwiches, flipping burgers, or stuffing a taco, and these skills will benefit you both as now a student and later in a future career.
Fast food helped get me here, and it helped make me who I am. Give it a try this summer—it might just change your life, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On “Punish a Muslim Day,” I missed the Quad shuttle.
It was the worst type of moment—I was walking across the Quad lawn, calm and slow, texting on my phone, aware that it was 8:48 a.m. and the shuttle would be leaving in two minutes. And then, suddenly, I looked up. Almost as if in slow motion, I watched the shuttle pull up in front of the SOCH, watched a crowd of my peers board it, and watched it roll away.
So, I walked to class instead. And I made it; was sitting in section at 9:05 a.m., a whole two minutes before Harvard time ended. (Really, who even needs the shuttle, which is always late when I need it to be early, and is always early when I need it to be late?)
But I spent the day thinking about that moment, when the shuttle rolled away. I hadn’t tried to run after it. It was a lost cause—I was too far away, it was already moving. When you’ve missed it, you’ve missed it.
And on that day, on a day which had been dubbed “Punish a Muslim Day,” there was something unsettlingly familiar about that feeling of resignation. That feeling when the shuttle’s going, and you know you can’t catch it. That feeling when you wake to vitriol on the Internet that teeters over the edge into real life, and you know you can’t stop it. You know you haven’t been able to stop it before, and if something happens today, well—it’ll be no different. Why would it be?
When I learned about “Punish a Muslim Day,” I wasn’t scared. I wasn’t even surprised. I wasn’t taken aback, wasn’t shocked at the horrors that people are capable of. I didn’t change my plans, didn’t even consider the possibility of skipping class or not wearing my headscarf. I didn’t even do anything out of the ordinary to keep myself extra safe that day.
When I missed the shuttle, I had to walk. I had no choice. When I learned that a certain day had been dubbed as prime time to attack me, I went on with life. I had no choice.
Because if I stopped everything every time I was in danger, I wouldn’t get anywhere. This is what being Muslim is. It is waking up every morning, ready to duck when the world comes swinging at you, and it is realizing that some days, that swing will collide with you. You’ll end up with a black eye or a split lip, and guess what? You’ll wake up the next morning to play again. Tough luck.
Being Muslim is knowing how to navigate, and survive, and thrive, even while you duck and dodge and jump. Sometimes, it’s a hate crime, coming at you. It’s the constant, ever-rising threat of violence. It’s those numbers and those brutalities that control your narrative. Some are triple murder and abduction and rape. Some are single bullets. Always they are rising, always they are underreported. Being Muslim is the pervasiveness of this violence. It isn’t distant. It’s hit the mosque you attend, whether in the form of a bomb threat, a threatening letter, or bullet holes. Sometimes it’s even reached your home, or your school.
Being Muslim is not knowing where life ends and the crime begins. It’s refusing to cry over the split lip, because you know what? Some people break their legs trying to duck, and that could be you. So being Muslim means shrugging off the yells in the street. It means excusing the rude TSA agents who derail you in airports or the waiter who deny you service. It means knowing that that’s just life—the violence is when someone pulls your scarf down in the middle of the street or when someone threatens your little sibling at school.
Being Muslim means having no real allies in this game. It means watching the people who can’t duck get hit. It means being forced to sit on the sidelines while Republican and Democratic presidents alike bomb the countries that you come from, and indiscriminately kill those who could have been you in another life. It means taking forced timeouts: when the referee blows the whistle, and the game pauses, whether for a White House iftar dinner or an interfaith event—a moment in which there is no real swing to duck, but also no real allyship; just forced smiles until the game begins again.
But being Muslim is also about playing the game, and getting good at it. It’s about communities coming together to not duck anymore, but stand, and face the swings, and return the hit. It is about strength, in belief and in hope. It’s about fighting back—whether working to document masses of hate crimes, or building community resources to empower those affected by violence, or attending protests, or engaging in community building and activism while juggling the busy life of a college student.
So on April 3, I wasn’t doing anything I haven’t done before. I didn’t have any new feelings. Because for me, and for millions of Muslims across this country and across the Western world, April 3 was not the first “punish a Muslim day” we lived through. There was also February 10. June 18. And too many others to list here.
We will live through more—always ducking, always dodging. We will also have more and more days where we return a hit and are able to stand tall. But until then, you’re going to need to do better than a flyer and a hashtag to scare us.

For the week leading up to the holiday, J.Crew celebrated the second annual National Stripes Day on Instagram by posting a different “limited-edition” striped item each day. Their captions reassured that “only x days” were left until the holiday, like the company needed a countdown to temper stripe-lovers’ zeal. However cheekily the company conceded that the holiday was “100% made-up” in parentheticals, J.Crew promised me an absolutely hedonistic abundance of striped goods—not only apparel but also, according to their website, “drinks, snacks and other fun striped surprises.”
But, when I arrived at Copley Place (a mall in Back Bay that, because of the tasteful gray marble floors and high ceilings, felt like an heiress’s luxury bathroom) and took the escalator up three floors to a J.Crew sandwiched between a Vineyard Vines and a Neiman Marcus, I could barely discern there was a national holiday celebrated behind the store’s glass double doors.
In the store’s window, 12 of the 13 mannequins wore some variant of a striped shirt. One wore an oversized navy t-shirt with thin white stripes, another wore a rugby-style shirt with thick pale pink and blue stripes, and yet another wore a long-sleeve with horizontal white and neon orange stripes. But stripes are probably the most common clothing pattern and each mannequin only wore one striped item. So the display didn’t look like the visual result of a post-Stripe Day bacchanal orgy like I had anticipated; it looked like a modest East Coast couple’s summer picnic party. The only hint of the holiday was a very small black chalkboard that read “Let’s Party!! Come celebrate with stripey surprises inside…” The sign was almos hidden under an even larger, brighter sign that read “Spring is in full bloom! 40% off your purchase!”
As I entered the store, a saleswoman wearing a white and ultramarine blue striped t-shirt greeted me with an enthusiastic “welcome to J.Crew!”—not even a simple “happy holidays.” And, while all the salespeople wore striped shirts, most shoppers did not, thus either ignoring or never even seeing J.Crew’s stipulation on the company Instagram story to “#wearstripes.” These people were shopping because of proximity to J.Crew, not their devotion to stripes.
The only celebratory surprise was hidden by a mannequin. Behind her torso was a metal basin filled with ten cans of La Croix and a cookie platter. Neither the La Croix nor the cookies were striped. A family of four women entered the store and the family tween exclaimed, “Fuck! They don’t have a bathroom. I’m trying Victoria’s Secret.” The tween’s younger sister, the only stripe-wearer in the family, noticed the cookie platter in her peripheral view and immediately ran to it. She used her palm to high-five every cookie. Her mother noticed, and dragged her from of the store.
However disinterested the Copley Place J.Crew seemed to be towards National Stripes Day, the CambridgeSide Galleria J.Crew’s disregard for their own holiday managed to surpass the Copley Place J.Crew’s scrooge-esque apathy. Of the five employees at this J.Crew, only two wore stripes. One employee even wore a different pattern: gingham. The store façade didn’t even reference the holiday.
It took me about ten minutes to locate the ‘stripey’ refreshments, which, again, were not striped. Another metal basin with half-melted ice and four La Croix and a platter of somewhat smashed donut holes held court at a table in the back corner of the store. Raspberry jam spilled out of one donut like blood gushing around an un-stitched gash.
The J.Crew factory store in Somerville did not even pretend to celebrate the company’s own holiday. Assembly Row, which overlooks the West bank of Mystic River, is a few blocks of East Somerville streets settled by an alarmingly large number of factory stores. It felt like a more overtly consumerist Disneyland. The stores were barely decorated, only one or two disheveled mannequins. And storespeople don’t bother restacking piles of sweatshirts because the name of the factory game is swift and purposeful shopping, not leisure or luxury. You go to a factory store for a fantastic deal, not to languidly browse through neat racks of beige cardigans on a whim. Accordingly, the J.Crew Factory Store didn’t bother decorating the store with half-hidden signs that explained, “When in doubt, STRIPES.”
But, while the J.Crew factory store was devoid of stale, mini-pastries, about three times the amount of people in the other two J.Crew’s combined populated this store. A line of impatient shoppers stretched from the register in the back of the store, snaking through disordered racks of mostly striped shirts and dresses. It felt like shopping during the week before Christmas—everyone was there for the explicit purpose of finding cheap sweaters as quickly as possible, a task that requires shoving, quick-walking, and eye-rolling at dawdlers. A 30-year-old woman pushed me with her shoulder because I was a roadblock in her route to the “Teddie Sweater” table, which offered a basic pullover in red, royal purple, navy, navy with a white embroidered pineapple, and navy with a hot pink embroidered flamingo for 60 percent off. Everyone in the store unwittingly celebrated the holiday with fervor by purchasing as many clothes, most of which happened to be striped, as quickly and aggressively as possible.
I walked out a few steps behind a mother-daughter duo each carrying a shopping bag in either arm. The mother, who was wearing a solid, cream-colored shirt, exclaimed, “We bought so much stuff!” and high-fived her teenage daughter. They had a happy National Stripes Day.

As we pull away from the Boston Sheraton, I have to explain to my Lyft driver why there are mobs of adults dressed in full costume clogging the crosswalks outside.
“They’re here for an anime convention,” I say.
“Anime?” A 10-foot tall inflated tyrannosaurus rex bobs by.
“Yeah, like Japanese cartoons.”
“I don’t get it.” A balding Buzz Lightyear sprints across the street and the driver jams on the brakes. “Why?”
***
Anime Boston stormed the Back Bay from March 30 to April 1, bringing with it over 25,000 dedicated cosplayers, anime fans, and curious onlookers in what it calls “a cornerstone of the North East Anime Convention circuit.” Now in its 15th year, the convention boasts everything from a “Solar Salsa Semi-Formal” to a blood drive; from a maid café to a manga swap meet. Convention-goers flooded in to attend panels on topics both serious—“Japanese Architecture: Ritual, Religious, and Performance Spaces” and “Keeping Your Anime Creations: A Session on Intellectual Property Law”—and lighthearted, like “My Waifu’s Not Weird” (actually a session on cognitive science) and “A Beginner’s Guide to Eff’d-Up Hentai” (I didn’t go to this one).
 
But I didn’t come to the convention for the panels on vaporwave or Japanese history; I came to find out why cosplayers—who spend hours of sewing and gluing in an attempt to recreate the costumes of their favorite cartoon/video game/movie character—do what they do. Why put on 20 pounds of plastic and foam to look like your favorite League of Legends champion and walk around the Hynes Convention Center for seven hours?

Margaret M. Corraine is decked out in green and yellow-gold armor plates that squeak as she walks. She wields a four-foot tall hammer, the head of which is adorned with hearts and bigger than a basketball.
“I worked on it every night for three months,” she says, smiling proudly under her helmet.
She’s dressed as Sailor Jupiter, a character from the series “Sailor Moon” whom she loves. “When you first meet her, she pile-drives a guy into the ground. She also has a very soft and sweet feminine side—she likes to cook, and things that are pink, and…” She trails off, gesticulating.
I ask how she made the hammer, and she begins rattling off names of foams and plastics and glues that I can’t follow with. She made her hammer and all of her armor entirely from scratch, in a process she describes as “really hard, but worth it.”
Demion C. Knight hovers nearby, also wielding a giant weapon—a sword taller than he is, inlaid with detailed lapis lazuli highlights, the hilt topped by a skull. The sword is a trademark of Arthas from “Warcraft III”, and Knight has reproduced his look convincingly. Long grey-white hair cascades from the hood of his floor-length black robe; his shoulder plates have foot-long spikes coming out of them. Grinning and pointing at the sword, he says, “This took from close to December. Sadly, I purchased the rest.” When I ask what the sword is made of, he shrugs. “It’s foam, plastic. There’s wood,” he says, mysteriously.
For him, cosplay is attractive because “you can be somebody else than you normally are.” This sentiment is common among cosplayers I talk to—the appeal of being somebody else for the weekend is huge. People really get into it: A Super Saiyan Goku by the entrance has full spiked-out hair, eye contacts, and fake scars drawn onto his bare biceps. A Widowmaker from Overwatch is stopped by security to have his four-foot long sniper rifle checked. Thor, resplendent in full armor that lights up and flashes, dukes it out with a sad-looking Captain America in a latex bodysuit in the hallway.
***
It’s way too easy to get lost wandering here. There’s a new crazy costume or attraction in every corner. A cavernous ballroom on the third floor is filled with video game consoles and monitors, and people crowd around games of Super Smash Bros. and Dance Dance Revolution. Someone staggers around wearing a VR headset and trips on a cable. (Nobody notices.) On the first floor, in the Dealer’s Room, vendors sell boxes on boxes of manga and anime Blu-rays, along with poster and body pillows plastered with questionably young and unclothed anime girls. As Saitama from One Punch Man and Mike Wazowski shout about a first-edition manga in his booth, a heavily bearded vendor sighs and says to no one in particular, “Our unending quest to take your money.”
The event is surprisingly diverse. I see everything from babies wearing matching Sailor Moon costumes to 70-year-old couples dressed as Mario and Luigi. Of course, not all outfits are so involved—plenty of people are in plainclothes here, whether it be the gawkers, who point and stare and surreptitiously snap pictures, or the fans, who are just here to get their favorite books signed. A short man wearing a MIT 2019 hoodie and a black facemask that reads “Hentai” strides through the halls, his nose buried in a thick manga anthology.
***
There is, of course, an element of exhibitionism to many of the cosplayers. Some of the outfits are outright attention grabs, like the trash can walking around with a sign that reads “Your Waifu” on it, or the shabby-looking Goofy who’s been waving around his “FACE down, ASS up. That’s the way we like to HYUCK” sign by the escalators for at least an hour now.
Dale Armstrong is blunt about it. Covered head-to-toe in gold and navy blue polystyrene, he admits: “I came to show off my armor. And it’s just really fun.” I wonder how he goes to the bathroom, but instead ask if he made it from scratch. His face turns indignant. “All by myself, from hands, from foam floorboards, and some crafting foam.”
Armstrong enjoys the spectacle of it all: the crowds, the rivalry, the paparazzi. “I kind of love it when people take pictures of me,” he says. “I actually keep a count of everybody who takes a picture and compare how my different costumes did.” Sure enough: As I take his photo after our interview, he shouts, “Number 26!” and disappears into the crowd.
On the third floor, I find Matthew J. Columbo, holding a disembodied dragon head made out of—of all things—sleeping bag mats. It bites and snarls at cringing passersby as he manipulates the rods attached to its jaws. Finally, he lays aside the giant mask to talk to me: “This is like the coliseum, a big stage for everyone to show what they made,” he says.
But for him, cosplay is more than just showing off a costume—it’s showing off one’s own creativity. “I tried painting, I tried drawing. This is the only thing that makes sense to me in some way,” he says. “It’s a way to be an artist… that’s relevant to a lot more people.”
I point at the head: Is that thing heavy to hold all day?
“Not really,” he says. “I mean, you hold it for like seven hours, and you gotta pound the pavement if you’re gonna bring a costume and go to all that effort. It’s just foam.”
***
Columbo also says he is grateful for the much-cited community aspect of cosplay. “The people that I become friends with in this community are honestly the people who know what it’s like to sit for tens of hours, cutting foam, alone.” He looks down. “And things like that. That’s really what I connect with.”
Richard Jay, wearing a skintight bodysuit and toting a huge rifle—he’s the Widowmaker whose gun was nearly confiscated in the security line!—agrees.
“It’s always been really friendly,” he says. “We like to share tips on how to build things and how to make things.”
He pauses to gush over the light-up Thor costume I saw earlier: “It’s absolutely amazing, man. It’s incredible.” It’s easiest to observe this supportive attitude in the hallways, as cosplayers mill with the crowds—people will shout out character names as their real-life counterparts walk by, or stop and ask for a picture. It’s nice, really.
***
My last stop at the event is a press conference with one of the guests of honor, Jez Roth, who’s been designing cosplays and costumes for over 20 years and has won countless awards for his skills, outfitting the likes of Kim Kardashian and Snoop Dogg.
“This community made me what I am today. I owe everything to the cosplay scene,” he says. “We basically were outsiders. We came together over something that we loved, and we turned it into a very positive thing, and we celebrated our differences.”
He’s wearing a white tuxedo and sparkling, sharp cat-eye sunglasses. This outfit came together because of a masquerade he judged: “I’m not going to show up like no scrubby individual for this event.
“Everyone in there was going to look glam,” he adds, and then, slamming a white-gloved hand on the table: “I will not be outshone!”

The next time you walk past the Science Center on your way to the Law School Library, stop and take a look around. You are now in the Hundred Acre Wood:home of Winnie the Pooh and A.A. Milne’s beloved franchise.
Confused? Look to your right and notice the small tree stump with a fading red shingled roof and a worn blue door. Some illegible blue spray-painted word covers part of it. The house, passed by hundreds of students every day and largely unnoticed by pedestrians, is so tiny that only a small animal or a magical creature could possibly live in it.
Over the past 20 or so years, Cambridge has been home to two different Pooh trees. The house next to the Science Center seems to be the oldest one, having been built sometime in the early 1990s. Its exact origins remain a mystery, but it survived even after the tree that housed it was chopped down in 2012.
Once upon a time, Pooh had another home in Cambridge, closer to the Quad. In 1998, E. Mitchell Ryerson (“Mitch”), a local sculptor, built a Winnie the Pooh house out of a hollow tree trunk on Hurlbut Street. Ryerson says he had been working on a project with the Cambridge Arts Council to carve seats out of trees that had been cut down. When he came across the tree on Hurlbut Street, it was already known as “the Pooh Tree,” thanks to the late Harvard Professor B. Irven DeVore, or “Irv.” According to Ryerson, Devore “was obsessed with Winnie the Pooh. He had turned some trees in front of his house, which was just down the street, into Owl’s House and Eeyore’s House for his grandchildren.”
The house on Hurlbut Street was much more elaborate, built inside the hollow of an eight to nine-foot stump. Its roof sheltered a window and a seat with a secret compartment underneath. Inside was a staircase and mini furniture, custom-made for Pooh’s House. While Pooh was never home, people came from far and wide to visit, leaving messages in a journal inside the tree. Ryerson still keeps many of these journals, which include notes like “Dear Pooh, I want to be your BFF,” and “I hope that you get a lot of honey.” He estimates that they went through about 100 journals in the 20 years that the house existed.
Unfortunately for fans of A.A. Milne’s classic children’s stories, the Pooh House on Hurlbut Street no longer exists. The tree house was chopped down just over a year ago, in the spring of 2017. Even Winnie the Pooh’s eternal youth could not escape the Americans with Disabilities Act and the inevitable decay of an old tree.
So that leaves Cambridge with one last and often overlooked home for Milne’s silly ol’ bear on Harvard’s campus. The Pooh House you see today is only a husk of its former glory. It hadn’t always sprouted out of such a disappointing stump, but the rest of the tree was chopped down in 2012. And Pooh’s House has been the victim of vandals for years. George H. Eastman, a local doctor and Graduate School of Education alumnus, served as a caretaker for the House for several years. He made a sign for it that said “Pooh” and created a small door—both of which have since been ripped off.  Rabbit and Piglet lived in nearby trees for a time, but those houses have disappeared. Today, Pooh’s blue door is bolted in place and the red shingled roof is weather-worn.
Pooh’s presence on Harvard’s campus wasn’t always limited to one tree stump. In 1946, a few members of a certain semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine applied to create a “Pooh Club.” William G. Rueter ‘46 was elected their Christopher Robin—whatever that means. But times have changed. Today, the dilapidated house by the Science Center is the only Pooh-friendly space in Cambridge.
So the next time you’re racing to class or trying to navigate your way to the Law School, take a moment to search for Pooh’s humble abode.

Undergraduates who participate in a club for all four years at Harvard can cite longevity as a mark of their dedication, but Allen G. Feinstein ’86 puts them all to shame.
He’s been involved with the Hasty Pudding Theatricals since his freshman year of college. “I would have to actually count how many years that is,” he says. After taking a moment to tally, he calculates that this is his 36th year.
Music was always an important part of Feinstein’s life. He learned how to play the recorder before he reached kindergarten and expanded his horizons to include “a whole bunch of wind and brass instruments when I was in high school. And piano.”
When Feinstein arrived at Harvard his freshman year, he translated that enthusiasm for music into extracurricular activities like the Harvard University Band, the Harvard Wind Ensemble, and Hasty Pudding Theatricals, where he played clarinet, saxophone, oboe, and trombone.
By the time he was a college sophomore, Feinstein was listening to recordings and transcribing full scores for the Hasty Pudding’s pit orchestra—by hand, because, as he notes, “this was pre-computers.” By breaking down scores and seeing how the parts came together, he learned how arrangements and compositions work. He began to write arrangements for the Harvard Band’s halftime shows, and, by his junior year, he was creating orchestrations for the Hasty Pudding’s pit orchestra.
Academically, Feinstein’s undergraduate experience was “wonderfully unfocused,” he says. “I changed majors so many times that I wound up completing a concentration that doesn’t exist anymore, that I kind of completed almost by accident—called Physical Sciences, because I was a science kind of guy. But I spent all my time doing music.”
Feinstein later went on to graduate from  the New England Conservatory of Music, but he remained involved with the Harvard arts community, composing multiple commissioned works for the Harvard Wind Ensemble and continuing to conduct and arrange music for the Hasty Pudding. He recalls one kickline in which he blended the composer’s Transylvania-themed score with Bach, but in the style of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” all for a cast of dancing zombies.
Feinstein now works as a teaching professor and director of bands at Northeastern University, where he is also the head advisor for the music department. In addition to maintaining his involvement in the Pudding and working a day job in academia, he has continued to expand his musical horizons: he’s now also the conductor for the Harvard Pops.
“For the Pops, I was hired about 20 years ago,” he says, leaning against a wall just outside of Lowell Lecture Hall, where the Pops practice every Tuesday from 4 to 6:30 p.m.  Inside, approximately 15 members of the Pops have arrived early to set up, and the resounding acoustics of the hall ensure that the clanging of music stands and scraping of chairs punctuate his words.  “I was told all I would have to do was show up and conduct, because they would take care of everything else.”
One member of the Pops hiring committee was Peter G. Chan ’99.  About 15 years later, Chan asked Feinstein and the Pops to assist him with his flash-mob proposal on Harvard’s campus.
Chan brought his soon-to-be-fiancée to Lowell Lecture Hall, which was vacant, and sat down to play a seemingly spontaneous rendition of a Rachmaninoff piano concerto. Mid-movement, Feinstein and the Pops rushed in and provided background accompaniment for a particularly dramatic section, before scurrying out again. The New York Times documented the whole scene on video and featured it in the Style section.
Feinstein’s continued Harvard involvement has also given him other high-profile opportunities over the years, including the chance to conduct performances for the Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year ceremonies, honoring celebrities like Lucille Ball and Glenn Close.
This member of the old guard has stayed with the Pudding long enough to witness the beginning of its upcoming transformation. Asked for his thoughts on the Hasty Pudding’s new policy permitting women to audition, Feinstein declines to comment. He later addresses the issue briefly in an emailed statement, writing that “this year, my conversation about [the Hasty Pudding’s creative] process with Mila Kunis quickly got sidetracked into a discussion of the show’s casting policies, just about an hour before the Pudding announced the change in casting that will begin next year.”
As the organization adapts, Feinstein hopes to continue his involvement, even if the group looks different than it did when he was an undergraduate. Working with Harvard students, in fact, has helped him with his own projects. “I’ve learned a lot through that organization [the Hasty Pudding] on how musicals work, and I apply that to my own musical work,” he says. “The process all around is just very stimulating.”

In late January I was assigned a strange task. A friend came onto me crassly at a party. This was disappointing, but fine. The strange part came later, when a mutual friend brought the night up to him, and it turned out he’d been blackout drunk the whole time and didn’t remember a thing. Being a person who cares about me and cares about women, he asked me to tell him everything that had taken place between us that night.
In the days leading up to our scheduled meet-up, I pondered what to do. Heavy on my mind in the weeks prior (heavy on my mind still) had been the question: how do women tell stories of sexual violence? How do our narratives shift based on audience, context, objective? My situation with my friend, decidedly far from off from violence or assault, echoed these broader questions and weightier situations, and I was sucked into the microcosm. In this case, I knew there was a particular set of events, a way of reasonably narrating this set of events that would sound benign, and another reasonable narration that would sound like a story of harassment. After all, in every act of storytelling we choose where to skim and where to prolong, where to soften and where to amplify. Should I aim to preserve our friendship, I wondered, or did I have some duty to moralize? A hard facts delivery or describe how it felt? I found myself with this inexplicable chance to actualize the questions I’d been grappling with in the abstract. In this small situation, to this small audience, with these small stakes, I was tasked with constructing a narrative of solely my own design.
What does one say?
***
Since October, following the news has felt like standing on the floor of a massive stock exchange. Except where you’d expect to see a wild circulation of stocks and bonds, narratives of sexual violence take their place. The exchange is perpetual. The perceived value of these narratives fluctuates greatly, appraised based on the teller (Is she white? Black? Poor? Does she have something to gain? Something to hide?), the mode of delivery (Is it a reputable publication? A tweet? Is it emotionally driven?), and the character of the story itself (Is it severe? Ambiguous? How much does it incriminate the men we love?). It feels sometimes, that amidst the whizzing blur, it’s impossible to reach up and grab a story, open it slowly, and inspect it with the care it deserves. It feels sometimes, that amidst the whizzing blur, you can’t see or hear a thing.
***
I gather on a couch in October with friends of three months. It has been a tense week. A movie will loosen us, we decide. The #MeToo posts began appearing at the start of the week, and I didn’t know what they were when I saw the first one on my newsfeed, probably because of something about the insularity of life here. But quickly I learned, and I wanted them to stop for the most visceral and self-serving reasons of eye-shielding and self-preservation. Of course they shouldn’t stop. Or of course it was too early to pass judgement on whether they should stop, too early to say how much good they would cumulatively do, in the end.
My friend suggests a movie I’ve heard of when I was younger. A cult classic called Teeth. He says it will be fun. I know the general premise is that there is a girl, and she has teeth in her vagina. The movie turns out to be a series of violent assault scenes, and each assaulter is in turn castrated by the vagina teeth. It has not occurred to my friend or the filmmaker—who is clearly intending this as some kind of feminist parable—why this might be upsetting to watch.
I know that it is not a new objection to condemn gratuitous rape scenes, but I want it to stop, like the posts. This is the same! The same infinite scroll. Of course it’s not the same. Of course there is legitimate merit in holding abusers publicly accountable. But it felt the same. I excuse myself from the movie early and go on Facebook less for the rest of the semester.
I hadn’t thought about what kind of movie might justify these graphic depictions until I watched Jodie Foster in 1988’s “The Accused.” It’s one of the earliest mainstream movies to condemn the rape of a woman who is poor, loud, and likes to have sex. You see the site of her assault—a jukebox bar with wood and vinyl interior—at the beginning, but you don’t see the rape until the end. Most of the movie takes place in a courtroom, and the rape scene is the gauzy, dreamlike flashback finale. I watch gawky-eyed. I tell someone the next day the scene was fifteen minutes long, although a quick google told me it was actually only about four. It felt longer. I mean it felt endless. It was really graphic, up on a pinball machine. Was that necessary? How could that have been necessary? I earnestly search for an answer to this question.
The 1988 Washington Post review is somewhat sympathetic to the film’s premise—that a woman who is not a virginal saint could actually have been raped—but it quickly qualifies, its outreached hand only extends so far: “Face it. No women in her right mind would have gone into that bar and done her impression of a Vanity video. But Sarah's lack of good sense isn't on trial here.” The review and others like it lead me to believe that the scene was actually—I cringe to say—justified. That there existed a set of mainstream cultural circumstances so naive as to justify it. So naive, because the most compelling question the film must ask is, did it really happen? Did it really happen as much as she says it happened? And the answer it has to give is, yes, it did, look.

In February I wake up about three times nightly. Every wake-up is marked by bite-sized inputs and outputs of narrative: I keep my phone by my pillow, and I wake up and immediately either type out a thought into my Notes app or open some morsel of information from the outside world. These notes were usually some tiny feminist outrage, some morbid rumination on the state of womanhood. When these would come, I greet a familiar old frustration. Shouldn’t I be sleeping, or at least, shouldn’t I be thinking about more interesting things?
And then there is the background-droning hope for the arrival on my screen of a small delight, or a life-changing update, or something in between. The #MeToo posts arrived this way, and a sprinkling of allegations dotted fall and winter wake-ups. At Harvard, the news came slower, but inevitably the e-mails about Dominguez, the tenured professor of Government accused of decades of harassment, arrived in my inbox in March.
My friend tells me that she tries to read the Chronicle of Higher Education story that recounted all the allegations, but she had to stop. “It just scrolled forever.” I understand. I have wondered about this for a long time—these laundry lists, this infinite scroll. The literal spreadsheet.
I used to wonder about it on the personal level, about the value of carrying around a perpetually growing mental laundry list of instances of harassment and assault in my own life. Huffington Post listicles say things like, “When I was twelve, a man shouted X at me out of a car window, and when I was fourteen, a man grabbed Y, and so on forever...” and this is all legitimate, but has never failed to make me think, “I have this list too, and it’s boring!” I feel that each acquisition is meaningless, that one or four instances should have driven home the point, but I keep collecting like all collections. Like seashells. In the best moments, when it seems like there is something to be gleaned from pain, like tokens of an interesting life. Have I not lived so much?
Now I wonder at the group level about what it means for the culture to acquire this perpetually amassing laundry list of allegations, via #MeToo and beyond, that no one really seems sure what to do with.
It’s not that I’m afraid that a massive onslaught of allegations will lead to desensitization; it’s just that I wonder what the effects of overloading our sensitivities are. The amorphous concept of “knowing the truth” seems valuable enough, but when I try to follow this thread, it’s not clear where this “knowing” translates into societal action.
And there is the question of how we can possibly see something so large, so slow. How do you tell a 35-year story? The article is an attempt to condense time. A beating, a bomb, a bullet shocks—what if the same amount is harm is inflicted over decades, in smaller instances that go unreported, or when reported, go discounted; if the potency of violence is so diluted across time that it becomes unrecognizable as such? A dirty cloth stretched so far that its fibers become invisible, or simply look like a filter, like a part of the scenery.
***
I do have a favorite story of male violence to tell. It’s about this time when I’m working on a farm, and a man comes into my room in this isolated farmhouse. It’s approximately one in the morning, and he’s holding a knife of a foot and a half. He stands over me for a minute, then enters my closet. I dash for the bathroom and lock myself in. He paces in front of the bathroom door until about 6 a.m., then departs.
It’s my favorite story to tell because people are willing to listen to it, mainly; because it’s exciting and fits into many contexts. I have learned that there is not room to publicly tell these stories in the way you might tell a friend the next morning. Stories must be fine-tuned and well-packaged. The farm story circumnavigates gendered violence just enough to drive home the sentiment, “Look at just how much fear we live with! Look at how much danger we are constantly in!” but does not barrage the listener with the nitty gritty of sex and power. It is, in essence, a good story; it holds apparent value other than being a story of gendered violence.
***
In January, when I finally meet up with the friend who has asked to meet up to discuss what happened between us at the weekend’s party, it is something of a failed conversation. Everything feels off a notch. Whatever I say, he misunderstands slightly. (I had spoken with a female friend in preparation, and everything I said to her felt so intuitive to communicate. I didn’t have to speak too long before she knew exactly what I meant.) But this conversation demands explicitness. and I can’t find the words. I leave thinking of how every story lands differently on different ears.
Narratives of sexual violence fill the public air these days like gnats in summer, but I do still find them fairly invisible in life here. If assault stories made up a music scene, we’d have a dead one, or at least an underground one. I’m always dumbfounded by how quickly, upon walking through the gates of the Yard, the noise of outside traffic is muffled. Instant quiet. It can be nice, in the most unproductive way. I won’t say I have not imagined, one newsless morning, waking up to silence.

It’s 2007. Steve Jobs has just revealed the original iPhone in San Francisco; Kanye West has recently awoken from a prophetic dream that he can buy his own way to heaven, and my grandmother, Catherine Ferrell, is the only white person I will let touch my hair.
She rolls a  thick mixture of olive and jojoba oils between her palms and caresses each strand of my hair with a purposeful tenderness. A shiver runs up my spine as she massages my scalp in circular patterns. Our teeth are firmly clenched. Tears slip down our cheeks in tandem as she vigilantly yanks apart my tangles: my pain is also hers. She stays with me for a time and then pushes me into the bathroom to unravel the confusion myself. I welcome my grandmother’s hands because they move with a righteous intention: to educate me on how to one day do this for myself.
Ten years later, I’m naked in my bathroom at Harvard. Perched on the edge of the bathtub, I balance a laptop on my damp knees and squint through a protein-oil haze. Conditioner drips from damp spirals. The weight of the overpriced hydrating cream is so heavy that I can barely read what my fingers have frantically been typing into the search bar: “how to untangle knotted hair.”
As I scroll through pages of nondescript articles, my red-rimmed eyes flicker over to the time-stamp at the right-hand corner of the screen. 5:15 p.m. It dawns on me that I have spent two hours locked in this bathroom. In two hours, I might have organized my Google calendar, reviewed lecture slides for statistics, and answered upwards of 20 emails. My empty stomach drops and nothing catches it. Too bad. No one in the dining hall will ever see me like this.

During Visitas, female-identifying prospective students are invited to learn more about the Association of Black Harvard Women and discuss the experience of black womanhood at an institution built to educate white men. Questions jump from colorism to taking ownership of academic spaces. After 20 or 30 minutes, someone finally asks the question:
“How far do you have to go to get your hair done in Cambridge?”
A pocket of air goes out of the room and it fills with chatter. How many girls wanted to ask this question?
The responses from upperclassmen are thorough and expansive, ranging from inexpensive places to get your hair braided to how to find highly effective products for a steal. I take notes diligently. These women are providing us with more than solutions to our hair woes. They offer up these products and places as an assurance: potential ways to define ourselves in a space they mention will surely attempt to define us. I am skeptical—not of their comfort but of the perception that products and places will make being a woman of color at Harvard easier.
***
I look in the mirror, and, to my embarrassment, the frazzled girl staring back starts to cry. Her face twists up into the sort of ugly that usually only occurs when she don’t give a fuck about what she looks like. Except right now, she cares. She really, really does.
If I’m not out in 15 minutes I’m going to miss the damn bus. I take a deep breath.  I imagine that I’m nine years old again and that my white grandmother is pacing nervously outside the door. If my days are constricted by New England weather that steals moisture from the air and Cambridge prices that pilfer an absurd amount of money from my wallet, then it’s my job to deal with it.

“It’s easier for someone with more resources and more free time to put effort into making themselves adhere to beauty standards,” Ruva Chigwedere ’21 says.
Chigwedere is one of many black women at Harvard I’ve talked to who are eager to dissect the role class plays in the way we engage in self-care. Her tightly coiled, 4c hair was braided for most of the first semester. This semester, her braids are out, and she’s letting her hair breathe.
“There’s this whole idea of hair as expression, but who can afford to express themselves? [Who can afford] to fit into society, and, therefore find a higher place because they fit into white notions of beauty?” Chigwedere asks.
I subconsciously roll a limp strand of hair between my fingers. I’ve been thinking about something similar. All hair expresses something; we subconsciously imbue perceptions of socioeconomic status, political affiliation, and cleanliness onto each other based on physical appearance—hair included. Black hair is scrutinized with an enunciated ferocity. Individuals who embrace their natural kinks and enjoy hairstyles that emphasize texture open themselves to critical perceptions of wealth and their ability to fit comfortably in a corporate environment.
“I spend a lot of time thinking about the kind of images I present,” Madison A. “Maddie” Trice ’21 says. Trice is on a self-professed journey with her hair, trying different styles in order to get to understand it more intimately. “In pre-professional spaces I still feel this compulsion to wear my hair a certain way... if I’m going to an important meeting or trying to get funding for something, instead of wearing bantu knots, I would wear my hair up in a scarf.”
At Harvard, where students compete to be both hired and admired, this pressure is magnified. If you can physically imply wealth or institutional knowledge about which trends are popular, you might have an easier time navigating spaces comfortably at Harvard.
Trice’s next foray into hair expression is a brightly colored weave. She expresses little outward nervousness about the way her peers will perceive this choice. “India Arie has that song ‘I Am Not My Hair,’” she says. “I get to explore how I can simultaneously not be defined by it and also use it as a way of expressing who I am.”
Within this context, to say our hair is self-expression is not enough. With every twist, knot and braid we’re attempting something more powerful: self-definition. Styling can be an incredibly powerful tool when wielded correctly. That’s why it feels so important to get it right. This is also why the question of who can afford to express themselves is not unimportant.
“Hair can be a really important form of self love and exploration, which it has been for me. But it can also be a way of enacting a lot of larger struggles… how do I engage in those acts of exploration and excitement for trying new things while also making it so that other people can do the same?” Trice wonders.
***
5:30 p.m. I may be struggling to afford to get this right, but I also can’t afford to get this wrong. I step into the shower to the sound of Abbey Lincoln singing about the land from which her soul supposedly hails. I wash the leave-in conditioner from my sectioned hair and from my aching eyes. I detangle part by part with a wide-tooth comb and do some dreaming of my own. I remember a time when my hair would grow up instead of down; a time before I abandoned my pick for a comb and my hair oil for conditioners that promised to lengthen, loosen, and define my curls.
At 6:00 p.m. I step out of the shower, dry my hair with a t-shirt, and look into the mirror. The dream is over and my hair is under control again.
The frazzled girl in the mirror is gone.  I have created someone in her place who is apparently more employable, tidier and cleaner. All at once, I wonder if somehow I am gone as well.

With their sad and empty displays tucked away between bustling coffee shops and burrito places, these businesses often go unnoticed. But FM is finally shining a light on their desolate facades in this tour of the most depressing places around Harvard.
The Evergood Market
The empty shell of a store located between Harvard and Porter squares has been silent for almost two years, reminding passersby of a long-gone era when polio and a men-only Ivy League weren’t just punchlines to jokes about baby boomers. The grocery store closed due to declining sales in August 2016. It would have serendipitously turned 69 this year, though it has yet to be occupied by other tenants. So when we paid this corpse of a once-loved family business a visit, we found everything remained untouched and eerily retro. The painted sign, bleached by the occasional Cambridge sun, and the mostly barren shelves, some still with a stray can or two, were plain post-apocalyptic. I left reminded of my own mortality and craving a diner milkshake.
Market in the Square
The story behind the store’s closing is shrouded with the mystery of drug rumors. Yet the reason for this store’s unfortunate demise turns out to be a simple and less glamorous failure to pay rent. The once bustling business that could satisfy any craving at any hour now forlornly displays its badge of shame: the sheriff’s yellow “Seized” stickers and windows covered in white paper. It’s probably for the best, though, as not many people would be able to bear the heartbreaking view of the much loved sandwich counter lonely and abandoned. The glory days are truly over.
Quad Rite Aid
Somehow the Quad Rite Aid is even sadder than the bad CVS whose closure touched exactly zero hearts. The inside of the store is akin to an optical illusion: it seems tiny as you enter, but contorts into lonely maze of shelves upon shelves of greeting cards and store brand medicine, leading you to a wall devoid of customers. But the most upsetting thing about the store is its absolute lack of self-checkout registers, forcing me to interact with other people when I really just wanted to buy sea salt popcorn.
Harvard Square Theatre
The soon-to-be-demolished-and-turned-into-a-mall (*capitalism*) former movie theater has a legendary presence in the Square. Despite being on death row, this space is actually the least depressing on the list because of its touchingly campy murals of Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin.
Bob Slate Stationers
This obscure business is located right next to that one hardware store right in the heart of the square. It’s therefore way too close to its competitors CVS, Staples and Papyrus (the rich man’s Staples). The store’s offerings, from motivational cat prints your granddad has in his garage to leftover Valentine’s Day stickers, are so touching in their guileless innocence you almost feel bad for this small stationery store trying to survive in a cutthroat atmosphere. But not bad enough to actually go there. I actually wrote this review after looking at one store photo on their Facebook page.

Walking into the office of Astronomy professor Owen J. Gingerich, you may want to double check to make sure you’ve found the right place. More a book collector’s sanctum than an office, Gingerich’s bookshelves are crowded with ancient, valuable books and tchotchkes. But despite the wealth of knowledge that pervades the room, one particular item truly stands out among the rest—a brown paper bag filled with a raisin-bread ham sandwich from Whole Foods Market: Gingerich’s daily lunch.
Gingerich smirks, unable to contain a child-like grin. “So, why’d I get chosen for an interview?”
At ease in his herringbone blazer, grey slacks, and worn, black dress shoes, Gingerich, at first glance, blends in well with the otherwise undecorated walls of the Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. But one need only look into his eyes to discover a man of zeal—not just an academic, but also an investigator with a genuine vigor for the history of astronomy.
Gingerich first began collecting tables containing star positions–called ephemerides–after a professor researching a poem by John Skelton called to ask him about the position of stars in the sky.
“Looking carefully at the poem, it was very wonderfully the case that you could date it,” Gingerich says. “There were just enough hints, half of which had been ignored by the Skelton experts earlier and didn’t get hung up on all his little details.”
And that’s what he does best: get hung up on the details.  It was his investigation into this poem that caused him to wonder, “How accurate were ephemerides at the time of Columbus?”  So he acquired more of the tables until he had amassed the world’s largest collection from 1460 up until 1600. “So you ask how I got into collecting…” he trails off, laughing.
When asked to put his interest into words, Gingerich falters, unable to assign over 30 years of work one single motive.  His magnum opus, “The Book Nobody Read,” was originally meant to be a simple contradiction of Arthur Koestler, a scholar who claimed that nearly no one contemporaneous with Copernicus read his revolutionary work on the heliocentric model (De Revolutionibus).  Upon discovering a first-edition copy of De Revolutionibus in the Edinburgh observatory, he noticed that it was full of annotations in the margins. Gingerich says, “And it was plain that here was somebody who had interest in the book.” This “someone” turned out to be Erasmus Reinhold, a prominent astronomy teacher in the 1500s.
Thinking that this teacher probably shared his copy of Copernicus with his students, Gingerich decided to look at a few other copies of De Revolutionibus—maybe a 100-copy survey, just to be safe. But this project ended up being more than he originally bargained for. The marginalia from one edition of the book launched an adventure around the globe to seek out more than 600 copies of De Revolutionibus.
After seeing his 100th copy of the Copernicus volume, Gingerich received an offer he couldn’t refuse: a chance to go to the Vatican and see their edition.  To his surprise, the Vatican copy also had Reinhold’s annotations—the same ones he saw in the Edinburgh observatory.
“And I realized, not just then, it was really just stamping it, that there was a fair amount of readership and it was indicated by people having identical notes, and they were copying from each other and their teachers,” Gingerich says.  His studies revealed a network of scholarship that surrounded the work previously thought to have only been read by “about 10 people.”
When asked which of the books lining his office walls are most valuable, he replies, “I’ve never worked it out that way.” Predictably, most of his collection correlates with his deep interest in the lives and work of Copernicus and Kepler. Even one of the few non-scientific books he has still maintains a strong connection to his penchant for Copernican artifacts: a Hebrew Bible printed by the same publisher as De Revolutionibus. Gingerich takes great pride, however, in the variety of his collection–everything from pamphlets signed by John Dee, to thousand-page records of astronomical data before 2000 BC, to a Eurypterus remipies fossil.
When asked to sum up the composition of his collection, Gingerich pauses for a brief moment, scanning through the catalog of his library, only contained in his brain. He smiles.
“So you’re sort of asking what kind of things do I have? Well…. all sorts, really!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students said they are concerned and confused by the school’s approach to sexual assault prevention and response at a panel Tuesday, arguing HKS needs to clarify its methods for handling sexual misconduct.
The panel, hosted by the Kennedy School’s Gender Policy Union, centered around student activism meant to address sexual misconduct at Harvard. The event featured speakers Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19— a member of anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better—and MaryRose Mazzola, a 2015 graduate of the Kennedy School and a former co-coordinator of the Harvard graduate school-wide coalition Harvard Students Demand Respect.
Goldberg and Mazzola detailed the histories of their respective groups and actions they have taken to push forward initiatives meant to end sexual violence and harassment on campus.
Emily M. Ausubel, a first-year Master in Public Policy student and a co-chair of the Gender Policy Union, said the group decided to focus on sexual assault policy after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that 18 women have accused Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences last month  placed Dominguez on “administrative leave” as Harvard investigates the allegations, and Dominguez has since announced he will retire from post.
“That created a big stir across campus and suddenly a lot of people were talking about this issue in a much more directed way and including myself and the rest of the Gender Policy Union members,” Ausubel said.
The Dominguez allegations prompted Kennedy School students to consider the school’s method of handling sexual harassment. The Kennedy School follows University-wide Title IX policy and procedures for handling complaints of sexual misconduct, and in recent years has taken a number of steps to implement the recommendations of a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention.
The school now holds mandatory trainings at student orientation, has designated four staff members as Title IX coordinators, and provides workshops to train faculty on how to facilitate conversations around gender-based and other sensitive issues in the classroom, according to Kennedy School spokesman Doug Gavel.
Still, some students said these actions are not enough.
At the panel, Ausubel spoke about several concerns students have shared about the current implementation of the Title IX policy at HKS, which she said students raised at an off-the-record town hall about sexual misconduct the Union hosted last week.
“Some of the big takeaways of that conversation was a lack of clarity on Title IX policy, including all of the nitty gritty of the steps,” Ausubel said.
In addition to confusion over Title IX policy, Ausubel said students at the town hall called the mandatory orientation program was inadequate. Specifically, Ausubel said students worried that the training—currently mandatory for all first-year students but not for returning students—did not do enough to spark discussions around consent and community norms at Harvard.
The four current Title IX coordinators at the school all hold additional administrative roles; Debra Isaacson, the Title IX coordinator specifically for students, also serves as dean of students. Ausubel said students believe the four administrators are “overworked” and unable to prioritize Title IX concerns as a result.
Isaacson did not respond to a request for comment.
Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in a statement Wednesday the school has been working to address these issues.
“We have been discussing many of these concerns with students, and we share the frustration of many students about how challenging the issue of sexual harassment can be,” Gavel wrote.
Goldberg and Mazzola concluded the panel by offering strategies so students can better communicate their feedback and apprehensions about current sexual misconduct-related procedures to administrators.
Goldberg urged Kennedy School students to connect with students at other graduate schools and Title IX experts. She also discussed what she called “the capital H policy,” a strategy of using the Harvard name to push for change.
“People pay attention to you because you’re a Harvard student, and that can be a really valuable tool,” she said.
Gavel wrote in a statement that the Kennedy School will continue to listen to student feedback in order to improve their programming on sexual assault prevention and response.
“We also have been engaging in conversations with our students to hear their concerns, and their ideas, so that we can enhance and improve our policies and our orientation sessions moving forward,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates at America Adelante—an invitation-only conference hosted at the Kennedy School meant to foster leadership and collaboration between Latinx individuals—listened to students of color from Parkland, Fla. talk about the #NeverAgain movement to stop gun violence on a conference call last weekend.
In February, 17 people were killed after a shooter opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Since then, students from the school have spoken out against gun violence on social media, ultimately organizing a march in Washington D.C that drew thousands and galvanized support for gun control.
Ten Parkland students called into the conference to share their experiences with attendees, who ranged from Harvard students to politicians and executive directors of various companies. The students said they hoped to convey the many voices in the #NeverAgain movement, especially those of students of color, whom they said have so far not comprised the focus of the movement.
“There’s been a shared message across many voices at this school. We all share the same message, and we want to tell the world,” said Carlos “Carlitos” Rodriguez, a Stoneman Douglas junior. “More than 3,300 students go to Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and we all were affected.”
The group of students that called into the conference is currently working on a campaign to share and broadcast personal stories of gun violence in all situations—stories that may not have appeared in national publications and news outlets. The campaign, called “Stories Untold,” is available on Twitter and Instagram.
A different group of students from Parkland—including Emma González, who has largely become the face of the #NeverAgain movement—visited the Institute of Politics earlier in February.
The students on the conference call said different stories took place in every classroom across Stoneman Douglas.
“I don’t have the words for it,” said Lorena Sanabria, another Stoneman Douglas junior. “It makes you think that at that point where you think you don’t know what’s going on, there were already people lying dead.”
Several conference attendees said they have changed their approach to the movement against gun violence after hearing the students speak.
“For weeks, we have been telling ourselves, we need to get a hold of Emma [González]. Never did it occur to me, there are other Latinos there. It’s Florida for God’s sake,” Lucy Flores, Vice President of Public Affairs at Mitú—a media company that focuses on Latinx perspectives and issues—said. “Your voices are as valuable and as powerful as everybody else’s.”
She added that she is making a “commitment” to feature the students’ stories on a video series for Mitú.
“This isn’t just a moment. This is a movement. We want to propel the ideas that come out of these wonderful people into the culture at large,” Herb Scannell, CEO of Mitú, added.
Sindy M. Benavides, the COO of civil rights organization League of United Latin American Citizens, said the event helped her see the importance of “taking a step back and actually asking them what help they need versus making an assumption of what I can provide.”
“A lot of times you forget that as youth, they also have answers,” Benavides said. “On our end, our job is to make sure we’re helping them harness the creativity and the power they already have.”
Rodriguez is a vlogger, and, amid the chaos that ensued during the shooting, he captured some footage of his experience. Some of that footage depicts students running and hiding. Other students described their fear and uncertainty during the shooting.
“I was on the first floor of the building: room 1213. We could hear shots down the hallway but didn’t really have an idea of what was happening,” said Morgan Williams, a Stoneman Douglas junior. “It was a weird feeling; we were all confused and didn’t know what was going on.”
Four people in Williams’s class were shot. She described having to run past bodies in the hallway to get out of the building.
“Nothing felt real in that moment,” she said.
The students on the call also talked about what happened after the shooting and detailed their activism around the issue of gun violence.
“They should have realized it at Columbine. They should have done something then,” Rodriguez said.
“When all this starts to calm down and people start to forget, I don’t want people to forget,” Williams said. “I want people to still remember what happened and what continues to happen in this country because of gun violence.”
Sanabria said in an interview after the discussion that she laments not having the chance to remind conference attendees to actively continue having conversations.
“Don’t let this be a passing memory because this is very relevant. I mean, look at what happened at Youtube just yesterday. They witnessed a shooting as well.”
A shooter opened fire at YouTube headquarters Tuesday, injuring three and killing herself.
Daniel Tabares, a freshman at Stoneman Douglas, asked, “How are you, Harvard, going to help us and keep this movement going?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This August, incoming Harvard freshmen will have a new pre-orientation program option—the First-Year Retreat and Experience, or FYRE, a two-year funded pilot program developed particularly for under-resourced students.
FYRE co-chair James A. Bedford ’20 revealed the new program’s name at a town hall last month. The program’s steering committee, comprising six members, and its director, Sadé Abraham, gathered to introduce themselves, provide program updates, and hear feedback from students and faculty present. Katie W. Steele, director of College initiatives and student development, and Roland S. Davis, the associate dean of diversity and inclusion, both attended the meeting.
Andrew Perez ’20 and Bedford said FYRE will be limited to 100 students, though the two expect the number of applications to surpass this cap. Abraham will work closely with the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid to determine who will "benefit the most" from the program, she said.
While some town hall attendees said they assume the program will serve many first-generation college students, the name of the program deliberately leaves out the words “first generation” in an effort to broaden outreach and avoid stereotypes, according to Bedford.
“We wanted to ensure that this program wasn't stigmatizing in a way that this program was called the ‘first generation’ or  ‘low-income group’ on campus—or in any way that students felt outed or couldn't have pride in that pre-orientation program,” Bedford said. “We definitely want to evoke a sense of excitement and ensure that we embody the continued commitment to students on this campus.”
The program co-chairs also said they are aware some incoming students who qualify as under-resourced will not also fall under the first-generation label.
“You don't need to be low-income to feel insecure and uncomfortable coming to Harvard because you haven't had those resources,” Bedford said.
Last spring semester, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a similar proposal for a “First Year Institute,” a summer pre-matriculation program designed specifically for low-income and first generation students. But Khurana announced in August that the College would debut a new pre-orientation program for freshmen from "historically marginalized communities" in 2018.
Perez said FYRE will heavily focus on community-building. In an effort to create concrete relationships that extend past the pre-orientation program, FYRE staffers will form “families” comprised of two team leaders and 10 students. Perez said Alyssa J. Britton ’21, head of mentorship for the program, is still planning out how families will be paired.
“I think that's something that we're trying to do among other things—just really stressing the mentorship and the community aspect of the program and the mission statement of saying that it's not just ‘We're going to give you tools and you'll figure it out on your own,’ but rather ‘We'll be there for you just like there have been people that have been there for us,’” said Perez.
The application for team leaders is now closed, and the co-chairs are currently conducting interviews.
The steering committee for FYRE is also currently creating its own resource guide with the ultimate goal of supporting more Harvard students, including those who may be rejected from the program.
“The resource guide kind of exemplifies one of the ways in which we could be showing continued commitment to the students not to just do three and half days and leave them with something they can really take away as something tangible,” Bedford said.
The resource guide is still being workshopped, and Bedford said the committee is still actively seeking student feedback.
“We really want to hear from the community, because I know that our six voices are diverse but not representative of everyone who can benefit from this program,” Bedford said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate School of Design affiliates are circulating a month-old spreadsheet—publicly available online—that contains anonymous accounts of sexual misconduct and racist acts allegedly perpetrated by more than a dozen GSD students, faculty, and administrators including the current dean.
The spreadsheet, titled “Shitty Architecture Men,” does not only list GSD affiliates—as of Monday, the sheet named more than 100 men affiliated with institutions of higher education like Yale University as well as men who work for prominent architecture firms. Up until recently, anyone with Internet access and the link to the document could add in a man’s name, that individual’s associated institution or firm, and a description of the inappropriate acts the man allegedly committed.
The list is now temporarily unavailable and will return April 9, according to a message posted by the document’s anonymous administrator Tuesday.
In anonymous postings on the sheet, commenters accused 18 GSD affiliates of treating students improperly in the classroom and in professional settings; the accusations comprise both allegations of sexual harassment and allegations of racist behavior. Accused Design School men range from studio instructors to lecturers to top leaders at the school, including current Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi and former chair of the school’s Department of Architecture Iñaki Ábalos.
In a statement provided Monday by GSD spokesperson Travis Dagenais, Design School Executive Dean Patricia Roberts wrote the school is “aware” of the list but cannot comment on the specific allegations.
“At the GSD, we take such issues very seriously,” Roberts wrote. “While I cannot comment on specific aspects of the list or individuals included on it, it is itself a signal that we must do better to promote an open dialogue about these issues and to strive for transparency in how we as a school deal with them.”
In a disclaimer posted on the spreadsheet, sheet administrators emphasize that none of the content in the document is “legally true.”
“We do not represent anything here as fact,” the disclaimer reads. “This is a compilation of thoughts, experiences and memories and things we have overheard.”
GSD administrators have taken several steps to respond to broader concerns over sexual misconduct at the school across the past few weeks.
Mostafavi held an open forum conversation last week with GSD students to discuss actions the School of Design has taken in the past regarding sexual misconduct and to solicit ideas for the path forward.
“It was a conversation we are eager to continue,” Roberts wrote in her emailed statement.
Roberts also sent a March 26 email to Design School affiliates affirming the school’s commitment to “personal accountability.” The email did not specifically reference the list.
“As most of you know, the national conversation about sexual and gender-based harassment in professional and educational environments… has intensified over the past several months, most recently within the design disciplines,” Roberts wrote in the March email. “We take all disclosures of sexual and/or gender-based harassment, including sexual assault, very seriously.”
Roberts also pointed out Title IX resources available at the GSD and Harvard more broadly in her March email and encouraged students to share their concerns with GSD Title IX coordinators. The School of Design has “augmented” its policies and procedures related to preventing sexual harassment and assault in recent years, according to Roberts.
The school is planning to hold a series of discussions related to issues of sexual misconduct in coming weeks, Roberts wrote in her emailed statement to The Crimson Monday.
The “Shitty Architecture Men” sheet comes amid heightened national consciousness of sexual harassment and assault, spurred in large part by viral social media campaigns like the #MeToo movement. The movement has unseated men in industries ranging from Hollywood to academia.
At Harvard, Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez retired in March after at least 18 women publicly accused him of sexual harassment—and after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Dominguez on “administrative leave.”
The Design School list parallels a previous public spreadsheet, dubbed “Shitty Media Men,” in which anonymous contributors made allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against men who worked for magazines and in the publishing industry. In its final form, that list included accusations against more than 70 men.
Natasha H. Hicks, a student pursuing her master’s degree in urban planning and design at the GSD, wrote in an email Wednesday that the spreadsheet has been “well-circulated informally” among students and faculty. She wrote she thinks the spreadsheet has encouraged conversations about sexual harassment and Title IX at the school.
“I think what is positive about the list is that it is bringing to the forefront of the conversation a critical dialogue as to how we define the spectrum of sexual harassment and assault,” Hicks wrote. “It has also provided a lot of questions and conversations around insufficiencies in current protocol and procedures, namely how universities handle Title IX requirements.”
Taylor J. Halamka, a GSD student who heads the Design School’s Student Forum, wrote in an email that the Forum—a student governance body—is committed to working with administrators and students to address “larger pervasive issues” raised by the spreadsheet.
“These discussions are ongoing, and we are just at the beginning,” Halamka wrote. “It is our hope that we have begun not merely a conversation but a call for action within our walls and outside of them.”

Administrators flagged seven classes at the Harvard School of Public Health for review this year after each class drew three or more student reports of in-class “verbal or nonverbal slights/insults” on online course evaluations.
In total, 85 students responded “yes” to a question asking whether they had experienced in-class microaggressions, according to data provided by Nancy Turnbull, senior associate dean for professional education at the School of Public Health. In 43 out of 138 courses evaluated during the most recent two academic terms, at least one student reported hearing insults.
Turnbull wrote in an email that there is “a very small number of courses in which students identify this as an issue.”
The seven courses with three or more “yes” responses received 36 total reports of microaggressions.
These classes have now been “flagged for special review and attention,” Turnbull wrote.
Meredith B. Rosenthal, senior associate dean for academic affairs, said administrators sometimes meet individually with faculty members to discuss these kinds of issues.
“On a case-by-case basis, we'll meet individually with faculty where we see concerns to help them understand what their students’ experiences are, but also to help them figure out how to address them,” she said.
Administrators also share data with the faculty as a whole in an effort to spark conversations about diversity issues at the school, Rosenthal said.
“We share data in the aggregate with the faculty at faculty meetings,” she said. “We have workshops for our faculty that help them think about how to manage sometimes difficult, but important, conversations in classrooms around diversity and inclusion.”
The question on the course evaluation forms specifically asks students if they have experienced any “verbal or nonverbal slights/insults (whether intentional or unintentional) that negatively targeted a particular identity group.”
The form lists “age, disability status, gender, immigration status, linguistic background, nationality, political views, race/ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class” as examples of identity groups.
In an email, Rosenthal wrote that students can report “student-to-student” comments as well as remarks made by faculty.
Students have been able to report information about classroom climate via the evaluation form for around three years, though the question has not always been phrased in exactly the same way, Rosenthal said.
On average, nearly 90 percent of students complete the evaluations.
At a town hall last month, a School of Public Health student asked Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris if he plans to include a similar question on undergraduate Q Guide forms.
“There will be a question of some kind that at least is trying to get at that,” Harris responded. He added the exact phrasing of the question was yet to be determined.
Harris later penned an op-ed in The Crimson asserting that the question, if included, will ask “whether the teaching staff has created a welcoming environment conducive to learning” and “is not intended to invite reports on breaches of professional conduct.”
Across the University more broadly, faculty and administrators are stepping up efforts to address issues of diversity and inclusion. Last week, a University-wide task force released its final report proposing eight key steps Harvard should take to become more inclusive, including creating two new research centers.
According to the report, 5 percent of School of Public Health faculty are underrepresented minorities. Only the Medical School has a lower percentage of underrepresented minority faculty, clocking in at 4 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has filed a Title IX complaint against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez, according to an email FAS Dean Michael D. Smith sent Tuesday to 15 women who are accusing the professor of sexual harassment.
Smith’s email came as a private response to a letter the 15 women sent last Thursday. In their letter, the women—comprising former Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and staff—called on the University to implement several steps they claim are necessary to ensure a “full and fair” review of the allegations against Dominguez.
The women also outlined several criticisms of the Title IX office, which deals with the federal policy—Title IX—that prohibits sex or gender-based discrimination including sexual harassment. Smith wrote in his reply email that he could not comment on the women's criticisms because there is an ongoing complaint against the professor.
“Since the FAS has submitted a formal Title IX complaint involving Jorge Dominguez, it is improper for me to opine on the specific issues laid out in your letter while this complaint is open,” Smith wrote in the email, obtained by The Crimson.
In February and March, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez, the former vice provost for International Affairs, of repeated instances of sexual misconduct across the past three decades.
Soon after the allegations became public, Smith announced that FAS would review the allegations against Dominguez and that Dominguez was being placed on paid “administrative leave.” A day later Dominguez declared he would retire from his teaching position at the end of the school year and would step down from all administrative positions immediately.
Though several women have been in touch with the Title IX office about Dominguez, Smith’s email forms the first confirmation from administrators that there is an official complaint against the professor.
Formal Title IX complaints in FAS are investigated according to the school’s sexual and gender-based harassment policies and procedures. Once a formal complaint is filed, the Office for Dispute Resolution is tasked with investigating the allegations.
Both individuals and the institution itself can file Title IX complaints. Nienke C. Grossman ’99, one of the 15 women who signed the Thursday letter to Smith,  said staffers in the Title IX Office told her on March 26 that the office had prepared a complaint including a list of potential complainants or witnesses. She and Suzanna E. Challen, another alumnus who has made public allegations against Dominguez, first reached out to the Title IX Office about the professor in Nov. 2017.
“The Title IX Office offered for us to serve as witnesses to the Title IX complaint or to file our own complaints. They gave us the option of doing either,” Grossman wrote in an email last month.
Once ODR receives a formal complaint, it assigns an investigator to the case, who then performs an initial review. If the investigator decides there is sufficient grounds for further investigation, the respondent—the person against whom the allegations have been made—is contacted to submit a response to the accusations. The respondent can submit a list of witnesses; ODR will ultimately build an expanded witness list including individuals the complainant lists as well as others the investigator considers valuable to the investigation.
At the investigation’s conclusion, the investigator will create a report detailing recommendations for FAS to “eliminate any harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects.”
“We share a commitment to a full and fair investigation of the allegations surrounding Jorge Dominguez,” Smith wrote in the email he sent to the women Thursday. “I continue to encourage anyone who may have witnessed or experienced sexual harassment, whether recently or in the past, to come forward and share their experiences.”
The women claimed in their letter last week that Harvard is “ill-equipped” to complete such an investigation due to a variety of factors including a lack of resources and a previous failure to recognize Dominguez’s decades of alleged harassment. The letter's signatories also called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Dominguez’s alleged history of sexual misconduct, claiming the University cannot be objective when investigating itself.
Smith’s emailed response did not address the topic of an independent investigation.
The women wrote last week they are addressing Smith because the University’s policies afford the FAS dean authority over the investigation of misconduct and discipline of professors, including granting himthe ability to modify the normal procedures “in cases involving grave misconduct.”
“As detailed in our procedures, the administration of discipline in cases against Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) faculty is subject to the authority of the FAS Dean,” Smith wrote in his response Thursday.
Smith added he has forwarded the women's letter to Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 because Garber oversees the Title IX Office and ODR. The women sent a copy of their letter to Garber, University President Drew G. Faust, and Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild last week.
“You should be hearing from the Provost’s Office directly,” Smith wrote.

Consider this article a call to action for all Harvard students. Cardi B is currently partnering with Tinder to hold a free concert for the school that receives the most right swipes on Tinder. Currently Harvard is in the top 64 schools, with half the schools being eliminated every week. The concert will be held for the winning school on April 25th, which coincides with the beginning of our reading period. In order to win ourselves a second Yardfest and prove to other schools that we are not just sad loners in the library, we have put together a guide to guarantee us the concert.
Sign Up Everyone You Know for Tinder (Including Yourself)
As long as it’s linked to their Facebook profile and it has Harvard as their school, all of their data will count toward our score. Significant others have to understand making a Tinder is worth it for Cardi B. You don’t necessarily have to use it, just let it sit there and rack up swipes.
Increase Your Radius
Tinder allows your radius to go up to 100 miles, and more mileage means more people, more potential right swipes, and a better chance for us getting that concert. The other people setting their radius that far away have to be desperate, which guarantees a good like ratio. The best part about this is you will never have to see these people around and you can ghost them peacefully.
Don't Swipe Left
Swiping left on people takes you out of people’s lineup, reducing the number of chances you have to be swiped right on. If you really cannot handle swiping right on a lot of people, just let your Tinder sit there until the end of the contest.
Swipe Right on Other Harvard Students
I know it may be weird to swipe right on that one person you see in the dining hall everyday or the person from your freshman year Expos, but remember—it’s for Cardi B. You don’t have to date this person, just swipe right for your mutual benefit.
Catfish
If you really don’t want to create a Tinder for yourself, find some great pictures of someone else and link a Tinder of their face to your Facebook account. Still counts for our total score without the telling yourself that you’ve given in to the monstrosity that is online dating.
Now, Harvard, is your time to rise. Don’t sit idly by and let the opportunity of a free Cardi B concert slip away.
