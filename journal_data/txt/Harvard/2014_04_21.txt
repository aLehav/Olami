After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, runners from around the world will step to the starting line of the Boston Marathon. This will be the 118th running of the world’s oldest annual marathon, but the first since the tragic bombing attack last year. More than 36,000 runners—the second largest field in the race’s history—will navigate the 26.2 miles from the suburb of Hopkinton to downtown Boston, despite the specter of two pressure-cooker bombs that killed three and injured 264 one year ago.
 
We applaud the spirit of those who will run again. We applaud too the citizens of Boston, of its neighboring towns, and of cities and towns all over the world who have come to cheer on the runners of the marathon. The commitment of both runners and spectators to participate in the race, despite the dangers last year presented, is a testament to their characters; it also represents an act of defiance, a symbol that the people of Massachusetts and elsewhere will not be cowed by brazen acts of terrorism.
 
The manner in which the Boston community has come together even more strongly than in years past is impressive, but not surprising. Even after the bombing and the subsequent manhunt—events that shook the spirits and beliefs of many—the people of this region stood tall and fought on; the community lived up to Boston’s reputation as a city of tough, loyal, and committed people. 
On a more somber note, we hope that this same sense of community can be harnessed to prevent future tragedies like the bombings on Marathon Monday last year. Though they were not born here, the Tsarnaev brothers nevertheless grew up mere miles from Boylston Street. They went to school here; they lived here. It is our hope that an even stronger Boston community can help thwart any future homegrown attacks.
The race today represents a time of remembrance, of reflection, and of celebration. It is a time to remember the lives that were lost and the runners and spectators who were injured and traumatized, a time to remember the heroic efforts of the first responders and the policemen who captured the suspects. It is a time to reflect on the lessons learned—about the world we live in and the traditions and values that we hold dearest, about the fleeting nature of life. Most of all, it is a time to celebrate the determination of the runners of the marathon. It is a time to celebrate the spirit of the city and its people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Whether in Boston in fact or in spirit, countless people are connected to the events of the storied Boston Marathon on any given Patriots’ Day. But on April 15, 2013, the people of Boston found themselves experiencing firsthand what people around the world were watching on their televisions and computer screens.
 
Everyone has a story. Those who had loved ones running. Those at the finish line at 2:49 p.m. Those who heard the news and simply couldn’t believe that this could happen in our backyard. Those who “would have been right there, if not for [insert small twist of fate here].” The runners themselves.
 
For me, that story took an unexpected turn from my vantage point on Boylston Street. Standing in front of a Dunkin Donuts right across the street from the Lenox Hotel, I was almost squarely between the two blasts. From the ground trembling beneath my feet to the ear-splitting, heart-wrenching bangs, I felt the reverberations from the explosions that led to a wave of terror, shock, and numbness. Since that moment, a part of me has become inextricably linked to my experience that day. Right then and there, I was both confronted with the fragility of human life and comforted by witnessing those whose immediate inclination was to help everyone around them. It is something I will never forget.
 
A year later, all you have to do is walk down the street and see reminders of last year—marathon jackets on the backs of dedicated runners, “Boston Strong” t-shirts hanging from the stands of vendors in Harvard Square, and even the blooming of bright yellow daffodils once again. It is easy to let this time become a source of sadness and flashback, but I have realized that it is far more important to channel all of these reminders into solidifying the lessons I have learned through the healing process in the last year.
 
So today, I hope to share just a few of my own thoughts on the positive things that emerged from that tragic day. I certainly do not claim to speak for everyone who was affected in some way; I simply hope to let you pause and consider what we can learn from that day and from each other. While it was an ordeal I would never wish upon anyone, it also offered me the gift of a newfound perspective—an urgency for living life to the fullest.
 
More than anything, I realized that nothing in this world matters more than the family and friends I treasure deeply. You can bet that my family was the first thing to come to my mind amidst the explosions. At the end of the day, life is about cherishing the people with whom we share our joys and sorrows, laughs and tears, and successes and setbacks. If there’s anything you take away from this piece, let it be this—make sure those people in your life know how much they mean to you. Don’t wait to let people know that you love them.
 
Another striking product of my experience was the poignant reminder that tomorrow is never guaranteed. When you realize that life can be taken from you in an instant, you remember that each day truly is a gift. Life is too short not to do what makes you happy.
 
One of the most resounding messages in the last year has been “Boston Strong.” To me, this is a message of community and solidarity. While it does not mean that we all have to be strong all the time, it means that together we are able to support each other. Together we are strong. Together. This is a lesson for all communities, including our own community here at Harvard.
 
“Vulnerable” is perhaps the most accurate term to describe how I felt on Boylston Street last April 15. And in the days and months that followed, it was difficult to feel vulnerable to my memories and to struggle when they inevitably surfaced. Especially at a place like Harvard, where it is so easy to get caught up in the façade of perfection, it is challenging to allow ourselves to open up to those around us. But this mistaken belief that everyone else has it all together just makes honest conversation even more critical. It took me a while, but I realized that it’s okay to not always be okay. Don’t be afraid to speak up, be honest, and listen in return.
 
Ultimately, the last year has shown the fundamental goodness of humanity. I have so much admiration for all the first responders, doctors, caregivers, and spectators who ran toward the injured. Their selfless actions exemplified what it means to care for each other. Most of all, the survivors themselves have displayed a remarkable persistence of spirit. People are truly incredible.
 
So with this anniversary, take time to reflect on what April 15, 2013, meant to you and the community you live in. Talk to your friends about their experiences. In doing so, we honor the victims, the survivors, and their families who are still recovering every day.
 
There are rare moments that transcend any lines that we draw between ourselves, and this is one of them. This binds us all together.
 
Let us not forget the lessons we learned just a short year ago. Tell your family you love them. Spend that extra time with your friends. Think about what it is you’re passionate about, and stop waiting to pursue it. Give back to your community. Cheer on the runners today. Lace up your running shoes if you feel like it. Do what makes you happy.
 
And most importantly, remember.

Harvard University is an institution that prides itself on its commitment to diversity. Our university has a robust financial aid program that actively seeks to make a Harvard education affordable. Our university has pioneered the holistic affirmative action admissions model and admits a diverse class of brilliant young minds each year. When it comes to diversity at Harvard, there are many reasons to be proud. 
But as events in recent weeks have demonstrated, the mission to create an environment in which all students feel that they belong has not yet been accomplished. The LatinX town hall meeting and “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign remind us that students of many backgrounds continue to feel at Harvard, but not of Harvard. 
The time is now for the University to recommit to fostering a more supportive campus. This fall, the most racially diverse class of freshman in Harvard’s history will arrive at our gates. We cannot let these students down.
Administrators, faculty members, and students must commit to actively supporting the ethnic and racial diversity already on Harvard’s campus as well as the incoming class of students arriving in the fall. We believe that many strides can still be made in official programming and policy related to racial diversity, faculty and staff diversity, and resources for student groups.
Racial insensitivity and other forms of harassment can no longer be accepted, excused, or ignored. In a series of town hall meetings organized by black and Latino student leaders, students reported several incidents of racial insensitivity and harassment from university administration and staff.
There is an urgent need for the administration to construct programming that better supports students of color and other historically marginalized communities. The Community Conversations that entering freshmen participate in are meant to cultivate diversity, yet many of these conversations feel forced, insincere, and short-lived. We believe a more sustained and impactful program dedicated to fostering diversity should be implemented in each House, operating as an open forum for students and faculty to come together and have meaningful conversations on race, culture, class, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
Harvard’s faculty and administration play a critical role in nurturing a diverse atmosphere, but the present racial makeup of Harvard’s faculty and administration does not reflect the racial diversity of the student population. We believe the lack of racial diversity among Harvard faculty and administration diminishes our university’s ability to foster a campus of belonging.
The most urgent concern is the lack of diversity on the Administrative Board. This body is responsible for disciplining Harvard students, yet its members are far from representative of the student population. It is of utmost importance that the University take deliberate action to diversify this key group of administrators.
 
At $32.7 billion, Harvard University has the largest financial endowment of any university in the country. Yet, unlike Yale and Stanford, Harvard does not have dedicated physical spaces for racial minorities. The Harvard Foundation has played an important role in improving race relations on campus, but we believe that safe, physical spaces for historically marginalized minorities are also necessary. The lack of physical spaces for racial groups has undoubtedly contributed to the feelings of exclusion that many Harvard students have voiced. 
These physical spaces will empower, not divide. Presently, far too many students of color have voiced frustrations in not being able to safely discuss many issues that pertain to their lives on campus. Like the Office of BGTLQ Student Life and the Women’s Center, safe, physical spaces for racial minorities are a necessity if Harvard is to be an institution of belonging. 
Dean Pfister recently announced the creation of a working group to “examine how we can better support the needs of all our students, especially those who don't feel a full sense of belonging at Harvard.” Working groups and task forces are positive steps in the right direction, but it is crucial that our university community go beyond merely examining issues of diversity and inclusion. Our coalition, The Diversity Report, is dedicated to working with the administration to not just examine these issues, but also ensure that the University implements these changes.


The United States grows more diverse with each passing day. By the end of this decade, no single ethnic or racial group will constitute a majority of children under the age of 18. Those children will grow up and apply to universities like Harvard expecting to feel a sense of belonging regardless of what color their skin is. If Harvard is to be that institution, committed to inclusive excellence, diversity, and equal opportunity, our university must make the affirmative effort to foster an environment that all Harvard students can sincerely and proudly say they belong to.

Last spring, as a member of the Undergraduate Capital Campaign Task Force, I had the dubious privilege of being one of the first to hear Harvard’s newest fundraising pitch. I was struck by the Capital Campaign’s emphasis on the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the expense of the humanities or social sciences—and by its strange ideas on how to push forward “Teaching and Learning” initiatives. A year later, I am concerned that Harvard has its priorities wrong—our university continues to seek millions of dollars for “twenty-first century classrooms” while ignoring true obstacles to excellent undergraduate education.
In the past year, our university officially launched the creatively-named “Harvard Campaign,” which seeks to raise $6.5 billion across the university. Harvard has made public its intention to raise $2.5 billion for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including $450 million earmarked directly for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; according to my most recent email from Dean Pfister, we’re more than halfway to that goal. The Harvard Campaign as a whole has identified several “aspirations” to which it encourages alumni to donate. These include “Meaning, Values, and Creativity,” “Integrated Knowledge,” and “Teaching and Learning.”
Harvard’s fundraisers told the Undergraduate Capital Campaign Task Force that the campaign priorities reflect what excites donors. Apparently, at least in the minds of Harvard’s fundraising staff, Harvard’s alums are thrilled by science and gadgets. The “Teaching and Learning” section of the Harvard Campaign relies on the rhetoric of technological progress, using phrases like “innovation in pedagogy,” “emerging insights,” and “the transformative potential of the digital age.”
The Harvard Campaign website suggests “a few examples” of ways in which your donation to Harvard might push forward teaching and learning initiatives: by creating “advanced pedagogical tools,” by funding “a suite of online courses through HarvardX,” or by supporting the “digitization of the Harvard Library’s extensive collection.”In particular, the Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences suggests donations to “support 21st-century classrooms,” in which “cutting-edge technology, digital tools, and flexible furniture enable innovative pedagogy and active learning.”
I’m sure that all of these proposals reflect well-developed and thoughtful plans on the part of Harvard University. But in my four years here, the rigidity of Harvard’s furniture has never seemed a major roadblock to my learning experience. In fact, I have had little to no interaction with technology in the classroom. While updated “digital tools” might be useful for statistical modelers, computer scientists, and engineers, they mean little to me, or to the hundreds of other undergraduates in the humanities and social sciences.
Instead, my day-to-day pedagogical experience has been much more heavily influenced by my teachers—the faculty, lecturers, and graduate students with whom I read, discuss, and learn. I have had the privilege to take a few seminar-sized classes led by really excellent educators. Professors including Edward Hall of the Philosophy Department; Henry Abelove, last year’s F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professor of Gender and Sexuality; Sheila Jasanoff of the Program of Science, Technology, and Society; and Allan Brandt of the History of Science Department have all immensely enriched my intellectual life. These faculty members have demonstrated to me that great education requires pedagogical skill and care. My best classes at Harvard have relied on carefully curated syllabi and thoughtfully led class discussions—not on new media or technological interventions.If Harvard truly wants to improve the learning experience of its undergraduate students, it should invest in its teachers. Most students require not cutting-edge technology, but simply a decent classroom experience.
Happily, the Harvard Campaign need not grasp for vague solutions like “innovative classrooms”: The Harvard Teaching Campaign has begun to lay out a clear way forward for Harvard to improve teaching and learning. The Teaching Campaign demands that the university “commit to providing reasonably sized sections and lab groups” with a maximum of 12 students each. Even if all large lecture classes were also available on HarvardX, hour-long sections would still not allow time for every student to speak more than once. Even if every single room in Sever Hall were retrofitted with wall-sized computer screens, over-loaded teaching fellows might still fail to return problem sets on time.
Nicholas Christakis wrote last year in The New York Times, “The social sciences offer equal promise for improving human welfare; our lives can be greatly improved through a deeper understanding of individual and collective behavior.” I might go even further and suggest that the social sciences and the humanities provide important insights into human welfare that the sciences can never approach. Harvard’s outsized investment in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences suggests that Harvard has great hope for the future of education and research in engineering. But Harvard should not forget its roots in the humanities and social sciences, nor the undergraduates and graduate students who depend on the archival and intellectual resources of this university for their research.
For someone whose academic work relies on computer modeling and programming, high-tech classrooms and state-of-the-art technologies could influence pedagogy. I, on the other hand, am happy in an old wood-paneled classroom and rigid furniture. If Harvard administrators want to improve the educational experience of the majority of our undergraduates and graduate students, they should focus not on updating classroom technology but on training professors and graduate students and allowing them to be good educators.

In search of budding entrepreneurs, the casting team for ABC’s Emmy-nominated reality television show “Shark Tank” visited Harvard’s Innovation Lab on Friday.
“Shark Tank” presents four “sharks,” multi-millionaire and billionaire business leaders seeking a product worth their investment. On each episode, aspiring entrepreneurs present their pitches to the sharks and negotiate a deal.
The show’s producers have embarked on a nationwide search, which will continue through July, to find innovative entrepreneurs to appear as contestants on the show. The traveling casting team takes notes on the pitches they are presented and sends information to producers in Los Angeles, who make final casting decisions.
In a four-hour time frame, students from across the University came to the lab to pitch their products, which ranged from sanitizing products to cellphone apps.
A good pitch generally includes a compelling product and a captivating personality, according to Shark Tank supervising casting producer Scott Salyers.
“Getting on Shark Tank is a combination of the business product idea and the person,” Salyers said. “It is a TV show, so we want people that are going to be passionate.”
Gordon S. Jones, the managing director of the Innovation Lab, said he saw similar trends in aspiring entrepreneurs who have successful projects or ventures.
“First, you look at the entrepreneur themselves and ask are they willing to take risks or do they prefer to be safe and do they have the skills to take this unique idea forward,” Jones said. “And lastly, are they passionate about it?”
Salyers said he thinks that studying at Harvard will give contestants on the show a leg up, but the quality of the product along with personality are still crucial.
“A lot of it is based on their credibility and their background,” Salyers said. “It’s not going to hurt if you’re in front of the sharks and you say you go to Harvard Business School.”
Harvard is among a number of universities being visited by the casting team, including the University of Southern California and the University of Texas.
“We try to be open to the idea of innovation, so my thought was why not give students a chance to get their ideas out to a national audience,” Jones said. 
Olumade Alonge, a student at the Extension School, pitched his new idea to the five members of the casting team.
“Best case scenario would definitely be to get the investment and support from the sharks,” Alonge said. “Not getting a response at all without any feedback would be worse than not moving on.”

The Office of BGLTQ Student Life, in partnership with other campus organizations, has expanded Harvard’s Pride Week into Pride Month in order to increase its thematic scope and impact on students.
Throughout the month of April, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has facilitated an event series, entitled Harvard Pride ’14, centered on queer issues and student life. Campus organizations—including Queer Students and Allies, the queer Jewish student group BAGELS, and the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality—organized and sponsored individual events.
“We found that only providing programming in a week limited the opportunities for students to engage in community,” Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life Vanidy “Van” Bailey wrote in an email, adding that a single week limited the range of topics discussed.
According to Bailey, this sentiment led to the decision by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life to increase both the duration of Pride ’14 and the number of campus organizations it partnered with for Pride Month’s programming.
“Students being at the center of the work is key to my vision as the director and empowering the community to collaborate in that vision is critical,” Bailey wrote. “[The Office of BGLTQ Student Life] facilitated a collaborative program planning process that involved students, staff, faculty, prospective students, and [alumni].”
In this vein,“Get Wet: An Orgasm Seminar,” an event on Saturday which featured discussions on vaginal orgasms and free sex toys, was part of both Harvard Pride ’14 and Sex Weekend. The latter is a series of events about sex organized by the student group Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College as a spring preview to Sex Week in the fall.
Board member of SHEATH Kirin Gupta ’16 said she believes that partnerships with groups like the Office of BGLTQ Life are critical because they allow conversations about important issues like sex to specifically address gender and diversity.
 
“It has to be an inclusive dialogue that we have with everybody on campus who has any sort of stake in the issue,” Gupta said. She called these partnerships an “evolving process.”
According to Co-Chair of QSA Neimy K. Escobar ’15, although Harvard Pride existed prior to the founding of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life in spring 2012, it was organized largely by student groups such as the QSA. Escobar said she believes the organizational limitations of these groups partly explain why Harvard Pride had been limited to a week’s duration in the past.
Escobar said she is glad to see Harvard Pride happen again this year.
“I think there’s never enough conversations about a lot of things, and I think specifically highlighting certain months or certain weeks or certain events is a really great way to get the conversation out to a lot of people,” she said.
Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, co-chair of the Queer Advisory Council, which funded some of the events of Harvard Pride ’14, said the joint efforts of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and its partners resulted in “a huge calendar of events—from film screenings to panels to plays—that reflect the diversity of queer life at Harvard.”

More than 20 participants from across the University, other Boston schools, and the Boston and Cambridge community tackled several environmental issues at the first Sustainability Hackathon at the Harvard Innovation Lab on Saturday.
At the hackathon, hosted by the Harvard Environmental Action Committee and the Harvard Council on Business and the Environment, attendees formed groups of three and addressed one of seven possible topics—food waste, business and private residence engagement in sustainability efforts, Boston’s car-centric commuter culture, and chemical management in labs.
The hackathon ended with each group presenting possible solutions for these current sustainability challenges.
Hackathon organizer, Abhinav Bhushan, a research fellow in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, received a grant from Harvard’s Office of Sustainability to host the event.
Participants spent most of the day researching their topics. Groups presented proposals ranging from an improved tracking system to reduce chemical waste to an electronic waste disposal system that could be implemented at the University. Others sought ways to promote business and political involvement in creating more sustainable initiatives.
“This could be run as a thought experiment…but instead we’re having people address specific [issues] in order to create robust models to actually implement in the Boston and Cambridge area,” Saad Amer ’16, co-president of the Harvard Council on Business and the Environment, said.
Presentations were judged on their level of innovation, impact on sustainability, practicality, and presentation style. Winning teams received certificates based on their final rankings. Judges included representatives from Massachusetts General Hospital and the University.
“Bringing people together from different backgrounds to talk about these issues generates these ideas that everyone in their silos wouldn’t come up with [on their own],” said Holly W. Samuelson, a professor at the Graduate School of Design and one of the hackathon judges.
Although he felt that event attendance was low, Bhushan said he believed the event was a success given the quality of the presentations and feedback from the judges.
Amer said that some of the participants’ ideas will be presented to staff at the Office of Sustainability as it formulates a new sustainability plan for the University.

More than 1,000 students from Harvard and across the nation flocked to campus this weekend to discuss the political, social, and economic aspects of China’s role in the world as part of the annual Harvard China Forum.
The weekend-long forum, which sported a waitlist of more than 500 students wishing to attend, featured presentations and panels on topics ranging from the venture capital space in China to Chinese urbanization, with the mission to answer the question, “Can China lead?” 
Speakers included the former prime minister of Australia, Kevin M. Rudd, as well as the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, Stephen Orlins.
According to Eric Z. Wang ’15, the president of the Harvard China Forum, the conference attracted “unprecedented speakers and unprecedented levels of interest,” with large numbers of attendees packing into Science Center rooms in which the panels were held. The event has become a “yearly occasion” for many, Wang said, adding that he feels positively about the forum’s future.
One of the panelists, World Bank Vice President Xian Zhu, commented on the transformation of American interest in China, particularly at Harvard. He said that in his 28 years of regularly visiting Harvard and the United States more broadly, he has seen that interest has shifted from topics such as “the philosophy, history, and culture of China, in a very academic sense.” Given China’s increasingly prominent role in global business and financial markets, he said that interest in China as a current economic and political player has risen sharply.
One of the conference organizers, Carolyn R. Ye ’17, cited her interest in Chinese business and China’s “role as a growing superpower” as one of many reasons that she got involved in the conference.
“The way China is changing as a culture and economy are questions on everyone’s mind,” said Ye, who was a special programming associate for the conference. She added that her connection to China comes from years of visiting friends and family in China, as well as an interest in the history and philosophy of the country.
 
The conference drew many students from other universities as well. Stephen Quie, an international business major with a focus on China who attends Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota, said he found the conference valuable due to its holistic approach.
 
“You cannot do good business without a full understanding of China,” he said.
 
Meanwhile, David Guhl, a senior at Cornell University, said he was attracted to this particular conference because it draws a “huge concentration” of people with connections to mainland China and because many of the sessions were conducted in Chinese languages.
 Richard Lessard, a senior at Dartmouth College and president of Dartmouth’s Global China Connection, said that he was interested in the conference partly because he will be working for a consulting firm in Shanghai next year.

Every Saturday morning, History of Science professor Peter L. Galison ’77 wakes before dawn, laces up his shoes, and runs. Some days he heads for the Charles River, other days for downtown Boston, often braving the snow and ice to prepare for his second Boston Marathon.
“For me it’s a great treasure to see the city wake up while running and see people rowing on the Charles,” said Galison, who has been training for nearly two years since he first decided to run the marathon. “There’s something calming about it.”
Galison is one of about 36,000 runners racing this year’s Boston Marathon on Monday. More than two dozen of those runners will come from Harvard, either as qualifying runners or through the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, which this year has opened up spots for 17 Harvard undergraduates to race for a charity. Though Galison is running independently of the Marathon Challenge, with a non-Harvard group called the Marathon Coalition, he said the camaraderie of the runner community is universal.
But this year, Harvard runners say, that camaraderie will extend well beyond the race course. Many of those racing the 118th-annual Boston Marathon were present at last year’s event, either as spectators or runners, and remember vividly the horrific bombings near the finish line. 
Some, like Galison, were stopped short of the finish. Others, like fourth-time marathon runner and Human Evolutionary Biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman, had already completed the race and only heard news of the explosions after returning to campus. Even runners who did not partake in last year's marathon feel a strong connection with those who were affected by last year’s events.
To many Harvard racers, this year’s marathon is the ultimate symbol of “Boston Strong,” a message of solidarity that arose in the aftermath of the bombings last April. And on Monday, Harvard runners will celebrate this message, racing to honor the victims of last year’s tragedy and to finish the long course toward recovery.
“We’re running to reaffirm this wonderful tradition,” Lieberman said. “To reaffirm our community.”
BUILDING DISTANCE 
Most Harvard runners have been preparing for the marathon since 2013, consciously watching their diets and gradually ratcheting up their mileage all with an eye toward Marathon Monday. Over the course of six months, many runners, like Matthew J. Mollerus ’17, have been running 40 to 50 miles per week, saving the longer 20-mile runs for weekends.
Mollerus, a member of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, said the group selects marathon participants, who this year have raised funds for either the Phillips Brooks House Association or the American Medical Athletic Association, based on their participation in the group, making the marathon push one with community at its center.
Community members can access the group's listserv, managed by Craig Rodgers, founder of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, and post the time and place where they intend to run that day. In preparation for the marathon, many racers will find partners to accompany them on their longer distance runs, those most similar to the marathon itself.
Kate D. D'Orazio ’15 and Anne F. Wenk ’15 began running at Harvard during their freshman year. The two met through Harvard club running and have completed each of their long runs together in preparation of this year’s marathon.
“You just have hours to talk,” D'Orazio said. “[Anne] would bring water, and I would bring a banana and we would split it half way because you need to eat something when you are running a long run, like a 20-miler.”
Lieberman agreed, adding that he always needs to eat more food when in training mode.
“You’re just burning a lot of fuel,” he said.
Chinese History professor Michael A. Szonyi, who has been on sabbatical leave this past year to write a book about 14th-century Chinese soldiers, said he has run on several continents in preparation for the marathon.
“Basically I coordinate all of my travel with my running,” he said. “Three weeks ago I ran in London, Ontario, and it was -28 degrees centigrade. I was running in ski goggles and ski gloves. Then I got on the plane and went to Singapore, where I ran. It was 34 degrees centigrade.”
Szonyi also said his book is often a topic of conversation when he runs with other people.
“I’ve explained it to a physiotherapist on a three-hour run, to an accountant on a four-hour run,” Szonyi said, laughing. “I think the book will be a better book. I’ve been with a wider audience.”
Terah E. Lyons ’14 pinched a metatarsal nerve while training and has since been swimming, biking, and lifting weights to keep in shape for the marathon. Although she hasn't run distance recently, she said cross training has kept her busy.
“Training for a marathon is a different animal,” Lyons said. “It definitely takes a lot of time.”
‘A FUNDAMENTALLY HUMAN BEHAVIOR’
For some, running is a stress relief from hectic life in the Harvard bubble. For others, it promises the challenge of overcoming physical pain, or the intimacy of a close-knit running community. For those who will participate in Monday’s marathon, that symbolism will not go unrecognized.
Lieberman, who has studied the evolution of running in humans, said running is a “fundamentally human behavior.”
“We’ve been doing this for millions of years,” he said.
Like the ancient humans he studies, Lieberman sometimes trains barefoot, though he said he will not be running the Boston Marathon barefoot. To him, the best part of running marathons is the feeling of achievement he receives after pushing through a grueling 26.2 miles.
“There’s point in every marathon, where it’s about strength and the ability to overcome, because you’re tired and you're hurt and wonder why you're doing this,” he said. “ That’s what’s so incredible about it.”
Mollerus, also an avid rockclimber, became motivated to run during his junior year of high school, after he fell 35 feet during a national rock climbing competition. He shattered two vertebrae, which impeded him from climbing, but he said that didn’t stop him from finding another athletic outlet.
“I just really like movement,” he said. Mollerus added that he hopes to beat his father’s marathon time on Monday. Mollerus found out recently that he will be the youngest runner in this year’s race.
Galison, who attended Harvard as an undergraduate, also said his father was a marathon runner. He said he remembers visiting New York during college to watch his father compete in the New York City Marathon, which partly inspired him to run marathons as well.
“There’s also a kind of peacefulness to it,” he said. “It’s pretty simple. You run.”
He added that running throughout the city while training for the marathon has brought him closer to Boston.
“I like getting to know the city, I like the rhythm of it,” he said.  “There’s something about covering this territory of Boston and Boston suburbs by foot.”
FINISHING WHAT THEY STARTED
“I have a running watch, and it says my longest run ever is 25.9 miles, said Szonyi, referring to the distance he ran last year at the Boston Marathon.“ I want it to say 26.2.” Among the Harvard runners evacuated from the course before completing last year’s marathon, Szonyi is not unique.
Lyons, who ran unregistered as a “bandit” last year, said she was close to the finish line when the bombs exploded, hindering her from finishing the race. This year, she is running with the Harvard College Marathon Challenge as an official racer, and although she is injured, she has her heart set on crossing the finish line.
“For me it's a true exercise in closure,” Lyons said. “I really have felt something’s been missing.”
Galison, who said it was very “disorienting” to be stopped so abruptly before completing the race, said he is excited to finally finish what he started two years ago when training for the 2013 Boston Marathon.
“Like many of the runners, for me [running the marathon] is both personal and also a really reclaiming experience,” said Galison. “It’s such an important symbol of everything in Boston.”
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who ran the marathon last year, echoed this sentiment.
“It really was going to be my last marathon,” he told the Harvard Gazette. “But after the bombing, like so many other people, I thought it was important to send a message by showing up this year.”
Other runners said they anticipate the energy of the crowd will be more prominent than last year.
Wenk, who attended last year’s Patriot’s Day Red Sox game, estimated that there were nearly one million spectators at the 2013 Boston Marathon. This year, she predicts there will be even more.
“Everyone’s out, it’s like the first day of spring, everyone’s really excited,”  Wenk said. “That on top of the One Boston, Boston Strong feeling, I think will just be incredible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Undergraduate Council approved a paid partnership with the Harvard Business School’s new online platform HBX and announced the launch of the Council’s new website at their general meeting Sunday.
HBX will pay the UC to publicize upcoming online courses—including three online courses on business analytics, accounting, and management economics slated to launch next June—and arrange opportunities for HBX representatives to set up information tables in Upperclassmen House dining halls.


“This is a great means of creating another source of revenue for the UC while at the same time providing a service to campus which is something that students universally can take advantage of,” Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, chair of the UC Education committee, said after the meeting.
The contract stipulates that the UC will receive at least $1,500 in compensation for its first year and a minimum of $3,000 for the following year.
Goyal insisted that the HBX contract secured by his committee, while indicative of financial concerns faced by the UC, does not require the Council to approve any other partnerships in the future.
“It’s not just anybody that can come and ask us for publicity in exchange for a fee,” Goyal said, emphasizing the affiliation of HBX and its purported applicability to undergraduates.
The UC also publicized the official launch of its new website, which Student Relations Committee Chair Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 said will be more “interactive,” “useful for students,” and “current.”
The launch comes after months of delays and a goal advanced by UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 to launch the site by the beginning of the Spring term.
 
Nasrollahzadeh attributed the slowed rollout to several problems, including the difficulty of maintaining a web designer and the time required to produce new content for the site.
Still, Nasrollahzadeh praised ways she said the new site will facilitate better interaction between the Council and students by incorporating polls, pictures, and comedic elements.
 
“We are figuring out how to connect in a better and more relevant way to the students,” she said.
 
The UC meeting also featured an update to the Council’s attendance policies. Just this February, the Council revised its bylaws, subjecting representatives who miss three or more meetings to a review, instead of immediate expulsion from the Council.
 
Under the revisions approved Sunday, a member under review will be expelled from the Council if the majority of the Executive Committee votes in favor of such a dismissal. Previously, a two-thirds majority vote was required to mandate an expulsion.
 
The meeting also included Oak Yard Representative Luke R. Heine’s  '17 pitch for his Spring clothing donations drive for Freshmen that he has dubbed the “Take Your Clothes Off” campaign.
 
The Council additionally approved a wave of legislation to allocate money to the various initiatives of the Student Initiatives Committee and the Freshman Class Committee.

UPDATED: April 22, 2014, at 12:16 a.m.
Tianhao He ’15 was awarded a Truman Scholarship last week in recognition of his commitment to public service. He was the only winner from Harvard this year. 
The Truman Scholarship, which describes itself as a “living memorial” to President Harry S. Truman, picks between 55 and 65 candidates out of a pool of roughly 600 candidates. 
Scholarship recipients receive $30,000 to help pay for graduate school, a trip to the Truman Presidential Library in Missouri, and support and guidance for finding a position at a prominent nonprofit or the federal government before they enroll in graduate school.
One of the largest components of the Truman Scholarship is a demonstrated commitment to public service, according to its website. Those who receive the scholarship are recognized as potential “change agents.”
Since arriving at Harvard, He has developed a drive to reform housing policy, he said.
According to He, working for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau helped him develop an interest in urban development and housing. He has focused his efforts on the Bureau’s Eviction Defense Clinic, which runs a free legal services clinic for families in Boston facing eviction. 
“I work with the Harvard Law School students to empower these families with the legal resources so they can assert their rights in court and fight to stay in their homes,” He said. 
He, a sociology concentrator, noted that the Sociology Department has enabled him to undertake research on housing throughout Boston neighborhoods.
“I think if we really want to address the structural roots of the economic inequalities in this country, that starts with transforming our neighborhoods. When you transform neighborhoods, you transform opportunities,” He said.
He said that he first discovered a passion for public service while interning with the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force launched by President Obama during the summer of 2013. 
“It was a fascinating window, learning about how the federal government works in terms of the mechanics of policy and the sensitivities of politics,” He said. “That experience really made me passionate about pursuing a career in public service.”
He will return to Washington this summer to intern at the White House Domestic Policy Council. 
He said that he appreciated the support he received from mentors at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, the Sociology Department, and the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. 
“These mentors have taught me to be critical but not cynical,” He said. “While the challenges facing our country are real and complex, we should not turn away and pretend these problems don't exist. Instead, we should turn towards these problems, get involved, and reimagine how we can solve them.” 
He added that he is certain that he will pursue a career in public service and is eager to look for solutions to the questions that policymakers face.
“The difficulties of these problems don't deter me. Instead they excite me. That's why I am committed to a career in public service, and I am grateful to Harvard for making my path in service possible,” He said.
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: April 21, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the destination of a trip awarded to all Truman scholars. In fact, the scholars travel to the Truman Presidential Library in Missouri with the program. The article also incorrectly stated that the scholarship guarantees recipients a job after graduation. In fact, though it does provide resources and support for finding employment, it does not ensure the recipient a job.

Just months after losing one of its members in a fatal car crash, the Harvard Mock Trial team finished third at American Mock Trial Association Nationals last week, bringing one of the team’s most successful seasons to a close.
Team members decided to compete at nationals with the minimum number of competitors because they had chosen not to replace Angela R. Mathew ’15, who died on Feb. 10 in a car accident while travelling back to Harvard with the team after a tournament.
“It was a difficult year,” Co-Captain Florence Y. Chen ’15 said. “But it has built a lot of confidence and a lot of strength…and that is something we are going to keep with us for a long time.”
Chen was assigned the same role at Nationals that Mathew had held before her death. Both students played journalists, who were witnesses at the trial.
Chen noted that she thought about Mathew while competing and said that it was “inspiring to think of the way [Mathew] performed.”
The 48 teams that reach Nationals are divided up into two divisions where teams compete to produce a finalist that moves to the last round. Since only the winner of each division makes the final round, Harvard’s 10-2 record and second place finish within its division was not enough to secure a place in the finals.
Harvard has never won Mock Trial nationals, but Chen noted that the team always finishes among the top five or ten teams.
Since Harvard has performed particularly well over the past three seasons, it will return next year as the top seed, according to rankings compiled by the program.
The Harvard team also boasts one of the highest retention rates it has ever had.
“It really shows the resilience of the program,” Chen said.
The Harvard team is run entirely by students, although alums occasionally coach members.
The team included co-captains Florence Y. Chen ’15 and J. Zachary Fields ’15, alongside Graham J. Wyatt ’14, Kristina L. Tester ’14, Neil N. Alacha ’16, and Gene Y. Chang ’17.
 
According to Chen, she and Fields often thought of a line from The Lord of the Rings while the team mourned Mathew’s death.
 
“You can’t decide what time is given to you,” Chen said. “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy weekend for Radcliffe crew as both the heavyweights and lightweights faced strong competition on both Saturday and Sunday.
The lightweights competed in two races at home this weekend, the Lightweight Invitational on Saturday and the Muri Cup on Sunday, while the heavyweights traveled to Clemson, S.C. for the Clemson Invitational.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
In a clash of women’s lightweight crew titans on the Charles this  Saturday, the No. 2 Black and White used a strong second half push to  past No. 1 Stanford to win the varsity eight at the Lightweight  Invitational.
The race, which also included No. 4 BU, No. 5 Wisconsin and No. 7 MIT, was the  first real test for the Radcliffe lightweights this spring, and the  Black and White showed it was more than ready for the challenge.  Radcliffe’s seven-second win marks the second straight year the Black  and White varsity eight has taken the Lightweight Invitational Cup.
“Off the start, Stanford was about half a boat length up on us,”  junior Adelaide Backer said. “That can be pretty detrimental if you let  it get to you, but I don’t think I have ever felt so together as a boat  as we did in this race. Everyone was relaxed and calm, and we made a  couple of noticeable moves that I think really psyched [Stanford] out.”
With Radcliffe pulling away from Stanford to win by open water, the  real race in the varsity eight was for third as Wisconsin beat out BU by  less than two seconds.
In the second varsity eight, the Black and White took a lead off of  the start and never looked back, leading wire-to-wire in route to a nine-second margin of victory over Wisconsin. In the third varsity eight, which only  featured boats from Radcliffe and BU, the Black and White just edged out  its local rival by a second for the victory.
The only Radcliffe lightweight loss on the day came in the novice  four, where MIT won by over 12 seconds to take home the only non-last  finish for the Engineers on the day.
Nearly a year ago, the Black and White, ranked at No. 2 against Stanford's No. 1, accomplished the same upset during the Invitational before being just edged out by the Cardinal for the national title.
The Black and White continued Saturday’s success on Sunday against neighboring MIT as it earned a sweep in the battle for the Muri Cup.
The Radcliffe lightweight varsity eight led the way on Sunday, finishing with a time of 6:44.7 for a 24-second win over MIT. The second varsity eight for the Black and White clocked in at 6:56.6 for another triumph over the Engineers.
It was in the varsity four race, however, where the biggest gap in competition could be seen as Radcliffe earned a time of 8:00.5, a full 54 seconds ahead of the MIT varsity four.
The closest race of the day was in the novice four, where the Black and White avenged a loss on Saturday to earn an open water victory over the Engineers and complete the sweep.
“We have great depth on this team right now,” Backer said. “Since I have come to Harvard, I don’t think we have had such a competitive seat-racing season. I think [our depth] has really increased our competitiveness across the board this year and is really promising going forward."
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The two-day Clemson Invitational featured heat racing on Saturday, with the finals held on Sunday. Both days were characterized by 20+ mph gusting crosswinds that made for very challenging race conditions.
The first varsity eight finished third in its heat behind Indiana and Washington State and posted a time of 7:09.4, good for the fifth-fastest time across all heats. On Sunday, Radcliffe followed up Saturday’s result with a fourth-place finish in the final, with a time of 6:57.8, falling to UCLA, Wisconsin, and Indiana.
The second varsity eight was the highlight of the weekend for the Black and White, winning its heat on Saturday and placing second on Sunday after losing to Indiana by five-tenths of a second.
“Moving from [Saturday’s] race into Sunday, we really wanted to improve on our finish,” senior Eliza Flint said. “Yesterday, we let Indiana back into the race near the finish, so we wanted to have a good sprint today and we did. We really walked through and caught up during the sprint.”
The Radcliffe varsity four also had a strong weekend, placing third in its heat on Saturday before dropping almost thirty seconds for a second place finish on Sunday.
“It was crazy conditions out there all weekend,” Flint said. “It was taking boats twenty to thirty minutes just to lock onto the starting blocks. Racing in those conditions is always challenging, but rowing on the Charles has actually prepared us quite well so the crosswinds this weekend were nothing new for us. I think that showed up in the results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field program may have been spread out amongst several meets this weekend, but the energy of the team was high. Records were falling all Friday and Saturday as the team split up and competed in four meets across the country.
Coming off a strong win against Yale, confidence was high for the athletes, and they certainly didn’t slow down. In last weekend’s victory over the Bulldogs, the field athletes dominated, capturing first place in every event. However this weekend, it was the runners who shone for the Crimson.
LSU ALUMNI GOLD
The Harvard record book received a makeover following the meet in Louisiana, as several runners made their way into the top spots in Crimson history.
Sophomore Madison Hansen shone for Harvard as she earned a personal best in the heptathlon event, with first-place scores in the high jump and second in the 800-meter run. With 5152 points, Hansen won the event and moved into the Crimson’s second all-time spot.
“Day one didn’t go as well as I had hoped, so I knew coming into day two I had to work really hard,” Hansen said. “Long jump was the first event of day two, and I jumped a college personal best. The 800 was my last event, and my goal had been to break 2:20 this season, so running a 2:17 was really exciting.”
Though they were unable to break their school record setting mark, the 4x100 relay team of junior Ashley Collinsworth, freshman Jade Miller, sophomore Autumne Franklin, and junior Danielle Barbian finished fifth in the event with a time of 45.94 to take second in Harvard history. The quartet was just 0.1 second slower than its record setting time which it ran earlier this season.
Collinsworth also had a strong performance individually in the 200 meter dash earning the second best time in Crimson history, while Franklin and Miller were impressive in the 400 meter hurdles with Franklin moving into third all time at Harvard.
LARRY ELLIS INVITE
A group of Harvard athletes headed to Ancient Eight foe Princeton to compete in the Larry Ellis Invite against athletes from over 120 schools. Field athletes continued their season dominance in the meet, but on the track, sophomore Paige Kouba was the star.
Kouba claimed the top spot in the Crimson record books in the steeplechase with a time of 10:34.22.
On the men’s side, junior Igor Liokumovich placed second in the shot put and third in the discus with some of his strongest throws of the season. Junior Dean Sullivan finished second in the javelin with a throw of 64 meters.
MT. SAC INVITATIONAL
The Mt. SAC Invitational meet brought several Harvard athletes to the southwest coast to compete, making it the Crimson’s third straight year competing on the Mt. San Antonio College campus.
The distance runners excelled at the meet, posting top times of the season and adding their names to the Harvard record books.
On the women’s side, senior Morgan Kelly added her name to the record books in the five-kilometer event with the top outdoor time in Crimson history. She finished in a time of 16:11.05. This long-standing record had not been broken since Katie Wiley ’85 finished in 16:15.08.
The men were also strong competitors in the 5k, with senior James Leakos moving to second all time with his time of 13:44.57. Sophomore Tom Purnell was just behind him, claiming fifth all time with his time of 13:59.42.
MIT COED INVITE
Just down the river on MIT’s campus, the MIT Coed Invitational was renamed the Sean Collier Invitational to honor the fallen MIT police officer who was killed last spring following the events of the Boston Marathon bombing.
“The big thing for that meet is another opportunity for kids to get a chance to compete,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We’re very committed to this program having all the team members provided opportunities to have competitive experiences. It’s nice to be able to stay local and travel a short distance to get on a fast track to the competition.”
This meet was particularly helpful to some of the younger members of the team to gain meet experience. Freshman Madeline Zimmerman came in second in the triple jump with a distance of 11.38 meters.
As the regular season winds down and the runners prepare for the championship portion of the season, both runners and field athletes will be focusing on fine-tuning their events.
“As a team we will focus on really executing in these last meets before Heps and competing as well as we practice,” Hansen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the Harvard men’s golf team entered the final round of the Princeton Invitational with a 14-stroke lead before watching it nearly slip away. This weekend, however, the Crimson ensured that there would be no such closing-round drama.
After building a 15-stroke lead in the first round of the Yale Invitational, Harvard cruised to its second consecutive victory, shooting a 573 on the day and besting the second-place Bulldogs by 13 strokes.
“We’ve been working on all the right things for a long time, and this was a long time coming,” sophomore Rohan Ramnath said. “You knew it was going to happen. It was just a matter of time.”
Leading the way for the Crimson was captain Theodore Lederhausen, who shot just one-over par in both rounds of the 36-hole tournament. The senior’s score of 142 earned him second place, his best finish as a member of the team to date.
Right behind their captain, junior Akash Mirchandani, sophomore Un Cho, and freshman Robert Deng all shot 144, tying for fifth. Mirchandani led the pack after the first round, shooting a one-under 69, while Deng and Cho shot 70 and 71, respectively. All three of their scores rose in the second round, but only slightly, allowing the Harvard trio to notch a top-five finish.
The performance of the day, however, belonged to Ramnath. Competing as an individual, the sophomore shot one-under for the tournament, topping the leaderboard for the first time in his collegiate career. After shooting five-over in the opening round, Ramnath played some of his best golf in the second, shooting a six-under 64.
“I think that I played really well the whole day,” Ramnath said. “It’s just that in the morning, I couldn’t really make putts…. It was a little bit frustrating, but I stuck with it, and in the second round they, just started falling.”
The win for Ramnath marks the second consecutive week that a Crimson golfer has claimed the individual crown. Mirchandani earned that title last weekend, shooting eight-under par at the Princeton Invitational. With the win, the junior ended a three-year drought in which no Harvard golfer took home an individual championship.
Also competing as individuals, senior Seiji Liu and freshman Kendrick Vinar joined many of their teammates the top 15. In his first action of the spring, Liu was the sixth Crimson golfer to finish in the top eight, finishing with a three-over 73 in both rounds. Vinar was just as consistent, shooting a 74 in both rounds, good for 13th place.
“[Having six guys in the top eight] is a crazy result, and that kind of thing will rarely, rarely happen, but I just give credit to the guys,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s not like [this result] is going to happen all the time, but I’m not overly surprised [since] their internal competition is so high.”
The result did not come as much of a surprise after the Crimson jumped out to a substantial lead over the 11-team field in the morning, continuing the team’s season-long success in the opening rounds. In fact, Harvard has now recorded its best score in the first round in all but one of the six tournaments that the team has competed in this season.
“We’ve been getting off to very good starts, which is very convenient,” Rhoads said. “We talk so often about our process—our controllable things—and the whole goal is to keep doing those things to the best of our abilities. Then, the results really will take care of themselves.”
The Crimson has now finished in the top five in six of its seven competitions on the season. In addition, this year marks the first time that Harvard has earned two team victories in a season since the 2008-2009 campaign.
Besides the Crimson and the Bulldogs, only Hartford and Dartmouth managed to post sub-300 rounds at the Invitational. The two sides finished third and fourth, shooting 595 and 610, respectively.
Rounding out the Ancient Eight squads in its last tune-up prior to the Ivy Championships was Brown, which finished sixth with a stroke total of 617. According to Romnath, Harvard is happy to enter the championship weekend with momentum over its conference opponents, but the team is not taking anything for granted.
“Everyone’s just taking it one day at a time,” Romnath said. “It’s easy to get complacent, overconfident, or cocky, but I think we’ve been working towards this for so long that we know everything we need to do from here on is just [whatever] gives ourselves the best chance to win.”

Throughout The Crimson’s illustrious history, the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper has printed multiple important opinion pieces. Headlines range from “Five O’Clock Somewhere,” to “Respecting the Basic Humanity of Asian Tourists,” reflecting the serious nature of the op-eds. 
However, there have also been a few, shall we say, less sensitive choices—for example, take last week’s op-ed, questionably titled "Internship or Internment."

1) Corporation Approves New Policy for Searches of Electronic Communications: Under the new policy, electronic searches must be authorized by the relevant dean or the dean’s designee. The policy also states that all searches must be recorded and that a committee chaired by Law School professor John C. P. Goldberg will conduct periodic reviews of recorded searches. While the University must notify the target of a search in most situations, it is not required to do so if notification might compromise the effectiveness of the search.
2) ‘Shark Tank’ Casting Team Searches for Harvard Entrepreneurs: “In search of budding entrepreneurs, the casting team for ABC’s Emmy-nominated reality television show “Shark Tank” visited Harvard’s Innovation Lab on Friday.” “Students from across the University came to the lab to pitch their products, which ranged from sanitizing products to cellphone apps.”

As he drank water from the fountain he thought of the girl at the front desk. She was young and strong and wore a red “Hemenway Gymnasium” shirt. He smiled at her when she swiped his I.D. card, but they never spoke.
“Come on, David. Stop day dreaming.”
It was his friend Michael. They were both freshmen. They met at IMs and decided to go to work out together. They did it mostly for cosmetic reasons.
“You’re thinking about that girl, aren’t you, buddy?”
“Let’s finish up our bicep-tricep super set burnout,” David said, avoiding the question.
After they finished they left, walking past the girl. David avoided looking at her. He could imagine one thousand ways the interaction could go wrong.
“Have a creatine mass-builder shake with me,” Michael said, “It will make you strong.” After pausing for a minute he went on, “There is only one thing, David: courage. Courage and grace under pressure. You must have that when you pump up and when you approach that girl. Another drink.”
They each filled up another glass of mass-builder. They were both bloated from all the chemicals as they separated and went to class.

 Harvard dining halls are on the verge of a revolution.* Next year, you might be able to waltz into one of our fine 12 House dining halls to enjoy some swai alongside a nice glass of California wine.
That’s right, the Harvard Management Company—the investment branch of Harvard’s enormous endowment—has been busy "quietly" purchasing $61 million worth of vineyards in Southern California. They cite the wine market’s “cyclical upswing,” but we know better. This is the first step of a grand scheme to turn our dining halls into nightclubs. Flyby endorses.
