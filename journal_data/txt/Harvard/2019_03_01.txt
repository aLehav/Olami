Leading up to Ghungroo 2019, parts of Agassiz Theatre transformed temporarily into a vibrant art space, reflecting months of preparation by the South Asian Association and the production’s student artists, actors, dancers, and musicians. Paint-splattered cloth and intricate pieces of the hand-made set, ranging from paintings of flowers to wooden sculptures of trains, covered the floor. Laughter and the smell of pizza floated across the space. The work culminates in a performance run starting Feb. 28, and this year’s producers aim to create better representations of diversity within South Asia than they have seen in previous years of Ghungroo.
Raahul A. Acharya ’20, SAA Co-President and Ghungroo Co-Producer, recounted the original intentions of the annual production, which a group of friends started in the ‘80s. “They were having one of those late night sessions in the Kong and were like, ‘We should make an organization or some kind of production that actually mirrors the South Asian culture here on campus,’” Acharya said.
This year, the producers are working to expand that vision. Rameen Rana ’20, Acharya’s Co-President and Co-Producer, reflected on changes to Ghungroo’s plot structure and set for 2019. While previous editions of Ghungroo have featured a single skit plotline with a fixed set of characters, this year’s Ghungroo is made up of around 30 short skits that take the audience through places such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, highlighting the different languages and traditions from all across South Asia.
“This is the South Asian Association, which encompasses so many different cultures and so many backgrounds,” Rana said. “That's something that we're really trying to stress with our set, which is this beautiful transfer that takes you through a journey throughout South Asia. We really want to show that it’s not an Indocentric show.”
Arjun J. Prasad ’22, SAA frosh representative and Ghungroo dancer, actor and treasurer, shared one example of the tradition and culture that the production highlights. The dance in which he performs brings together approaches from multiple eras.
“It’s a mix between traditional and more modern dance. The traditional parts of the dance are called Dandiya, which is when you dance with sticks,” Prasad said, referring to a traditional Indian dance which is used to commemorate the goddess Durga’s fight against the buffalo demon, Mahishasura. “The more modern part includes more modern songs and and dance moves.”
Acharya describes Ghungroo as “ecstatic,” “creative,” and “familial.”
“It brings everyone together and it just makes a really close family out of people that I haven't met or even known before,” Acharya said.
Some moments are characterized by playful competitiveness among Ghungroo members. “My proudest moment in dancing, personally, is when I was told by the choreographers that I have the best body roll out there,” Acharya said, laughing. “I hit that body roll well.”
Rana was captivated by Ghungroo before even coming to Harvard. She was enticed to join the production right away as an SAA freshman representative, as well as an actor and dancer.
“Ever since I remember coming to Visitas as a pre-frosh, I was like, ‘I need to do Ghungroo,’” Rana said. “This is one of those things that I know I'm going to tell my kids about and just be so proud of.”
Ghungroo runs Feb. 28, March 1, and March 2 at 7 p.m., as well as March 2 at 12 p.m., in the Agassiz Theatre on 5 James Street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago last week, we forcefully condemned Harvard College Faith and Action’s decision to host a controversial speaker who identified as “ex-gay” and urged queer Christians to deny their sexuality in the service of God at one of its Friday night “Doxa” forums. Just a week later, HCFA was found to have pressured one of its student leaders to resign in September 2017 after details of her same-sex relationship had emerged.
In response to that decision, the Office of Student Life, now restructured as the Dean of Students Office, placed HCFA on “administrative probation” — a term whose meaning the administration had repeatedly refused to clarify. When HCFA was placed on probation, the administration said that HCFA would need to sever ties with its parent organization — Christian Union — in order to regain recognized status from the College.
But this requirement — and other typical probationary requirements like the inability of organizations to use University spaces — have dismayingly not been enforced by the University. Despite the administration’s inability or unwillingness to define standards for probation or hold HCFA accountable for them, Associate Dean for Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller nonetheless wrote in an email that the probationary period is “scheduled to conclude next month.”
We hope the Harvard community, especially the transitioning DSO, still remembers — and takes seriously — HCFA’s deeply problematic behavior of last year. The inability of the College to enforce the punishments leveled against HCFA is not just disappointing, but more broadly indicative of Harvard’s failure to hold fast to some of its punitive efforts — including sanctions against the final clubs. We hope that new DSO reinvigorates efforts to bring actual, meaningful sanctions against HCFA, to clarify the terms of and subsequently enforce the organization's probation, and to ensure that it severs contact with Christian Union.
In private comments, former Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis expressed concern about punishing HCFA, fearing that Harvard could be seen as attacking Christianity. We are sympathetic to these concerns, particularly in the modern political context, and recognize how crucial it is that Harvard not alienate people of faith. However, we believe that failure to clarify the University’s position and bring HCFA’s status into accordance with stated University procedure represents a lack of consistency on the part of the administration.
Student groups of all kinds deserve and receive support from the University to facilitate their operations. These groups are often united on the basis of shared interest, such as faith in the case of HCFA. But the University cannot privilege one kind of unifying interest — even one as central to the lives of its adherents as religion — over others in administering consequences for policy violations. To that end, the administration must reconsider its approach to dealing with HCFA as the organization moves towards coming off its “administrative probation.” The College must clarify its policies to the community at large and put them into practice equally for all student organizations — including HCFA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week marks the one-year anniversary since the Chronicle of Higher Education revealed that Harvard University Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez sexually harassed at least 18 students and colleagues over the course of nearly four decades. That’s longer than we have been alive.
The first reported incident occurred in 1979, and the University’s own investigation determined that Dominguez committed “serious misconduct” as early as 1983. Nevertheless, Dominguez was kept on University payroll without significant consequences. In fact, he was rewarded. Not only did the University promote him to Vice Provost and other powerful gatekeeping roles, but he was even assigned to teach a freshman seminar in fall 2017. Through these decisions, Harvard knowingly and at best carelessly put hundreds of students and colleagues at personal and professional risk over and over again. After being finally shamed to act by community concern in response to the media reports, Harvard announced that it was considering a neutral, external investigation. But a year later — despite repeated inquiries from students in the Government Department, where Dominguez taught — we haven’t heard a single update on the promised external investigation since. No wonder nearly half of Harvard graduate women (and more than half of female undergraduates) don’t trust that the system will take sexual misconduct seriously if they come forward.
When will the University protect its student workers the way it protects its reputation? That is, when will we have real redress to protect us from the pervasive harassment, abuse, and discrimination that happens here at Harvard? It is clearer now than ever before that we cannot simply trust the University’s own internal processes to eradicate harassment on campus — especially as the federal government turns a blind eye to schools that sweep sexual harassment under the rug. It was only after last year’s media reports and subsequent public outrage that the University gave Dominguez a gentleman’s exit from teaching by allowing him to retire. The Law School afforded Brett M. Kavanaugh the same courtesy, without opening any known investigation into the allegations against him. All the while, new allegations against faculty members such as Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. and others Harvard has kept below the radar continue to mount.
Harvard’s processes are supposed to protect students’ and employees’ civil rights, but instead, the University has used the process to protect itself. It comes then as no surprise that the University has not heeded Government graduate and undergraduate students’ call for an external review. The University repeatedly asks students and workers to trust that the administration does right by us, even though the University has so flagrantly and chronically failed to protect its students and workers.
This is why it’s so critically important that student workers are bargaining for strong protections against discrimination and harassment in our first union contract. Specifically, we are bargaining for a voluntary, neutral grievance procedure, which means that if we as student workers have our rights violated — for example, if we experience wage theft, unsafe working conditions, or harassment — we can choose to take our claim to a neutral, third-party arbitrator with no conflict of interest. Thus, student workers who have experienced discrimination or harassment would have the option of seeking help through the grievance procedure, the University’s internal offices, or both, based on their individual needs and goals. This is especially important for students who experience discrimination based on their race or disability status, who cannot use the Title IX process available for gender-based claims.
Third-party grievance procedures are standard parts of a union contract, and they help insulate student workers like us from arbitrary or biased decisions by our employers about pay, discipline, and remedying discrimination at work. But in contract negotiations with our Harvard Graduate Students Union-UAW, the University administration is insisting that harassment and discrimination based on race, gender, disability or other protected categories should be carved out of the protections in the contract. Students would be able to use a fair, neutral grievance procedure for all other workplace contract violations — but people of color, women, BGLTQ people, immigrants, and disabled students who are discriminated against would have to rely on the University's internal "dispute resolution" processes. Under the University’s internal processes, we believe a Harvard administrator always has the final say — and Harvard protects itself, not students or workers.
Harvard has fought our student union every step of the way, from illegally excluding over 500 student workers from the voter rolls in our first election, to using our tuition money to hire expensive union-busting law firms, to blasting our mailboxes with anti-union emails and mailings. Now the University is dragging its feet on bargaining and fighting to deny us a fair, neutral grievance procedure for harassment and discrimination. Under no circumstances should student workers agree to a contract in which we cannot vindicate our rights not to be harassed or discriminated against at work.
The last we heard, Dominguez retained his faculty emeritus privileges, and the internal “investigation” into the allegations against him has no clear end date. We’re not willing to wait any longer. Every day our union doesn’t have a contract with a fair and neutral grievance procedure is another day we don’t have adequate protections against harassment and discrimination.
Harvard, time’s up.

If you took Social Studies 10: Introduction to Social Theory, you, like me, may have been told that Durkheim’s use of “primitive” was simply an “objective” descriptor of aboriginal religion. You may have questioned Jefferson’s slavery, only to be told that although these failings were regrettable, they should not “impede” scholarly engagement.
Such qualms were likely deemed tragic yet forgone facts, immaterial to theoretical production. Western modernity’s underside was presumably extraneous to Tocqueville and Locke, germane only for Fanon or Chakrabarty. Questions of global significance were probably dismissed in favor of the West’s grand narrative of self-constitution, its great myth that its so-called progress was the product of truth-discerning rationality rather than historically-specific (and undeniably limited) approaches to the world.
In truth, these dismissals belie complicated realities: Kant’s racial hierarchies would guide race science — and fuel Euro-American capitalism — for centuries. Locke emphasized the extent of his religious tolerance by including even “Mahometans.” Tocqueville, meanwhile, championed brutal French colonization of Algeria. Rather than seeing these truths as they are — consequence and concomitant of theory — we push them aside, failing to acknowledge the assumptions and limitations of our own intellectual tradition.
I am not alone in this argument: Scholars from Said to Mbembe have discussed how depiction and domination of others was definitional for the modern West. The history of the Western intellectual tradition, then, is not only history within Euro-American borders — it’s also history outside them. Just as we read domestic politics as theoretical backdrop, the West’s systematic otherizing must also be read as intertwined with theoretical production.
This is not to argue that we discard our tradition, nor to indict it wholesale. But it is to say that Western self-definition has never been solitary, never separable from centuries of global south exploitation casually dismissed in our classrooms. Only by recognizing these linkages as fundamental can we understand the Western tradition as it is — limited and historically-mediated — and appreciate it as only one of many ways of interpreting the world. Only then can we destabilize our claims to universality, weaken the theoretical and political monopoly we self-impose on a world repeatedly signaling its insufficiency.
But we continually fail to do so at Harvard and beyond, instead divorcing social theory from impetus and impact. Moten and Harvey describe this failure as “negligence” endemic to academic professionalization in the modern university. In becoming modern scholars, they argue, we are trained into “negligence that disavows the possibility of a thought of an outside.” We accept our bounded fields, our limited language, and it alienates us, destroys the sociality essential to transformative work. Rather than theorizing “a movement against the possibility of a country,” for example, we find ourselves theorizing “just a people’s history of the same country.” Put simply, we run in different directions within a given circle, but our negligence keeps the circle itself intact — presuppositions, limits, and all.
In attempts to diversify and “decolonize,” Social Studies — like academia broadly— has failed to leave this circle, or even identify its existence. Responding to complaints about Western-centrism, we parade faculty of color, critical or not, as excuses to avoid instituting programs that reveal the circle’s existence. To really try, we add theorists of color to syllabi and sit back, as though slavery is Jacobs’ story and not Jefferson’s, or as if Muslim women’s agential rationality in Mahmood isn’t tied to a Weberian capitalism rational precisely in its opposition to the Orient. But just as it has failed in the White House and on Wall Street, this politics of representation will not solve our inability to understand global south histories as fundamental rather than contingent to the Western tradition. It will not allow us to escape our circles of negligence, to disrupt our presuppositions and find courage to build anew.
Recognizing this, some have argued for deeper engagement with non-Western traditions in hopes that comparison may unveil our own negligences. They are certainly not wrong; in my own work, engagement across traditions has been incomparably generative. But the truth is that if we hope to learn from others, we must first cultivate an understanding of our own limits. Otherwise, we risk sampling writers from non-Western traditions as nothing more than interesting but antiquated curios (or, as this year’s SS10a lecturer said of Douglass, as a “break” from theory).
If we want to create generative, transgressive scholarship that pushes the bounds of the possible and breaks us out of theoretical and political quagmires — scholarship worthy of the universities we want to inhabit — we must identify our negligences and challenge them. And we must do so not only as academic endeavor but also as expression of our “concern for sociality,” as recognition of interlinked histories and responsibilities we collectively bear. Jefferson is not disconnected from slavery, nor is Hegel from African colonization. Algeria continues to suffer from Tocqueville’s imperatives, just as the Muslim world does from Lockean characterizations. Our world is dying of catastrophes we ourselves have sown, and our self-satisfied asociality — from classroom to public square — can no longer sustain us.
To recognize this, to recognize limitations and consequences of our modes of thought and to consider what it may mean to learn from those of others — this must be our scholarly project. To do otherwise is at best deluded and at worst complicit, and, regardless, produces irresponsible scholarship that fails to give us insight into our past and our present while also keeping us from our possible futures.

Former Harvard School of Public Health security guard Joseph G. Bartuah — who alleged last week that Securitas, his employer, started a retaliatory investigation into him after he reported a supervisor’s behavior — received a letter of termination from Securitas Wednesday.
The letter, signed by Alonzo B. Herring, an area manager for Securitas North America, states that Bartuah engaged in “serious misconduct” while on duty at the Shattuck International House, a residential building at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. It further states that the School of Public Health requested Bartauh's removal.
“The Senior Client of the Harvard Chan School requested your immediate removal from the International House,” Herring wrote in the letter, which was provided by Bartuah. “You were reported to frequently abandon the designated Security post located within the ground floor lobby.”
Bartuah said his union, 32BJ Service Employees International Union, has filed a grievance on his behalf.
The letter claims that Bartuah’s behavior violated several company policies, including leaving his post without “proper relief,” falsifying company records, and engaging in “carelessness or negligence in the performance of an assigned duty,” as well as other violations.
Bartuah said the termination was “expected,” but he did not think it was warranted.
“The only charge I would agree with is that I was leaving my post without proper relief,” Bartuah said, but added that this is a “common practice for overnight workers.”
He alleged last week that managers opened the investigation into him leaving his desk only because he sent an email to his supervisors Feb. 5 stating that one of them made “unprofessional” remarks that damaged Bartuah’s reputation among his colleagues.
Three days later, on Feb. 8, Bartuah received a call from Herring telling him not to come to work. The formal termination letter arrived Wednesday.
The letter stated that Bartuah’s firing was a “Client Requested Removal,” in reference to Harvard, which contracts Securitas.
Bartuah, however, said that based on the “experience of co-workers that have gone through this,” he believes Securitas was behind the termination.
“Securitas will always say that the client requested that we should remove you and almost always there's no evidence of whether the client actually requested that,” Bartuah said.
Bartuah alleged that Securitas took advantage of a provision in the contract that allows the client to request employees’ removal without cause.
“In our union contract once the client says that you should be removed, you are to be removed,” Bartuah said. “They always stand by that to justify their decisions, so I kind of expected that the reason will go that way.”
Securitas’ Boston office did not respond to a request for comment.
“It is inappropriate for Securitas to comment on specific employment related matters and matters possibly to be addressed in the grievance process,” Herring, the Securitas area manager, wrote in an email.
The University declined to comment on whether it requested the removal.
“As a matter of practice, the School does not comment on personnel matters,” School of Public Health spokesperson Todd Datz wrote in an emailed statement.
As part of union grievance procedures, Bartuah and 32BJ SEIU representatives will meet with a Securitas human resources manager, according to Bartuah.
“Grievance arbitration procedures provide for certain preliminary intermediate steps where the parties, usually the union, will sit down with employer representatives,” William B. Gould IV, former Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, said in an interview. “They will try to resolve the matter themselves in some way. And if they're unable to resolve it, then and only then, would the matter be referred to arbitration.”
Unions usually have the discretion to invoke arbitration processes. The case’s merit and whether they could prevail before an arbitrator are the primary factors when unions decide whether to bring a grievance to an arbitration process, according to Gould.
32BJ SEIU spokesperson Amanda Torres Price referred to a previous statement about the case, and declined to comment on Bartuah’s individual case.
“We take allegations of unjust termination seriously and follow a strict protocol to process any grievance accordingly,” she wrote when Bartuah was first being investigated.

Hedge-fund manager David E. Goel ’93 and Stacey L. Goel donated $100 million to Harvard for an arts research and performance space in Allston, the University announced Thursday.
The gift begins Harvard’s fundraising initiative to build a new “state of the art” center and provide a “future home” for the American Repertory Theatre, which currently operates out of Loeb Drama Center, according to a press release about the donation.
“There is something almost metaphorically perfect about the architectural license to build a center for the arts at the nucleus of Harvard’s expanding campus,” David Goel said in the press release.
Goel said he hopes the center will become “a physical representation of the idea that each set of academic disciplines is strengthened by proximity, dialogue, and contribution to the same tapestry of human understanding.”
A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus ’88 said in the press release that the gift will allow the the group to take more creative risks.
“We are excited by the transformative possibilities that come with the Goels’ astoundingly generous gift,” she said. “It will allow us to envision a sustainably designed center that encourages creative risk-taking in open, democratic spaces that will feel welcoming and porous to the city.
The gift follows a precarious situtaion at the A.R.T. two years ago: in 2017, the Department of Education found that the A.R.T. Institute — which offered two-year graduate programs in acting, dramaturgy, and voice pedagogy — was saddling students with high levels of debt, leading to an admissions freeze. Later that year, the A.R.T. decided to shutter its Institute program for three years to “work on a strategic plan,” according to an email to affiliates at the time.
The Goels’ gift is intended to honor David Goel’s parents, according to the release. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the gift will draw more support for projects concerning the arts at Harvard.
“David and Stacey have given us a gift that will undoubtedly inspire support for one of our most exciting projects to advance the arts at Harvard,” Bacow said in the press release. “The new space we envision will be a magnet for artists and audiences, as well as students, faculty, and staff.
David Goel is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Goels endowed the Goel Center for Theater and Dance at Phillips Exeter Academy which opened its doors in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students and professors have become more aware of the irregular sleep habits of Harvard undergraduates in recent years, some groups have taken initiative to better educate College students on the benefits of proper sleep.
Programs like the Sleep 101 training module — which was made mandatory for the Class of 2022 — and the Sleep Matters Initiative are sparking conversations about these issues and shedding light on why researchers believe sleep should be prioritized on college campuses.
Although Sleep 101 made its Harvard debut last semester, its development began around ten years ago with a presentation to undergraduates on the health benefits of sleep, according to Charles A. Czeisler ’74, Director of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Czeisler said after the talk that he was approached by students who were upset that this had been their first comprehensive lesson on how sleep impacts educational performance.
“They said to me, how can we have the largest division of sleep medicine in the world here, over 100 faculty, and nobody tells us that sleep is important to our education,” Czeisler said. “And I said, ‘Well that's a fair point, so maybe we should do something.’”
Czeisler set out to create a program for Harvard students that eventually evolved into Sleep 101. After some initial setbacks, a combination of sufficient funding and student advocacy aided its approval by the Undergraduate Council within the past year.
Raymond J. So ’21 — who became concerned about students’ sleep patterns after taking Czeisler’s freshman seminar on sleep deficiency — spearheaded the student advocacy efforts for the module.
“After the seminar had concluded, I sent an email to the Undergraduate Council, proposing that the church bells ring later in the morning,” So wrote in an emailed statement. “For obvious reasons, such a proposal was rejected.”
“I still wanted to create some policy-based change regarding sleep at the College, and thus, I tempered down my proposal into a sleep education initiative, one component of which was to implement Sleep 101 at the College,” So added.
Pallas S. Ziporyn ’10, the project manager for Sleep 101 who oversaw the team that developed the module, said her Harvard experience was a “creative driver” for the training program.
“I still felt that there was somewhat of a toxic sleep culture at Harvard,” Ziporyn said. “I think it was my [Peer Advising Fellow] who said people say that there are three S’s — sleep, social life and studying — and you can only have two; you can't have all three.”
Ziporyn added that, during her time as an undergraduate, a competitive mindset surrounding sleep deficiency ultimately lead to adverse effects on her own health.
“We would be envious of people who could sleep just five or six hours,” she said. “At one point I went through a long stretch of forcing my body to sleep five or six hours a night because I knew that's what some of my friends were doing and for me personally I had really bad results — I ended up at UHS.”
In addition to the educational benefits, Ziporyn said she believes the module lets students know that the College administrators care about their sleep.
“I thought that my professors did not want me to sleep, that I would be showing that I was a good student by not sleeping,” she said. “And I think having someone just say, ‘We want you to sleep, it’s good for you to sleep, life will be better for you if you sleep,’ has a lot of value.”
Ziporyn is also responsible for managing the program’s partnerships with other institutions. The module was piloted at over a dozen schools including Lehigh University, Loyola University of Maryland, and the University of St. Thomas, according to Ziporyn.
In conjunction with the Sleep 101 module, the student-led group Sleep Matters Initiative has played an active role in raising awareness about sleep and emphasizing the importance of sleep health on campus.
“The Sleep Matters Initiative is a collaboration between some undergraduate students at the College and Brigham sleep team,” said Mark E. Czeisler ’19, a leader of the organization and Charles Czeisler's son.
The initiative took off in spring of 2016 after a group of students recognized the problem of undergraduate sleep deficiency and inconsistency.
“It all started a few years back when some of us just kind of stepped back and looked and we hear all the stories about the all-nighters in Lamont,” Sean F. Gibney ’19, another leader in the Sleep Matters Initiative, said. “Personal experience made us all realize that there was a problem that we could maybe try to address.”
One of the Sleep Matters Initiative's main projects is conducting a research study on undergraduate sleep routines. Data collection took place last year with students in Quincy House and Adams House.
When first approached about the idea, Faculty Dean of Quincy House Deborah J. Gehrke said there was hesitation to approving the study “because it’s a little labor intensive” on the part of the participants. Despite initial reservations toward the proposal, it was ultimately approved about two years ago.
The randomized, voluntary study began with a basic background questionnaire for students that intended to participate. Then, students were asked to fill out a daily journal logging information about the quality and quantity of their sleep that night.
In addition to filling out the number of hours of sleep, students were asked if things prevented them from going to sleep on time and about different factors that impacted people's environement and allowed them to get sleep or to not get sleep,” Gibney said.
The study also provided incentives such as Amazon gift cards to keep up consistent engagement with the daily sleep logs.
To evaluate the effects of sleep education, students of one house received informational materials in concurrence with the daily journal, whereas the second house did not receive any supplemental materials.
The study's goal centered around creating awareness for sleep health and collecting data on undergraduate sleep.
“It can be difficult to prioritize sleep,” Mark Czeisler said. “Another goal is definitely to educate students and give them a sense of little tools or tips that can help them maximize sleep time in this environment.
Over the duration of the study, 391 students participated in the study with 7,390 days of diary data collected, he wrote in an email. The study took place throughout the 2018 spring semester.
The sleep study was intended to evaluate several factors, including sleep time preferences, sleep habits as linked to graduating class, and consistency of sleep among students.
After the conclusion of the study, many students cited positive feelings about the study, according to Gibney. Participants also received a personalized data report that compared a summary of their data to the rest of the participants in the study. Gibney said many of the students “appreciated” having that data.
Faculty Deans of Quincy also agreed with the positive outcomes of the sleep study.
“The students rose to the occasion and they filled out the journal so it was great,” Gehrke said.
The sleep study also caused a change in attitudes toward sleep, Quincy's other Faculty Dean, Lee Gehrke, added.
“It’s just raised awareness and made it easier for conversations about the importance of sleep to happen,” Lee Gehrke said. “People realize that it’s an important issue to be aware of.”
The analysis of the study results is still ongoing, but researchers have already noted that students’ sleep needs did not align with their actual sleep patterns, Gibney said.
The study's complete findings will be presented in June at the 33rd annual meeting of the Sleep Research Society, “SLEEP 2019.” Two posters will be showcased at the conference with one focusing on sleep habits of undergraduates and the other highlighting research strategies for future long-term projects, according to Mark Czeisler.

In her first year and a half as Director of Corporate Partnerships at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Ellie G. Carlough has implemented a number of measures with fellow administrators to strengthen SEAS’s connections with the private sector.
In a February interview, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said these efforts to create corporate partnerships continues to be one of his top priorities. He said Harvard has historically lagged behind its peer institutions in these efforts and stressed the numerous benefits these industry relationships could bring.
“It’s not just to get funding for the faculty,” Doyle said. “There are great academic reasons to bring experience to the classroom, to bring case studies to the classroom, to inspire both faculty and students.”
Carlough, who joined the SEAS staff as part of Doyle’s effort to implement better mechanisms for interacting with the private sector, said much of her first year’s work has been focused on building pathways for direct engagement between students and industry, and providing a clear contact point for companies looking to partner with SEAS.
Together with Keith R. Karasek, the Director of Experiential and Career Development at SEAS, Carlough said she has been working to make recruiting efforts at SEAS more robust and accessible to students. These efforts are meant to supplement, rather than replace, existing job and internship opportunities offered by the University's Office of Career Services through centralized resources such as Crimson Careers.
“We are working on developing an online corporate catalog so that students can see what companies are coming to SEAS looking for internships or jobs, looking for students,” Carlough said.
“I think there is great value in students working with industry and interacting with industry on a variety of levels, particularly for those students who want to go to industry jobs after they graduate,” she added.
Carlough said she is also looking into ways industry partners can potentially sponsor students’ final projects in courses like Engineering Sciences 100: “Engineering Design Projects.”
“It seems like a place where we can integrate industry partners who have projects that would be interesting to students and can mentor them,” she said. “We want to make sure the student is supported and is able to excel in the course.”
Last March, Carlough and Applied Math Professor Lakshminarayanan “L.” Mahadevan launched the inaugural Dean’s Industry Lecture — a series of talks that brings industry leaders to SEAS to educate students about issues at the intersection of science, society, and technology.
Previous lecturers have included Henri Seydoux, the founder and CEO of civil drone company Parrot, and John C.C. Fan, the president and CEO of Kopin Corporation, which specializes in wearable virtual and artificial reality devices.
Carlough said that part of her role is to serve as a point of contact with companies interested in working with SEAS students and faculty.
“This is the first time, recently, that there’s been a staff position to act as a connecting point, so what I’ve been doing is meeting with companies who are coming to SEAS to partner,” Carlough said.
Industry partnerships also provide an opportunity to connect with students in the classroom, Doyle said. When discussing ways to increase faculty numbers, he pointed toward industry as a potential source of lecturers. Currently, guest lecturers from corporations are brought into classes through faculty connections, but in the future, those hired from industry would hold positions similar to Professors of the Practice, who are non-tenured faculty at Harvard.
“We need to do quality control and make sure these are reasonable people who understand our pedagogy, understand our culture of working with students on the campus,” Doyle said. “It’s a great opportunity to bring in world experience.”

Undergraduate students make up more than 80 percent of the patients seen in Harvard University Health Services' Urgent Care, Harvard University Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi said in an interview last week.
In its current model, HUHS treats undergraduates primarily through its Primary Care and Urgent Care services. Students seeking to use Primary Care must schedule an appointment in advance, but Urgent Care sees students without appointments 24/7. Though undergraduates make up approximately 32.8 percent of total students enrolled at Harvard — 6,766 out of 20,604 — an overwhelming majority of the patients treated at Urgent Care are College students, according to Francesconi and HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira.
Both Barreira and Francesconi said potential reasons for the statistic include confusion over the assignment of Primary Care providers and busy schedules preventing students from making formal appointments.
“For the people who actually do try to use Primary Care, Primary Care may not have the availability that you can get when you get seen in Urgent Care,” Francesconi said. “You can walk into Urgent Care and somebody will see you, right? Where if you try to use Primary Care, it's most often appointment based, and they'll say, ‘Well we don't have an appointment today, but we might have one tomorrow,’ and sometimes that doesn't work with schedules.”
Barreira and Francesconi said HUHS is seeking direct feedback from students, which could help HUHS improve its services. HUHS is also looking into telehealth and other online chat formats to increase accessibility. Barreira added that a patient advisory council currently aids him in handling “general UHS stuff.”
Though all students have the opportunity to connect with an HUHS Primary Care provider prior to arriving on campus in the fall of their first year, only a small percentage of freshmen reach out beforehand, according to Barreira.
“About 10 percent of people contact us ahead of time because they have existing medical conditions and they want to be connected to us so it's sort of various autoimmune diseases, and asthma, and diabetes, and stuff like that,” Barreira said.
Despite his concerns, Barreira said he recognizes that some issues concerning the College student body must be addressed by Urgent Care.
“It's kind of hard to see a primary care doctor and say, ‘You're gonna throw up in a week, so let's do something about it,’” Barriera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of students gathered on wooden chairs and sofas for an open mic night focused on issues of immigration and blackness at the Signet Society Thursday evening.
The event, titled “Issa Open Mic Night,” was organized in the wake of rapper 21 Savage’s United States Immigration Customs Enforcement detainment, the impending revocation of Temporary Protected Status for Haitian immigrants, and the conclusion of Black History Month.
The event’s sponsors — Act on a Dream, a student immigration advocacy group; the Black Students Association; Harvard African Students Association; the Harvard Caribbean Club, the Signet Society; KeyChange, an a capella group that performs songs by black artists; and the Institute of Politics — sought to create a space for intersectional dialogue about migration, blackness, and policing.
“I hope people come to this event and learn that immigration is more than just a Latinx issue, it’s an issue that transcends races,” Diego Navarrete ’21, co-director of Act on a Dream and a Crimson Editorial board member, said in an interview before the event. “It crosses a lot of different communities.”
HCC Vice President Char Deslandes ’21, who is an international student from the United Kingdom, discussed the importance of the event in recognizing the “incredibly terrifying” experience of being a black immigrant in the United States.
“You’re constantly on edge especially as a black person, if I’m being real. I never know will a police officer stop me, will I have a terrible interaction that escalates and causes me to not be able to stay at school?” Delandes said.
Act on a Dream’s Intersectionality Co-Chairs Leo A. Garcia ’21 and Farah M. Afify ’22 emceed the open mic night.
“We care about black immigrant narratives,” Afify said when introducing the event with Garcia. “They matter, and they’re something that must be discussed.”
More than a dozen students performed at the open mic evening. Acts included songs, original poems, and recitations from a Facebook post and Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, “Long Walk to Freedom.”
Lauren A. Tucker ’22 performed an original spoken word poem entitled “Black History, My History,” which she called a product of personal “frustration and reflection.” Tucker said she attended the event because of her desire to remind audience members of black history.
“Black history cannot just be confined in pages 248 to 256 in your American history textbook. Today is black history,” she recited in her poem. “We are black history.”
Tucker said in an interview after her performance that she appreciated the welcoming space that “Issa Open Mic Night” provided for personal creative expression.
“It’s a beautiful audience, a diverse audience,” Tucker said. “It was really nice, just with the vibe and people who are sharing vulnerable pieces.”
In between student performances, students enjoyed drinks and food while mingling with each other. During intermissions, students who wanted to perform next notified Garcia and Afify, who then introduced them to the room.
Ilham A. T. Ali ’21 also performed at the event, sharing both a poem on behalf of an anonymous student and her own original poem that was inspired by her mother, who is a Sudanese activist.
Ali’s poem, named for her mother, shared stories about her participation in protests erupting across Sudan in opposition of the country’s authoritarian government and violent raids by the government and secret police on civilian homes.
At the end of the event, Garcia and Afify thanked audience members, performers, and co-organizers.
“Our main focus is to create a forum for everybody, creating an intersectional community that will welcome people to the community who may not have felt as welcomed before,” Garcia said.
“We’re very proud to have had this event in this place,” Abraham E. Rebollo ’20, a Signet member, said. “We are trying to open the space up more to artists of color and activists groups to use this space and to be able to have a platform to speak about their experiences.”

Dozens of mothers who lost their children to opioid overdoses are calling on Harvard to remove the Sackler family’s name from its campus, in light of recent allegations that the family was deeply involved in perpetrating the national opioid crisis.
The women, many of whom are members of Team Sharing, a grief group for parents of opioid victims, have written letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in the past few weeks, urging Harvard to cut ties with the Sacklers and refuse future funding from them. The letter-writers also helped promote a petition calling for the same objectives, which has garnered more than 14,500 signatures as of Thursday evening.
The mothers’ efforts to pressure the University come at a time when other prestigious institutions that have received donations from the Sacklers are grappling with similar entreaties from activists.
Members of the Sackler family have served as executives at Purdue Pharma, the Connecticut-based pharmaceutical company that produces OxyContin, a painkiller that has been widely condemned for its role in the opioid crisis.
In the 1980s, Arthur M. Sackler helped fund the construction of a namesake museum on Harvard’s campus, which currently holds the University’s collection of Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean art.
In interviews with multiple letter-writers, many pressed the University to take a zero-tolerance approach when it comes to reconciling past donations from the Sackler family, even from members not directly connected to the manufacturing and sale of OxyContin.
“They don’t need to be recognized in any way,” said DeAnna Ashby-Shultz, who leads the North Carolina chapter of Team Sharing. “Their money is dirty money.”
Though Arthur Sackler passed away roughly a decade before the drug came to market, many activists blame him for the aggressive advertising tactics he helped pioneer, which they say Purdue sales representatives later used to push OxyContin.
Dame Jillian Sackler, the widow of Arthur Sackler, wrote in an emailed statement that her husband had “nothing to do” with OxyContin and that his estate is not named in “any lawsuit” against Purdue.
“It is a gross injustice to blame my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the public health crisis surrounding opioids,” she wrote. “Arthur was never involved in Purdue Pharma, a company owned by his brothers Mortimer and Raymond and their families.”
Cheryl A. Juaire and Rhonda Lotti, leaders of the Massachusetts chapter of Team Sharing, wrote in a letter to Bacow that leaving the Sackler name on its campus was “reprehensible.”
“It clearly implies that Harvard University stands with Purdue and the Sacklers in the belief that money matters more than lives. We don’t believe that is the image you want to portray of such an institution that you are now the President of,” they wrote.
Bacow wrote in response that the “stories and photographs” he received from the mothers “deeply moved” him, but that the University did not plan to strip Arthur Sackler’s name from the museum on campus.
“Your assertions that the construction of the original building that housed the Arthur M. Sackler Museum was paid for by a donation from Dr. Sackler and that he died before OxyContin was developed and marketed are correct,” Bacow wrote. “Given these circumstances and legal and contractual considerations, we do not have plans to remove Dr. Sackler’s name from the Museum.”
He added that Harvard researchers are “earnestly addressing” the opioid crisis to prevent other mothers from having to experience the loss of a child.
Jeremy Cohen, a Cambridge activist who spearheaded the petition, said he believes the recent revelations arising from a lawsuit brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 against members of the Sackler family have given him and other activists significant momentum in their efforts.
Healey’s lawsuit alleges that Sackler family members who served on Purdue’s board of directors, deceptively marketed OxyContin and attempted to shift blame onto opioid users for their addiction, all while raking in billions of dollars from their addictive painkiller.
“It’s kind of front of mind for everyone right now,” Cohen said. “Two or three years ago, it might not have gotten the same traction.”
The group of mothers writing to Harvard say their next target is likely Tufts University, which received donations from Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, former executives at Purdue, to construct a biomedical school building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard graduate students have long bristled at the expectation that they must pay necessary academic conference expenses up front and wait months to receive reimbursements.
The discussion surrounding reimbursement issues was refreshed after Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology Ph.D. candidate Jessica E. Sagers published an op-ed in Science Magazine, detailing how she and her peers have suffered under Harvard’s current reimbursement policies.
The article, entitled “Reimbursement policies make academia less inclusive,” was published Feb. 14, and has since amassed 23,000 Facebook shares.
Harvard protocol is to reimburse students for conference expenses — including registration, air travel, and lodging — only after they attend, according to Sagers. The policy requires students to pay significant sums up front that can infringe upon their modest stipends.
“Registration is usually happening three to six months before you go to the conference. So even if you win a travel grant or have a fellowship that supports travel, you are expected to front that money, which can be one to two thousand dollars,” Sagers said in an interview.
“You’re just out that money until the conference happens because you’re not allowed to submit reimbursement forms until after the conference. Even then, you submit forms after the conference, and the reimbursement times are interminable, something like two to three months,” she added. “There was one time when I was out $4,000 for an entire year.”
The problem is pervasive, according to Dana L. Boebinger, who is also a Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology Ph.D. candidate. Boebinger said that a few days after Science Magazine published Sagers’s article, she overheard someone lament they had been waiting months for a reimbursement.
“There was a group of people standing next to me. And one of them said to the group of friends, ‘Well, I can’t order the takeout for us or call the Uber because I applied for this conference a couple of months ago and I still haven’t been paid back,’” Boebinger said.
Sagers said these reimbursement policies preclude her financially disadvantaged peers from attending conferences and advancing their careers.
“If somebody looks at a CV of [a student] who is applying for a postdoc position and they don’t see any conference presentations or any conference talks, that’s a red flag. You’re expected to participate in the ecosystem of science, and if you don’t, that does hurt your career,” Sagers said.
Jeanne Gallée, also a SHBT Ph.D. candidate, wrote in an email that conferences are integral to furthering scientific careers.
“Even beyond boosting your resume, scientific conferences are essential in that they allow you to connect with peers and established researchers, and perhaps more importantly, provide the perfect space to receive feedback on your own ideas,” she wrote.
The Harvard Graduate Student Union has been working to address the issue, according to Madeleine F. Jennewein, a member of the group's bargaining committee. She said the problem “spans all students,” and the union has sought to include the issue in their bargaining goals.
“We have been very aware of the difficulties of reimbursement within our bargaining unit, and have included in our bargaining goals and our proposals to the university ways to reduce the upfront financial burden on student workers as they travel for conferences and make work-related expenses,” she wrote in an email.
Sagers said she has voiced her concerns to the administration before. In November, she wrote to Accounting Administrator Danny Cho that it was “really painful” to be denied reimbursement until after she attended her conference in February.
He replied that “these are federal funds and DMS cannot change the policy,” according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
Director of Finance and Administration Will Carter wrote in an emailed statement that the University is required to abide by the Office of Management and Budget’s Uniform Administrative Requirements because Harvard receives federal funding.
“Non-compliance carries a significant risk to the entire institution’s portfolio of federal awards,” Carter wrote.
The OMB did not respond to a request for comment.
Sagers said she has confronted University officials about delayed reimbursements in the past, and administrators usually cite the OMB’s standards.
“That’s essentially the line we receive,” Sagers said. “And I have had many, many conversations with administrators, and it doesn’t push any farther than that.”
Both Sagers and Boebinger suggested that students be given departmental credit cards to pay for upfront conference fees. The Graduate Student Council has already taken steps to address the issue, according to GSC President Blakey B. O’Connor.
“The GSC changed its policy for awarding Conference and Summer Research Grants two years ago,” O’Connor wrote in an emailed statement. “With the new policy in place, students may receive their awards before they attend a conference, instead of having to submit receipts for reimbursements."
Sagers said she will continue to speak out about the issue.
“If I don’t advocate for myself in this process, I know no one will advocate for me.”
Correction: March 2, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sagers's op-ed has 500 shares on Facebook. In fact, the op-ed has 23,000 shares.

As the Harvard baseball team prepares to embark on a new season, it looks to expand upon the growth that it experienced last year.
“I thought we competed well last year,” Coach Bill Decker said. “I really thought we grew. We did some nice things offensively, we played good team defense, and we pitched well as well. We saw all of those three phases improve.”
Harvard’s 22-20 record marked its first season above a .500 win percentage since 2006, the last year in which it took first place in the Ivy League. Leading the team during last year’s fruitful season were pitchers Simon Rosenblum-Larson and Noah Zavolas, both of whom currently find themselves involved in the farm systems of Major League Baseball franchises.
“We’re going to miss those guys,” senior pitcher Kevin Stone said. “Noah was the Ivy League pitcher of the year last year and Simon was the next guy in line to win that award.”
Stone is one starting pitcher who will help the Harvard pitching staff fill in the holes left by Zavolas and Rosenblum-Larson. Additionally, senior Ian Miller is coming back to Harvard after sitting out last season due to injury, and sophomore Buddy Hayward is coming off of an encouraging summer to expand upon the five starts he threw during his freshman season.
“I don’t think [losing Zavolas and Rosenblum-Larson] will be much of a problem given the depth that we have,” Stone remarked. “In fact, I’m excited about what we’re bringing to the table.”
What will perhaps be missed more than the mound presence of Zavolas and Rosenblum-Larson is their locker room presence — and the locker room presence of many of the outgoing seniors, for that matter.
“The thing about last season was that we had some nice leadership from the guys who are no longer here,” Coach Decker commented. “I think that’s the biggest void, but it’s just about continuing the process. Now, it’s somebody else who has to step up.”
Captains Jake Allen and Chase Aldridge are a couple of members of the team that will look to fill that leadership role this spring.
“Jake and Chase are awesome,” sophomore outfielder Tommy Seidl said. “They are the perfect dynamic of leaders. They’re both great leaders by example. It’s good to have leaders that aren’t just good baseball players but also set the tone for how you should act on and off the field.”
“We’re trying to get an infectious leadership in our locker room,” Decker added. “Where guys can invest in one another, guys can do the little things together.”
Over the course of their winter break excursion to the Dominican Republic, the team began to build a strong locker room culture and worked to change their mentality about the game.
“It expanded our view and made us more relaxed about baseball,” Seidl commented. “It helped us change our approach a little bit. A lot of times, we take it too seriously. But the Dominican players know how to really make the most out of it — the first thing is that they’re having fun.”
Additionally, the team used the experience as an opportunity to improve their skills on the diamond against top-notch local talent.
“It was an unreal experience — we got progressively better every single day,” Seidl said. “We just started playing better baseball. It was really good to see live pitching; it was awesome to go down there and just interact with the locals of Santo Domingo. My favorite part was playing against the Boca Chica Allstars, a group of Major League prospects.”
Returning to campus in mid-January, the team got right to work. After a bumpy start due to malfunctions with the practice bubble over the football field, the team was finally able to get into a solid training routine.
“I think they’ve done a good job taking control of what we can control” Decker said. “We’ve been kind of all over the place with the bubble situation, but our guys trained really well whether it was on campus or using off-campus facilities. They’re getting better as a team and getting better as individuals, just working on the little parts of the game that are really important.”
Despite the exciting prospect of a new season, the team is keeping its head down, just focusing on the games at hand on a week-by-week basis.
“The only thing I am really concerned about is right now,” Coach Decker said. “What we’re going to be able to do down in South Carolina against Wofford and how we prepare for that series. Making sure we can play clean and relaxed — just kind of play catch. These are the things we should focus on — one series, one game at a time.”
This weekend, the team heads on its first road trip of the season. Despite not being Ivy League play, the matchups against Wofford College down in Spartanburg, S.C., offer the team an opportunity to start off the season on the right foot.
“[Despite being non-conference], these games do matter,” Seidl commented. “We want to do well, we want to get out-of-league wins because it’s good to show that you can compete against those guys too.”
“We’re going at it like everything matters — of course, Ivy League [games] matter more — but we go into this full blown, ready to go, trying to get W’s” Stone added. “Playing out-of-conference competition is really good for us, because we get to stack ourselves up against some better teams than we might see in the Ivy League. Typically, we’ll play some schools from bigger conferences and more baseball-centered programs. Not only does it give us a good reference point to where we are and what we have to work on, but traveling with the team brings us all closer together. It’s a big bonding experience.”
“It’s about staying where you need to be,” Coach Decker remarked, agreeing with the importance of staying grounded. “Don’t let the game speed you up, stay who you are and analyze situations. It’s about good pitching, good at bat, and good defense.”
The allure of Ivy League play is nonetheless captivating the attention of the squad, despite the thirteen non-conference games that come before the Ancient Eight opener at Penn. The Crimson will look to expand upon its fourth-place finish in the conference last season.
“I think fourth place is a bit misleading because we were a game or two away from being in the final championship series,” Stone had to say. “We’re playing like we expect to be in the final series of the year, and we’re carrying ourselves like that. It’s super energizing.”
“The Ivy League is important, and that’s really what we play for,” Coach Decker said. “But we’ve got to take care of those first games, whoever they’re against.”
All in all, the team feels ready and excited for the dawn of a new season — a new chance to demonstrate all their growth and hard work from the offseason as they officially take the diamond for the first time in months. This, after all, is what they live for.
“We’re getting back on the field,” Seidl said. “We haven’t been on an actual diamond that’s not covered by a bubble since the fall — besides the D.R., obviously — but going and actually competing against other teams, that’s really what it’s about.”
“We’re looking forward to getting going,” Coach Decker concluded. “I think we’re all excited about it. From our staff to our support staff to our players, I just think that there’s a good feeling. I think we’re in a good spot. But now, we’re going to find out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I enter the Murr Center’s women’s lacrosse office for an interview with new Carole Kleinfelder Head Coach for Harvard Women's Lacrosse Devon Wills, and I am unimpressed with the decor. It is carpeted and clean but gray and rather dark, with a pipe exposed on the wall. It is reminiscent of the average dorm room here: an unremarkable space for a remarkable person.
Wills sits back in her chair with an inviting smile. She is well-settled into her new home, as the office’s nondescript walls have been adorned with action shots and accolades. The Colorado native looks poised, ready to take on the challenge of leading the Crimson to the top of the standings in her rookie campaign. Harvard finished 6-9 (2-5 Ivy) last year, unable to to put together a winning streak of two or more consecutive games.
Her lacrosse pedigree is certainly impressive. She joined the U.S. national team in 2007 and quickly cemented her place as one of the best American goalies in recent memory.
As captain in 2017, she led the squad to gold medals in the Federation of International Lacrosse World Cup and the International World Games (While lacrosse is currently not an Olympic sport, there has been a concerted but as yet unsuccessful push in recent years to add it to the slate).
She was involved in the creation of the Women’s Professional Lacrosse League and previously played in its predecessor of sorts, the United Women’s Lacrosse League.
Wills comes to Cambridge from the University of Southern California, where she was a talented defensive and recruiting coordinator.
However, Wills is no stranger to Ivy League lacrosse. The three-time All-American standout at Dartmouth College led the Big Green to the NCAA championship game in 2006. In that season, she boasted the lowest goals-against average in the nation and held captain’s honors.
She identifies the overall student culture among the Ancient Eight as an important feature of this post for her.
“I always had an appreciation for how successful the programs are and how successful the league is, given the differences and time constraints that they have compared to the rest of the college realm,” Wills said. “There’s something to be said for choosing an Ivy League school, that you’re really showing a commitment to your character and a commitment to your personal growth off the field. That’s something that drew me back. I wanted to work with players who had that in mind in addition to prioritizing athletics.”
After graduating from Dartmouth with a degree in sociology, she joined the Big Green’s coaching staff as an assistant before heading back to her home state to be an assistant at the University of Denver.
With all of that experience under her belt, Wills is considered a real catch in the college sporting world.
“We are thrilled to welcome Devon as our new head women's lacrosse coach,” said Bob Scalise, John D. Nichols '53 Family Director of Athletics. “Devon is widely known as an outstanding coach and mentor, and she returns to the Ivy League after making a tremendous impact at USC. One of the greats in the history of women's lacrosse, Devon brings a winning pedigree to Cambridge and we look forward to her continued success here at Harvard.”
Wills also brings to Boston a unique skill set with respect to recruiting. She is from the Mountain West, played in New England, and coached for the better part of a decade on the West Coast.
“It’s been able to give me a broader perspective on recruiting so that we’re not closing the doors to, you know, potential recruits from far away,” Wills said. “Whether its California, Minnesota, Chicago, Florida, I don’t really care where you’re from. If you’re academically qualified to come here and you’re a good lacrosse player, then we absolutely want to give you a look.”
It is snowing outside as she speaks, another chilly Boston afternoon in the middle of the long winter. Her old stomping grounds in SoCal are likely grinning with dewy sunshine right now. It is no wonder the Crimson can have trouble attracting talent from thousands of miles away.
The conversation turns to the upcoming season. Wills knows her honeymoon won’t last long, that she will be judged soon enough not by her successes in settings past, but by how she fares inside the Harvard Stadium. She expects continual ups and downs to the season.
“At first, in the fall, we were just trying to get our bearings and get a grasp on what everybody’s strengths were,” Wills said. “And now that we’re really into preseason practice, we’re kind of getting more in depth concepts and everything. It is a lot of teaching. I think everybody’s kind of new to the system, which is taking more time that I think it probably would if they were used to it. But it’s always the same focus, you know, that everybody just needs to get better.”
It will be an uphill climb for Wills' squad this year. Princeton and Penn both suffered only one loss last spring, and Harvard was mired in a logjam of two- and three-win teams at the bottom of the standings. Wills wants to emphasize playing the right way over simply gunning for as many wins as possible immediately.
“We’re trying to keep an eye on process-based goals,” Wills said. “Just trying to get better each practice, learning from the previous practice, learning from the previous game. We’re focusing on growth. So rather than saying like, Oh, we want to win X number of games or we want to win this title or that title or have Y number of All-Americans, I think right now we want to make sure we’re getting better each day.”
She smiles and shakes my hand while an assistant calls with a question from the adjacent room. Wills’s reputation got her here, but she is all business now. A long, challenging season looms, and Wills and her captains have work to do.
As I exit the Murr Center, one thing becomes apparent: she deserves a bigger office.

After a long offseason, the men’s and women’s golf teams are gearing up to hit the links again this spring. Both sides look to get back in form and make a strong push for the Ivy League Championships come mid-April.
The journey to winning the league is already underway, even before the first tee. Despite the inconvenient New England weather, both squads have taken it upon themselves to make the most of this lengthy break.
“We’ve been doing everything we can, preparing a lot indoors and outdoors when possible,” freshman Anina Ku said. “Overall we’re really happy with the plan we’ve made and how we’re executing it.”
Ku and fellow freshman Elizabeth Wang were second and first respectively on the women’s team in terms of average score this past fall. This translated to an individual best finish of third for Wang and fifth for Ku. The team earned its overall top result at the Dartmouth Invitational, placing second in a field of 15 teams in the first tournament of the season.
The Crimson women will kick their new campaign off with a trip to Florida for the Harvard Invitational on March 30th. This will be followed by a special matchplay event hosted by Princeton on April 6th, before the Ivy League Championships in Ringoes, N.J. on April 19th.
The team obviously wants to score as low as possible and place as well as it can, but that isn’t at the core of its mindset. The Crimson knows that it must focus on improving each and every day in order to have success in the long run.
“A lot of our goals are based on doing everything we can every practice, every workout,” Ku said. “Our main goal was and always will be making sure we’re giving our best effort for every practice and every shot in every round.”
This sentiment is certainly one that is echoed on the men’s side as well. They are currently working on strength and conditioning twice a week in addition to their five normal practices. The group is eager to reap the benefits from their offseason efforts and prove that it can perform at a high level.
“Everyone’s very motivated,” junior Rij Patel said. “I think that’s been the most important thing. We’ve used this time to really progress and we’re all very excited for our first tournament.”
The injury-ravaged squad stumbled through the fall but is now returning to full-strength for the spring. The past season was highlighted by a fifth place finish at the Quechee Invitational for Harvard. In terms of individual performances, Patel’s average score of 71.63 and sophomore Grant Fairbairn’s 73.25 led the way.
The men’s team has four events to look forward to, one more than the Crimson women. It all begins with a unique trip to Scottsdale, Ariz. on March 9th for the Michigan Desert Mountain Tournament. Usually the first contest takes place after spring break, but this year it is on the earlier side.
“We’re trying to use this tournament as a way to kickstart our season,” Patel said. “I think it’s just an amazing opportunity to play a tournament like this before spring break and get a head start to our season. I think it’ll be a good indicator of where we’re at and we’ll use that as a way to push our games’ forward.”
A little over a month later the Ivy League Championships will begin on April 19th in Elverson, Pa. This will be a three-day affair at a tricky course, forcing the teams to display significant resolve and skill in order to come out on top.
“It’s going to be a very close and tough championship to win this year,” Patel said. “All the teams are working really hard and we’re just going to focus on what we can do. We focus on our controllables. I think that’s all we can ask for and whatever happens, happens.”
For both the Harvard men and women, a championship team will not form overnight. Success will be the result of consistent improvement and determination over the next two months. Furthermore, it will require contributions from every individual on the roster.
Despite this pressure to do well, it is what every athlete dreams about. Having the opportunity to help one’s team work towards a championship is what fuels the long practices and the countless weight room sessions. That is why when the time comes, every golfer will be ready to seize the moment.
“The way our team is looking right now, every person who goes to a tournament could do something incredible,” Ku said.

Kaitlyn Schiffhauer is no stranger to fours. Back when she donned blue and white for the Palo Alto High School Eagles, she soared to the top of her class as a four-time varsity softball letterwinner. Last April, she registered a four-game hitting streak, her longest collegiate hit surplus. And now, as a Harvard senior, the captain for the Crimson is just over halfway through her fourth year at the College. Thus, it should come as no shock that she summed up her goals for the Harvard softball team in four words: Respect. Passion. Fortitude. Confidence.
As the Crimson journeys into the 2019 softball season, high hopes and steep expectations are certainly coming along for the ride. After sweeping Dartmouth in a two-game series last May, Harvard took home its seventh Ivy League softball title under last year’s senior class, a group that Schiffhauer described as essential to the Crimson’s victory.
“Last year’s senior class was a tremendous example of leadership,” Schiffhauer said. “They held up high standards of Harvard softball, so I learned a lot from them.”
Respect.
This season, the Crimson softball team hopes to replicate the success of last year’s leadership. Pitcher and infielder Katie Duncan, the squad’s newest captain, regards her predecessors as epitomes of camaraderie.
“In terms of making an impression on the freshman, I just want to continue the idea that the seniors implemented last year,” Duncan said. “They really [focused on] supporting one another as a community and to really be a family on and off the field.”
Passion.
Maintaining the team’s drive over the course of the entire softball season is no easy task for Harvard’s captains. With training beginning at the start of the academic year and championship games not being played until early May, the softball season is one of the NCAA’s longest.
“We definitely have a very long season,” Duncan said. “But the seniors last year did a phenomenal job of inspiring everyone to love the game of softball, and I think they all really radiated positivity and made everyone excited to always be there.”
Fortitude.
Of course, with a drawn-out season inevitably comes injuries, an occurrence that last year’s softball squad was no stranger to. This season, however, the Crimson are aiming to balance practice with prudence.
“Last year was really hard because we went through a lot of injuries,” Schiffhauer said. “This season, we’re doing a really good job of managing our injuries and taking care of ourselves, of having high expectations but also knowing when to pull back.”
Confidence.
No matter the struggles that last year’s team faced, the women in crimson are ready to take this season by the horns. Both captains characterize the incoming freshman class as “eager to give 100%” to a team with which they are quickly becoming integrated.
“At the end of the day, I go back and know that my senior class and Katie are supporting me,” said Schiffhauer. “No matter what, the whole team and coaching staff are always behind me.”
Looking Ahead.
As the Crimson squad look toward the upcoming season with hope and excitement, this past weekend’s games served as a litmus test for where they currently stand so far this season.
“This weekend it was great to be on field, on dirt,” Coach Jenny Allard said. “Playing outside, getting our feet under us, getting competitive.”
The Crimson traveled to the sunshine state to participate in the Jacksonville Classic where they first faced LIU-Brooklyn, followed by back-to-back games against Delaware and Jacksonville.
“We have been in a bubble for the past month, there has not been a lot of sunlight” Schiffhauer said. “Seeing that yellow ball is so exciting, so are the moments you live for and the whole team plays for.”
Harvard lost its season opener against the Blackbirds, falling 2-0, before playing the Dolphins and the Blue Hens twice, coming out of both series even against with a win and loss apiece.
“Coming home 2-3 against a line-up of some very tough teams, we are pleased overall with the experience that we got,” Allard said. “There is a lot to build on and a lot of things we will address this week in practice, before we head to Washington, D.C. next weekend.”
The Crimson’s upcoming game schedule is jam packed with road games, with the Harvard squad not playing their first home game until late March against the Brown Bears.
“We do a lot of mental game work,” Allard said. “We are very organized and very structured against how we travel as a team. We make being on the road something that we are good at.”
Last year during the NCAA Regional tournament, the Crimson lost to then-ranked No. 7 Georgia, by a score of 6-2. Afterwards, the Crimson faced the Golden Bears in a win or go home situation and were unable to contain California’s dominant offense, resulting in Harvard’s elimination.
“The goal of any Division 1, 2, or 3 team is to play in the NCAA tournament,” Allard said. “We were excited about the opportunity and we trained hard to be at that regional.”
While looking to replicate last year’s success and qualify for the NCAA regional tournament, this year’s squad has the additional benefit of improving on last year’s performance, with the ultimate goal of bringing Harvard to the next level of collegiate softball.
“The thing we need to continue to play at is a level where the speed of the game is faster,” Allard said. “At that level it is just a little more faster and once you get to the playoffs you have the very best teams competing.”

The reigning 400m Ivy League Heptagonal champion is no stranger to success. Sophomore sprinter Jovahn Williamson has always been one of the fastest runners in the country. He was one of the most decorated high school sprinters in New York State history, placing third at the state championships and second at New Balance Nationals in the 400m his senior year.
With an impressive high school resume behind him, the Dix Hills, N.Y., native started out his collegiate career expected to already become one of the best sprinters the Ivy League had to offer. With teammate Rodney Agyare-May joining him, Harvard sprinting was expected to be rejuvenated with star talent.
Williamson’s indoor track season his freshmen year saw him put up impressive times, with season bests of 48.46 in the 400m and 22.75 in the 200m. He placed eighth at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in the 400m, missing out on his chance to score points for the team.
However, the talented freshman knew he was capable of performing at a higher level. His high school personal records were faster than the times Williamson recorded that indoor season, and he recognized he would have to put in the work to attain his potential.
Growing more accustomed to the Crimson’s training and track regime, Williamson took massive leaps his freshman outdoor season. He lowered his 200m time to 21.94 and his 400m time to 47.56. He won the 400m at the outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and earned the chance to compete against the best in the nation at the NCAA D1 East Prelims.
Coming into this season, Williamson was ready to show the Ancient Eight that his outdoor performance last season was no fluke. Winning the outdoor 400m as just a freshman, there was immense pressure for the sophomore standout to excel once again and maintain his title as the 400m champion.
Despite the pressure mounting, Williamson continued to improve and have some of the fastest times ever seen in a Harvard uniform.
“I would say the biggest factor in my improvement is the experience that I gained from last year,” Williamson said. “It is tough to transition into a new system as a freshman, but I feel like that experience helped me come into this year with new confidence and a better plan on how to reach my goals for the season.”
The sophomore sprinter started his season on a high note with a record-breaking performance at the BU Season Opener. He broke the school record in the 300m with a time 33.75. He followed up that race with a victory at the Harvard-Penn dual meet, earning another fast 300 time of 34.37.
Williamson continued to shine throughout the season, earning victories in both individual and relay events at multiple meets. He would be put in the Harvard spotlight once again the Clemson Invite, where he broke the school record in the 400m.
Williamson's record highlighted day one in a meet against some of the nation's top track talent. He crossed the finish line in 47.39 seconds, and outperformed some of the best sprinters the country had to offer.
“It was very thrilling,” Williamson said. “I felt like I was finally starting to see good progress in my training and confidence.”
Breaking the 300m and 400m record gave the New York native the validation that his training was paying off and he was performing at the potential he was capable of. The sprinter attributes to his success to a calm and relaxed pre-meet routine that allows him to stay focused and composed before he competes.
“On meet days I usually just try to stay as calm and relaxed as possible to ease my nerves,” Williamson said. “I don’t really have any pre-meet traditions other than eating a good meal and drinking plenty of water beforehand.”
With an accomplished set of races behind him, Jovahn Williamson recognized it was now time for him to perform at the biggest meet of the season: The Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
“We were working diligently at practice with our coaches to be best prepared for the championship,” Williamson said. “We need everyone at their best in order to leave a mark on the Ivy League.”
On the day of Heps, the 300 and 400 meter record holder had some of the best races of his life. Starting off with a second place finish in the 200m with a time of 21.94, he was ready to make up for his 400m performance from last year.
Williamson not only won, but dominated the rest of the competition. He ran 48.10 in trials, almost half a second faster than everyone else. He followed that up by running a blazing 47.53 in the 400m final, outlasting Penn’s Anthony Okolo by over a second.
Jovahn Williamson now has two Ivy League championships under his belt and he still has five seasons of track and field ahead of him. The best sprinter in Harvard history still has even more left to prove.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All Harvard athletes are known for their busy schedules and delicate balance between academics and athletics. For the ski team, this coordination takes on a whole different meaning, with carnivals and sometimes even practices taking place in other states. This season, the team mastered this balance, recording its best finish in recent history, and sending two skiers to the NCAA Championships next weekend.
“Individually, having two people go to NCAAs, as well as having all of our freshman turn in top-30 performances is awesome,” said senior Nordic captain Lily Koffman. “Team-wise, our Middlebury result combined with Alpine was the best result we’ve had in decades. On the women’s side we got a couple fourth places, which are the best we’ve had in several years.”
Harvard is one of twenty four teams sending skiers to Stowe, VT to compete in the national championships, but it occupies a fairly unique place on this list. While most schools come from areas known for skiing — such as Colorado, Utah, Vermont, and Maine — Harvard is uniquely urban, with the closest mountains fit for skiing being one state over. Additionally, Harvard is the only Ivy League institution outside of blue-chip Dartmouth represented this year, and the southernmost school not located on the Rocky Mountains.
“We want to prove to people that it is possible to be a really fast skier at Harvard despite the fact that we don’t have a really hilly trail system nearby.” said freshman James Kitch of Harvard’s unique position.
This position comes with its share of challenges, as Harvard’s practice schedule is fairly unique. During the fall, trainings consist mostly of running and roller-skiing, while in the winter, the team heads to a golf-course in Weston, about 30 minutes down the road, which gets covered in man-made snow if mother nature fails to provide.
“It’s kind of nice that we get to get off campus and get to the suburbs. All of us love to spend a lot of our time outside.” Koffman said. “The highlight for us is obviously when it starts to snow, when we get to get out to training camps in Vermont and New Hampshire.
Collegiate skiing has a notoriously short season, which runs from early January through early March, with Harvard competing in just 5 regular season carnivals. These are followed by EISA regional championships, and NCAA championships, if the team does well enough. This means that every weekend of the six-week season takes on extreme significance, at a level that is possibly unmatched in other collegiate sports.
“In college, you’re always skiing together and you’re all racing to score points for the same team together,” said Kitch of the adjustment to collegiate skiing. “While skiing is an individual sport, and individually you want to be the best you can, there’s this dynamic of trying to score points for Harvard and to beat other schools. It was really cool here to be part of this really strong team culture.”
Kitch had a freshman season to remember, cruising to a fifth place finish at the Middlebury Carnival on February 15th, the team’s best this season. A strong showing from sophomore Nellie Ide, who posted a tenth place finish, among others, propelled Harvard to a seventh-place finish out of fifteen schools, its best finish on the season and its best finish at Middlebury since 1974. Kitch also picked up a ninth-place finish at the UNH Carnival, and top-30 finishes in his other three regular season carnivals. These results, combined with a 14th place finish at EISA regionals were enough to propel the freshman to the NCAA championships.
The other Harvard representative at next weekend’s NCAA championships will be senior Hannah Hardenbergh. Hardenbergh capped off an impressive season which included top-30 finishes in each of the team’s five carnivals by placing eleventh at EISA championships. The Edwards, Co. native picked up an eighth-place finish at St. Lawrence Carnival, as well as a tenth at Middlebury. Despite these strong individual finishes, Hardenbergh stayed humble, crediting her teammates for their part in her success.
“The group is just absolutely incredible. Not only are they supportive, but they're super fun to be with,” Hardenbergh said of her teammates. “It's always a challenge to balance school and skiing, it's almost impossible to do both perfectly at the same time. I’m proud of myself and my teammates for maintaining that balance as best we can, and as a result, we’ve become very strong in our athletic and academic endeavors.”
Hardenbergh and Kitch will look to conclude an impressive season with a strong showing at the NCAA championships next weekend. Regardless of where they finish, the Harvard skiing program has had a season to remember.

The original version of the article incorrectly stated that Harvard was the only Ivy League institution represented at the NCAA championships. In fact, Harvard is the only Ivy team outside of Dartmouth at the national tournament.

As the winter winds begin to cool down, the much calmer spring breeze begins to take its place. The sun comes out, flowers start to bud, and birds begin to sing. Yet, spring would not be complete without its most important feature: lacrosse.
The Crimson is looking forward to having a bounce back season this year. In 2018, despite getting off to a great 7-1 start, the team struggled in the second half of the campaign, losing the final six games to finish 7-6 on the year. The team also has to deal with major departures from last season, as it graduated 16 seniors including Morgan Cheek ‘18, who led the team in assists (34) and total overall points (59), as well as starting goalie Robert Shaw ‘18.
However, the team is in no way letting that get to them, and is looking to come out and make a statement in 2019. Led by senior defenseman Jonathan Butler, junior attackman Kyle Anderson, and senior defenseman Spencer Danie, the Crimson feel ready to take on any team it faces this season. The team felt that heading into this year, the aggression needed to be taken to a new level.
“Our main focus is to fuel competition in everything we do,” Anderson said.
The 2019 season has not began the way the team was hoping for, but there is still plenty of time to turn it around. In its first matchup, on Feb. 16, the Crimson traveled to Chapel Hill to take on No. 12/14 North Carolina. Despite hanging with the Tar Heels for most of the game, Harvard ended up falling 16-11.
A week later, Harvard hosted the University of Massachusetts for its home opener. Once again, the Crimson played a solid game, but a quick fourth quarter goal spree in which UMass netted three goals in a minute and 26 second allowed the in-state rival to pick up a 12-9 win.
Three days later, the Crimson took on Holy Cross in a game that got moved from Worcester to Cambridge at the last minute. Harvard was able to get out to a commanding 10-3 lead, but struggled to keep the momentum going, as Holy Cross brought the game all the way back and ended up winning 11-10 in double overtime.
Despite the rough start, the season has had a few bright spots. On the onset of the season, Butler and sophomore midfielder Jack Frisoli were named to the NEILA All-New England Preseason Second Team. In addition, freshman attackman Austin Madronic, who has six goals on the year, was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week after the first matchup against UNC.
“It's an honor to win Ivy League Rookie of the Week, especially in my first college game,” Madronic said. “However, as a team, we didn't end up with the outcome we wanted and we have a lot of work to do, but I know we're up for a challenge.”
Heading into March, Harvard will be entering the month in which it feasted last year, going 5-1 against a collection of Ivy League and local opponents. These games included tight wins against Brown, Dartmouth, and an OT thriller against local rival Boston University. Harvard will have the same slate of opponent this year, with a home tilt Saturday the 9th against Providence (2-2) and a home game near the end of March against last year’s No. 1/1 ranked team Albany (1-1) to end the mouth.
The conclusion of the season will be the toughest competition to date for the Crimson squad. It will face No. 3/3 ranked Cornell (2-0) at home on the 6th of November and Penn (0-2) the following Saturday at home. Against both teams last year the team battled to the buzzer, losing as talented Cornell and Penn teams pulled away late. The Crimson will finish its season with a bout away against Princeton (1-1) and a home clash against a No. 4/4 ranked Yale (1-1) team that won the national championship last year. This year, Harvard will hope to capitalize on its opportunities against quality opponents in tight games.
Despite the tough beginning, the Crimson has many chances to take down some of the best teams in the nation. The team is hungry to get its season back on track, starting this Saturday away against Hartford (0-3).

As the ice of the River Charles thaws and recedes, the Harvard crew programs look to rejuvenate the waters with intensive competition and spirited drive. On the heels of competitive seasons last year, each team looks to embark on an even more successful campaign this spring.
The Radcliffe lightweight crew placed its first varsity boat fifth at last year’s IRAs in 7:33.483. The team also captured the Muri Cup. For senior Tessa Buchan, the development of the younger rowers in the program was a theme of last year and will continue to play a large role this coming spring.
“We gave a lot of speed and kept that through until this past fall, and in the fall for the Head of the Charles, we won the lightweight four event, so that was a pretty big highlight,” Buchan said.
“We were able to field two eights in the lightweight eight event; in the previous year, we only had one eight there.”
“I think we’re seeing a lot of people have personal records right now,” Buchan added.
“The team overall is getting speedier from the 3V to the 1V. We’re going to be in Florida in three weeks for winter training, and that’s a pretty exciting time. We really see all the work we put on the erg show on the water, and we’re going to be in D.C. on March 30 for the first race. Hopefully we’ll get a W there.”
New assistant coach Mary Foster will join head coach Sarah Baker at the helm after serving as a volunteer coach in the past.
The Crimson men’s heavyweight third varsity boat finished second at the IRAs last year and also took first at the 153rd Harvard-Yale Regatta. The team took the Smith Cup over Northeastern and the Compton Cup over Princeton as well.
Radcliffe’s heavyweight team placed fourth at the Ivy League Championships and took the Eastern Sprints title after winning the first and second varsity eight and the first varsity four.
The Harvard men’s lightweight crew took bronze at the IRAs last year after starting the season red-hot, including a string of victories against then top-ranked Cornell. The team took the Biglin Bowl from Dartmouth and MIT and capsized Navy to take the Haines Cup.
The men’s crew looks to build on the momentum of a strong senior class. Senior Jack Stone, the coxswain for the 1V, emphasized the significance of the the older leaders on the team.
“It’s phenomenal that we have such a huge senior class, and I think we have had very few seniors leave the team over the last four years,” Stone said. “We’re now seeing a lot of leadership from everyone across the class, and I think the seniors, all of us, will really help make this team even better through our final year and leave a good legacy.”
At its core, each and every one of the members of Harvard’s crew team is a driven athlete. The strenuous and continuous year-long training regiment is hard to fathom. Yet every morning, these rowers will awaken in the wee hours to take on the training challenges of the day, pushing themselves to greater heights.
“I can just say that the guys that I’ve met on the team are easily the hardest working people on campus,” Stone said. “There’s no one who is slacking off in class; [they’re] taking incredibly advanced courses, and it’s really a challenge because unlike most sports, there’s really no offseason, so during the entire year, there are guys doing research with professors, writing theses, taking classes like Math 55 as well as doing a sport that continues throughout the whole year.”
Rowing is clearly not just a physical sport, but one that necessitates incredible mental fortitude and persistence. The qualities and discipline of the sport require laser focus and immense composure during races.
“They just have to keep pushing themselves throughout the entire race,” Stone said. “When you think about a sport that requires you to be in such good physical condition throughout the year, the vast majority of the year you’re training and races are months away, so I think the sport attracts people who think really far ahead and stay disciplined with their fitness.”
Daniel James Brown’s The Boys in the Boat is the epic retelling of the University of Washington’s crew triumph at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The camaraderie and companionship of that Washington crew parallels Harvard’s own. From waking up early in the morning to spending many hours a week at practice, the sport welds the most driven of people into the most formidable of athletes.
“Rowing is a bit of a crazy sport,” Buchan said. “I actually did the math the other day that we’re going to do 20,000 minutes of training in the spring and only 42 minutes of competition. So I think the dedication to the team as a whole, and that you’re pulling for the girl in front of you, behind you.”
“I think rowers are generally those who love the feeling of the workout and the feeling of having the team there, and as much as we’re super competitive, that inner drive, our ability to compete within ourselves and beat our own personal records is something that keeps us so in love with the sport.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early afternoon of Saturday, Feb. 9 — as I was just roused from a late-night slumber, still processing the thrilling triple-overtime game at Lavietes Pavilion the night before — I received a fascinating email in my inbox from a man named Vince Lackner.
Somewhat perplexed by the generic “Harvard Basketball” email title, I quickly scrolled down to the signature. Here, it read, “Vince Lackner ‘72, Harvard Basketball 1970-71”. Intriguing, I thought.
By the time I finished reading the full note, it had dawned on me that I had stumbled into an exciting opportunity— one that would allow me to dive deep into the legacy of a basketball program whose sole NCAA appearance before the arrival of Tommy Amaker came in 1946.
So onwards to Henrietta’s Table in The Charles Hotel I went, as per my invitation. Here, inside a semi-bustling eatery hours past its signature brunch time, I quickly located my party at the front bar area. Already situated and chatting casually were a few individuals: Susan Clark, Brigid Decsi and her son Brian, an older gentlemen named Cliff Crosby, and the man who put this reunion together, Vince Lackner himself.
These names may sound unfamiliar, unless one is a true historian or aficionado of Harvard Basketball. But the common bond that ties these folks together, as well as one more individual I would later speak to over phone named Don Swegan, is one that stretches back to that decade that played host to World War II. As Tom Brokaw would say, this group belonged to the tail end of the Greatest Generation.
But first, let’s go back to that table again. On my left stood Brigid Decsi, whose father Lou had co-captained that historic 1946 Ivy championship team. On my right stood Susan Clark, whose father Jack would later serve as captain of the team the following season. Both Jack Clark and Lou Decsi had recently past away in the last two years, leaving the aforementioned Swegan as the only living member of the 1946 championship team.
And Cliff Crosby? The 90-year old man who would later drive back to his home in New Hampshire was a graduate of Harvard College in 1950, who also earned letters for the Crimson in basketball (as well as baseball/football) in the late 1940s.
Quite a remarkable ensemble, to say the least.
Like many of his teammates on that 1946 championship team, Decsi did not arrive in Cambridge his freshman year. Instead, the Akron, Ohio native originally enrolled in Bucknell University through the Navy V-12 officer’s training program. The six-foot-three Decsi captained the basketball team while with the Bisons, and when the war ended in 1945, the V-12 students were re-distributed across ROTC institutions.
One such university happened to be Harvard, and amazingly five of Decsi’s new “V-12” teammates also captained their previous school teams — among this list included ex-Bowling Green skipper and future Celtic Wyndol Gray, Millersburg ex-captain Saul Maraiaschin (another Celtic), and Swegan who led the Baldwin-Wallace side.
Decsi stayed at Harvard for only that one championship season, returning back to Bucknell to conclude his collegiate career. He was one of the starters on that season’s team, playing mostly at center.
“Despite his height, Desci has looked fast and tricky under the boards in pre-season practice,” a Crimson article from Dec. 7, 1945 read.
Following graduation, Decsi embarked on a brief semi-pro career including spending two years with the Celtics’ B team, the Hartford Hurricanes.
“He had some photographs but really what it did for him was it shaped his life,” according to Brigid Decsi, Lou’s daughter. “Because he went from Harvard, then he played semi-pro ball, and then he went on and tried out for the Celtics. He said to me that he never had any regrets because he tried.”
As to Lou’s time in the military service, the trained dirigibles mechanic embraced a nomadic life of sorts, due to his basketball prowess.
“He kept getting moved to different bases because he could play basketball,” Brigid Decsi said. “...Each of the bases had teams and they would compete against each other. If the head of each base wanted their team to win, they would move people, they would try and load their team with the best players so that kept him [in service].”
Following his basketball-playing days, Decsi settled in Connecticut and would later manage the payroll department of the Hartford Insurance Group. Today, Brigid and their extended families continued to call that area their adopted home.
Unlike the bounty of transfers on that 1945-1946 squad, Clark was the established veteran on that championship team as their returning captain. But like many on the team, Clark came from humble beginnings as an native of a small town in upstate New York.
The six-foot-two forward was the main scoring target before the arrival of the transfers in ‘45-’46, which relegated him to a role coming off the bench. Still, the Eliot House native maintained a passion, diligence, and love for the sport and of New England that lasted an entire lifetime. Susan, his daughter, recounted how staying active was critical to Jack even in his nineties.
“It was just sort of part of my dad actually, now that I think about it, he would play with much younger guys after work,” Susan Clark recounted. “There was something about [basketball] he just loved."
"He stayed very active into his 90’s. It was part of his life and discipline," added Susan Clark.
Compounded to Jack’s fervor for basketball was an equal appreciation for the university he called home.
“Whatever happened [at Harvard] held a place so ingrained in his feeling for that the college and the people and the sports, he just loved to go back,” Susan Clark said. “And I always went to commencement with him. Every year, we would go and...he didn't talk about experiences that much or particular things other than...just the love of it....And we went into Cambridge. And we walked through the Harvard Yard, and it just couldn't quite get enough of it.”
Up to his later years, Clark maintained an email chain with Coach Tommy Amaker, continuously exchanging thoughts about the team and staying involved with the happenings in the program.
Unable to be physically present at this reunion, the 94-year old man currently resides in a retirement community near his lifelong home in Youngstown, Ohio. Upon picking up the phone, however, it was obvious that Swegan continued to have an undeniable love for this meaningful game from his younger years.
Swegan’s claim to fame, outside of the fact that he scored the final basket in the NIT Tournament against top-ranked Ohio State to throw off the point spread (“everybody in the crowd went wild!”)?
Remarkably, Swegan had sat only a few seats away from The Great Bambino while waiting for Harvard’s later-afternoon matchup against the Buckeyes.
“We played the NIT and Kentucky played Rhode Island,” Swegan said. “And I stood in the last row of Madison Square Garden, next to Babe Ruth, and sat there the whole game watching the Rhode Island-Kentucky game.”
Due to earning the Ivy League championship, the Crimson had earned just one of eight spots to the national tournament held in the ‘World’s Most Famous Arena’ in New York City. This was an eye-opening experience for many of the members of the team who had spent most of their lives in small-town America.
Swegan also noted how different the rules of the game and style of play were back then, commentating on how he was able to play both basketball, baseball, and football while at Harvard. In fact, Swegan was the captain of the baseball team and represented Harvard at the only East-West College baseball game at Fenway Park.
“The coach could not meet with the players at a timeout,” Swegan said. “So when timeout was called you had to stand there under the basket. But the coach was not allowed to interact with you at that time.”
When you went to screen for a man so somebody could get a cut or a shot you had to be three feet away from the guy that you were screening...if you got right up to a guy they would call it a pick.”
You could not invade the basket cylinder, you could not catch your hand in there. So there was no dunking or jamming of the ball.”
Swegan stayed at Harvard for only one season, but he gained some notoriety after being invited by the Friends of Harvard Basketball to attend the Crimson’s first NCAA Tournament game since his own 1946 contest at MSG. Harvard earned that long-awaited berth in 2012, and Swegan was the sole representative of that class to attend the game in Albuquerque.
“Maybe they were surprised I lived that long,” said Swegan on interacting with the 2012 team. “I don't know. Anyway, we had some good action interaction with the players and with the parents and so on. And I thoroughly enjoyed it.”
At the banquet later that month, Swegan reunited with his old teammate Jack Clark, their first meeting in 66 years. At his retirement home, that reunion photo still hangs high as a reminder of their collegiate friendship.
“[Jack Clark] is a wonderful guy, a tremendous man, and we have that on my wall here at home,” Swegan said. “I've got some pictures with him when I was out there in Cambridge for the banquet.”
Similar to Swegan, Crosby was a standout multi-sport athlete at Harvard who outrightly declared baseball as his strongest sport. A dominant reliever who according to a 1950 Crimson article solved “the one Crimson weakness, and the one which was responsible for the great number of its defeats, [which was] the lack of adequate mound strength for relief purposes,” Crosby also excelled as a catcher.
Crosby enrolled in Cambridge the fall of 1946, when many of the ROTC transfers had already left campus. But the New Hampshire native still vividly recalled the post-war excitement that had dispersed throughout the university.
“All the people who had served in the war were coming back, so there were young people just out of high school and veterans,” Crosby said. “But they all wanted to do sports. They still couldn’t let go of all the fighting and the fun they got out of it, which was teamwork and maturity of the group. It was wonderful to watch.”
On the basketball court, Crosby had some compelling stories. First, as one of the strongest defenders on the team, he would often be pitted with the most talented opponents — among this list included none other than Holy Cross’ Bob Cousy.
As members of the same graduating class, Crosby was pitted against Cousy in all four years, losing to the Crusaders in each of its attempts. The ex-Harvard guard commented on Cousy’s shiftiness and aggressiveness as distinguishing qualities in his play.
Another neat fact? Not only did Harvard send a few of their best players to the Celtics, the team often practiced against their professional counterparts.
“Basketball wasn’t a big thing and the Celtics were just starting,” Crosby said. “We actually scrimmaged them. There were two players I remember, one was Eddie Ehlers from Purdue. He had a crossover dribble. The other was Ed Sadowski. He had a particular motion when he got down on the post, he would hit you in the chest. When he did it to college boys you would feel it.”
Finally, the college teams around Boston in the forties would frequently play games at the Boston Garden back then. Alongside the Holy Cross rivalry, the Crimson also battled Boston College and Princeton among other squads in the hallowed, 13,000-plus seat grounds. Certainly an experience worth cherishing and retelling for future generations.
A native of Pittsburgh, PA., this lawyer and estate administration software developer was the glue to this entire operation, connecting several long-lost members of that 1946 team and organizing this reunion before the Cornell game on Feb. 9.
A member of the team in 1970-71 (a “pine brother”, as he describes it), Lackner has since become an ardent supporter of the program and de-facto historian of sorts. Specifically integrating his interest and background in data/analytics, Lackner helped coordinate the trip to Albuquerque where Swegan was able to attend the 2012 tournament game while taking an active role in connecting the Harvard basketball community.
“I want to do more of that, because I can do it,” Lackner said. “I’ve got the data, skillset, experience and motivation. I can visualize and geo-code to help people know where the others are, and help them connect. Because it just means a lot...I love the term called friend-raising.”
Among one of Lackner’s projects is compiling a database of all student-athletes who ever played basketball in the Ivy League, something that Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris expressed interest in at the Harvard-Stanford game in Shanghai in November 2016. The database, updated through 2017, currently lists 4,541 men (starting in 1900) and 1,551 women (starting in 1921). Lackner looks forward to taking the next step with this information.
“There’s so many stories, so many interesting things that so many people have done in their lives,” Lackner added. “And there’s a lot of joy that they experience to share that with others.”
The history and people behind Harvard Basketball continues and many of these pieces are only beginning to come into picture, both past and present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March 27, 1999. Minneapolis, Minn. Tension permeated Mariucci Arena as the two best teams in women’s hockey — the No. 1 Harvard Crimson and the No. 2 UNH Wildcats — entered overtime, locked at five apiece. By the end of sudden death, a national champion would be crowned.
Facing that pressure-packed scenario, Harvard remained calm. The Crimson had entered the title game with 32 victories under its belt, including an overtime win against UNH one week earlier in the ECAC Championship. The battle-tested team knew what to do.
“In terms of that intermission [before overtime], going in, I think it was more a matter of ‘We’ve got this,’” said AJ Mleczko, Harvard co-captain, two-time Olympian for Team USA, 1998 gold-medalist, and current New York Islanders analyst for MSG Network. “We knew that we just had to spread them out and use our depth. We had so many good players on that team.”
Another one of those players was freshman phenom Jennifer Botterill, the ECAC and Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Botterill posted a prolific Olympic record of her own, representing Canada in four different Olympic Games and taking gold in three of them. She and Mleczko were fierce rivals in the 1998 Games but would join forces in the 1998-99 season as linemates, working with future Canadian Olympian Tammy Lee Shewchuk to compile astounding numbers in the process. Twenty years later, the Mleczko-Botterill duo remains intact — Botterill also works as an Islanders analyst for MSG.
“That line [Mlezcko, Botterill, Shewchuk] was one of the best lines in college hockey ever, and there’ve been a couple others since,” coach Katey Stone said. “What those kids were able to do together ... was huge. They weren’t all great friends all the time, but they knew that they were the right three to play together.”
Notably, both Mlezcko and Botterill would win the Patty Kazmaier Award, the highest accolade in women’s college hockey. Mleczko took home the 1999 hardware, and Botterill would add two of her own in 2001 and 2003.
In the crucible of overtime, Botterill would prove herself worthy of her many accolades. Collecting a pass from Mlezcko, Botterill cracked the tie with a clutch finish that marked her eighth game-winning goal of the year. Mlezcko would cap off her college career with the title-clinching feed — her 77th assist of the season. 
“One season, all of that happens, and the swing of pressure could’ve been heavy on those kids, but it wasn’t,” said Stone, recalling that moment when puck met net. “They couldn’t have been more excited, more proud.”
With the national championship, Harvard hockey had arrived and was here to stay. In subsequent years under Stone, the Crimson has continued to produce Patty Kazmaier winners, cultivate Olympians, and, as recently as 2015, appear in national championship games. That 1999 game-winner was the watershed moment.
“It was an incredibly unifying experience — going that deep into the playoffs, going 33-1,” Mlezcko said. “I think there were so many things we had done along the way. We won the Beanpot. Then we won the Ivy. Then we won the ECAC. And then we won the national championship. We were ticking off the list, but none of them were runaway victories. The Beanpot was overtime, the ECAC Championship was an overtime game, and then the national championship was an overtime game. There was a lot of unity that had to happen there.”
Behind the slew of nail-biting, sometimes improbable victories was Stone. In 1994, Stone, herself a UNH graduate, took the top spot for Harvard after an impressive record coaching high school hockey teams. During her first season in Cambridge, the Crimson went 12-11-2. The next three years would see Harvard finish under .500.
“Going into that year, Harvard had always been a building program,” Mlezcko said. “The big three that nobody could touch were UNH, Northeastern, and Providence College.”
Then came the 1998-99 season, and with it, unprecedented dominance. A November loss to Brown interrupted a fast start, but the Crimson would rally around the setback and never turn back.
“November 14th. I remember the day. Down at Brown, and we lost 4-2, and I really didn’t think we should’ve lost that game,” Stone said. “It was a wakeup call for us. We had been sort of off to an early cruise with that team, and then we went down to Brown, and they beat us. After that, there was a very different attitude in the locker room.”
Claudia Asano Barcomb, co-captain of the 1999 team and current director of athletics and girls’ varsity ice hockey coach at The Governor’s Academy in Newbury, Mass., underscored that, after the November Brown game, the team never wanted to experience the feeling of a loss again.
“[After the game,] AJ and I looked at each other, sort of aware, and just said, ‘Well, you know, we’ve got to prove ourselves,’” Asano Barcomb said. “We [didn’t] want this season to be, ‘Who did you lose to?’ We wanted it to be, ‘Who did you beat?’ … I remember us saying that this is our motivating day. We lost to a team we didn’t think we should have. So, it was a big day.”
That different attitude transformed an impressive roster, staffed with Olympians and Olympians-to-be, national team members, a number of determined players, and one of the best-ever offensive lines in college hockey, into a steamroller. After opening 3-1, the Crimson would win all 30 of its remaining games, including every available championship.
“We weren't without issues on our team,” Stone said. “We had Olympians, and kids that weren’t Olympians, and good college hockey players. It was always a balance, but at the end of the day, they did everything they could for each other, and that’s, I think, the single biggest reason why we won. They were very unselfish.”
Despite the all-but impeccable record, the season was no cakewalk. Junior goalie Crystal Springer broke her collarbone midway through the season, forcing rookie Alison Kuusisto into the net for a series of crucial regular season games, including the Beanpot.
“Winning the Beanpot the way we won it was telling to me that we were going to figure this out, we were going to make it happen,” Stone said. “We were down [in] the semifinal … and then were able to find a way.”
Springer returned in time for playoffs, leading Harvard to an ECAC championship and seeing the Crimson through to the semifinal game. Then, with under five minutes remaining and Harvard all but assured a ticket to the national title match, misfortune struck.
“Crystal Springer goes out to play this puck behind the net, routine play, and gets crushed by a Brown player, snaps it again, because your collarbone’s really not as strong after,” Stone said. “Less than 24 hours later, you had your backup goalie in a national championship game.”
The Crimson, though, was ready. Harvard had played the Wildcats three times earlier — twice in the regular season, and again in the ECAC Championship — and beat them each time. That initial win marked the first time a Crimson squad had ever bested UNH.
“Because it’s a storied program, it’s a benchmark from a coaching standpoint,” Stone said. “To be able to beat them twice in the regular season and then again in the ECAC playoffs, by that point, I was like, ‘You know what, we’re good. We’re good, and we can beat them any day.’”
The Crimson started off cold in Minnesota, trailing UNH from the outset before turning up the heat. By the start of the third, Harvard held a 4-3 advantage. Then, with 10:38 left in regulation, Harvard sophomore Angie Francisco buried a power play score to take a 5-3 lead and seemingly put the game away. The Wildcats, though, had fuel in the tank. At 5:19 remaining, UNH scored, and the equalizer came less than three minutes later.
“We were up 5-3, and we kind of got a little loose,” Stone said. “That was a gut check for our kids. I basically, at one point, said to them, ‘Can you guys do this? Let’s go.’ And then they just found a way.”
“We kept the puck in their defensive end,” Stone said. “Three or four times, it looked like they were going to clear the puck, and they didn’t. We kept it in, we kept it in, we kept it in — and the rest is history.”
The overtime, which lasted 8:01 before the victor was crowned, required relentless hustle and intense focus from all involved. In the end, though, it came down to a line of three Olympic gold medalists — the first triumvirate in college hockey history to combine for more than 300 points in one season — to bring it all home: a dish from Mleczko, a shot from Botterill, and a championship for Harvard.
“I think the proudest thing for me — and we just had a celebration of the ’99 team, and many of our players were able to come back — is just how connected they were, and how connected they still are,” Stone said. “And I just think that that’s a testament to their character and how much it meant to them.”
Not only did the national championship have major implications for the program — it also forged lasting relationships among players. The team remains tight, and communication is frequent.
“My closest friends are on that team, but our family expands beyond just the teammates I played with,” Asano Barcomb said. “We are a big family, Harvard hockey, the women’s side in particular. We pick each other up when we’re down, and we boost each other up when there’s a lot of success.”
The lessons learned from the national championship also carried implications that applied to future hockey careers and to life. Mleczko, already an Olympian, would be returning to Team USA for the 2002 Games. With the national championship under her belt and the leadership skills she learned while playing at Harvard, she had a renewed perspective.
“That year gave me a ton of confidence that I was able to carry back to Team USA,” Mlezcko said. “The confidence that I had handling the puck, the strength I gained, the conditioning, all that stuff…. Being a part of the Harvard hockey family is something that no one can take away.”

When we say balancing act, we’re not referring to how you’re doing “so well” taking five classes, doing three different consulting clubs, and only spending two nights a week in Lamont. We mean something far, far more impressive: the HUDS paper cup. Though you could of course use this little disposable (and eco-friendly) miracle for its intended purpose, it’s way more fun to think of all the ways to stuff as much as possible into it for every meal (if you can get past the judgemental stares of the HUDS staff and your fellow classmates).
Breakfast
After weeks of the same old plate full of eggs, mushy fruit, and cereal, why not try something new in a fun, disposable container? Just think of all the friends you’ll make in your 9:00 a.m. when you come in with armfuls of mid-class snacks!
If you’re looking for something sweet, we all know that pancakes are actually just a vehicle for syrup, so get a full cup of syrup and a pancake to go with it! Feeling more on the savory side? Here’s a cup we like to call the “deconstructed egg sandwich”: just use hash browns as a bread base and pile in the eggs and bacon plus seasonings of choice.
Lunch
We all know the struggle of trying find time to sit down and eat with the Harvard Time-less schedule, especially when we forget about our friends over at the hyphenated Fly-By. When your schedule just doesn’t seem to work out, the HUDS paper cup is there to help you speed through the lines before your next strangely-timed class.
On these chilly fall days, we like to at least pretend to be clever by filling up a heaping bowl of the best chili HUDS has to offer (personally I’m a white chicken fan). Just don’t forget to grab a piece of bread for dipping to really complete the “warm meal by a fireplace” vibes. Or if you’re feeling like an adventure into the salad bar, toss in your lettuce of choice, make it hearty with beans, chicken, or some other protein, and throw in all the toppings and dressing you can fit. You’ll never need to drop another $10 for a Sweetgreen salad again!
Dinner
Sometimes, we all need a little touch of class in our lives – candles and cloth napkins not included. Whether it’s a break from p-set grinding with friends or an evening with that special someone (we’re looking at you, d-hall crush!), a meal served exclusively in these little cups can be a welcome change from the typical HUDS green tray.
For those who want to get bougie af: simply load up your cup with rice, order a fried egg from the grill, whip up your sauce as you wait, and add veggies plus your sauce and egg to your rice for some high quality HUDS-style fried rice. And don’t forget dessert! Fill that cup to the brim with a nice swirl of ice cream, drizzle on plenty of chocolate syrup and whipped cream from the fridges, and if you’re feeling creative, add in whatever fruit they have to offer that day. (After all, if it has fruit it counts as healthy, right?)
In the end, we’re a firm believer that any meal can be greatly improved with a HUDS paper cup. Just make sure to grab some cutlery and napkins, and you’re all set for your paper cup meal!
