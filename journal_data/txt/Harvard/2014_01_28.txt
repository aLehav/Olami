"Mom is still alive, but she's going to be murdered at midnight on Good Friday." The opening line of bestselling author Isabel Allende's new novel, “Ripper,” is every bit as dramatic and gripping as the start of a murder mystery should be. Yet this is not your typical thriller. For Allende, known for her historical fiction and magical realism, crime fiction is unfamiliar territory. “Ripper” was intended to be a collaboration with her husband, crime writer William C. Gordon, but, according to Allende in the book's acknowledgements, “within twenty-four hours it was clear the project would end in divorce.” Allende took the idea and ran with it, and created a compelling novel, but it's clear that she creates her best work when she sticks to her typical genres.
 
Unlike many thrillers, “Ripper” is driven far more by character than by a perfectly crafted plot. Character development has long been one of Allende's greatest strengths, and the cast of “Ripper” certainly does not disappoint. She presents Indiana Jackson, a gorgeous natural healer with boundless reservoirs of generosity; her daughter, Amanda, a brilliant but spoiled high school senior obsessed with an online crime-solving game; and Amanda's father, Bob Martin, a former high school jock who now heads the homicide division of the San Francisco Police Department. Allende's characters are complex, intricately interconnected, and endowed with rich backstories. Even minor characters—the circle of misfit teenagers Amanda meets online to solve crimes, Amanda's strict Catholic grandmother who runs the family tortilla factory, the pot-smoking painter who lives on the roof of Indiana's clinic—are intriguing and well realized. Collectively, they are a bit too quirky to be quite realistic, even in a city as eclectic as San Francisco; Allende has chosen to trade a small amount of plausibility for the ability to explore a fascinating set of personalities.
 
Compelling as these characters are, they often threaten to overwhelm a somewhat lackluster plot. The novel's central events, a series of ritualistic murders and their investigation by both the SFPD and Amanda's circle of friends, are stranded in a sea of (admittedly interesting) backstory. Overall, Allende lacks the feel for suspense and pacing necessary for crime fiction—while the novel's last quarter is rife with tension, the preceding portion presents the killings and investigations casually, as just another curiosity in the characters’ intricate lives. The character drama sometimes lacks suspense as well, as Allende frequently drops details of their futures into the text—for instance, introducing a character as “Bradley, Amanda's future boyfriend.”
 
Beyond just the change in genre, Allende’s fans will notice stylistic differences between this and her previous works. “Ripper” is characterized by plain, literal language, a stark contrast to the lyricism of Allende's other works. This could be attributed in part to the translation from Spanish—often it seems that the word choice is more formal or technical than necessary—yet there does seem to be a broader stylistic shift, perhaps in an attempt to adopt a straightforward, investigative tone suited to a murder mystery. While initially unexpected, this new linguistic style is ultimately effective; Allende still manages to create extensive, beautifully detailed descriptions, and the plainer language helps to keep the story readable where it might outherwise have gotten bogged down in the characters’ ample backstories.
 
Despite its initial shortcomings, the plot of “Ripper” comes together in an exciting and well-executed ending, striking just the right balance of surprise—unexpected, but not outside of the realm of possibility. Attention to the massively complex web of characters begins to pay off as it becomes clear exactly how various initially disparate pieces of backstory fit together. Suspense builds as the clues finally begin to make sense and a rescue mission unfolds side by side with the killer's life story. The prevalent motifs of family, community, memory, injustice, abuse, and psychological trauma combine to form the vividly realized psyche of the killer.
 
It is ultimately Allende's ability to develop such unique and psychologically complex characters that drives “Ripper” forward; the carefully constructed personality of the killer gives meaning to the meandering investigation and character drama that comprise the majority of the book. It is fascination with the larger-than-life characters, rather than a traditionally suspenseful thriller plot, that makes the novel engaging. Likewise, a nuanced and perceptive treatment of inequality, injustice, and abuse, another of Allende's strengths, redeems the slight plot flaws. These assets save “Ripper” from being just another amateur crime novel, yet it is not appealing for the attributes that typically make good crime fiction. While “Ripper” is an enjoyable read and a generally successful novel, it is also an experiment with mystery writing—one that suggests Allende's prodigious talents are most effectively used in the genres with which she is most familiar.

Riding on the tail of the decade’s wave of dream pop bands, chamber pop group Gem Club, composed of vocalists Christopher Barnes and Ieva Berberian and cellist Kristen Drymala, released its debut LP, “Breakers,” in September of 2011. Much like its debut, the Boston band’s sophomore effort, “In Roses,” is perhaps best described as hipsterdom’s take on easy listening—while pleasant enough to the ear, the album is plagued by a lack of emotional variation that quickly relegates it to the realm of the uninspired.
 
At first listen, “In Roses” impresses, seemingly the perfect soundtrack for a snowy winter’s day. The soothing “[Nowhere]” consists of a flood of hazy synths that overlap but manage to avoid discord, while “Michael” contains glimmers of glockenspiel that brighten the drone of the underlying vibrato-less cello line. Each track is simultaneously lush and delicate—but there lies much of the album’s weakness, as continuity teeters on the edge of monotony.
 
The details of each song on “In Roses” vary, but the structure of each is largely the same: creep in, swell, fade out. “Hypericum,” “Marathon (In Roses),” and “Polly” all begin with the same broken chord motif, and most tracks start quietly with a single instrument before building to a climax through the introduction of additional voices and instruments, and subsequently drifting to a close as voices and instruments fall silent one by one. The impression the listener receives is one of sameness; several songs in, there is nothing jarring or even surprising about “In Roses,” an observation that unfortunately holds true for the majority of the album’s 50 minutes.
 
It is difficult not to draw comparisons between Gem Club and its better-known counterparts: Barnes’ whispery, emotion-laden falsetto is a cross between those of Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke. But where Vernon makes up for the unvarying nature of his vocals with intricate instrumental arrangements and Yorke compensates for sometimes simple instrumentals with raw, tortured melodies and lyrical wit, Barnes falls short on all counts: his voice is meek, his arrangements basic, and his lyrics rendered incomprehensible by his mumbled delivery. It soon becomes apparent that what is missing in the ultimately ordinary “In Roses” is the existence of a crucial element that elevates Bon Iver and Radiohead to the extraordinary.
 
The band is not without promise, however—“In Roses” contains redeeming flashes of brilliance that shine through the tedium of the rest of the album. “Idea for Strings” opens and is interspersed with the wordless shifting harmonies of a choir, a welcome respite from Barnes’ repetitive vocals. In a rare powerful moment, the second half of “Soft Season” features a desolate passage in which the strings rise to a howl, evoking images of the wind gusting over the barren arctic tundra. The album reaches its peak in “QY2,” which begins with sustained vocals that alternate between dissonant second intervals and a single note; the song’s harmonies never quite settle into something comfortable to listen to, but for Gem Club, this sense of discomfort is one of their sole instances of musical innovation and thus the high point of “In Roses.”
 What Gem Club lacks, then, is not talent but musical maturity. For all its instances of inspiration, “In Roses” as a whole comes across as indie Muzak, falling easily into the realm of the mediocre. Much may lie in store for the young trio, but Barnes, Berberian, and Drymala must first learn to translate their emotions into song before they can realize their full potential.

Sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint the Dum Dum Girls. For instance, when newcomers to the band see the quartet’s bloody red lipstick and sky-high, fish-netted legs, they may be surprised to hear that the group has drawn comparisons to Best Coast and the Vivian Girls. Even fans who have been listening to the band longer may approach their latest effort, “Too True”, with a little uncertainty. After all, the L.A. outfit has served up two very different sonic dishes since their 2010 debut. Their first, “I Will Be,” was a sweet and edgy hit of youthful love songs. However, their next, “Only In Dreams,” was written following the death of lead singer/songwriter Dee Dee Penny’s mother. The result was a brooding concoction of tortured tracks bubbling over the flame of garage band grit. Which Dum Dum Girls show up on “Too True”?
 
From the opening words of the album, it appears to be the former. With lyrics like “We touched beneath our skin / right down to the bare wires”, it sounds like “Too True” might ascend to the adolescent heights of the love songs on “I Will Be”. But suddenly Dee Dee hurls a studded, black-leather-gripped wrench into the listeners’ expectations, sinisterly proclaiming that she belongs to “the cult of love.” Eerily tinkling synths surround ghostly backing vocals in what opens up to be a sublime smack of opulent yet lo-fi gothic rock.
 
The rest of the album proves that the grungier subject matter isn’t an anomaly. If “Evil Blooms” sounds like something out of a dreamy punk rocker’s diary (“Evil blooms just like a flower / the world stares down from her high tower”) that’s because it is. Even though “Too True” doesn’t always sound like a punk album, the feeling persists that that’s where Dee Dee was trying to push it. Among the record’s inspirations, she cites “the punk poets Patti Smith and Lou Reed (who, like many, I consider to be my spiritual parents).” She even recorded pieces of the record in true DIY punk fashion—utilizing a makeshift recording studio in her bedroom. As a result of Dee Dee’s efforts, “Too True” ends up following closer in the dreamy and disturbed footsteps of “Only In Dreams,” if not always musically, then definitely lyrically.
 
Dee Dee’s impressive knack for lyrics brings “Too True” together. Even songs that feel sonically distanced from the album’s rockier trend are masterfully tied back by her pen. This is the case with “Are You Okay?,” a moody, pop-rock track that sounds as if it could’ve been lifted from Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours.” It’s a feat that really does exemplify her punk spirit, and it helps the band evade the “60’s girl band revival” category that they so loathe (would The Ronettes ever chirp, “My face is numb / I know just what I’m doing, but what is this I’m pursuing?”). Though “Trouble is My Name” may sound like a soft rock ballad that harks back to the band’s googly-eyed origins, Penny’s lyrics flip the script. Entertaining the adolescent sound only to sinisterly subvert it, she states like a creepy horror movie child, “Trouble is my name. Is it your name too?”
 
The album’s highest moments, however, are products of both incisive lyrics and grungy atmosphere. That’s exactly what happens on “Lost Boys and Girls Club,” the peak of the band’s post-punk garage groove. There’s something utterly cathartic about hearing Penny purr, “Your eyes are black X’s of hate and of hexes” as shredding electric guitars and abundant cymbals misbehave in the background. Similar is “Rimbaud Eyes,” a track that name-drops 19th century poet Arthur Rimbaud. The song feels like a manifesto, partially because Penny means the title phrase to be a compliment. This is despite—and definitely because of—the fact that the man was a drunken libertine who died young after living a life that shunned moral conventions. If that isn’t punk, what is?
 
Since their 2008 debut, the Dum Dum Girls have been walking a tightrope, balancing a stock of influences comprised equally of ’60s Ronettes pop and ’80s garage rock. “Too True” sees them largely favoring the bombastic guitar riffs and blaring synths of a post-punk revival band, but not by totally discarding their melodious girl-group origins. The result is an album that does feel inspired, but also slightly confused. When the songs aren’t really good, they’re still alright (see “Under These Hands” and “Little Minx”), but the next time Dee Dee Penny channels her spirit mother, Patti Smith, it might be a good idea to ask her to stick around just a little longer.

When President Obama delivers his sixth State of the Union address tonight, he is likely to strike an optimistic chord and highlight the strength of the union. 
He’ll do so at a time when American society is increasingly fractured along class lines and the income inequality gap continues to grow. Wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few—income concentration has returned to 1920s levels and the United States ismore unequal than even the notoriously corrupt Nigeria.
The troubling trend has only been worsened by the financial recession, with the top 1 percent of Americans realizing 95 percent of the income gains since the recovery. Their incomes shot up by 31.4 percent between 2009 and 2012, while the incomes for the other 99 percent of Americans stagnated.
Reducing income inequality should be the president’s foremost priority. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it is also vital for economic growth. The post-World War II boom in America was also the time of greatest income equity. That has deteriorated sharply since the ’70s, when worker productivity increases began to seriously outpace compensation increases.
Reversing income inequality can begin by increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from its current woefully low $7.25 an hour. Had the minimum wage kept up with inflation since its peak in real value in 1968, it would currently be worth $10.56. The raise would increase the wages of 30 million Americans, especially underpaid workers who would be empowered to come off government assistance. 
A bill sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa would do just that and might stand a higher chance of passage than some of the president’s other priorities like the environment or gay rights. Republicans, wary of seeming too callous in an election year, are softening their opposition to the popular measure.
In the same vein as newly elected New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s promise of universal preschool education, the president should seriously work to ensure that every American child has access to early childhood education.
Expanding the earned-income tax credit, one of most effective tools for fighting poverty, is another goal that progressives and conservatives alike ought to get behind.
But perhaps the greatest casualty of the income inequality problem is intergenerational income mobility, an essential ingredient of the American Dream. Economists have observed a clear, negative correlation between income inequality and intergenerational social mobility in what some dub the Great Gatsby Curve. Unsurprisingly, America is both exceptionally unequal and has exceptionally low social mobility.
As Alexis de Tocqueville noted in his careful study “Democracy in America”: Of all the unique characteristics of America, “none struck my eye more vividly than the equality of conditions…it gives a certain direction to public spirit, a certain turn to the laws, new maxims to those who govern, and particular habits to the governed.” That kind of equality is the legacy for which Obama should strive.

I am proud to say the only substantial accomplishment I’ve achieved this break has been finishing the entire series of “Desperate Housewives” (there are eight seasons if that helps put things into perspective.)
Unlike most of my Harvard peers, when I told people that my plans for break included a strict diet of Cherry Garcia FroYo and Netflix on autoplay, I actually meant it. 
Instead of doing a winter session program, filling out applications, responding to emails, or checking my grades, I decided to take a more Buddha-approved approach to winter break (a.k.a. watching whatever my oh-so-thoughtful Netflix account recommended to me until my eyes blurred over.) 
For those of you grimacing at the possibility of such blatant unproductivity, it’s time to consider some serious life changes. 
Obviously, watching countless hours of TV isn’t for everyone—it takes a lot of hard work and will power combined with a very specific set of priorities. You must value time with fictional characters more than with your friends and family, whom you haven’t seen in months (an easily met qualification—TV characters are so much more interesting than real people), and have the strength to fight all urges to stretch and take breaks when your lower half goes numb or you feel that your bladder might explode due to excessive consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (the only true companion a Netflix-er has in her stoic yet solitary lifestyle.) 
But for those who may doubt their resilience under such high-intensity conditions, do not fret; there are other options. Novice alternatives include yoga, meditation, watching bamboo grow, or sitting in a dark room staring at a Jerry Garcia poster. The takeaway from my lifestyle choices this winter break is that I was entirely unproductive (at least in the Harvardian sense of the word). I actively spent the last month of my life doing a whole lot of nothing, and, in all seriousness, it was the smartest decision I made all semester. 
Harvard is, from the day you enter its gates, a cult of productivity. I realized the “easing-in” technique was an illegitimate college approach at Harvard as soon as the first activity fair rolled around—I discovered that people were signing up at every stand, not to con their way into more free Reese’s Pieces (as had been my intention), but because they genuinely planned on doing everything. 
We may not inflict mandatory competition via grade deflation as some of our peer institutions (shout-out to Princeton and UChicago readers: No one cares that you’re more miserable than us), but that sure doesn’t stop us from being competitive. Everyone is in constant motion, terrified that to stop and take a breath means slipping down the rabbit hole. But would it be that bad to let oneself slip into a parallel universe—a wonderland of nothingness? 
This past semester, I tried to correct my seemingly naive freshmen decision to pursue Reese’s rather than activities by piling on more jobs and extracurriculars. But instead of finding passion and a sense of success, all the extra busyness did was provide me with more money to spend on candy and an added sense of confusion and haziness. I effectively eliminated my “me-time” and, with it, any opportunity to think about things outside my immediate Harvard bubble. Even sleeping made me anxious. I parted with the pointless shenanigans that used to top my list of priorities, and, with it, parted with my sense of “me.” 
This break, I remembered what it was like to relax. I began doing pointless, unproductive things again, things that made me happy. Besides binge watching TV series (my first and foremost priority), I allowed myself to space out without feeling anxious, started doing yoga again, and even left my house a few times to share my bubble of unproductivity with the people I love. 
I relearned how to do nothing. 
I’m sure I have plenty of angry emails needing to be addressed, application deadlines quickly approaching or even missed, grades that probably should’ve been dealt with long ago, but no matter how many problems I have waiting for me when I finally decide to re-enter the “real” world, I do not regret my time of nothingness one bit. 
We need time to ourselves, time to think in order to reach any sort of clarity. Enveloped by nothingness, I could think about what made me me—what I was passionate about, what activities and classes I really should be involved with, and which ones I was just doing to make me feel adequate in a world of unearthly overachievers. 
If you’ve started to forget what you ate for breakfast or can’t remember the last time you changed your shirt or washed your hair, it might be time to give yourself a break. Be spontaneous, go do something that will waste the next six hours of your life with no foreseeable benefits, and don't think about the repercussions. It could be going to one of the weird events you get on our house-list, walking to Target with your roommates, or just sitting by the river until your face goes numb. 
Or maybe it’s watching six back-to-back episodes of Desperate Housewives.

It surprises me how much easier it is to tell someone that you are depressed than to say that you are lonely at Harvard.
 
Neither is simple, both coming with their own vulnerabilities and social costs. However, efforts to destigmatize and encourage open conversations about depression have made great strides in molding how the average Harvard student views the condition. Depression is a recognized psychiatric illness with a biological basis with which the public can identify and sympathize. Society could still benefit from more awareness about depression, but at the very least liberal-minded, sympathetic populations generally understand that the depressed are victims rather than makers of their misfortune.
 
On the other hand, you cannot say that you are lonely without feeling that it is largely your own fault. Although loneliness is admittedly less severe an affliction than depression, social isolation does not benefit from the same sympathetic perspective of victimhood. Feelings of alienation are not by themselves a mental illness, cannot yet be attributed to brain chemistry, and receive relatively little attention in the mental health discussion here at Harvard.
 
As a result, loneliness is often perceived not as a misfortunate circumstance, but rather a social dysfunction of one’s own invention. There is an understood but unspoken assumption that if you are lonely, then you must be unlikeable or socially maladapted. Insidious logic dictates that people who are likeable can make friends and people who can make friends are not lonely. Unlike depression, loneliness is a reflection of your fundamental character and affability. There is no pride to be salvaged in loneliness.
 
Harvard is an especially difficult place to talk about feeling socially unfulfilled, because Harvard is the one place where we feel we have no right to be isolated. Surrounded by an unprecedented amount of common interests, diversity, and warm welcomes, we are inundated with opportunities for companionship. By the end of freshman fall, many students are already gushing about how they have never felt so well connected before Harvard. If you cannot bond at Harvard, it follows, you must not be able to bond anywhere.
 
Therefore, to say that you are lonely is to risk being painfully judged in a community where loneliness is rarely raised as an issue. You can maintain your self-respect in admitting that you are stressed about your work or that you are angry about a friend’s behavior. But to say that you are lonely is to reveal that you are unable to accomplish what Harvard is structured to make easy: connection.
 
What we often fail to realize is that feelings of alienation are not a reflection of social aptitude or dysfunction. The word “loneliness” evokes images of the sorrowful student sitting alone in the corner of the dining hall without friends. At Harvard, loneliness is never this obvious. Often, bouts of loneliness are found in affable individuals with active social lives. Despite the vast number of superficial connections each of us maintains on a daily basis, truly satisfying relationships are incredibly difficult to achieve. Even the very people who seem to thrive can suffer from a lack of a deep, nourishing bond with another human being.
 
Loneliness and solitude are different things. How else can we explain the feeling that, even after a whirlwind of socializing here at Harvard, we still can experience the dread that maybe no one truly understands us? Maybe, we think, our friendships are not as deep as we would like. Maybe we are still searching for people who see the world as we do. Maybe we talk and drink and party but nothing anesthetizes the awful feeling of being encaged in our own minds. Anyone who has felt this isolation knows how debilitating it can be.
 
Because we are afraid to be honest, the self-therapy for loneliness becomes what Harvard students do best: busyness. In “The Lonely American: Drifting Apart in the 21st Century,” Jacqueline Olds and Richard Schwartz make a plausible argument for the correlation between loneliness and busyness in modern America. They argue that, because people feel unable to confide in others, Americans seek therapy for loneliness instead in superhero activities—marrying themselves to work and taking on more projects than they can handle. Emptiness becomes anathema. Booked schedules offer a sense of fullness while leaving no time for needing people.
 
My own confessions of loneliness are often met with surprise. I wish it did not have to be such a shock. I wish that we did not have to be taken aback that smiles can speak the language of isolation as much as tears. I wish that loneliness did not have to be a secret to whisper behind closed doors for fear of losing the image of the perfect socialite-slash-conversationalist that we love here at Harvard.
 
But for now, when alienation strikes, I bury myself in the frenetic scramble to drive the emptiness away. Rather than expose my loneliness, it is much easier to be a superman, to take an extra class and join another student group for fear of white spaces in my schedule, so that at the end of the day, when someone asks me why I seem down, I do not have to lie when I say, “A lot of work. The usual.”
 
What I would rather say is this: “I feel lonely sometimes. Do you?”

“Look, I taped his mouth shut so he can’t bite you. You can hold it any way you want as long as you don’t drop it.” The zookeeper at Sawgrass Recreation Park in Everglades, Florida, then very callously proceeded to demonstrate the various ways one could hold a baby alligator.
 
Having worked at a zoo that emphasized careful, limited contact with animals and would never allow a non-trained professional to handle an animal, I openly gaped at him.
 
“But what if you hold him improperly and hurt him?”
 
He conveniently ignored my inquiry, while the other visitors seemed to be more concerned about getting bitten than about the wellbeing of the captive alligator.
 
Many humans seem to have a dichotomist approach towards animals: Because many humans do not understand animal behavior, they tend to anthropomorphize certain species, cooing at their adorable appearances, and write off others as dangerous killers, perhaps influenced by films such as Jaws and Anaconda. Both approaches may have negative consequences. The first may lead to a failure to domesticate a wild animal, resulting in injury to both owner and “pet,” and the second can result in the hunting of a species to the point of endangerment.
 
Sensationalist stories on endangerment and pet injuries are often seen in the news, but the widespread lack of knowledge regarding animals also has more subtle implications, such as the mistreatment of animals in the wild or captivity. For example, there is much controversy about the ethical standing of zoos: Captive Animals’ Protection Society lists ten reasons why the goals and the execution of zoos do not justify imprisoning animals. The question of whether zoological institutions are morally permissible aside, however, animal handlers, especially those who interact with the public through demonstrations, have an obligation to emphasize proper conduct towards animals as well as to dispel myths, not exacerbate them.
 
However, it would be wrong to only focus on formal zoological institutions.  In order to most effectively advance the relationship between humans and animals all humans must attempt to interpret animal behavior outside the scope of human behavioral patterns.
 
Every year, there are incidences of curious people looking for unconventional pets, pets that unfortunately end up being not quite what the excited pet owners were expecting. This takes place not only when humans adopt ferocious alligators or tigers, but also when they take home seemingly innocuous lorises and baby chimpanzees.
 
People tend to forget that, although many wild animals may boast harmless appearances, some animals were not bred to be pets. Humans tend to anthropomorphize animals because it helps them make sense of behavior comparing it to certain needs and actions of a human. Oftentimes, however, it is impossible look at animal actions through a human lens, leading to problematic misinterpretations.
 
On the flip side, when dealing with dangerous species, the motto “better safe than sorry” comes to mind. But, due to movies and social media, humans may have more than an unhealthy fear of certain animals. While it is advisable to be wary of dangerous species, sometimes caution verges on irrational fear. For example, according to many wildlife sources, snakes generally will not attack humans unless provoked. Yet according to a poll conducted in 2013, the snake is Americans’ most feared animal. When our fear is unfounded, the health of the animal in question can become compromised. If humans resort to hunting species they find frightening, endangerment is a possibility as well.
 
It is hard to determine how we should perceive any given animal because verbal feedback is virtually impossible. But it is necessary to keep in mind that animals exist outside the mythical pet-killer binary and to be respectful of the fact that animals do not follow human behavioral patterns. Only with this mindset can humans fully appreciate and understand the importance of proper handling and interaction with animals, both in the home and on trips to the zoo.

The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research announced Monday 16 W.E.B. Du Bois fellows for the 2013-2014 academic year, including a Nobel Prize-winning author and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.
This semester, six new fellows will join five others who have been in residence with the program since the beginning of the fall term. Five more fellows completed their residencies last semester.
The W.E.B. Du Bois Institute normally announces the fellows at the beginning of the academic year, but waited until its absorption by the newly established Hutchins Center was completed.
“We are delighted to welcome one of our most prestigious, exciting, and diverse classes of Fellows of the W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute,” Hutchings Center Director Henry Louis Gates Jr. said in a press release.
Since its creation in September, the Hutchins Center has served as the umbrella organization for roughly a dozen programs and initiatives in African and African-American studies at Harvard.
Of the 16 fellows, six will be starting fellowships this semester: David Bindman, Holly Ellis, Shose Kessi, Christopher J. Lee, Deborah Willis, and George Wilson. These six join five scholars who will continue their time at the Du Bois Institute from last semester, including Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka.
These fellows are the first class since the Institute was officially absorbed by the Hutchins Center in early October, a move which financially united seven existing initiatives with a $15 million gift from Glenn H. Hutchins '77, one of the University's most prolific donors and a co-chair of the Harvard Campaign. Nevertheless, the fellows program remains unchanged, according to Hutchins Center fellows officer Krishna Lewis.
Fellows—who are mostly professors and students—are given access to a wide range of Harvard’s resources to support their own research during the duration of the fellowship. They also participate in a variety of colloquia, lectures, discussions, and workshops focusing on African and African-American studies.
“It's a true honor to be invited to take time to use this opportunity to create additional scholarship to my work,” said Willis, a leading historian on African-American photography who teaches at New York University. “The number of scholars that they have around and the resources that are a part of the Institute really help those of us who need access to images or more time for [our] work.”
Kessi, a lecturer and psychologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, joins the fellowship for the spring semester and will further her research on the effects of affirmative action, which has transformed the previously all-white University of Cape Town.
“There’s been a lot of research done on the African-American experience [in the American university system],” she said, adding that she hopes this work might help her develop her own academic endeavors.
Kessi also noted that she was looking forward to learning from and engaging with the other fellows.
Bindman, who has been a part of the Du Bois Fellowship six times before, also commented on the fellowship experience and noted that “there’s a real sense of community here. One of the best things about it is having other fellows in residence to work with.”
Lewis said that she hopes Monday’s announcement clears up confusion about the program after the institute’s structural changes.
“We usually send out these announcements at the beginning of the academic year, but we were in a bit of a quandary at the beginning of this year because we knew we were making this transition,” said Lewis, adding that “there has been this confusion about what happened to the Du Bois fellows.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Academic Integrity Committee has approved for student feedback a draft of what could prove to be Harvard’s first-ever honor code, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Faculty Council will discuss the issue at its upcoming meeting Wednesday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris confirmed Monday.
Writing in an email, Harris added that he expects the honor code will then be discussed at the first monthly Faculty meeting of the semester on Feb. 4. The “target” date for the implementation of the honor code is fall 2015, Harris later wrote, adding that there was “too much to put in place” to implement it in 2014.
The full Faculty’s Feb. 4 discussion would come roughly 10 months after the Academic Integrity Committee first proposed a five-point honor code last April, and several months after a smaller subcommittee began drafting the code’s language in the fall.
The Academic Integrity Committee’s April proposal called for, among other points, the creation of a judicial board, populated by both students and faculty and distinct from the Administrative Board, that would hear cases of academic dishonesty. It also proposed that students be required to sign a “declaration of integrity” on major assignments and exams.
Academic Integrity Committee and drafting committee member Terah E. Lyons ’14 said, and Harris confirmed, that the completed draft of the honor code contains three main “tenets” of last April’s proposal—the honor code’s actual language, the integrity statement, and a judicial board, now called an “honor board,” populated by students and faculty.
 
The Academic Integrity Committee will hold a series of meetings across campus over the next week to solicit student feedback on the honor code. The first meeting, one of four scheduled, is slated to take place Tuesday night in the Adams House Conservatory.
 
“We really want everyone to be honest,” said Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a member of the Academic Integrity Committee and the Undergraduate Council vice president. “That’s the whole point...of an ‘honor code,’ for everyone to be very open and candid about what they think.”
In addition, Goffard said that he expects that the UC will vote on the honor code in the next “couple of weeks,” calling that vote “crucial.”
 
One of the upcoming student feedback meetings will take place in the House that another top College administrator calls home. Cabot House Co-Master Rakesh Khurana, who last week was named the next permanent Dean of the College, sits on the full Academic Integrity Committee and is also a member of the smaller committee that drafted the recently-completed code.
Though the Academic Integrity Committee was first convened in 2010, to some, the committee’s efforts took on greater meaning in the aftermath of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest cheating case in recent memory. Administrators announced at the beginning of the fall 2012 semester that the Ad Board was investigating roughly 125 students for possible plagiarism or inappropriate collaboration on a take-home exam. Ultimately, roughly 70 students were required to temporarily withdraw from the College in connection with the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scheduling mistakes forced some students to crowd into classrooms and press against doors on Monday, the first day of shopping period.
Some classes were booked for the same classroom at the same time Monday. Discrepancies also arose between the websites of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Registrar, sowing confusion among students, as the spring 2014 semester got underway.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning, Philosophy 34: “Existentialism in Literature and Film” and History 1878: “Ottoman State and Society” were both assigned to the same Emerson Hall room at 11 a.m. Monday. 
“We have learned late this afternoon that there were, in fact, two courses that were inadvertently booked for the same classroom today,” Manning wrote in an email. “At this time, we are not aware of any other double booked courses.”
The conflict was temporarily resolved when the history class moved into a lecture room next door, said Sean D. Kelly, chair of the Philosophy Department.
The Registrar has not yet found a permanent solution for when the courses should meet on Wednesday, Manning said, but it is working with Harvard University Information Technology services to resolve the issue before the semester gets well underway.
As well as double booking classes, the Registrar also listed meeting times and locations of some classes differently than it did on Harvard iSites, a server that compiles course websites.
Two lecture courses that tend to attract many students—English 178x: “The American Novel: Dreiser to the Present” and Economics 1123: “Introduction to Econometrics”—met in an overcrowded Sever 113 at 10 a.m..
 
“I was walking along with a friend who is not interested at all in English, and I’m not interested at all in economics,” said Al Fernandez ’17, who shopped English 178x. “Then we walked into the same classroom, and he was like, ‘You’re wrong,’ and I was like, ‘No, you’re wrong.’”
 
According to the Registrar, Econ 1123 was supposed to meet in Harvard Hall at 10 a.m..
“The course location information on the iSite of any course that was held in the fall and which carries on into the spring term potentially may not have been updated by today,” Manning wrote.
Other courses, however, were overcrowded due to unexpected student interest, not technical discrepancies.
 
Kimberlyn Leary, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, who teaches Sociology 169: “Negotiation and Conflict Transformation for Policy and Practice,” said that although she taught her first class in a large room, almost every seat was occupied and students had to find space along the walls in the back of the room.
“I think everybody knows because it was posted that there’s a cap on the enrollment that 50 students will be able to take the class,” Leary said, adding that she plans to use a non-preferential course lottery to determine which students will be able to take her class.
“Unfortunately I’m going to have to keep it at 50 because we do so much interactive work, and it’s already tight in the room we have.”
Leary, who said her course was popular during shopping week last spring as well, added that she is excited and pleased about the number of students who expressed interest in her course.
 “It’s pretty fun for professors too at the beginning of the semester,” Leary said.

Israeli Major General Yaakov Amidror highlighted the strategic importance of Israel at a Harvard Hillel talk Monday night.
 
“There is only one anchor of stability in the Middle East and that is Israel,” said Amidror, who recently stepped away from his position as head of the Israeli National Security Council. “It is the only state [in the region] with a very strong democracy.”
Amidror responded vehemently against allegations that Israel commits human rights offenses.
“Not one of the human rights experts at Harvard are responsible for the lives of citizens anywhere in the world—when you come to real life, it’s much more complicated,” Amidror said.
He also defended the Israeli Defense Forces’ practice of forcibly entering the homes of Palestinians for counter-terrorism purposes.
“We saved 15,000 lives of Israelis,” Amidror said. “The Palestinians are suffering...from us going into their beds, homes...to prevent suicide bombings.”
Amidror supported Israel’s high level of defense spending in light of numerous threats in the Middle East. He was quick to defend Israel’s military capacity against the potential threat of nearby Iran.
“We can do less than America—we are not a superpower—but we can do good enough,” he said.
According to Amidror, Israel historically spent nearly 20 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, but has recently cut back to a little over six percent—still more than the United States and Europe.
He also praised the strength of the relationship between Israel and the United States, calling the Obama administration “the best we’ve had since 1967.”
Amidror noted that Israel, with the help of American aid, successfully tested the Arrow III missile shield this month, which could greatly increase Israel’s ability to defend itself against missile attacks.
Students expressed a variety of opinions on the event.
“He didn’t say anything shockingly new—he repeated the general establishment opinion about Iran,” said Aaron Magid, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “I thought it was interesting that he said that America and Israel’s cooperation with military intelligence is the strongest it's ever been under Obama.”
Joshua S. Chmara ‘15 offered a slightly different reaction to the talk.
“I thought it was really interesting,” he said. “We need more people to come who support Israel and just have a better understanding of the facts and just what’s twisted by the media.”

The edX platform expanded to include a paid course targeted at professionals on Wednesday when the World Economic Forum announced that it would join the online learning initiative to offer a class this spring. Just a day later, Dartmouth launched its own edX collaboration to provide free enrollment to online courses in the fall.
 
The Forum, a Swiss non-profit organization that holds an annual conference on global economic policy, will launch its first course, “Global Technology Leadership” in May through an online platform entitled “Forum Academy.”
 
While the majority of edX partners are universities reaching out to a wide variety of students with free online courses, the executive director of the Forum wrote in a press release that the new initiative seeks to enroll professionals in “leadership development” classes that will give them the opportunity to “constantly update their knowledge.”
 
According to the organization’s website, Forum Academy will charge users registration and certification fees to enroll.
 
Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX, said that he sees the expansion of edX to an institution that is not a traditional university as an opportunity to attract new types of users to the platform.
 
“The partnership with the [World Economic Forum] underscores that learning takes many forms and there are many audiences for learning,” Lue said. “In light of the progress we have made in the edX platform and the edX consortium, having built something that is continuing to evolve and will serve a wider swath of audiences is a really good thing.”
 
On Thursday, Dartmouth announced its own partnership with edX, becoming the 31st university to join the platform since it was started by Harvard and MIT more than a year ago. The university will offer its first open online course this fall, although it does not plan to charge enrollment fees.
 
“The reason Dartmouth is getting into [edX] is clearly not as a money-making kind of thing,” said Joshua Kim, the director of digital learning initiatives at Dartmouth. Kim added that the chief goal of the online platform is to gather large amounts of data that could potentially improve teaching and learning on Dartmouth’s campus. 
 
“This whole online learning initiative at Dartmouth is part of our much larger effort to invest in our learning and invest in our faculty and leverage technology,” Kim said.
Lue noted that Harvard also plans to use data from edX to fine tune education for its tuition-paying students.
 
“We are very much committed to a recirculation of benefits to students on campus. That is a founding principle of edX, with DartmouthX as well,” Lue said, adding that Forum Academy uses a different model because it is not a traditional university. “For the [Forum], in my opinion, it is more about the ability to broaden access to a much larger audience.”
 
Dartmouth and the Forum joined the platform just days after HarvardX announced that it will offer a paid version of the online course “CS50x” this semester that includes online office hours with the course instructor, David J. Malan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2013, at 3:21 a.m.
The Cambridge City Council hopes to create a space dedicated to the mentorship, apprenticeship, and scholarship of individuals in the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics—or STEAM—disciplines.
The initiative, proposed Monday evening at a City Council meeting, would convert the Foundry Building, located in East Cambridge, into a STEAM facility, pending further approval and investigation. 
Cambridge residents ranging from dancers to artists to professors backed the resolution that would make the site a community center for education and the meeting place for several local non-profit groups. The cost of the upgrade is approximately $11 million.
Many residents felt strongly that the education and training in technology and engineering would help younger generations of Cambridge residents be more competitive in the job market.
“The better we are at engineering, the better we will be at innovating,” said Cambridge resident Sue Butler, who supports the initiative. 
For others, the new STEAM facility could provide opportunities for youth who have fewer educational resources.
“Our resources can help level the playing field,” said Joseph Elder, a lifelong Cambridge resident and father of three, who believes the facility could provide extracurricular opportunities. 
Other residents were pleased with the proposal’s focus on the “arts” element of STEAM.
Junot Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and a creative writing professor at MIT, spoke in support of the proposed facility, noting that the city’s STEAM community is widely dispersed. 
 
“We’ve long needed this institution,” Díaz said. “Having a place that focalizes, but also creates an important structure…would be important for the future of Cambridge.”
The proposed center would not only be intended for children. Many hoped that the facility would be available to individuals of any age and would serve as a meeting place for those interested in learning and teaching.
One resident did offer arguments against the renovation of the space, questioning whether the city should take on the entire financial burden of the project. 
“This building is really not for me. It is impossible for me to reach [it] through public transport,” said James Williamson, who also pointed out that the location of the building might be inconvenient for other residents.
However, the overwhelming public support for the proposal was tempered by the practical and logistical concerns brought up by the city staff and Council members.
In particular, City Manager Richard C. Rossi noted that the financing estimate of $11 million only includes costs related to bring the building up to code like handicap access, roofing, and plumbing. If the building is to be equipped for use as a STEAM facility, the costs would be much higher.
"If the city is going to pay for it all...then that's a 25-or-more-million-dollar expenditure that shows nowhere in our capital plan," Rossi said.
Finding a way to finance the upgrade poses another challenge, especially since there are several pending projects that have been promised funding. Councillor E. Denise Simmons reminded the assembly that the City Council has already committed to renovating three local schools, but has not been able to fulfill that obligation.
The Foundry building was built in 1895 as part of the George F. Blake Manufacturing Company. Since then, the building has been renovated several times and most recently served as home to numerous Kendall Square startups.
The Foundry was purchased by the city, with the stipulation that at least a portion of the building be designated for community use.

A working paper by two Harvard Business School professors published earlier this month, which found that black hosts on the online rental marketplace Airbnb list their properties for approximately 12 percent less than non-black hosts, has sparked discussion about the presence of racial discrimination in online marketplaces.
 
The study, entitled “Digital Discrimination: The Case of Airbnb.com,” was released in the middle of January by associate professor Benjamin G. Edelman ’02 and assistant professor Michael Luca. After collecting data regarding the price, location, and quality of each of Airbnb’s New York City listings—as well as certain characteristics, including race, of each listing’s host—the authors found that black hosts earn about $17 less than non-black hosts per night, for listings of similar qualities.
 
Airbnb, which supplies over half a million property listings to renters looking for short-term accommodations in a variety of locations across the world, has grown to a valuation of more than $2.5 billion since its founding in 2008. The site requires hosts to post public profiles—including profile pictures and first names—and places this information alongside property information for a given listing.
 
In a public statement regarding the study, Airbnb reaffirmed their commitment to a transparent community in which discrimination is prohibited. The statement also offered several criticisms of Edelman and Luca’s methodology, claiming that the year-and-a-half-old data used in the study was antiquated and that the paper focused only on listings in New York City.
 
“[Edelman and Luca] made a number of subjective or inaccurate determinations when compiling their findings,” the release stated.
 
Because the Airbnb site does not provide information about demand for a given listing, Edelman and Luca were only able to consider asking price in their analysis of demand for a given listing. While Luca said that their extrapolation from listing price is a valid indicator of discrimination against black hosts, Carla D. Martin ’03, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of African and African American Studies who studies race and technology, said that the discrepancy in initial asking price is a valuable data point in and of itself.
 
“These studies show that these are groups that ask for less—that are likely to ask for lower numbers to begin with,” she said, referencing past studies which have studied the initial salaries and salary raises of women and people of color. “We may be seeing something like this playing out on the Airbnb side of things.”
 
In order to reduce the number of instances of discrimination in its marketplace, Luca said Airbnb might replace a host’s profile picture with a word cloud of personal characteristics or move the picture to a less prominent position on the listing page.
 
“There are examples of successful platforms such as eBay that don't contain pictures of the person who is trying to sell you a good,” he said. “We don’t see any immediate reason why you need a picture to facilitate a transaction.”
 
In the future, Luca and Edelman aspire to work directly with platforms, including Airbnb, to develop mechanisms to minimize discrimination in online market transactions. 
 
Regardless of Airbnb’s design decisions, the consideration of racial issues in an array of online platforms is becoming more and more necessary as society is uploaded to the internet, Martin said.
 
“People are replicating society online in important ways, and, because racism exists in offline society, it very naturally extends to social uses in digital spaces,” she said. “Dealing with race is an increasingly important issue that these social media sites have to face—in addition to gender, ethnicity, and other social differences.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As expected, a draft of what would be Harvard College’s first-ever honor code calls for students to sign a statement affirming their commitment to academic integrity and gives them a role in hearing cases of academic dishonesty among undergraduates.
Student members of the Academic Integrity Committee shared the draft Tuesday evening at the first of four meetings scheduled to cull student feedback on the honor code draft.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said Monday that the “target” implementation date for the honor code is the fall of 2015. Before an honor code could be implemented at the College, the full faculty would have to vote to approve a draft. The elected Faculty Council is expected to discuss the honor code at its upcoming meeting Wednesday afternoon.
The Academic Integrity Committee first proposed instituting an honor code last April, when Harris presented a proposal to faculty members at their monthly meeting, the semester after news broke of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest cheating investigation in recent memory.
That document proposed, in part, that students be required to sign a “declaration of integrity” on major assignments and exams and the creation of a student-faculty judicial board that would hear cases of academic dishonesty, separate from the Administrative Board. The draft presented Tuesday, dated Jan. 10, is consistent with the spirit of both proposals, dictating a one-sentence “affirmation of integrity” for College students to sign and outlining guidelines for a “student-faculty honor board,” comprised of 50 percent students and 50 percent administrators and faculty.
As described in the draft, the proposed board would hear cases of honor code violations. The dean of the College would have the authority to decide whether the Ad Board or the honor board would hear a case that does not clearly fall under one body’s jurisdiction.
If the draft were approved as written, student members of the honor board would be selected not through popular election, but through interviews and nominations.
“The process should recruit students from across the entire spectrum of the College, including those who might be less inclined to engage in any competitive election,” the draft reads.
Just short of one-and-a-half pages long, the draft does not discuss possible sanctions that the honor board could hand down in cases under its jurisdiction.
The draft calls for students to make the integrity statement on “all of their academic work.” It reads: “I attest to the honesty of my academic work and affirm that it conforms to the standards of the Harvard College Honor Code.”
Three student members of the Academic Integrity Committee—Terah E. Lyons ’14, Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, and Olivia Z. Zhu ’15—presented the honor code draft at the meeting in the Adams Conservatory and then asked the eight students in attendance for feedback with several faculty and administrative members of the committee looking on. For example, the student presenters asked attendees for their thoughts on the appropriate circumstances when students should be required to sign the integrity statement.
Additionally, several students questioned what role faculty members would play in supporting the “culture of academic integrity” that the honor code calls for.
One attendee, Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, expressed concern that the language of the draft could place too much of the responsibility on students in preserving academic integrity. Faculty should also be part of the conversation, said Biebelberg, who represents Quincy House on the Undergraduate Council.
Jake N. Matthews ’16 later suggested that faculty members, like students, should be required to sign a statement indicating their commitment to the honor code.
For their part, the student presenters, all three of whom are members of the subcommittee charged with drafting the honor code’s language, agreed that faculty are a part of the broader discussion about academic integrity at the College. They also emphasized that the honor code draft was built around the entire College community, including students, faculty, and administrators.
“[Faculty are] a crucial aspect of this,” Lyons said. “It’s such a two-way street.... By no means do you have something that goes in one direction.”
The Academic Integrity Committee plans to hold three more student feedback meetings, the next on Wednesday evening in the Cabot House Living Room.

Coming into Sunday’s St. John’s Invitational, the Harvard men’s fencing team had not beaten No. 2 Penn State since 2010, having fallen to the Nittany Lions in early December.
Although the squad eked out the 15-12 win to break its losing streak to Penn State, No. 5 Harvard couldn’t find the winning touch against other top-tier opponents, losing each of its subsequent matches.
Also in the Taffner Field House, the second-ranked Crimson women’s fencing team began the day strong with wins over Penn State, Columbia, and Notre Dame. But Harvard could not continue its success, falling by a single bout to both Ohio State and host St. John’s to cap off Sunday’s competition.
The Crimson’s win over the Fighting Irish was the first in the squad’s 39-year history. It had been over three years since the last time the Harvard men’s team (5-5) defeated the Nittany Lions, and the significance of Sunday’s victory over the second-ranked team in the NCAA was not lost on even the newer fencers of the squad.
“Definitely the highlight of the day was that we crushed Penn State,” said freshman épée fencer Ace Eldeib. “[Penn State is] typically a very strong team, but we just crushed them today, which was excellent. It was pretty solid because they beat us earlier in the season.”
But after Eldeib and senior épéeist Michael Raynis went undefeated against their Penn State opponents to secure the win in the opening match, the Crimson couldn’t pull out another victory.
In the second match, the No. 1 Lions took all three weapons en route to a 18-9 match result over the Crimson. Sophomore Michael Woo was the only Harvard fencer to win two bouts against Columbia, which came into the invite as the top-ranked team for the first time in the 14 years that collegiate squash has had rankings.
The Crimson men also fell to No. 4 Notre Dame, 14-13, in a nail-biter. Despite victories from junior Alexander Ryjik, who went 12-3 on the strip fencing sabre and led Harvard to a 6-3 sabre advantage against the Buckeyes and the Fighting Irish, the Crimson was defeated by sixth-ranked Ohio State, 14-13.
“[Ryjik] did very well today,” Eldeib said. “One of [the bouts] was with…a very strong Hungarian fencer, and he just went into the bout and said to one of the teammates, ‘You know what, I’m going to beat him,’ and he did that.”
In the fifth and final match of the day, the Crimson lost to the 10th-ranked Red Storm squad. In the first match of the New Year for the second-ranked Crimson women’s team (6-2), the group finished the day with a 3-2 record thanks to the 28-15 result of the sabre squad on Sunday afternoon.
“On Sunday, I thought everyone was doing fine, and though people were making mistakes, there were also some really good moments,” freshman foilist Hali Nelson said. “We have stuff to work on, but we have a very strong team.”
In a fashion similar to the men’s team, the Crimson women handled the fourth-ranked Penn State team, 15-12, buoyed by a 6-3 victory by the sabre squad. Freshman sabre competitor Adrienne Jarocki joined senior foilist Alexandra Kiefer as the two Harvard fencers to go undefeated against the Nittany Lions.
The women moved on to beat sixth-ranked Columbia, 15-12, with the Crimson also posting a win in sabre. Jarocki and Kiefer finished the match undefeated. The former posted a 13-2 mark on the day, while the latter ended with a 12-3 record.
Though Harvard walked into the Taffner Field House higher in rank than the Fighting Irish, there was little doubt that history wasn’t on the Crimson’s side. Since the two sides first met in 1983, Harvard has lost to No. 3 Notre Dame eight times and in each of the past four seasons.
Yet again, the Crimson sabre fencers stole the show. This time it was a 7-2 victory, and the épéeists, led by sophomore Sarah Tillman’s three bout wins, clinched the monumental triumph with a 6-3 win of their own.
From there, Harvard was caught off guard by No. 5 Ohio State and No. 10 St. John’s, dropping both by a single bout, 14-13. Sophomore épéeist Nina van Loon posted a 3-0 record against the Buckeyes and went 9-6 for the day, but the Crimson came up just short.
“There were a bunch of 5-4 [individual] bouts [in the two losses],” Nelson said. “[We] know we could’ve beaten them, and we were so close. It’s motivation because we know we’re as good as them—we just need to prove it to everybody else.”

This year’s Harvard men’s squash team makes victory look almost too easy. What was a close 5-4 win in 2012 against the University of Rochester seemed like a walk in the park this season.
In the familiar confines of the Murr Center on Saturday, the No. 2 Crimson (9-0, 3-0 Ivy) extended its unbeaten record by topping Rochester (6-4, 3-1 Liberty League). Harvard dropped just one match to emerge victorious, 8-1.
“We had some very good wins,” co-captain Gary Power said. “There were some close matches, but we stuck it out and are very happy with our results this weekend. Everyone played extraordinarily well, which is a reflection of our performances so far this season.”
After a three-game upset against St. Lawrence Friday afternoon, fellow co-captain Brandon McLaughlin bounced back and defeated the Yellowjackets’ No. 2 seed Ryosei Kobayashi in a five-game match of endurance. After a large early lead in the first game, McLaughlin fell into a hole in the second.
The two players swapped sets, with McLaughlin eventually claiming the fifth game to give the point to Harvard. The point breakdown, which featured three sets that were decided by three points or fewer—11-4, 12-14, 11-9, 3-11, and 11-8—demonstrated just how evenly matched the two players were.
Brothers Nigel and Bryan Koh also needed five games to finish off their Rochester opponents. Senior Nigel Koh defeated No. 5 seed Aria Fazelimanesh, 11-9, 13-15, 9-11, 11-8, and 11-8. After falling behind by a game, rookie Bryan Koh played his second five-game match of the weekend to top senior opponent Karm Kumar, overcoming the early deficit to earn the win at the No. 6 spot.
“We are a very talented group, very focused,” Power said. “[We are] the best team Harvard has ever seen. We are fit and ready to go. Our training allows us to win most matches, 3-0, and if it gets to five games, we are usually in better shape than our opponents and can outlast them.”
But not all Crimson players saw their matches stretch into five games—five members of the squad shut out their opponents to bring home the victory.
“Standout performances were the bottom three, [sophomore] Nick Hopcroft, [senior] Tommy Mullaney, and [junior] Tyler Olson, who didn’t drop games,” McLaughlin said. “Gary Power also didn’t drop a game at No. 4, and [senior] Ali Farag performed as well as he always does.”
Rochester’s top seed, Niel Cordell, who was No. 17 in the Dunlop College Squash Association individual player rankings last season, faced third-ranked player and Harvard’s top seed, Farag. Cordell took Farag into extra points in the first two games of the match, but the Egypt native ultimately grabbed the games and the match, 12-10, 14-12, and 11-9.
“A big shout out has to go to Ali Farag,” Power said. “He is definitely a guy that, when everyone else watches, they think ‘this is phenomenal squash.’ He is potentially the best squash player that college squash has ever seen. He pushes us to play our best and not let up when the match isn’t going our way.”
Farag, who won the 2012 CSA Individual National Championships and reached the semifinals last year, looks to end this campaign in the top spot, where he was at the completion of the 2011-2012 season. With his victory over previous No. 1 Amr Khaled Khalifa of St. Lawrence on Friday evening, the top ranking may be back in Farag’s sights if the senior continues on the undefeated path.
“Ali had two big matches this weekend against strong opponents,” freshman Dylan Murray said. “It’s impressive but not too surprising [that he won], seeing as he is playing so strong recently and is coming off an appearance in the tournament of champions…in New York.”
Only No. 3 seed Murray fell to a Rochester opponent. Mario Yanez defeated Murray in straight games, 11-4, 11-5, and 11-5. Yanez, nicknamed “Super Mario” by his teammates, moves his personal record to 9-0 for the season with Saturday’s victory.
Saturday’s contest marks the Crimson’s ninth victory of the season, and their eighth win of at least 8-1. While this weekend was challenging for Harvard, the fight continues in the upcoming weeks with just a month left before CSA National Championships.
“We are looking forward to the rest of the season,” McLaughlin said.
