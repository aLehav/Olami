After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly five hours of public comments from Cambridge residents, discussion over the budget for the Cambridge Police Department — framed by a national debate over police brutality — became heated Wednesday when the City Council heard testimony from Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr.
The discussion centered around Policy Order 7 — co-sponsored by Councilors Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and Quinton Y. Zondervan — which requests that the city manager reallocate the funding increase for the Cambridge Police Department in the next budget to other services.
In the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021, CPD’s budget was slated to increase approximately $4.1 million from the previous year. The allocation makes up $65 million of the $715 million city budget, which the council is set to vote on Monday, June 15.
The policy order does not propose defunding the department, only holding its current funding level from the previous fiscal year.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said during the meeting that the policy order is meant to start a larger conversation about the relationship between police and the city.
“This is part of a larger discussion with the council and the city you have been having for a while about racism that the Black and brown residents of Cambridge face and about the role of policing in Cambridge,” he said. “There are, of course, other aspects of our conversation, including about the connection between racism and public health, and of police accountability.”
The debate over the role of police in Cambridge comes amid protests nationwide over police brutality following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police in late May. On Sunday, the Minneapolis City Council announced it will begin a process to dismantle the city’s police department, though it has not yet specified how.
Bard, along with City Manager Louis A. DePasquale strongly objected to the councilor’s proposal during the meeting. Bard said it was “befuddling” that he was not consulted by the councilors about the proposal, and added that the blocked funding would impact “community policing” programs.
“To attempt to take this kind of action with our budget in my opinion, is a lack of awareness as to the level of collaboration that this department does with other city agencies to actually enhance public health and public safety,” he said. “That's your children, your elders, your homeless, and those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse.”
“I'm gonna just say flat out, it's not sound governance,” he added.
Bard announced Monday that all CPD officers must now intervene in any instances of excessive force by another officer, where previously they were only required to report such cases.
Bard also directly criticized the sponsoring councilors — Zondervan and Sobrinho-Wheeler — for what he said was a “level of arrogance” in not consulting him.
“The fact that it seeks to defund all of the progress made to combat racial and justice and policing and to establish productive relationships with communities of color, without so much as even consulting me, is alarming, and I believe it reflects poorly on the sponsors,” he said “
During Bard’s testimony, Zondervan interrupted and said he was “lying” about police budget items, specifically the alleged military equipment police, which Bard had denied in his testimony.
Tempers flared, and several minutes of heated exchanges across the council chamber ensued, in which Councilor E. Denise Simmons said Zondervan was “out of control” and a “bully.”
The council eventually recessed for a brief period, following attempts by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui to maintain decorum.
Zondervan later defended his remarks, and said he was trying to hold the department accountable.
“Part of the reason that I got upset earlier this evening is that it is very disturbing to me when people in power are telling us everything's okay,” he said. “We are being silenced, and not given the opportunity to come to our own conclusions and to question authority.”
Simmons said she is concerned about the level of “outrage” over George Floyd’s death, a level she said she believes did not exist in the past when Black Americans were killed by police.
“Weren’t the countless other Black men that we failed in so many different ways, important?” she said. “So I just have to question the outrage, because it wasn't there then.”
Simmons also said the council should examine their own issues as well.
“Let's talk about the bias that we have,” she said. “If there's a problem in the city, it starts here with the policy makers.”
After the tense discussion, Sobrinho-Wheeler exercised his prerogative to table the order, pushing the issue to the next council meeting. In addition to the budget issue, the council also voted to send the Affordable Housing Overlay — a contentious proposal that dominated council elections last year — to committee for future hearings.
On Monday — the council’s normal meeting day — council members heard nearly five hours of public testimony. The vast majority of residents gave their support for Policy Order 7, and many also said this was their first time speaking to the city council. Approximately 400 residents signed up to speak, according to Siddiqui.
Bard said he did not find the public comments sincere or convincing.
“I did not hear authentic voices on Monday night,” he said. “I heard a bunch of people looking for their 'I'm a Black ally' receipts, hoping that they can somehow use it to pay off white guilt.”
Several speakers cited an incident in 2018 where CPD officers forcibly arrested Black Harvard undergraduate. The event sparked outrage over the officers' alleged use of excessive force and police brutality.
Amanda T. Chan — a Law School graduate — said living near where the altercation took place is “disturbing,” adding that she believes the department does not make residents safer.
“I really believe that if we all want to live in a community that is safer, and that is supported by social services, compassion, and generosity and not with weapons, pepper spray, tasers, and physical violence, I think that policy order should certainly be approved by this council,” she said.
Avriel C. Epps-Darling, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said she agreed with the proposal, and that she and her family do not feel safe around police in Cambridge.
“As a Black woman with a small son, I am terrified to interact with the Cambridge police department and that makes me really sad to be a part of this community,” she said. “So, I hope that everyone has the power to do something to change that as well.”
Isaiah A. Osazuwa II ’23 said in his testimony he believes the funding should shift to programs that focus on health care and education to deal with public issues, as well as “reinvesting” in marginalized populations in Cambridge.
“We should not let the increased funding to Cambridge PD cause us to miss out on the opportunity to make Cambridge an even more amazing place to live,” he said. “Instead, we must reallocate this funding toward more progressive interventions that truly will bring more safety to Cambridge.”
Correction: June 17, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Amanda T. Chan as a current Law School student. In fact, she graduated in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow urged the federal government to enact “forward-thinking immigration policies” in a June 2 letter to Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf.
The letter comes in anticipation of an Executive Order from President Donald J. Trump that would temporarily bar certain nonimmigrant categories from entering the United States, and then alter work authorization policies for students, scholars, and H1-B visa holders, per the Harvard International Office.
“I hope the Administration will reconsider any plan to suspend or restrict nonimmigrant visas and their work authorizations, including for international students, scholars, and specialized workers,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow asked the pair to “reject efforts to curtail” specific programs for international scholars: namely, Optional Practical Training and the STEM Extension.
Optional Practical Training allows students who have completed at least one academic year to use their student visas to work in the United States for one year to gain professional experience that relates to their field of study and complements their education. Students who receive degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math fields may also apply for an additional 24 month extension, known as the STEM Extension.
“Experiential learning is an important practical experience as well as a recruitment tool for those seeking to welcome top talent,” Bacow wrote.
He noted that the program is also “vital to the healthcare system,” since medical schools often use the extension to support first-year residency programs.
Bacow also cited increased competition for top students and declining enrollments at colleges and universities nationwide as reasons to safeguard the programs. Experts have said increased restrictions on international travel could result in further financial tumult for American higher education.
“The loss of OPT threatens to erode our ability to enroll the best and brightest,” he wrote. “Similar and competitive programs exist in many other countries, and we risk losing out.”
Bacow also advocated for a few specific changes — such as waiving in-person interviews — as the government develops its plans to resume visa processing and address backlogs that may have accrued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
He also cautioned the administration against “blunt measures that seek to exclude international scholars and students based on national origin.”
“Not only do these policies threaten to undermine our national ideals and core institutional values of openness and inclusivity, they threaten to cut off the United States from the global scientific community in critical fields of science and scholarship,” he wrote.
Trump enacted a controversial travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017.
In January, as the threat of the novel coronavirus loomed, Trump blocked entry to the United States from China for 14 days. In March, he also implemented a 30-day travel ban on 26 European nations.
In June 2019, Bacow wrote to Pompeo and then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan with concerns over immigration policies “driving anxiety and fear” for international students on campus, and he has cited immigration as one of his frequent topics of discussions with policymakers.
Though the expulsion from campus and transition to remote learning proved challenging for international students, Bacow thanked Pomepo and Wolf for their “quick action” on visa status issues at the time.
“The continuation of this policy will be important for the fall as we continue to respond to local public health conditions, and I urge you to expand flexibility to include new or initial status students, as well as continuing and transfer students,” he wrote.
The Departments of State and Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anthropology and African and African American Studies students distributed a petition Monday outlining steps toward “radical, truly transformative change” to department structures they say facilitated abuse, beginning with the removal of three faculty accused of sexual misconduct.
The petition to administrators in both departments — along with a letter sent by 39 alumni to Anthropology faculty Sunday — comes in response to an investigation by The Crimson last month, which identified allegations of sexual misconduct against three senior Anthropology faculty, as well as a department culture in Anthropology that put men at an advantage.
One of those faculty, Gary Urton, was placed on administrative leave last week. Twenty-five Anthropology faculty have called on him to resign.
As of Thursday evening, the student petition had garnered 396 signatures from graduate and undergraduate Anthropology and AAAS students, students in other Harvard departments, and academics outside the University.
The petitioners called on the two departments to repair harm through a transformative justice approach, a philosophy that focuses on supporting victims and dismantling structures that facilitated abuse rather than punishing perpetrators.
To begin that process, the students demanded that the three professors accused of sexual misconduct — Urton, Theodore C. Bestor, and John L. Comaroff, who holds a primary appointment in AAAS — be removed from their departments and have their tenure revoked before the fall semester begins. Of the three, the University’s Office for Dispute Resolution has only substantiated that Bestor committed sexual misconduct.
The students wrote that departmental issues identified by The Crimson’s reporting were “horrifying but unsurprising.”
“This is merely the tip of an immense iceberg of suffering and abuse which far surpasses the individuals named in the article, as other accusations emerge,” they wrote.
The students wrote that faculty should acknowledge their complicity in “putting students in harm’s way” by issuing a public apology.
“The Anthropology department has repeatedly refused to engage students’ complaints over the years, operating through private conversations, whispers and half-hearted commitments that were never formalized,” they wrote.
Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian and interim chair Rowan K. Flad announced the formation of a standing committee late last month to dismantle long-standing internal structures they said allowed for abuses of power.
The students called for the committee to be “appropriately paid,” be granted decision-making power, and include external members and members from the marginalized groups in the department.
The petitioners also demanded that both departments’ policies allow for anonymous reports, or “public secrets,” to prompt an investigation. They urged that department policies should require interim measures be implemented during an investigation, including removing the accused professor from all student committees and informing all department members of an ongoing investigation.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that many of the students’ demands lie outside the purview of Subramanian, Flad, and AAAS department chair Tommie Shelby. Only the FAS can remove a professor’s appointment in a department, and only the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — can vote to revoke a professor’s tenure upon the recommendation of the school’s dean and the University President.
The FAS, not departments, can implement interim measures under Title IX, though a department can implement “local management measures,” she added.
Responding to the students’ demand that investigations be publicly revealed, Dane wrote that confidentiality is an “important part of a fair investigative process.”
FAS policies already address some of the students’ demands, according to Dane.
Anonymous reporting can prompt an investigation if a Title IX coordinator decides to forward it to the ODR on individuals’ behalf. In order to participate as a witness in the investigation, however, the complainant must identify themself.
In addition, Title IX coordinators already contact all direct advisees of a faculty member who are subject to a complaint and offer them the option to switch advisors. Many students would find a requirement to change advisors or committee members “incredibly disruptive to their studies,” Dane wrote.
In the petition, the students also called on the departments to publicly endorse an independent third party grievance procedure for sexual harassment complaints pushed by Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers in its ongoing contract negotiations with the University.
In their separate letter Sunday, the 39 alumni suggested several steps the department should take to correct “systemic issues” identified by The Crimson’s reporting, some of which they wrote they noticed as students.
“Concerns about faculty diversity, tenure processes, the gendered dynamics of field work, graduate examinations, and student retention have been highlighted by students and other members of the community for years, and we feel now is the time for substantial, structural action,” the alumni wrote.
Like the students, the alumni expressed concern that the new standing committee would be ineffective without financial compensation for members and the inclusion of external, independent observers.
They wrote that the committee should clearly communicate a timeline and scope for investigating the sexual misconduct allegations, and should also examine faculty attitudes characterized by toughness and hostility — which they termed a “bro culture.”
The alumni letter also expressed concern that Harvard hired Comaroff with tenure in 2012 despite “allegedly existing complaints filed against him” at the University of Chicago, his previous place of work.
Comaroff wrote in an email Wednesday that “the claim that I had to answer to Title IX complaints filed at Chicago is simply false.” He added that no charges have been filed against him by Harvard’s ODR, and he has not been “accorded any due process whatsoever.”
In their letter, the alumni also urged Anthropology to make “serious and concrete commitments to faculty diversity, particularly in the archaeology wing and the senior social anthropology faculty.” Currently, three of the department’s 21 tenured faculty are women, none of whom specialize in archaeology.
The alumni also suggested the department improve awareness of the Title IX reporting process for graduate and undergraduate students through handbook changes and training sessions.
“We also suggest the creation of an in-department office staffed by a nonmandatory Title IX reporter for students, staff, or faculty to discuss their options regarding potential harassment,” they wrote.
In response to both the student and alumni petitions, Flad and Subramanian wrote that they are conscious of the urgency to address the department’s “long-standing problems.”
“We will take on board the recommendations made by students and alumni that are within our power to address in the department as we come together to engage in a thoughtful and deliberative process of enacting change,” they wrote.
The chairs “unequivocally” condemned harassment they said has been directed at students who worked with the accused faculty.
Shelby, the AAAS chair, referred to Dane’s comments in response to the student petition.
In closing their petition, the students recommended steps to dismantle “heteropatriarchal cultures” in both departments: hiring diverse faculty, redesigning introductory courses they said held a colonialist perspective, and considering reparations for a history of “harmful research.”
They also urged the departments to “abolish the levers of control which contribute to an unequal academic culture of patronage,” including eliminating the requirement for recommendation letters in applications. The Crimson’s investigation, and subsequent accounts of additional women accusing Urton of sexual misconduct, found that the threat of receiving negative letters of recommendation discouraged some women from reporting alleged harassment.
The students noted that recent movements for Black liberation around the world gave them “courage” to put forth a list of demands they knew may seem “too ambitious to many.”
“We owe it to past students, we owe it to ourselves and we owe it to future students,” they wrote. “We demand nothing short of radical, truly transformative change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The novel coronavirus may have begun spreading in China as early as August 2019, new research from a team of scientists led by Harvard Medical School professor John S. Brownstein suggests.
The research — published as a preprint on June 8 — was motivated by a desire to overcome the limitations of currently available coronavirus data, according to Benjamin M. Rader, an author on the paper and Boston University graduate student.
“By the time someone's in the hospital, or the CDC gets information about the disease, there's some lag of information going to public health agencies and getting aggregated and collated and cleaned,” Rader said.
In the preliminary study, researchers analyzed satellite imagery and common queries from the Chinese search engine Baidu to investigate the initial emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
The team partnered with RS Metrics, a satellite data collection and analysis company, to pore over images taken within the past two years of Wuhan hospital parking lots, and found a significant increase in traffic around major Wuhan hospitals during fall 2019 compared to fall 2018. Certain images displayed up to 90 percent increases in parked cars.
After they observed the increased hospital traffic, Rader said, the team set out to determine whether the spike had any correlation with COVID-19 cases in Wuhan. After analyzing index information from Baidu, they found that “cough” and “diarrhea” queries on the website surged during at the same point in time.
“While queries of the respiratory symptom “cough” show seasonal fluctuations coinciding with yearly influenza seasons, “diarrhea” is a more COVID-19 specific symptom and only shows an association with the current epidemic,” the researchers wrote in their manuscript.
Rader said using data from a search engine can reveal information about virus spread and presence that may be hard for public health officials to detect.
“There's some balance between the number of people searching for something where it would get picked up by a search engine, but still low enough where it might not get picked up by public health authorities,” Rader said.
The researchers believe this was potentially the case in Wuhan during the months leading up to December 2019.
Despite its conclusions, the study — which is now submitted for peer review — faced many limitations, according to Rader. He said the full story of how COVID-19 emerged largely remains a mystery to public health experts.
“It's really just a sliver of information that exists and needs to be interpreted as part of a broader picture,” Rader said.
Brownstein said that such limitations leave the door open for much further work on the topic, underscoring the need to “strengthen our public health surveillance globally.”
“Our work wasn’t meant to point any fingers,” Brownstein said. “Signals around disease get missed all the time, so it’s all about how do we improve the ability to identify things and take the lessons learned to prevent the next pandemic.”
“I think it’s not one paper that is going to clarify the origins of COVID-19; it's a lot of work among many scientists who are going to have to really think deeply,” he added.
