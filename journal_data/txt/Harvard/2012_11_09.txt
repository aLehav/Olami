Movies mean big business. They are popular, far-reaching, and, with any luck, entertaining. The movie industry, though, does far more than entertain us—it plays an active role in shaping our collective consciousness. Of course, this was not always the case; the written word once reigned supreme as the chief means of influencing public opinion. However, motion pictures are increasingly becoming the primary modes of spreading information and educating audiences. This phenomenon, despite the accompanying demise of the supremacy of books, is a tremendous boon: It offers the potential to effectively educate society and add to our shared culture.
Gone are the times when a simple pamphlet like Thomas Paine’s Common Sense could incite a revolution. Hard as it may have tried, Newsweek was never able to achieve the authority that print publications used to command, and has, as a result, become be the latest casualty in the industry. Even online written content, with the possibility of reaching billions of viewers, fails to influence public perception as words once could. The only pamphlets capable of provoking rebellions today are largely restricted to 140 characters in length.
In many respects, movies are usurping written works as the primary means of spreading ideas and educating the public. Films do not merely entertain; they educate. The public, for instance, was first truly exposed to King George VI, the British monarch during World War II who struggled with a stutter for the entirety of his life, not through a history textbook or popular novel, but by the Hollywood hit “The King’s Speech.” I learned more about the six American escapees during the Iranian hostage crisis by watching a two-minute trailer on YouTube for Ben Affleck’s new flick “Argo” than I picked up from years of history classes and their accompanying textbooks. Educating the public is always a benefit to society, regardless of the means by which information was imparted.
The effectiveness and influence of movies may be at least partly due to their inherent nature. As visual, rather than textual, stimulus, they display content much more quickly than can a book. Movies, then, are better vectors to reach and inform a vast audience. Moreover, the concrete images of film are easier to remember long after their display than the imagined ones required for reading. A picture, we are told, is worth 1000 words, and most films play at a rate of at least 24 frames per second. At that speed, Ben Affleck’s “Argo,” running 120 minutes long, is worth well more than 200 King James Bibles.
I do not mean to imply that a movie is qualitatively better than a piece of literature merely on account of its ability to display more content. Rather, this characteristic may explain our tendency to prefer and learn better from films than from books. Watching a motion picture is an inherently more passive experience than reading a book. Yet it imparts content in a much more easily consumable way than a book of commensurate length. Movies are more tangible, visual, and compact than comparable written works, and are therefore easier to remember. To lament the popularity of films relative to books is to simply ignore the potential benefit they offer society.
Critics point out that the potential for misinformation in movies is great: Not all historical films are necessarily accurate. The creative liberties taken are not always as obvious as those involving mutants averting the Cuban missile crisis. Politicized documentaries, such as “2016: Obama’s America” and Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11,” are characterized by the unabashed misrepresentation of facts. But history books, too, have never been completely accurate. One elementary school textbook claimed that thousands of black soldiers fought for the Confederacy, a definitively false claim. In fact, enough uncredible history books abound to warrant an entire contest sponsored by the History News Network.
Factual inaccuracies aside, the film industry goes beyond entertaining and even teaching the public; it reshapes the historical narrative in the public consciousness in a way books no longer do. When people think of the RMS Titanic, they remember Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet fighting for survival in the icy waters of the Atlantic. Similarly, Spielberg’s Lincoln will surely reshape the narrative of Abraham Lincoln’s presidency the way Oliver Stone’s JFK retold Kennedy’s assassination to the American public. These films demonstrate the potential of film to popularize history, educate the public, and reshape our collective culture.
Film is nothing new. Hollywood’s influence on American culture and consciousness is long established. However, the industry is expanding its influence beyond the confines of the United States and reaches a broader, more international audience than ever before. In our era of globalized culture, we may someday see motion pictures eclipse the written word as the primary means of education everywhere. Movie theaters are, in some ways, becoming global classrooms, and movies bestselling books. Some may be upset that films are replacing written works as cultural agents and education tools. But Argo looks pretty darn good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, Americans made the collective decision to stay the course, voting to reelect President Barack Obama by a relatively large margin. Yet, as most college students—especially in Colorado and Washington—know, President of the United States was not the only choice presented to the voting public. In many states, citizens were expected to do more than display their preferences for who should govern the country. They were expected to actually do some of the governing themselves. Here in Massachusetts, this manifested in ballot measures on automobile insurance, assisted suicide, and medicinal marijuana.
Plenty of results from Tuesday’s election are worth celebrating. Marriage equality activists point to successful referenda in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. Few argue with California’s decision to increase punishment for those convicted of human trafficking. However, getting excited over these results risks ignoring the fundamental problem with state ballot measures: that they are anathema to our system of representative government.
This year, 176 questions resided on ballots in various states. Their topics ranged from Alabama’s Forever Wild Land Trust Amendment to West Virginia’s Sheriff Term Limit Amendment. If you have a well-reasoned position on the optimal length of a sheriff’s term, well, then you are probably the sheriff. There is little reason to believe that the electorate, which the mainstream media perceives to be intellectually inferior enough to be susceptible to scurrilously depthless campaign ads, have the wherewithal to make critical decisions on issues that they cannot fully understand. While marijuana provisions were not without their share of supporters this fall, very few of those proponents can be said to understand the full implications of implementing sale of the drug. This is exactly why we have elected officials.
Regardless of what students are taught in elementary school, the United States of America is not a democracy. We obviously do not have time to govern the country. We have work to do and bills to pay. We don’t all head to the Pnyx of Ancient Greece to debate the merits of our pet causes. Rather, we choose a select few representatives to do that job for us. Because of our extensive primary system, these representatives are expected to be knowledgeable and reasonable individuals to whom we entrust decision-making authority. Employing people who govern for a living releases us from the unreasonable responsibility of reading up on each and every minor issue.
But for some reason, we have apparently decided that we do not fully trust these elected representatives. In Maryland, for example, Governor Martin J. O’Malley signed the Civil Marriage Protection Act, which legalized same-sex marriage, all the way back in March. Apparently that was not enough for same-sex marriage supporters in the state, since they went through the painstaking trouble of getting the question on the ballot with the sole intent of affirming the measure. While news headlines gleefully proclaim that “Maryland Approves Gay Marriage,” the actual ramifications of the passage of Question 6 are minimal. Same-sex marriage was already legal. Question 6 was merely an exercise in demonstrating that citizens do indeed follow the laws enacted by their local government.
The case in Maine is decidedly distinct, although the print media has not felt the need to differentiate. Maine passed a law allowing same-sex marriages in 2009, only to see it overturned by what was termed a “people’s veto” that same year.  Now, three Novembers later, voters did an about-face and reinstituted the law. This not only means that Maine wasted those three years in which same-sex marriages could have been lawful, but it also demonstrates the fickleness of the American populace. Maine’s elected officials did a good job predicting what its residents would eventually want. Unfortunately, Mainers were not prescient enough to realize it themselves.
There is a reason the Founding Fathers established the country as a constitutional republic. We have the power and the responsibility of electing individuals to carefully consider the important issues of our day. We also have the far greater power and responsibility of electing replacement individuals if the first set does not turn out the way we hope. There should be no need for a direct democracy in a constitutional republic. If there are enough people in a polis to vote for legalizing marijuana or same-sex marriage, there should be an ample number of individuals with those stances able to take positions in public service.
Instead of pretending to be citizens of the Acropolis, state activists should spend more time recruiting candidates who support their causes. Inherent tension between the will of the legislature and the will of the people is not a sign of a healthy polity. We should decide once and for all who has legitimate governing power. The answer to this question should be clear. Once that is figured out, Congress just has to find a way to get its approval rating above 17 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The storm of excitement, and to a lesser degree, disappointment on campus following Barack Obama’s re-election to a second term as President makes it easy to forget about the very real storm that hit the Northeast just a little over a week ago. While many of us celebrated the impromptu three-day weekend the hurricane gifted us, news of the devastation Sandy wrought upon New York and New Jersey brought us back to reality. After taking advantage of the extra day off to catch up on schoolwork (or not), many students devoted the rest of their week to help the relief efforts in any way they could. The response from Harvard students shows that despite their busy schedules, members of the student body can always find time to lend a helping hand.
The relief effort on campus was spearheaded by the Harvard College Red Cross, which launched a campaign on Sunday asking for online donations that would go directly towards the national Red Cross and its efforts to help the families affected by Hurricane Sandy. Appealing to students’ personal connections to the disaster, it emphasized that any amount donated, no matter how small, helped.
Other students found more creative ways to help with the relief efforts. On the same day that Harvard College Red Cross launched its online campaign, two seniors ran a marathon along the banks of the Charles River as part of an attempt to raise funds for the families hit by the storm. The two students were prompted to take action when the annual marathon schedule to take place in New York City that same day was cancelled in order to give the residents of the city time to rebuild and go back to their daily lives. Having already trained for the marathon, they took the lemons Sandy had handed them and made lemonade. Their goal was to raise one hundred dollars for each mile (for a total of $2,620), but over the course of the week they managed to almost double their original goal.
Everyone was affected by the storm. Many students had friends and family living in the areas affected by the storm, and those who didn’t almost certainly knew a friend who did. Although this certainly catalyzed the response, personal connections are not the only reason. Last year, when an earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated Japan, students at the college were quick to lend a hand to the relief efforts. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast over half a decade ago, students from the college organized a service trip over winter break to aid with rebuilding.
Fortunately, the zeal with which our student body approached the relief effort has been matched this time by the federal government. A day after the storm, President Obama declared the areas hit by Sandy disaster zones, opening them up to federal relief funds. In a welcome break from electoral politics, the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, praised the president and his administration’s quick response to the hurricane. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which lost much credibility due to its lackluster performance after Hurricane Katrina, has shown that it has learned its lesson through a quick and effective response to Sandy.
While the efforts of those on campus may be only a small part of the larger national effort to rebuild, as the Harvard College Red Cross emphasized, no amount of help is too small to make a difference.

During a July Senate hearing evaluating the impact of Super PAC funding on elections, Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig included a frightening metaphor in his testimony. He pointed out how, before the Citizens United decision, “our democracy was already broken.” So much so, that though “Citizens United may have shot the body, the body was already cold.”
This graphic allegory is oddly fitting. Outsize corporate influence on policy-making existed long before the Citizens United decision. The case has only exacerbated the problem by decreasing the legal risk for corporations who explicitly advocate on behalf of political causes. Repealing Citizens United via a constitutional amendment or targeting corrupt political officials and forcing them out of office would be akin to surgically removing bullets from a dead body. It would be time-consuming, expensive, and of little use. The concern we face with the problem of corporate influence in politics must be addressed with more fundamental and systemic changes than mere governmental reform.
The question we must ask ourselves is why the interests of corporations are not aligned with the interests of society. In their opinion on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the justices of the majority implied that the speech of corporations is equivalent to the speech of “citizens, or associations of citizens.” The idea that corporate influence in politics can occupy the same civic position as individual influence is misleading at best. This is for two reasons: American corporate leadership currently faces no legal obligation to consider the interests of all company stakeholders when pursuing profits, and corporations are under no legal obligation to represent wide stakeholder interests on the board.
It is not wild to imagine that, if stakeholder interests, particularly those of employees and local communities, were better represented in corporate leadership, corporations could conceivably be the most effective voices for reform with respect to issues such as shoddy workplace conditions and failing social safety nets. Kent Greenfield, a professor of corporate and constitutional law at Boston College, recently argued for such reforms, noting also that the changes would create an “improvement in the initial allocation of wealth [that] is bound to be more efficient in lessening inequality than having government redistribute wealth after the fact.”
A rare glimpse of how a more representative corporate governance model can become the norm in society is offered in a poignant Financial Times article from eleven years ago. Hireshi Okuda, at that time a chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation, spoke before a group of wealthy managers at a fancy restaurant, urging them not to embrace an exclusively shareholder-directed model of corporate governance because of “what Japanese junior high school textbooks say about corporate social responsibility. Under Japanese company law, they explain, shareholders are the owners of the corporation. But if corporations are run exclusively in the interests of shareholders, the business will be driven to pursue short-term profit at the expense of employment and spending on research and development. To be sustainable, children are told, corporations must nurture relationships with stakeholders such as suppliers, employees and the local community.”
A more representative system of stakeholder governance is the norm in Germany as well, where the co-determination model makes employee representation at the board level mandatory for many corporations. At the January 2011 World Economic Forum, John Studzinski, managing director of The Blackstone Group, commented on how, though it “may be odd for managers,” board-level employee representation in Germany “introduce[d] a range of new perspectives,” which played a role in Germany’s success mitigating the impact of the financial crisis. If American wealth management firms had mandated stakeholder governance systems, long-term societal interests would certainly figure into their activities more often.
Professor Greenfield asserts that a national corporate law standard under the power of Congress’ Commerce Clause could better bring corporate interests in line with societal interests. Our legislators should seriously consider this proposal. In what would perhaps be one of the most fitting applications of the otherwise loosely applied commercial clause, the engines of capitalism could begin to resuscitate a dying democracy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democratic Congressman John P. S. Sarbanes introduced his plan to combat big money in politics with a caution sign on his PowerPoint slide: “WARNING: Money is Dangerous to Your Democracy,”
The alert—written in big, yellow letters—introduced his concerns over the current system of campaign finance and his hopes for legislative reform.
According to Sarbanes, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988, congressional representatives spend 30 to 70 percent of their time fundraising, which distracts them from the legislation they are elected to craft.
“We’re operating at 25 percent concentration,” he said. “We raise money in the morning, we raise money at lunch time, and we raise money in the afternoon.”
Using his 2012 campaign as an experiment, Sarbanes committed to an incentive structure that forced him to reach a funding quota at the grassroots level before he tapped into funding from large donors. In the process, he said he discovered that the current system makes it nearly impossible to run a successful campaign without becoming beholden to special interests. He wants to make it realistic for willing candidates to reject the influence of lobbyists and groups with unlimited donation capacity.
Under the Grassroots Democracy Act, Sarbanes’s proposed solution, each citizen would receive a $50 tax credit, potentially in the form of a coupon, to use specifically for donations to congressional candidates of choice. To participate in the program and be labeled “grassroots candidates,” politicians would refuse money from so-called Political Action Committee, find 2,000 under-$100 donors, and raise at least $50,000 from those grassroots donors. A public fund would match donations under $100 to these grassroots candidates at a rate of 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. The act also would set aside money for candidates besieged by SuperPACs through what Sarbanes calls “The People’s Fund.”
Sarbanes believes Washington is finally ready to tackle campaign finance reform.
“For a long time most members of Congress were saying, ‘I hate this game, but I know how to play it,’” he said. “But I think now the money has gotten so big and so all-consuming that there’s starting to be a new critical mass emerging and saying ‘We can’t do this anymore.’”
“I think it would be a game changer and one of the best things that could happen for third-party candidates,” said Bill E. English, who works as a fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and read the full text of the act. “But once Democrats and Republicans figure that out, it won’t pass.”
Julia A. Novina, a “concerned citizen” not affiliated with Harvard, said she thought Sarbanes’s reforms were not radical enough. “The system is so broken it needs a major overhaul, and this validates the system.”
Law School professor and Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center Lawrence Lessig, who introduced Sarbanes, praised the congressman for his dedication to reform.
“There will be no congressman more involved in bringing about this critical—I would say republic-saving—legislation,” he said.

Although issues such as the economy and health care overshadowed climate change in this year’s presidential candidates in this year’s presidential election, affiliates at the Harvard Kennedy School said that President Obama can no longer ignore the environment in light of Hurricane Sandy.
“I think the question of ‘act or not act’ is not the right question—I think the question is in what ways are we going to act,” said Matthew Bunn, associate professor of public policy at HKS.
While addressing climate change will require more than one single solution, Bunn outlined President Obama’s potential next steps.
“I think you’ll see a fair amount of attention on preparedness, because, fundamentally, what we need to do is ‘avoid the unmanageable and manage the unavoidable,’ as the title of one report a couple of years ago put it,” he said.
“And it’s clear that some climate change is now unavoidable and we need to be better prepared for the increased extreme weather events.”
For voters and politicians alike, however, investments to stabilize the nation’s economy have traditionally taken precedence over efforts to explore greener energy resources. But energy policy and economic concerns do not have to be “mutually exclusive,” said Kathleen M. Araújo, HKS Energy Policy Fellow.
She added that improving energy efficiency and rethinking the country’s infrastructure would actually create jobs.
And Araújo agreed that looking ahead, Obama has multiple options to capitalize on these opportunities.
“In terms of policy that’s going to need to be dealt with, I would say our grid modernization is going to have to happen—irrespective of what energy is being used,” she said.
Bunn said that although a big carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to motivate responsible energy usage are the most economically efficient options for addressing climate change, the public is currently unlikely to support these strategies.
But he added that other viable alternatives must be considered, such as clamping down on coal companies, which are the main source of dangerous pollutants in the air.
In addition, implementing better efficiency standards in buildings would not only save the government money but also benefit efforts to combat climate change.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 9
An earlier version of this article inaccurately reported a quotation from Harvard Kennedy School Energy Policy Fellow Kathleen M. Araújo. She referred to “grid modernization,” not “group modernization,” when discussing necessary changes to U.S. energy policy.

Though education reform did not play a prominent role in the discourse surrounding the 2012 presidential election, there is hope for bipartisan compromise on the issue during President Obama’s second term, according to panelists at a discussion at the Graduate School of Education on Thursday.
The panelists said that education was not a major focus in the 2012 presidential election because the complex issues at the forefront of education policy are not important to the average voter.
Assistant professor of Education at the Ed School Martin R. West said that while voters tend to have low impressions of the American public school system as a whole, they tend to rate their local public schools highly. “To the extent that people perceive education as a problem in the U.S.—and I think they do—they perceive it as someone else’s problem,” he said.
The panelists said that, in the next few years, Republicans and Democrats alike will have to consider substantial changes to education policy.
“Education is one of those issues in American politics where there is legitimate hope for bipartisan collaboration,” West said.
West, who served as an advisor on K-12 education policy for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said that the Republican party will have an opportunity during the next four years to put forth a vision for the role of the federal government in education.
Massachusetts Secretary of Education S. Paul Reville, who served as moderator for the discussion, said that though education was not a major platform for Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren during her successful Senate campaign, he thought she was attuned to the needs of the middle class, which includes public education. “I think she’s more education conscious than Scott Brown,” he said.
For Nadine R. Rubinstein ’13, leader of the Harvard chapter of the national nonprofit Students for Education Reform, the American education system needs fundamental change. “For me personally, there’s nothing more important than improving education in terms of making America better, in terms of its economy, in terms of social cohesion, and combating the increasing polarization of politics,” she said.
Though she said she does not think federal education policies such as No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top are without flaw, she added that they have the ability to affect change on a broad scale. “I think the federal government’s biggest role can just be using federal money to incentivize certain changes or behaviors,” she said.

A class-action lawsuit alleging that Harvard violated the Massachusetts “tip law” by withholding service charges from employees awaits hearing by a federal judge, who will determine whether the case should be tried in a federal or state court.
The suit, which was filed in September on behalf of the Faculty Club and Loeb House wait staff, moved from the Middlesex County Superior Court to the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Oct. 23 at the request of the defendant, Harvard University.
Harvard’s “Notice of Removal” from state court argued that the relationship between the University and its employees was governed by its collective bargaining agreement, and the Labor Management Relations Act transforms the plaintiff’s claims into a federal matter. However, The wait staff argues that since the lawsuit refers to a state law, the case should be tried in a Massachusetts state court.
The complaint, which was originally filed on Sept. 20, stated that patrons of the Faculty Club and Loeb House pay a surcharge that “appears to patrons and guests to be a service charge that is added to food and beverage bills in lieu of a gratuity.” The University tells guests not to tip otherwise, but, according to the complaint, Harvard keeps the service charge for its own operating expenses.
Only days before the complaint was filed, the Harvard Club of Boston, an entity distinct from the University, settled a “tip law” suit with its wait staff for $4 million.
The wait staff’s attorney, Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, who also represented the Harvard Club workers in their suit, said that she had filed a motion for the case to be returned to state court.“This has nothing to do with the collective bargaining agreement,” she said. “We’re suing under state wage laws.”
She said she thought it insensible for workers not to receive surcharges because their contract does not mention what a state law does. “It’s kind of crazy to say that wait staff employees are in worse shape because they’re members of a union than if they weren’t,” Liss-Riordan said.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote that the purpose of the surcharge was clear to employees and customers, and that while the Faculty Club and Loeb House do not pay their workers with tips, their hourly wage is set by a contract negotiated with the staff’s union, UNITE HERE! Local 26.
These arguments also appeared in the University’s answer to the complaint, along with 16 affirmative defenses.
Liss-Riordan said that she did not know when the hearing to decide the case’s placement would take place, but that it would likely happen in the next few months.

After Massachusetts residents voted in favor of legalizing the use of medical marijuana on Tuesday, the jury is still out about whether the new legislation means that the University will allow the use of the substance on campus once the law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2013.
According to University administrators, discussions have not yet decided whether Harvard may also consider allowing University Health Services to prescribe medical marijuana, granting doctors the ability to authorize the medical use of the substance by students.
According to the website of William F. Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the new law will allow qualifying patients—those who are diagnosed with debilitating conditions such as cancer and HIV/AIDS—to possess as much as a 60-day supply of marijuana for personal medical use.
However, because marijuana is still an illegal drug on the federal level, the decision to allow student use of the substance on campus could potentially violate a number of federal regulations including the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug-Free Workplace Act.
The school could potentially risk losing its federal funding if it were to honor these prescriptions. This would suspend federal aid from the hundreds of Harvard students who typically receive it every year.
According to the Harvard Office of Federal Relations, the federal government provided Harvard College more than $17 million of the total $180 million allotted for financial aid, in the 2010 school year.
Many states that allow the general use of medical marijuana have restricted use of the substance on their college campuses.
In Arizona, where the use of medical marijuana was legalized in 2010, the use of the substance on college campuses was banned earlier this year, regardless of whether a student had a prescription.
Similarly, university officials in Colorado and Washington, where marijuana has been legalized for recreational use, have prohibited its use on their campuses.
The University does not anticipate taking immediate action regarding medical marijuana use on campus.
Paul J. Barreira, director of HUHS, wrote in an email, “The law to legalize the use of medical marijuana was just passed this week, so it will take time for the governing bodies to determine the policies around this new law.
"HUHS will not make any decisions or changes until the policies have been outlined, and we are able to do an internal review assessing our patient population and the need for this treatment.”

A new study conducted by Harvard Kennedy School assistant professor Todd T. Rogers revealed that campaign efforts by independent political organizations have a significant influence on the outcome of ballot measures.
The study, co-writtem with New York University professor Joel A. Middleton, was the first empirical assessment of the effects of campaigning on the results of ballot initiative races.
Ballot initiatives are used in a variety of states to tackle issues ranging from education policy to the legalization of medical marijuana. “Ballot initiatives are an increasingly impactful aspect of our democratic process and we were interested to see whether the outcomes of these initiatives could be influenced by interest groups,” Middleton said.
While the use of ballot initiatives in many states has been justified for their relative lack of outside influences, the study shows that the time and money spent by independent groups in circulating pamphlets, identifying voters, and other forms of campaigning are effective in swaying the minds of the public towards desired policy positions.
“People often advocate for these ballot initiatives because it takes the influence of lobbyists out of the process,” Rogers said. “But our research pretty strongly argues that either advocating for or advocating against, these campaigns can have an effect.”
The study was the first of its kind to study ballot initiatives through the use of a randomized field experiment, in which the voting behavior of residents was tracked and compared.
“There was a lot of research, none of it experimental,” Rogers said.” We were able to evaluate the impact of this kind of treatment costlessly, unobtrusively, accurately, and precisely.”
The study evaluated the impacts of ballot guides sent by Defend Oregon, a political action committee, to roughly 18 percent of Oregon Households during the 2008 election. Rogers and Middleton discoverer that in 10 to 12 initiative races, there was a greater percentage of success in precincts that received the guides than those that had not. The authors state that Defend Oregon’s actions may have even changed the final outcome in two of the contests.
The researchers hope that their results will spark a national discussion on the role of political organizations in campaigns.
“I think we, in our democratic system, should have a vigorous debate over whether that kind of money and expense is free speech or whether it’s a less positive force of influence in our democratic system,” Middleton said.
“Now that we know that these things truly can be effective, we need to ask ourselves whether we want the outcomes to be influenced or if we want to put regulations in place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thomas K. McCraw, Sr., who expanded the teaching of business history at the Harvard Business School and won the Pulitzer Prize for his book “The Prophets of Regulation,” died in Cambridge, Mass. on Sat., Nov. 3.
He was 72.McCraw, who joined the HBS faculty in 1978 and retired in 2006, led the School’s Research Seminar in business history and developed the curriculum for many MBA courses—including a popular elective called “The Coming of Managerial Capitalism.”
“When he arrived at HBS, business history teaching as such was relatively limited for the MBAs,” said Geoffrey G. Jones, a professor and faculty chair of the HBS’s Business History Initiative.
“McCraw was a leading part of the team which took a course of 30 people and turned it into a course which had between 300 and 400 MBAs a year doing American business history.”
While managing the School’s department on Business, Government, and the International Economy, McCraw actively recruited outside historians, economists, and political scientists guided by the vision that MBA students “needed an interdisciplinary view of the global environment,” Jones said.
“The fact that we have a strong group of seven, maybe eight historians here at the Business School...that’s thanks to Tom,” said Richard H. K. Vietor, a professor of business administration at HBS.
McCraw used biographical narrative throughout his own research to represent economic concepts such as capitalism, innovation, and regulation.
In “The Prophets of Regulation,” McCraw told the stories of four American intellectuals who shaped public policy by addressing economic regulation in different time periods and government sectors.“
It was beautifully researched,” Vietor said. “[McCraw] went through, and each paragraph and sentence he made as clear and readable as possible, so that the book would not only be of great value to scholars and graduate students, but very readable for, say, an undergraduate student.”
McCraw continued to write books after retiring from the Business School; his most recent work, “The Founders and Finance,” was published in October of this year, and he was planning a book about immigrant entrepreneurs to be published in 2015.“
McCraw recruited me here and then he oversaw my first years here,” Jones said.
“It’s always been challenging for historians to build a credible identity at the Business School, so he was important as a mentor and then as a confidant.”
McCraw is survived by his wife, Susan, his son Thomas, Jr., his daughter, Elizabeth, and three grandchildren.

Like hundreds of political dignitaries and leaders before them, the eight candidates vying for 2013 Undergraduate Council President and Vice President sat at the center of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday evening to participate in the first-ever public UC election debate.
“I’m a little nervous, as you may tell. This is a big stage to be on,” Spenser R. Goodman ’14 said, eliciting nods from his fellow candidates.
More than fifty students gathered to watch the presidential and vice presidential hopefuls field questions and defend their platforms at the debate, which was moderated by IOP Director and former Kentucky Secretary of State C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94. The event was sponsored by nearly a dozen student organizations and the Harvard College Women’s Center.
During the debate, student representatives from several on-campus groups asked the candidates five prepared questions that reflected their membership’s most pressing concerns. Most questions centered around diversity on campus—particularly in leadership positions.
Presidential candidate Michael C. George ’14 answered that his ultimate goal is to make the UC the most inclusive body on campus.
“The UC is the only representative body on campus and we are at our biggest when we represent every single group and every single student,” said George, who is also a Crimson news editor. “We want to foster campus discussion on what it means to be a diverse community.”
Similarly, presidential candidate Akshay M. Sharma ’14 and his running mate Akanksha Sharma ’14 said their whole platform hinges on making every student feel welcome. They are pursuing the creation of a University council and community council to discuss these issues.
“We want to connect the different student groups through executive emails and dialogues because the UC is a body that represents many student interests,” Akshay said.
Candidates made clear throughout their responses the differences between their platforms and those of the other tickets. Goodman and his running mate Darren C. McLeod ’14, an inactive Crimson sports editor, said promoting social life is central to their platform.
In this vein, Goodman said that he believes social programming is the strongest way to promote a more integrated community.
“One of the main goals of our platform is to provide safe, inclusive, and fun events that people can come to and make friends,” he said. “Our direction is promoting social life.”
Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14, a Crimson photo editor, on the other hand, said they are “demanding relevance” on campus. They are the first all-female ticket running for the UC in the past four years.
“We see the UC as becoming increasingly irrelevant on campus, but we see a way for it to positively influence our lives as students,” Raghuveer said. “People have asked me why we’re demanding relevance and not action, but relevance comes with action.”
Candidates were divided, however, when asked if they would allow the UC to take a stance on politically charged issues, such as debates over responsible University investments and the Occupy movement in the past.
“If we understand it to be a student need to take a stance on particular issues, then we will,” Akshay said.
George agreed but added that he did not think the UC should be a divisive body. “I think we should be a uniting body that gets students to rally behind issues that they care about,” he said.
The other two tickets, on the other hand, didn’t believe the UC should involve itself in highly politicized issues. “We don’t want to make students feel uncomfortable in taking on a position on such issues,” Goodman said.
Raghuveer agreed and said that the UC’s role is simply to determine the student body’s stance on such issues through referendums and Q-guide surveys. “It should be telling the administration and the world that this is what the student body thinks,” she said.
Current UC vice president Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 closed the debate by asking students to take the initiative and vote.
“The UC will be launching a huge voter turnout campaign so make sure you get out and vote,” she said.
Voting opens on Nov. 13.

With his office door on the first floor of the Science Center always open, it’s obvious Gregory Tucci loves talking to students. As the leader of introductory science classes such as Life and Physical Sciences A and Physical Sciences 11, he has become the face of Harvard’s Chemistry department. However, few, including Tucci himself, would have guessed that he would become so active in this field. The Harvard Crimson sat down with the Senior Lecturer in Chemistry and Chemical Biology to talk about chemistry and teaching.
The Harvard Crimson [THC]: Why did you become interested in chemistry?Gregory Tucci [GC]: When I applied to college, I loved biology. In high school, I took all biology courses. I even did a senior project on snails and how they grew in these aquariums. I would put them in different environments to see how the snails were doing. I thought biology was the best thing in the world and I loved it. Then, my guidance counselor told me that everyone loves biology and don’t put it down on your college applications because it makes it harder to get in. He said that nobody likes chemistry. He said to put chemistry down and that way I’d be much more likely to get into college. Now, that sounded like a great idea. So I put down chemistry. Then, when I got to college, I had a teacher whose name is Oliver Ludwig—which is kind of a great name don’t you think? He was the best teacher I had ever had in my entire life. I understood everything that he said and I fell in love with chemistry. And that’s how I became a chemistry major.
THC: Do you have any advice for students headed into careers for science?GC: I think you can do so many more things with a science degree now, in 2012, than you could do in 1989 when I graduated with my degree. You have many more possibilities...people who have these degrees have a huge range of capabilities. It is nice to have all these opportunities and see the things you could do out there. Enjoy all the opportunities you have.
THC: What would you tell an incoming freshman who is  terrified of chemistry?GC: I would tell them not to be terrified of chemistry! Everyone in this department knows that people are terrified of chemistry. Think about it: You go to a party, people ask what you do and you say “chemistry,” and they take a step back and make this face. It happens every time. So, we’re well aware of this and we don’t want this to be happening. We want you to love chemistry. We understand that some people are terrified and we want to make you love the subject.
THC: When people imagine chemistry class, they think of amazing live demonstrations. Which is your favorite?GC: You know what? My favorite demonstration is one—the demonstration staff here do it, so we have to have a plug for them—where you take liquid nitrogen and put it into a plastic soda bottle. You put the plastic soda bottle in warm water and put a giant trash can on top of it. Once the liquid becomes a gas, it takes the trash can and sends it up to the ceiling of the Science Center. It is awesome. You don’t expect it’s happening and you don’t see anything until the trash can goes “Wooo” and just launches up. It is a great demonstration. I love it.

Scientists have long believed that redheads, with their fair skin and hair, are more sensitive to sunlight than others. Last week, a team of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital strengthened the case with new findings suggesting that they have an increased risk of developing melanoma even in the absence of UV radiation.
The study, published in the journal “Nature” and led by Harvard Medical School professor David E. Fisher, originally aimed to explore how moles develop into melanoma in the presence of UV radiation. The researchers examined this phenomenon in mice, breeding one group to express a pigment-producing gene that causes red hair and fair skin while the other group expressed a dark-colored pigment. The next step in their plans was to expose the mice to UV radiation in order to examine how the rate of melanoma development differed between the two groups.
However, the researchers noticed that the “redheaded” mice developed melanoma even before they were exposed to UV radiation.
“The real surprise in this is that we were anticipating to provide UV radiation because UV is so associated with melanoma risk...but what we observed is that the redheaded mice developed melanoma...at a high rate even before we could get to the point of delivering the UV,” said Fisher, who is also the Head of the MGH Department of Dermatology. “One of our initial responses was to get a meter and go into the animal room to make sure that the bulbs were not actually emitting UV radiation by mistake.
The authors concluded that the actual pigment responsible for red hair and fair skin is the root of the carcinogenic effects. “We know that UV is not the only important factor in redheads now and redheads may need to be more thorough in checking themselves and more cautious because it’s not just a question of sun exposure,” said Dunster House resident Annie M. Morgan ’13, a co-author of the paper. “We know it’s not just UV so then the question is: what is the whole spectrum of factors that add up to predispose people to melanoma?”
The researchers cautioned that this does not mean that people can expose themselves to UV radiation without concern.
According to Devarati Mitra, a lead researcher in this study and a Harvard MD/PhD student and Cabot House Resident Tutor, the role of UV radiation in melanoma development is still significant.
“You definitely still need to wear sunscreen and cover up and all of that is unchanged by our results,” Mitra said. “But our results suggest that in addition to that UV effect there is an intrinsic risk of melanoma in individuals who primarily have this red color...so our data does not contradict what was known before but it adds a new dimension.”
According to Fisher, the next stage in advancing this research involves identifying specific traits of molecules that could block the damage caused by this red pigment.
“The class of molecules that we expect might have this activity are actually antioxidants—and though antioxidants are quite popular, we emphasize that not all antioxidants are the same and some may even increase the oxidative damage,” he said. “So we do not under any circumstances recommend that people try their own antioxidant remedies and pour pomegranate juice on their skin, because not only may it not work but it may actually worsen the process.”

Harvard Medical School Professor and Radcliffe Institute fellow Joan V. Ruderman will pioneer the next era of the Marine Biological Laboratory as its first female president.
After over 30 years of involvement with the MBL, first as a student and subsequently as a teacher and lab director, Ruderman will leave HMS to “continue to strengthen and build the three different arms of MBL: research, summer courses, and the visiting researcher program,” she said.
The international, non-profit lab, founded with the partial mission of educating women in biology, will celebrate its 125th anniversary next year. Ruderman has already begun planning the anniversary gala, which will also celebrate the success of the MBL’s recent capital campaign. Accoring to Ruderman, part of her excitement about leading the institute derives from the opportunity to continue expanding the opportunities MBL affords to students.
“I’m hoping to make it better and continue to work for better sources of funding to sustain all of the great projects,” she said.
Since women have traditionally comprised a small minority of scientific and research communities, Ruderman’s appointment serves as a milestone for women in science. However, she said she has not felt personally inhibited by her gender in her studies, especially in the 21st century.
“We’re in an era where there are women presidents at Harvard, Princeton, MIT,” Ruderman said. “That glory goes to the women in the generation that preceded me. Women were already in the conversation when I arrived on the scene.
Despite Ruderman’s positive experience as a woman in science, the gender disparity in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—persists in quantifiable ways.
While women made up 48 percent of the work force in 2009, they accounted for only 24 percent of the jobs in STEM fields, according to a U.S. Dept. of Commerce study published last August.
Ruderman welcomes discussion of the role of gender in academia, but her advice to aspiring women scientists applies equally to both sexes, she said.
“Build on things that you feel confident about,” Ruderman said. “Bounce back and move on. Don’t be shy or hesitant about making connections.”
Ruderman enrolled in MBL’s summer embryology course the summer after she completed graduate school. While working as a cellular biology professor at HMS, Ruderan spent her summers at the MBL, teaching courses and leading research on cell division cycles.
The MBL maintains many ongoing relationships with academic institutions around the world, including Harvard and the University of Cambridge, from its base in Massachusetts.
“Joan has excellent insights, leadership skills and a long history with the MBL in many capacities, giving her a broad knowledge of the institution,” wrote MBL Chief Academic and Scientific Officer Joshua W. Hamilton in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
“I am delighted she is coming on board as MBL President and Director and look forward to working closely with her to advance our institution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 10, 2012, at 12:01 a.m.
A study published recently in Nature found new genetic links between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, two autoimmune gut diseases that affect as many as 1.4 million people in the United States. The research was an immense collaborative effort, combining 75,000 data samples from 80 institutions including the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital—both affiliated with Harvard Medical School—and the the Broad Institute.
“What this study shows is that by looking at genetic information for a large number of patients and controls you could map a genetic architecture of Crohn’s disease and colitis,” said Harvard Medical School Professor Ramnik Xavier, one of the study’s authors.“We used genome-wide association studies in combination with fine mapping tools ... to identify genetic factors that either increase or decrease the risk for developing these diseases.”
Crohn’s disease and colitis, collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both involve inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Colitis only affects the colon, while Crohn’s disease can affect any gastrointestinal area from the mouth to the anus.
Over the past decade, many genes related to Crohn’s and colitis have been discovered. Evidence for a genetic basis of the diseases was first uncovered in 2000. But in 2005, only two genes linked to the diseases had been determined. Now, 163 IBD loci, or genetic regions, are known--71 of which were identified in this study.
“When we examined the 163 loci that are associated with either disease, we found that many risk factors are shared between the two diseases, which much fewer unique factors for each disease,” said Xavier, who is also a senior associate member of the Broad Institute and Chief of Gastroenterology and Director of the Center for the Study of IBD at Massacusetts General Hospital.
With his lab’s own data, Xavier and his team were able to identify some pathways associated with the diseases but were unable to pinpoint the exact genes. But upon compiling the data from many different labs, the authors were able to identify the specific genes linked with these conditions.
From the 163 loci, the researchers found that some of the genes associated with IBD are also linked with risk of type 1 diabetes and psoriasis, a skin disease, suggesting that “there may be genetic elements targeting the immune system that might increase the risk of autoimmune diseases.”
Newly-discovered genetic predispositions for these diseases, such as those uncovered in this study, “point to novel clues in disease pathogenesis,” Xavier said, adding that “we now better appreciate the importance of innate immune responses and how...bacteria in the gut affect the diseases.”
He noted that genetic findings of this study also reveal information “about disease risk, onset, progression of disease, complications, and response to treatment” that will help scientists design personalized care for patients in the future.

Like most biologists, Luke P. Thornburg ’13 spends his time in the lab interacting with living subjects. But unlike many researchers, Thornburg sings to his subjects—and they sing back to him.
Thornburg works in the Avian Cognition Lab at Brandeis University with two African Grey Parrots named Griffin and Arthur. Since this February, he has been investigating the evolutionary relationship between parrots and humans.
“Parrots are a lot closer to humans than we thought,” said Thornburg, who is an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator with a secondary field in Psychology.
The Lowell House resident discovered animal cognition research last fall after taking comparative psychologist Irene M. Pepperberg’s seminar Psychology 980f, “Animal Cognition.” Pepperberg holds appointments in both Brandeis and Harvard’s psychology departments.
Thornburg said that he’s “always been an animal fan,” but until the seminar, his only experience with birds was time with his sister’s pet cockatiel.
He added that learning about Pepperberg’s research parrot Alex inspired him to try animal cognition research for himself.
“We read a lot of papers on Alex...I learned a lot about different [bird] species but a whole lot of [Pepperberg’s] personal stories were inspiring,” Thornburg said.
Pepperberg said that accepting Thornburg on her research team was a no-brainer.
“He wrote probably one of the most innovative finals I’ve seen,” she said. “When he asked to work in the lab, I instantly said yes.”
Currently, Thornburg’s research focuses on how parrots socialize and judge the size of objects in their environment. He spends nine hours a week at the cognition lab working with Griffin and Arthur.
“[Thornburg’s] been one of the most professional and dedicated students that I have,” said Suzanne Gray, the Avian Cognition Lab manager. “He always shows extreme interest and very careful, thought-through work. He’s a great person to brainstorm with when things aren’t going exactly as planned.”
Before Thornburg joined the lab, Griffin and Alex had been trained to recognize colors and objects. Now in his own research, Thornburg presents pairs of differently-sized colored cups and asks his parrots which one they think is the larger of the two. He works primarily with Griffin, as Arthur does not like to work with male scientists and is the less sociable of the two.
“[Griffin] has good days and bad days,” Thornburg said. “It’s not like you’re testing a bacterial strain or an organism that’s going to do the same thing every time. [Parrots] are temperamental animals and so they’re definitely affected by mood and what day it is."
Thornburg’s also studies the idea of “reciprocal altruism”: how animals offer gifts or acts of kindness to others.
Aside from his research, Thornburg is active in the Harvard Glee Club, a Christian fellowship group, and the Harvard Story-Time Players. The Players put on shows for children in hospitals and after-school programs.
Still, Thornburg says his work with Griffin is one of the most prominent parts of his life.
“At the end of the day, when [Griffin’s] happy we’re done with the work, he’ll just start singing to himself,” Thornburg said.
“I’m kind of not supposed to sing along. I’m supposed to...get him to talk out his feelings and not just sing about it [but] sometimes I’ll sing along anyway.”

Hurricane Sandy brought with her not only devastating floods and forceful winds, but also a flurry of speculation about global warming and its relation to the unusual scale of the storm.
Marked by 80-110 mile per hour winds and 13 foot high flood tides, the post-tropical cyclone was one of the largest storms to afflict the East Coast in years. Although any given storm cannot be attributed to such a broad phenomenon as global warming, research has shown that warmer waters due to climate change contributed to the storm’s intensity. In particular, warmer temperatures can give hurricanes fuel to grow larger and travel farther.
“I know a lot of scientists are reluctant to make the connection, because I know there’s not a lot of direct evidence, but it’s very likely, and it’s definitely not making things better,” said Leverett House Eco-Representative Courtland A. Kelly ’13.
Another factor induced by global warming that may have contributed to the scale of the storm is the shifting of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which accounts for the difference in atmospheric pressure between the South Arctic and North Atlantic regions. As Arctic waters grow increasingly warm, the NAO trends negative during the autumn and winter, according to recent research by Charles Greene and colleagues at Cornell University. One of these shifts caused a jet stream to sweep across the U.S., Canada, and the Atlantic, which coincided with the arrival of Hurricane Sandy.
Although there are factors that amplified the behavior of Hurricane Sandy, many experts caution that a single storm cannot be directly linked to global warming so simply.
Although there are factors that amplified the behavior of Hurricane Sandy, many experts caution that a single storm cannot be directly linked to global warming so simply.
Others express their concern that the focus of Hurricane Sandy should not be on its potential relationship with global warming, but rather on improving the country’s infrastructure so that we will be better prepared for future storms and prevent extensive destruction and loss of life. Sandy alone is reported to have incurred $20 billion worth in damages.
“With or without climate change, we have unusually large events. I think it’s beyond statistical capacity to link the two,” said Environmental Engineering professor John Briscoe.
“These are very complex phenomena. I would spend far less time thinking, 'Is this climate change?' I would like to see the Crimson and the students at Harvard concerned about the infrastructure; learn how to build infrastructure and finance infrastructure,” he said.
Indeed, Hurricane Sandy has opened eyes and raised concern and awareness, having prompted scholars and government officials to critically examine the nation’s infrastructural failings in the national press as well as shed light on the potential of global warming to exacerbate future meteorological events.
“I hope that Hurricane Sandy can prove to be a wake-up call and move us away from the silence seen throughout the 2012 political campaigns, and spark a broader conversation about how important climate change is and continues to be,” said Cabot House Eco-Representative Isabella A. Wechsler '13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christian Webster had a slew of questions running through his mind as he walked into Lavietes Pavilion on that September afternoon that has been etched into his memory.
Webster can still remember the exact questions he pondered as he entered the gymnasium: What am I going to say to the team? How am I supposed to act now? What am I going to do without my friends?
Just hours had passed since the senior had received a piece of shocking news: men’s basketball co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry—Webster’s teammates, blockmates, and best friends since he arrived at Harvard back in 2009—were withdrawing from the College in the wake of the Gov. 1310 cheating scandal.
The news, which struck many because of its implications for the Ivy League men’s basketball title race, hit Webster on a personal level.
Curry and Casey’s departure also put Webster in an unexpected position; with the co-captains gone, Webster was now the team’s most experienced returning player.
All of these thoughts swirled through Webster’s mind as he entered Lavietes Pavilion that afternoon for the first practice of his Harvard career without his closest friends by his side. But Webster didn’t have much time to feel sorry for himself or his friends—or to think at all, for that matter.
Moments after Webster’s arrival, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker called the team together, and soon the spotlight shifted to the soft-spoken Webster, who was asked to address the team.
“The season must go on,” Webster recalls telling his teammates. “I know those are our boys—those are my closest friends—but we still have a season to play, and we can still win the Ivy League, and we can still do everything we wanted to do. We still have enough talent in this gym right now to do as much as we want.”
That afternoon, Webster became the Crimson’s leader.
“It definitely felt like it was out of a movie scene,” recalls sophomore Jonah Travis of Webster’s speech. “He just told us we can’t get hung up over [the loss of Curry and Casey]—this can’t be the season where we say, ‘Oh, we didn’t have these guys.’ He just said [that] we need to keep going, keep going strong.”
In early October, Travis and the rest of his Crimson teammates formally voted Webster and junior Laurent Rivard to be Harvard’s co-captains—a position Webster did not anticipate assuming when he returned to campus in August.
“I wasn’t prepared for it at all,” says Webster, who admits that vocal leadership isn’t something that comes naturally to him. “It was a little awkward at first. Everyone was kind of looking toward me for guidance.”
But heading into the Crimson’s season opener against MIT on Friday, Webster has adjusted to his new position.
“I’m not really a yeller, but if something is going wrong, I’ll huddle the team up,” he says. “It’s different for me to be more vocal, but it’s helped me grow a lot.”
Returning to the court has also helped Webster deal with the absence of his blockmates from the team.
“I still have times when it’s tough. I just try to work through it,” Webster says. “When I play basketball, I don’t think about anything [other] than what’s at hand.”
Webster is looking forward to tipping off the season for another reason as well: to prove that his performance last year was an anomaly.
After finishing second on the Crimson in scoring and earning an All-Ivy honorable mention as a sophomore, Webster had a disappointing junior campaign. His scoring average more than halved—dropping from 13.0 points per game to 4.5—and he attempted just 15 free throws (down from 123 a season before).
“I was getting caught up in people trying to tell me what to do, and I was trying to do different things,” Webster says. “I don’t know, it was just a lot of things going on mentally, and I was just not in tune.”
Over this past summer, Webster added another element to his on-court training. For hours, Webster pored over game tapes from a season ago, trying to pinpoint exactly what went wrong.
“It just looked like I wasn’t myself,” he says. “I wasn’t taking the shots that I usually take, and I wasn’t making the shots that I usually make.”
If the Crimson is going to compete for a conference title, all of that will have to change—something of which both Webster and Amaker are well aware.
“We’re going to need Christian to play very well for us,” Amaker says. “We need for him to be efficient, make open shots, to be as he was as a sophomore. That’s what we’re expecting, what we need, and he knows it.”
With the backing of his teammates, the co-captain believes he can return to his old ways.
“That my teammates want me to lead the team is the best compliment you can get,” Webster says. “I feel really confident right now in the team and myself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some teams, losing someone whom coach Kathy Delaney-Smith calls one of the best point guards in the Ivy League might be crippling.
But not for Harvard.
Despite the graduation of a first-team All-Ivy selection in point guard Brogan Berry, the Crimson women’s basketball team is looking to reach the top of the Ivy League this season for the first time since 2008.
“Our chances [of winning the Ivy title] are even better this year than last year,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis says. “We’re more experienced, and we have four starters coming back. We’re really stepping up and fulfilling the roles that we need to and I think that is going to allow us to achieve our goal of winning the title this year.”
That’s not to say that Berry won’t be missed on the team. The guard, who ranks sixth in points and second in assists in Harvard history, led the team to three second-place league finishes and the first Ivy victory in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
“Brogan was really the main leader for what we did on the court as well as [being] a huge encourager during practices and workouts,” co-captain Miriam Rutzen says. “When things got tough, or when we needed someone to take care of the ball under tough defensive pressure, or the game was on the line, you could always depend on Brogan to be able to handle that and make the big plays and really be calm and collected.”
This year, the team will see the responsibilities of a traditional point guard role spread across a number of different players.
“Brogan was a consummate point guard, and I will not try to fill her shoes,” Delaney-Smith says. “I’ve tweaked our system so that we don’t rely as heavily on a point guard, and I think our team is doing a terrific job. Instead of one person stepping into the shoes, it’s the team stepping up, and so far it’s working.”
The new system, Curtis says, will enable the team to take advantage of fast-break opportunities, hopefully leading to easy baskets.
“We’re really emphasizing the ability to handle pressure and have everyone on the team have that ability,” Curtis explains. “[That way] if a shot goes up, anyone who gets that rebound is able to take the ball and dribble it up the court so that we can attack our opponents and hit them quick.”
Although players like Curtis, junior guard Christine Clark, and freshman Kit Metoyer will still play the traditional role of the point guard when needed, the new system will allow for players to display a wider range of abilities.
“We’re putting in a whole new offensive system where anyone can run point guard, whether they’re the shortest or tallest person on our team,” co-captain Emma Golen says. “This is going to be very, very big for us.”
For the returning veteran guards—Clark and seniors Elle Hagedorn and Victoria Lippert—the new year will bring another chance to lead the team past three-time defending champion Princeton for the Ancient Eight crown.
“I think that we should win the Ivy League title this year,” Clark says. “We’re one year older, so we’ve played together for one more year—we know each other that much better.”
Clark, who averaged 15.3 points per game last year—fifth-best in the league—was named to the 2011-12 All-Ivy League First Team alongside Berry. Lippert finished third on the team in scoring and enters her senior year with 1,108 career points after being named to the All-Ivy League second team three times.
Curtis, though an underclassmen, says that she hopes to take on some of the leadership roles that Berry filled while playing in crimson. Curtis says she has certain qualities that may allow her to fill Berry’s old role more easily.
“[Delaney-Smith] used to say that I had ‘Broganesque tendencies,’” Curtis says. “Brogan and I were very similar, we’re both from the Midwest, and on the court we had similar skills. I’ve tried to fulfill that role of a leader on the court verbally, kind of [directing] players. I definitely learned a lot from Brogan, so I’m hoping to use what she’s taught me and use my skills to better the team this year.”
Two freshmen guards, Metoyer and Shilpa Tummala, look to factor into Harvard’s new scheme as well as the pressure will be spread more evenly among all of the players in Delaney-Smith’s new system.
Even though the team has changed and the offense evolved, Brogan’s influence lives on past her graduation.
“Kit’s just come in and done really well and learned from Ali and Clark, who have Brogan’s knowledge as well, so it’s a great little line down the train we have going here,” Golen explains. “Brogan’s legacy is not over—I guess you could say that. And the knowledge of her game is being passed down through the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Siyani Chambers arrived on Harvard’s campus in August, he did so without any preconceived notions about his role as a rookie on the Harvard men’s basketball team.
“I just came here to learn right away and just try to fit in where I fit in,” Chambers says. “If the coaches ask me to do something, I’ll do that to the best of my ability.”
Although the freshman point guard says that his mindset hasn’t changed since then—“There aren’t really any personal goals for me. I’m just trying to go out and do whatever I can to help the team”—the number of minutes Chambers will likely see on the court this season has skyrocketed.
On Sept. 11, Sports Illustrated reported that senior point guard Brandyn Curry, along with classmate Kyle Casey, would miss the 2012-13 campaign after withdrawing from school in the wake of the Gov  1310 cheating scandal. The departure of Curry—who led his team a year ago in assists and steals per game with 4.9 and 1.6, respectively—left the Crimson without the player who ran the offense and energized the defense for an average of over 30 minutes per game. Pair that with the additional loss of point guard Corbin Miller—who is currently serving as a missionary for the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—and Harvard had some serious shoes to fill in the backcourt.
All of a sudden, Chambers was the probable starter at the point. And with this newfound role comes high expectations.
“[A point guard] needs to be someone who can take control of our team, who’s going to be somewhat of a leader/coach on the floor,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker explains. “Thinking about those things right there for a freshman, that’s hard…. But those [are] things we expect out of that position.”
At 5’11” and 170 pounds, the Golden Valley, Minn. native is two inches and 25 pounds smaller than Curry. But according to his teammates, Chambers’ quickness will be an asset for the team.
“Siyani is more of a cut-em-up kind of point guard [than Curry],” co-captain Christian Webster says. “His handle is a lot quicker and tighter just because he’s so much smaller.”
Although Chambers has yet to don a Harvard uniform for regular-season action, Amaker says he’s confident in the abilities of the young guard.
“I’m not sure we’ve had a kid here in my tenure thus far coming in at a level of understanding, of a feel, of picking things up as quickly as [Chambers] has been able to,” Amaker notes. “I think his ball handling and his quickness will be welcome additions to this team.”
“He has a knack for the game that you can’t really teach,” Webster adds.
Chambers is no stranger to high-pressure moments, having led his high school team, Hopkins, to three state championships and a 122-5 record over four years.
“My high school team was pretty competitive, and we had a really good coach,” the lefty playmaker says. “I think that helped ease the transition [to college]. Before I came [to Harvard] I already knew how to work hard…. I think the trait of working hard passed over with me from high school [to] college.”
With that part of the puzzle already in place, Chambers says he can focus on adapting to the nuanced differences between high school and college basketball.
“The college pace of the game is a little faster,” he says. “I think that’s something all of the freshmen will have to get used to, just the speed of the game and the intensity that the game is played at.”
In addition to Chambers, Amaker may also look to sophomores Wesley Saunders and Alex Nesbitt to contribute at the point. Last season, Saunders chipped in 3.3 points per game in 13.9 minutes, while Nesbitt saw action in two contests.
“We need to have…whoever we call on, for whatever limit of time, whether it’s two minutes or 32 minutes, show up prepared and [feel like] we have confidence [in them]and they have confidence in their team,” Amaker says. “Whether that’s Alex Nesbitt, Wes Saunders, whoever it is, we want to feel like our guys are prepared.”
And although Amaker, a former point guard himself, admits he will be likely be “more demanding” on those at that position than any other, the coach seems optimistic as the Crimson begins the 2012-13 campaign Friday night against MIT.
“I’ve been impressed early on with Siyani, his ability to see things [on the court]…his instincts, his intelligence,” Amaker says. “He picks things up very easily, so we want to pace ourselves with him. It’s a long season, he’s a young guy, [and] it’s all brand new.”

“We’ve always had a focal point of our offensive philosophy,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker says. “That’s the inside presence. Our program was built around that. The main constant across my time here is that we want to play inside-out.”
Over the past two seasons, Keith Wright ’12 and Kyle Casey have accounted for 34 percent of the Crimson’s points and almost half of its rebounds. Now, Harvard finds itself without the two first-team All Ivy performers and their production. In order to maintain the offensive philosophy that has brought Amaker’s teams at least a share of the last two Ivy League titles, a trio of sophomores will be asked to step into the spotlight in the frontcourt.
“Those three guys up front have to become a core group,” Amaker says. “They’re the ones that are leading us up front.”
Then-freshmen Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis appeared in nearly every game last year, averaging 4.9 and 2.4 points per game, respectively, off the bench. Classmate Kenyatta Smith—the highest rated recruit of the bunch—only saw the floor for a combined 17 minutes last season. Entering the 2012-13 campaign, the fate of the Crimson will be determined in large part by the group’s ability to fill the shoes of Casey and Wright in the paint.
“Obviously [the sophomores] are going to have to give us a lot down low,” co-captain Christian Webster says. “Those are our guys. We’re going to count on them for a lot of points, a lot of rebounds, and post defense. Our offense goes through the big men—I don’t think that will change now.”
In late August, Harvard traveled to Italy for a four-game exhibition tour. Smith—who ESPN rated as the No. 17 center in the country as a high school senior—registered 10 rebounds against Rieti and 15 points against Bassano Basket, both in victories. At 6’8” and 250 pounds, Smith will be asked to fill Wright’s role as a back-to-the-basket enforcer in the paint.
“Our games are similar, but I wouldn’t say the same,” Smith says. “I’ve always been a catch-the-ball-low-in-the-post kind of guy, using my body to get to the rim and whatever moves I can with my back to the basket.”
With the new opportunity laid in front of him, Smith devoted the summer to improving in order to positively impact the team.
“Freshman year didn’t pan out the way that I wanted it to or expected it to,” Smith says. “So I just put that behind me and focused on getting in shape and doing what I had to do to prove myself on the floor and make an impact on the program. That’s always been my goal.”
Harder to replace may be the dynamic athletic presence that Casey provided. Sophomore Wesley Saunders should fill some of that role, but Moundou-Missi and Travis will be tasked with replicating Casey’s offensive versatility and aggressiveness on the boards.
“For me [this summer] was mainly [dedicated to] ball handling,” Moundou-Missi says. “Keith and Kyle were both great in the post, rebounding the ball well. We need to be vocal on defense and active on offense.”
At 6’7,” the athletic Moundou-Missi boasts a similar frame to Casey. And with a developing outside game, the sophomore may resemble Casey in more ways than one.
As a freshman, Moundou-Missi recorded 16 blocks while shooting 53.8 percent from the floor. In fact, last season Moundou-Missi and Casey’s per-minute production was roughly the same.
Despite playing just 6.5 minutes per game last year, Travis made his impact felt—particularly on the boards. At an undersized 6’6,” Travis managed to pull down rebounds against bigger opponents. Against a Seattle University front line that averaged just over 6’9” on Dec. 4, 2011, Travis had his signature game of the season. The then-freshman recorded a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds.
“[My aggressiveness on the boards] definitely comes from my dad,” Travis says. “He always pushed me, always beat the crap out of me. In the driveway there was no holding back. My high school coach was the same way. I realized early that either I work hard or I don’t play.”
The group continues to push each other every day in practice, ever cognizant of the responsibility that has fallen on their shoulders.
“If you’re not on your ‘A’ game every practice, the other guys will give it to you every time,” Travis says. “If you’re not holding your weight in a drill, we’ll catch you.”
In a competitive Ivy League, whether or not Harvard can repeat as conference champions will likely rely on the trio’s ability to hold their own weight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After missing the 2011-12 season due to NCAA regulations, sophomore and Olympian Temi Fagbenle is poised to shake up the Harvard women’s basketball program.
At 6’4”, the forward towers above her teammates—and most of the Ivy League competition. But sitting on the sidelines last season took its toll on Fagbenle and the team, which posted its fourth straight second-place finish in the Ancient Eight. NCAA regulations attempting to control for the flow of European athletes into American collegiate athletics forced Fagbenle to sit a year in residency.
“It was a low point of my athletic career to have to not play for my first year ever,” Fanbegle says. “It was pretty tough to deal with at the time, but, looking back, I believe things happen for a reason, and I think good did come out of it.”
Some of that good for Fagbenle came last spring, when she was selected as the youngest member of Great Britain’s Olympic team. Starting on the U-20 squad, she got on the fast track to the full team following an impressive performance at preparation camp.
Great Britain failed to pick up a win in the Olympic tournament, but Fagbenle played a role in all five games. She averaged 4.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks. Fagbenle says that competing against the top athletes in the world helped her focus on her mental game.
“It’s not just about what kind of moves I can make now,” Fagbenle says. “Seeing the way those top level players saw the floor, thought about the game, reacted to certain situations, and handled pressure was a fantastic learning experience.”
Fagbenle’s teammates recognize that she will be an impact player and credit her for her contribution last year.
“Last season, Temi brought her abilities to the team in the sense that she was able to make us better day in and day out by playing against us [in practice],” co-captain Miriam Rutzen says. “Even though she couldn’t play in games, we were able to practice against that caliber of player throughout the season.”
Fagbenle’s combination of size and skill will add a significant post presence, allowing the other forwards—who range from 6’0” to 6’2”—to match up more evenly with opponents.
“Forwards across the board were asked to step up and play against 6’4” and 6’5” people last year,” Rutzen says. “The experience that we got last year being the undersized underdogs will only make us stronger this year, and now we are playing more natural positions.”
Although Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says that she is not ready to name starters, she acknowledged that Fagbenle will have an enormous impact on Harvard’s offense this season. But the team will have to adjust to accommodate her presence.
“The hard part for Miriam and Emma is they play so well together, so they lose that comfort zone,” Delaney-Smith says. “They are all are learning to play with Temi, which they should because she is a remarkable player.”
According to Delaney-Smith, Fagbenle’s size and skill will impact the game at both ends.
“She’s an incredible shot-blocker,” Delaney-Smith says. “We have a defensive system that is going to be different than what we’ve had [in past seasons]. Offensively, she has great hands. If she misses her first shot, she has a great second jump.”
Fagbenle will be joined by a freshman class that includes guard and top-100 recruit Shilpa Tummala, who committed a year after Fagbenle decided on Harvard. Fagbenle knew she wanted to play basketball in college, but she turned down higher-ranked programs for Harvard’s academics. Although some credit Fagbenle’s decision with increasing the Crimson’s standing for future recruits, Fagbenle says that she does not think about it that way.
“It would be wonderful if I was to hear that someone committed because they wanted to add to the program, and they heard that I was here, but that wasn’t the goal,” Fagbenle says. “I don’t see myself being any kind of crazy superstar. I just want to bring something positive to the team.”
Although she was not able to play or travel last year, Fagbenle feels that the transition will not be difficult, as she spent so much time practicing with her teammates as a freshman. She hopes to contribute to the Crimson’s first Ivy League title since 2008.
“This year, we are working on being a more cohesive team and that will determine whether we win the championship,” Fagbenle says. “It’s not whether we have the talent because we definitely have the talent. If we utilize that and work together to create the best outcome, we will be a force to be reckoned with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With ESPN already having described her as “a proven shooter” who is “active and smooth,” freshman Shilpa Tummala is no stranger to basketball at a high level. But after joining the Harvard women’s hoops squad this year, Tummala now has a role different than any she has had before: that of a collegiate athlete.
While where and who she plays may have dramatically changed this offseason, Tummala says she will bring the same mindset to the court no matter what jersey she is wearing.
“In high school, I was really fortunate to be successful,” Tummala says. “At the college level, I just want to bring that same winning mentality to practice every day. I feel that our team is already very competitive, and I want to keep with that, always bringing the drive to win while learning the ropes of college basketball.”
Though she has been on campus for less than three months, Tummala has spent long hours practicing with her team.  This, she states, has been vital in her shift to both Harvard and this higher stage of basketball.
“It’s a pretty big jump from high school to college play,” Tummala says. “But it’s good to have people around you like that that are supportive step by step. [My teammates] are not just friends, as I know we’re going to grow to be like a family. And on the basketball side, this is definitely reflected on the court.”
Tummala was ranked the No. 69 recruit in the nation by ESPN during her senior year of high school. Shortly after, her St. Mary’s Knights team won its second straight Arizona state championship—by 25 points. And after the season ended, Tummala was named a McDonald’s All-America nominee and placed on her all-state team.
“Shilpa was an incredible high school player,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says. “But there is a transition. I don’t care how good your skill set is, there is a transition to college basketball…. She has the size, the strength, and the court IQ, so it’s probably now more of a matter of just knowing the system and understanding college basketball, what she can get away with and what she can’t. She already has the skill set.”
Describing her transition to the collegiate hoops world, Tummala emphasized conditioning as her biggest hurdle thus far in a Crimson uniform. She said that the change in “pace of play” has been probably the most dramatic difference between high school and college basketball.
Given her track record and publicity, Tummala had her choice of Division I basketball schools. USC, UC Berkeley, and Georgetown—three highly competitive programs—were at the top of her list. Ultimately, Tummala says that picking Harvard was the right choice.
“It’s the perfect fit for me,” Tummala says. “I love it here and couldn’t have made a better decision in my entire life. I’m just thankful that I had this opportunity.”
Now that she’s here, both coach and player agree that her role on the team is yet to be solidified.
“[She contributes] everything,” Delaney-Smith explains. “She is a big-time guard. She is a great shooter…and is a great passer. In order to be a great passer at Harvard, she has to know our system. That’s the learning curve…. But she’s doing great. I’m more than pleased with he. What role she has, though, is still being defined.”
Tummala echoed her coach’s statement, then stressed her willingness to play any part that her teammates and coaches may ask of her.
“I don’t know what my role is [except] just to be positive,” Tummala says. “Regardless of anything, my role will always be to push my teammates to be better and have my teammates pushing me to be better in practice. I want to be aware of what the team needs, and whatever that may be, whatever they want me to do, that’s what I’ll do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You would have to scan far down the list of last season’s leading scorers to find the player whom the Harvard men’s basketball team may most lean on to put the ball in the hoop this year. But the Crimson needs no reminder of how much can change in a year, so it should have no reservations about assigning that role to sophomore Wesley Saunders.
Though Saunders averaged just 3.3 points and 13.9 minutes per game in 2011-12, the departures of Kyle Casey, Brandyn Curry, Oliver McNally ’12, Keith Wright ’12, and Corbin Miller leave Saunders the opportunity to seize a more prominent role on the team this winter. But perhaps more important was Saunders’ own development over the summer, in which the productive stretches he displayed only occasionally a season ago seemed to come more regularly.
“He would be the first to say he worked very hard throughout the summer months to improve himself,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker says. “He was dedicated, he was committed to his workouts, and because you work that hard, I think there’s a level of confidence he felt for himself in how he’s supposed to play.”
During the team’s week-long summer tour of Italy, in which it squared off with four Italian club teams in four different cities, Saunders led the Crimson in scoring, averaging 16.5 points per game to help Harvard secure a perfect 4-0 record.
“He performed incredibly well [and] played hard and efficient,” says Amaker of Saunders’ play in Italy. “He was our best player throughout Italy, which is saying a lot for anyone.”
Though junior co-captain Laurent Rivard—another player on whom the offense will depend heavily—was absent from the Italy trip, the transition from second or third player off the bench to “best player” is remarkable from any perspective. But Amaker noted that such a leap should not be thought of as abnormal, especially for a player who had to adapt all of last season to new circumstances and competition.
“We cannot overstate the value [of transitioning] from one year to the next, going from a freshman on the way to a sophomore,” Amaker says. “There’s a familiarity, a level of comfort with our system, our style, our philosophy.”
But the confidence the coach recognizes as emanating from Saunders is not born simply from another year’s maturity. His teammates have already noticed the difference in one vital aspect of his offensive repertoire: his jump shot.
Confidence can be difficult to come by when a player doesn’t trust his own game, and as a freshman, Saunders certainly didn’t seem sold on his outside shooting—he did not attempt a single three-point shot all of last season, creating most of his offense by slashing into the lane and finishing at the rim.
To improve his jumper, Saunders worked with a shooting coach over the summer, taking 500 to 1,000 practice shots a day. Paired with a workout regimen that included footwork, agility, and jump training, Saunders’ offseason was designed to transform him into a more explosive and well-rounded version of his freshman self.
“Because I put in the work, I feel more comfortable with my shot,” Saunders says. “I’ve got the muscle memory down and can just let it fly.”
According to co-captain Christian Webster, opponents will be forced to respect Saunders’ newfound range, which was on display at Crimson Madness, the team’s intra-squad scrimmage held on Oct. 13.
“He’s just hard to guard now,” Webster says. “[Last year], people could slack off of him like they play [Boston Celtics point guard] Rajon Rondo, but now they’ve got to play up on him. His shot has gotten so much better; it’s much more fluid.”
But in some ways, Saunders’ development should not come as a surprise.  A highly-touted recruit coming out of Windward High in Los Angeles, Calif., Saunders carried with him the prospect of transitioning into a dominant player in the Ivy League. But much of the buzz that surrounded him was predicated on his raw physical gifts, as he possesses a combination of size and speed rarely found in the Ancient Eight. Having begun to round out the rest of his game, Saunders may give the Crimson an early return on the promise he showed last season and in high school.
Of course, Saunders has yet to prove himself consistently in meaningful regular season play, but he doesn’t have long to wait to get his chance. If Harvard is to come close to repeating last season’s run, it will need big contributions from its sophomore class, including forwards Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi. And if Saunders can sustain the level of play his coaches and teammates are trumpeting, the Ivy League may have a new star in the making.
“[The other sophomores] have been putting in just as much work as me, I know that,” Saunders says. “Obviously, we’re going to have different roles, and it’s going to be a challenge to come together as a unit, but it’s not necessarily about me putting up the most points—just me doing the best that I can to help the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s basketball team takes the floor against North Dakota State Friday night, it will mark the beginning of the end for seniors Victoria Lippert and Elle Hagedorn and co-captains Emma Golen and Miriam Rutzen.
The Crimson finished last season with an 18-12 record overall, going 10-4 in conference play—good enough for second in the Ivy League behind an undefeated Princeton team. If Harvard is to improve on last year’s campaign, the four seniors will have much to do with it.
“I thought we were very young last year, but I think we’re very experienced now,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says. “Those four seniors have had a lot of tournament game time under their belt. They’re ready to go, they’re hungry, and they’re angry that we let last year slip away from us.”
Having experienced second-place Ancient Eight finishes in each of their three seasons, the seniors have learned what it takes to achieve success on the court and have grown close along the way.
“I love these girls,” Lippert says. “Emma, Miriam, and Elle are just awesome teammates and such good friends…. We’re really coming together this year even more because this is our graduation year. Our whole team and the seniors especially are united in that goal of finishing our careers with a title.”
Harvard graduated only two players last year: co-captains Brogan Berry and Lindsay Louie. Berry—who finished her career sixth on the program’s all-time scoring list— averaged 12.9 points per game, led the team with 4.2 assists per contest, and played an average of 35.3 minutes per game last season.
But outside of Berry, the rest of last year’s core will return more experienced and ready to improve on the foundation it built in 2011-12. Players are more familiar and comfortable with each other, something that junior center Elise Gordon attributes to the senior leadership.
“With Miriam and [Emma] being captains this season, they’ve obviously had to step up and take on a larger role,” Gordon says. “But it’s the little things that they do, like coming up to you and making sure you’re okay, and giving you tips, and helping you correct mistakes that you’re making. It’s these kinds of interactions that they’ve really been good at.”
All four seniors played important roles on last season’s squad. Although now-junior guard Christine Clark and Berry led the team in scoring, the next four spots on that list were occupied by this year’s seniors, with Lippert leading the group with 11.7 points per game.
Lippert has been one of the top three Harvard scorers each of her three years on the team. The guard ranks 14th in Crimson history in points and has been named to the All-Ivy Second Team every season.
“[Victoria is] just a flat out scorer in every regard,” Delaney-Smith says. “She’s multidimensional in the way she can score, and she’s got this love of the game. If I had to criticize her it would be because she’s too intense sometimes, and that’s great leadership as well.”
A pass-first player who amassed 4.4 rebounds per game despite playing less than a half on average last season, Hagedorn will almost certainly see more playing time this year with the departure of Berry.
Rutzen has been one of Harvard’s most consistent performers, averaging considerable minutes since her freshman season. Named the Crimson’s best defensive player last season, Rutzen has continued to develop even over the last few months.
“Miriam’s game is at a level I’ve never seen it,” Delaney-Smith explains. “I’m just so pleased with her. She is being a leader in every regard on and off the court.”
Averaging nearly 10 points per game last year, Golen has been a constant force for Harvard both on the wing and down low. The addition of sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who had to sit out last year, will likely change Golen’s role, but Delaney-Smith is confident she will continue to make large contributions both on the floor and in the locker room.
“[Emma] has proven in her four years how unselfish she is and how she puts the team first,” Delaney-Smith says. “I don’t think her leadership will miss a beat, whether she’s the sixth player or a starter. They’re equally important roles, and I think she knows that. She will embrace either role.”
According to both their coaches and teammates, the seniors’ words and actions have created the feeling that every player on the team possesses an important, unique role.
“I couldn’t be more pleased with [the senior] leadership,” Delaney-Smith says. “I’m a big believer in keeping some traditions and creating your own. This is now Miriam and [Emma’s] team, and they’ve really stepped up…. The team chemistry is the best it’s ever been. This is an incredible group of women, and I’m very pleased with where they are right now.”
Though Clark and Fagbenle may account for much of the team’s scoring, this group of seniors will play a key role in the overall success of the team.
“The fact that we have come so close the past few years is extra motivation to really get over that hump now,” Lippert says. “We know that we have such awesome potential, and now it’s a matter of putting it all together at the right time and executing and finishing hard down the stretch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last two years of the Harvard men’s basketball program have been marked by an unceasing series of highs.
From the first-ever Ivy title to the second-ever NCAA tournament appearance, from Linsanity to the Battle 4 Atlantis championship, from landing a top-50 recruit to a Top 25 ranking, coach Tommy Amaker has had his team on a seemingly interminable upswing.
But in September, the path that has revitalized a once-futile program hit a bump in the road when newly-elected co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry reportedly withdrew from the College in the wake of the Gov. 1310 cheating scandal.
Suddenly, a team that was expected to be at least a co-favorite to three-peat as Ivy champs was without a reigning first-team All-Ivy forward in Casey as well as its best perimeter defender and floor general in Curry.
What is left is a collection of mostly unproven young players who will now be thrown into the fire more quickly than anyone expected.
“We’ve seen some growth, and we’ve seen some guys adjust,” says Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad returns just two seniors and one starter. “I like the spirit of this group—they’re giving great effort.... The area we need to increase is our execution.”
Such execution was a key to last year’s success. But this season, not only are Casey and Curry gone but so too are last year’s co-captains, Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, who provided leadership, toughness, and clutch scoring over the course of their decorated careers. Also not to be overlooked is the departure of guard Corbin Miller, who left school to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after emerging as a dangerous sharpshooter a year ago. On the whole, the Crimson returns just one player, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, who averaged more than five points per game last season.
But Amaker is also left with an abundance of potential after accruing some of the Ivy League’s best recruiting classes in recent years. Whether that on-paper talent can bring about on-court success is the largest question heading into the start of the 2012-13 season.
“I think the team looks really good,” co-captain Christian Webster says. “We’ve got a lot of [talented] young guys, especially the sophomores who are going to step up big for us this year.”
One of those young players is freshman Siyani Chambers, the reigning Minnesota Mr. Basketball who is expected to replace Curry at the point. Though Amaker praises the rookie’s maturity and feel for the game, it remains to be seen whether the 6’0” Chambers will be able to handle the challenging task of controlling the flow of games and leading his team in the hostile road environments of the conference season.
“We all have to step up and fill the roles together as a unit,” Chambers says. “I’m just trying to fit in, do what my teammates and coaches ask of me, and continue to work hard.”
Harvard is expecting to get the majority of its points from the wings. If the team is going to compete for a conference championship, it will require a significant leap out of Wesley Saunders, who was named the team’s most improved player at last year’s postseason awards banquet. In 2012-13, Harvard will need the sophomore’s offensive contribution to be far closer to the 16.5 points per game he averaged during the Crimson’s four-game summer trip to Italy—when he led the squad despite the presence of Casey and Curry—than the 3.3 points per contest he contributed last season.
“He was our best player [in Italy], with all the names that were on that trip with us...which I think is saying a lot,” Amaker says. “He worked very hard throughout the summer months to improve himself. He was dedicated, [and] he was committed to his workouts. Because he worked that hard, I think there was a [new] level of confidence he felt in himself.”
“Obviously it’s going to be a different role [for me],” Saunders adds. “It’s not necessarily about me putting up the most points, it’s about me doing the best I can to help the team.”
Any success will also require a bounce-back performance from Webster, who was second on the squad in scoring as a sophomore but regressed a year ago, with his production dropping by nearly nine points per game.
“I didn’t have a good season personally [last year] but this summer—being up here, working hard, and playing well in Italy—really boosted my confidence,” Webster says. “I’m just ready to get [the season] started.”
Then there is Rivard, an elite three-point shooter who averaged 10.1 points last season, culminating in his nearly single-handedly keeping the Crimson alive in its NCAA tournament game against Vanderbilt by going six-of-seven from long distance. But without the presence of his four former co-starters in 2012-13, Rivard will likely be the focus of opposing defenses, which could mean fewer open shots.
“We’re concerned [that] he’s going to be a marked guy,” Amaker says. “If that is the case, [the question becomes], is he going to be able to not get frustrated by that and give up himself for the benefit of his teammates.”
Without Wright and Casey, the frontcourt will feature two new starters, spots that will likely be filled by talented but largely unproven sophomores Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi. The latter is the most polished of the Crimson bigs and often provided spurts of energy, defense, and rebounding off the bench last season. This year, he too will also be asked to take his game to another level and take on a larger scoring role as a starter.
“I’m just trying to be more aggressive, trying to not think too much,” Moundou-Missi says.
Smith was a highly-touted recruit last season who failed to get off the bench but will now need to harness his potential to replace Wright as the team’s premier back-to-the-basket low-post scorer. Sophomore forward Jonah Travis will likely play a number of minutes as well.
“The goal is to play inside-out,” Amaker says. “We’ll try to structure things around the personnel that we have, but it hasn’t changed the overall philosophy.”
That strategy will be put to the test during a grueling non-conference schedule. Harvard will play road games at No. 17 Memphis as well as St. Joseph’s and St. Mary’s—both of which received preseason top 25 votes—not to mention BCS-conference schools UConn, Boston College, and Cal.
“It’s a gauntlet,” Amaker says. “It’s the hardest [schedule] we’ve had [since I’ve been here].... I’m hopeful that we can control it. We can’t have our spirit broken if we hit a period of time when we’re not playing as well.”
But the Crimson’s destiny this season will come down to Ivy League play, in which Ian Hummer-led Princeton is considered a heavy preseason favorite. But despite the losses it has suffered and all the question marks surrounding it as it heads into the season, the new-look Crimson is not ready to concede the championship just yet.
“We have a chance,” Chambers says. “If we work hard and continue to get better everyday, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to take the Ivy League title again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team lost only one starter from its 2011-12 squad, but it will look quite different when it takes the court this season and attempts to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2007.
Last year, Brogan Berry ’12 graduated as a member of only the second class in coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s 31-year tenure to leave without at least one Ivy League ring, instead finishing second four years in a row.
A quartet of contributing seniors hopes to avoid the same fate this season.
“It’s definitely hitting home with all four of us seniors that this is really our last chance,” co-captain Emma Golen says. “A lot of us are going to be playing the last basketball games of our lives this year.”
Through three years, the four members of the senior class have brought diverse talents to the floor.
Golen is a versatile player who creates matchup problems for opponents. Last year, she ranked second in the Ivy League in three-point percentage, brought down double-digit rebounds multiple times, and tallied 13 blocks and 15 steals. Her co-captain, Miriam Rutzen, brings a powerful force to the low block and is looking better than ever according to Delaney-Smith.
On the perimeter, senior Victoria Lippert is a scoring machine who has averaged double-digit points in the past three seasons and was in the top five in the Ancient Eight in scoring as a freshman and sophomore. She currently ranks third in Harvard history in made three-pointers as well as 13th in points, and she will move higher in both of those categories with another strong season.
Lastly, senior Elle Hagedorn has been everything Delaney-Smith could have wanted in a sixth-man. A sparkplug off the bench, Hagedorn led the team in steals per minute last year and ranked near the top in rebounds per minute, in spite of being a 5’10” guard.
Despite the success the group has had, all four roles might change this year, as the team welcomes sophomore Temi Fagbenle to the court.
Fagbenle, who was ranked No. 13 in ESPN’s list of the 100 top recruits in the Class of 2011, was forced to sit out last season due to an NCAA ruling.
“[Fagbenle is] so much happier now,” Delaney-Smith says. “[Last year] she was an emotional roller coaster, as was I. I lost such confidence in the NCAA [when Fagbenle was required to sit out].”
Fagbenle used the time to dedicate herself to preparing for the Great Britain Olympic team tryouts. She went on to make the team and log significant minutes last August.
“I think she did fabulous,” Delaney-Smith says. “She’s a remarkable player.”
Now she will turn her focus to the Ivy League, as she revolutionizes the way the Crimson conducts business. On defense, Fagbenle’s length and ability to make opponents alter their shots down low will allow her teammates to be more aggressive on defense. On the other side of the floor, Fagbenle’s skills force defenders to focus on her, opening things up for others.
“I like to shoot, so for me, I like having Temi,” Golen says. “Even in practice already, she’s drawing so many [double teams] that create open shots, not just for me but for so many people.”
Changes in strategy brought about by the addition of Fagbenle are amplified by the loss of Berry, last year’s starting point guard and co-captain. Lacking a pure point guard with experience, Delaney-Smith has decided to change up the offensive system.
“It’s traditional if opponents see that [sophomore Ali Curtis is] a first-year point guard or that Kit [Metoyer is] a freshman to try to work the point guard and find a vulnerability, so that’s why the ball is not going to be in our point guard’s hand that much,” Delaney-Smith says. “We’ve been working on ball handling so that more than just our point guards have to handle the ball against pressure, and it’s working.”
While the team’s tactics have changed this offseason, its goal is the same as it has been for years: beat Princeton. Last year, the Tigers topped the Crimson by 28 and 30 points in two matchups en route to winning a third straight Ivy League title. This preseason, they were predicted to finish first once again.
“Princeton’s always in the back of your head, knowing they’ve won the title every year that everyone has been here,” Golen says.
But after becoming the first Ivy team to win a postseason game with a WNIT victory last year, the squad has the confidence to take down the Tigers this season.
“We opened a small door, and we want to open a bigger door this year,” Golen says. “We think if we get [to the NCAA tournament], we can really make some noise, but we have to focus on the season first.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team takes the court against MIT this Friday night, it will be a very different group than the one the Engineers encountered a year ago.
For starters, the Crimson enters its 2012-13 campaign coming off a hallmark year in which Harvard set a school record with 26 wins, captured its first outright Ivy League title, and advanced to the NCAA tournament for only the second time in program history.
But many of the familiar faces from the past season’s squad are gone.  Last year’s co-captains Oliver McNally and Keith Wright have graduated to the professional ranks, and the team will also be without seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, who both withdrew from the College for the year.
Having lost many of the veterans from last year’s squad, this year’s Crimson is young, and according to its coach, full of fresh faces and potential.
“We are really excited to kick off a new year, a new season,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Anytime you have a new season, it becomes a whole different group.  Obviously for us, we had a number of different moving parts.  It’s exciting to see where we can go.”
The Crimson’s home opener against MIT is the beginning of the team’s strong non-conference schedule.
“We know we have a very challenging schedule. [We’re] playing some quality [opponents] right out of the blocks, starting on Friday,” Amaker said.
Like Harvard, MIT enters its first contest of the year coming off its most successful season in program history.  The Engineers reached the final four of the Division III NCAA Championships and finished the season 29-2.
Currently ranked first in Division III, MIT returns four starters from last year’s squad.
Senior guard Mitchell Kates finished his junior season with fourth team All-American and first-team All-NEWMAC accolades after averaging 14.2 points and 5.4 assists per game. Center Noel Hollingsworth led the Engineer offense with an average of 17.2 points per game, while guard Jamie Karraker had a school record 111 three-point baskets in his junior season.  Forward Will Tashman was also named to the First Team All-NEWMAC.
MIT coach Larry Anderson will look to his veteran lineup as a source of leadership both on and off the court this coming season.
“They’ve been with the program for quite some time,” Anderson said.  “What we try and do is establish a culture here.  Those guys understand that culture.  They understand what it means to wear MIT across their chests.  [They] come into practice each and every day and try and get better.”
Despite the Crimson dominating the teams’ all-time series, 49-9, this season’s matchup may be more competitive than recent games between the crosstown rivals.  Harvard has come out on top the last nine times the two teams have faced off, but the experienced MIT squad, with four seniors at the helm, looks more apt to give Harvard a run for its money this time around.
“I think this is the year, if they are looking at a chance to come over here and knock us off, this is probably one of the better opportunities that they will have in front of them,” Amaker said.
But the Crimson will have plenty of firepower of its own to bring to the court.  Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard looks to be a key contributor to the Crimson offense.  In his sophomore season, the guard averaged 10.1 points per game and shot 41.0 percent from beyond the arc.
In last year’s matchup against MIT, Rivard propelled the Crimson offense to its 76-49 win over the Engineers, racking up 16 points on the night.
Co-captain Christian Webster will likely also step up to play an important role as a scorer and leader for the Harvard this season.  The guard nabbed seven points in last year’s contest against MIT but averaged just 4.5 points per game last season.
The sophomore class will also look to play a similarly larger role in the team’s home opener.  Forward Steve Moundou-Missi put up six points in 25 minutes of playing time against the Engineers last year, while forward Jonah Travis was a key reserve player for the Crimson in his freshman season. Moundou-Missi and Travis, along with center Kenyatta Smith, will be expected to contribute more in their sophomore season.
This offseason, the big three have helped ease the transition of the freshman class into college basketball.  The Crimson’s Class of 2016 features four fresh faces, including guard Siyani Chambers, who will play immediately this season as he looks ahead to his first collegiate basketball game—a game that is full of anticipation, not only for the rookie, but for the rest of the team as well.
“Days keep counting down,” Chambers said. “[We] are just excited to get the season underway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 9, 2012, at 10:57 p.m.
It’s happening again.
Whoa, calm yourselves, my dear cheerleaders. No, Columbia’s not coming back.
Instead, I’m referring to Harvard and Penn playing for a share of the Ivy League title in the season’s penultimate week, which has happened 11 times in the past 13 seasons. Since the start of the millennium, one of the two programs has taken the conference championship in every year but two.
In other words, Harvard vs. Penn is like Lindsay Lohan at a rehab facility—we’ve been down this road many times before. But this year, the stakes are especially high on both sides. A victory tomorrow would allow Harvard to tie the Quakers with 15 Ivy League titles and would move Tim Murphy within one championship of Al Bagnoli (whose last name, you can’t disagree, sounds like it would be a delicious breakfast pastry).
It’s been a strange season for Penn football, which went 0-3 in non-conference play, even losing to William & Mary (who is 1-7 against everyone else). The Quakers needed a last-minute drive to squeak by Columbia, which is kind of like needing a harness to successfully climb up that hill where the Teletubbies live. And then it lost to Yale, which is like losing a tackle football game to the Teletubbies.
But in the past two weeks, Penn looked much more like the team that was picked second in the Ancient Eight preseason poll. It has hit its stride just in time, knocking off Brown and winning a huge game at Princeton to set itself up for a chance at the title.
Of course, had Penn just beaten the Bulldogs, it still would’ve controlled its destiny in the Ivy race going into the final week even with a loss to Harvard.
But the Crimson too has a defeat on its schedule that, like Clint Eastwood’s thought process, has become increasingly incomprehensible over time. Had Harvard topped Princeton three weeks ago, a win tomorrow would have guaranteed it a perfect 10-0 season (Yale’s on the schedule next week). That would have put the Crimson squarely in the discussion of the greatest Ivy football team of the modern era (which, of course, is a discussion nobody actually has, but that’s not the point). Harvard can still win an outright title, but its rank among the all-time greats has taken an unsalvageable hit.
So despite suffering a monumental hiccup as startling as that time Kramer went on that crazy racist rant, here both teams are. Penn comes in fresh off its impressive victory in Jersey, while Harvard barely survived a squeaker over Columbia last week. And when I say squeaker, I mean that in the Ali-Liston, Reagan-Mondale, Stalin-Trotsky sense.
Little known fact: the Lions’ loss was so pathetic that President Obama changed “Columbia” back to “Occidental College” on his resume. Columbia was competitive for a shorter time than the Tim Pawlenty presidential campaign, and even Karl Rove was willing to call the game by the end of the first quarter. By then, it was readily clear that Columbia was about as ready for the match as Mitt Romney was to concede Tuesday night, because the Harvard offense was so unstoppable that even Todd Akin admitted there was no way to shut that thing down. Things got so bad for the Lions that even Paul Ryan felt pity.
What was that? You want to relive more classic 2012 election moments through my witty analogies to Columbia’s patheticness? Well why didn’t you say so?
Big Bird really isn’t happy about the election results, because he’s dead. That’s right, after watching Columbia last weekend, the poor guy decided just to hang himself, thinking there was no hope left in the world. Nate Silver said afterwards that Columbia’s likeliness of losing was so high it broke his statistical models. Jim Lehrer didn’t have to ask what the differences were between the two teams because they were so blatantly obvious. Rick Perry was even able to remember the three things Columbia did wrong—not being incredibly awful at football, not being unbelievably terrible at football, and not being horrifically dreadful at football. After watching the game, Newt Gingrich proposed that the Lions’ players be the first ones to be sent to his moon colony with the requirement that they never return.
There, is that enough? No? You much prefer political satire to the wealth of 69 jokes I had at my disposal but probably wouldn’t have been allowed to print? Fine, if you insist.
After watching the Lions, Rick Santorum is somehow now even more strongly against encouraging people to go to college. America’s happy warrior Joe Biden is no longer laughing, because Columbia was the biggest piece of mularkey he had ever seen. The Lions made Richard Mourdock stop believing in God’s will, and after the game Pete Mangurian started asking his assistants to provide him with binders full of women because the men on his team were so bad. Herman Cain came up with a 9-9-9 plan to save the Lions before realizing that fixing the team was going to be much more challenging than fixing the tax code. Fox News even admitted Columbia football was a far more pressing disaster than the Benghazi attacks.
Alright, I’m done. I know that will disappoint many of you, but we must keep moving forward (boom!).
PRINCETON AT YALE
Tony Reno walks into Toad’s to drink away his sorrows over leaving the Harvard football program for the disaster that is Yale. He orders a beer.
“That’s $4.75,” says the bartender.
Reno gives him a five dollar bill, which the bartender stows away.
“Excuse me, I’d like a quarter back,” Reno says.
“Sorry,” the bartender replies. “There are none left on campus.”
The nearby drummer plays ba-dum-tss as the bartender gives Reno his change, but the reality is that the coach still has nobody left under center. Injuries to Yale’s top three quarterbacks forced the Bulldogs to play a running back (Tyler Varga) and a wide receiver (Henry Furman) at QB two weeks ago. Last week, much to the delight of the Brown defense, opening day starter Eric Williams made his heroic return. Williams promptly completed half as many passes to the opposing team (two) as to his own receivers (four, out of 15 passes) before getting re-injured and turning the QB job back over to Furman. Yale football, ladies and gentlemen!
In seven games this year, Williams has now thrown 14 interceptions, the second-most in the country (and the guy ahead of him has played two more games and also thrown 26 touchdowns; Williams has thrown six). Out of the 100 FCS quarterbacks eligible to qualify, the freshman comes in at 95th in passing efficiency (Colton Chapple, by the way, is second). So congrats, Yale! Your QB has finally made the 95th percentile in something. If there’s a Rhodes Scholarship for bad quarterbacking, you won’t have to worry about letting that one slip away this year.
But honestly, I shouldn’t be too hard on Williams because none of this is really his fault. Ivy quarterbacks rarely succeed until they become upperclassmen (the difference between Chapple as a sophomore—when Murphy couldn’t even trust him to pass—and Chapple as a senior is exponential, for example). Simply put, Williams was about as ready to be Yale’s starting quarterback as Napoleon’s brother was to run Spain or Snookie was to be a parent.
This would not have been a problem had junior John Whitelaw not quit the team in the preseason after losing his job to Williams, which leaves us with three questions:
1) Just how bad was John Whitelaw at football if he lost a starting job to Eric Williams?
2) Who regrets leaving their respective position more, Whitelaw or Reno?
3) How on earth did Penn manage to lose to this team?
Pick: Princeton 31, Yale 7
CORNELL AT COLUMBIA
Jay-Z vs. Nas. Pizza vs. Bagels. Dodgers vs. Yankees. Aaron Burr vs Alexander Hamilton. Spiderman: Turn off the Dark vs. critics.
Over the years, there have been hundreds of great New York rivalries. This is not one of them. Cornell is bad at football, and Columbia is worse.
But by the way, Columbia, I owe you an apology. Last week, I wrote about 1,000 words on how terrible you were, but to your credit, you proved me wrong. Looking back at last week’s column, I’m embarrassed to see how poorly I assessed your team. I picked a 42-0 Harvard victory, and that turned out to only be the score at halftime! Boy, what was I thinking? Somehow, as far as Lions go, you managed to hold up worse on Saturday than Mufasa did against Scar and the Cowardly Lion did against life.
So what went wrong? When writing, I heeded the famous advice of Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder: “You never go full Koenig.” Simply put, I was too nice, and I ended up overrating you. But it won’t happen again. Next time, Columbia, I’ll go full Koenig. Because you’re right, you really are that bad.
Pick: Cornell 56, Columbia 17
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
Someone call The Jeffersons, because the Big Green is moving on up! Yes, Dartmouth continued its recent-year ascent on the Ivy League ladder with a very impressive 31-14 win over the Big Red in Ithaca last week (by the way, how can colors be big?). Dominick Pierre, who has turned into a star, collected 154 yards on the ground while Dartmouth’s defense made Jeff Mathews seem more out of his element than Donnie in The Big Lebowski.
The Big Green now sits in third place in the Ancient Eight and its five wins in eight games this season has equaled the amount its basketball program won in 30 last year.
So kudos to you, Dartmouth. But I think Brown—whose only Ivy losses have come to Harvard, Princeton, and Good Penn—is a slightly better team.
Pick: Brown 24, Dartmouth 21
HARVARD AT PENN
Simply put, it’s Harvard’s year.
And just like in last year’s de-facto Ivy title game between the two teams, the Crimson will show it on the field.
So prepare yourself, Tim Murphy. The Gatorade shower is coming.
Pick: Harvard 35, Penn 13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, with the Ivy League championship at stake, the Harvard football team held off a late Penn comeback to win, 37-20, and earn the Ancient Eight title outright.
In a déjà vu of sorts, the Crimson (7-1, 4-1 Ivy) will face off against the Quakers (4-4, 4-1) on Saturday, again with the title on the line, this time at Franklin Field.
“It doesn’t get any bigger than this,” said senior offensive lineman Jack Holuba. “It’s why you start playing football as a little kid, big games like this.”
On Oct. 20, a stunning loss to Princeton seemed to deliver a huge blow to the Harvard football team’s chances of repeating as league champions.
Fast forward three weeks and it is a whole new picture. With a little help from league foes Cornell and Penn, who each beat the Tigers in the last two weeks, the Crimson is tied at the top of the league with the Quakers, once again in control of its own fate.
“What I told the team [after the loss to Princeton] was that if we were going to be in this predicament where Princeton was to lose a few games, we definitely wanted to be in a position to control our own destiny,” said senior defensive end John Lyon. “That included winning all of the games from that point on, and that’s what we’ve done so far.”
The winner of Saturday’s contest will lock up at least a share of the Ivy title, making it yet another installment of the two teams’ rivalry in which the game has had the highest of stakes.
“This [game] has had a huge impact on the title race for 12 straight years, a direct and huge impact for 12 straight years,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Once again, here we are. We have a saying in our program, by virtue of where [this game] is on our schedule and the quality of our programs, ‘The road to the Ivy League Championship leads through Penn.’”
Last week against Columbia, the Crimson made a case for why it should be the league champion with an overwhelmingly dominant performance on both sides of the ball.
Harvard held the Lions to -19 yards rushing and 149 yards of total offense while tallying 585 yards of its own in a 69-0 rout, showing off its defensive prowess and offensive depth as nine different players scored touchdowns.
But Murphy anticipates that the tenacity of the Quakers’ offensive line will pose more of a challenge for the Crimson defensive front.
“It was a very young, inexperienced offensive line for Columbia,” Murphy said. “In this case, this week, they’ve got a very veteran, tough, strong, physically mature offensive line for one thing.”
Entering the game against Princeton last week, Penn was tied for first in the conference along with the Tigers and Harvard, making the game a critical one for both teams. The Quakers’ performance against Princeton was hardly one-sided, but Penn returned home from Princeton Stadium with something Harvard couldn’t secure during its trip to New Jersey: a win.
Heading into the fourth quarter, Penn trailed the Tigers, 21-14. Taking a note from their fourth-quarter comeback the week before against Brown, the Quakers rallied down the stretch once again.
An interception return for a touchdown by defensive lineman C.J. Mooney tied up the game, and quarterback Billy Ragone drove his team down the field and rushed for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter to lift Penn over Princeton, 28-21.
Turnovers played a key role in the Quakers’ victory over the Tigers—Penn forced four turnovers for the second week in a row. The Quakers scored 14 points off of Tigers quarterback Connor Michelsen’s three interceptions, and a forced fumble near Penn’s end zone with less than 30 seconds remaining sealed the victory for the Quakers.
“The first thing that we did was we were able to win the turnover battle,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “We decisively won that by a 4-1 count, so we had opportunities to get the ball back for our offense. If we turn the ball over too many times [against Harvard], it’s going to be a long afternoon for Penn, I can tell you that.”
The Crimson will counter the Quakers’ stiff defense with its high-octane offense, led by an offensive line that gives senior quarterback Colton Chapple time to throw and paved the way for over 300 yards of rushing against the Lions last week.
“[Harvard’s] terrific—if you look at their numbers, it’s scary how many points they put up—they have no apparent weakness,” Bagnoli said. “The challenge is going to be huge for us, and we’ll have to play arguably our best game of the year to give us a chance.”
Ragone, who passed for a score before his game-winning rushing touchdown, leads Penn’s offense and presents a double-headed attack with his passing and rushing game.
“They have one of the guys that can change the game in just a couple of plays with his feet or his arm in Billy Ragone,” Murphy said. “A guy that’s a winner, a guy that’s won an Ivy League Championship, a guy that’s won a lot of games as a starter. The combination of those makes this guy a much more dangerous quarterback, a much more dangerous opponent.”
Close games have been the story of Penn’s season—all eight of its contests have been decided by two scores or fewer. Harvard, on the other hand, has been taking advantage of an explosive offense to outscore its opponents by an average of 28 points.
Although the statistics favor Harvard, which is currently ranked atop the league in total offense and defense, the volatility of this season has served as a reminder to prepare for the unexpected.
“You’re never as good or as bad as you think you are,” Holuba said. “You have to take it with a grain of salt. That’s what we strive to do, we just have to worry about our game and not try to get too psyched about our opponent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The personnel may have been different, but the plot was the same.
In a game against Division III MIT that marked the first collegiate start for four Crimson players, the Harvard men’s basketball team relied once again on its stingy defense to secure a 69-54 win.
After the Engineers opened the game Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion on a 10-0 run, Harvard clamped down defensively over the final 36 minutes of play, holding the Engineers to 44 points on 32 percent shooting.
“Certainly coming out of the blocks they put us in a hole, but I thought our kids settled in and dug in,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose team responded to the 10-0 deficit with a 20-2 run. “We’re going to try and pressure and hopefully wear people down with how hard we play defensively.”
Harvard, which registered 10 blocks and nine steals, did enough on the other end of the court to maintain its lead, shooting 46.4 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc.
Three Harvard players finished in double figures with sophomore forward Jonah Travis leading the way, registering 14 points on seven shots in 21 minutes off the bench.
“I loved how Jonah Travis played. I thought he gave us a toughness, an energy, and a grit around the goal,” Amaker said. “He’s an undersized post guy for us, but he uses that to his advantage with quickness…. He’s a heart-and-soul kind of kid. He’s going to put on his hard hat and bring his lunch pail and put his work boots on.”
In his first collegiate start, sophomore Wesley Saunders scored 11 points before leaving the game with leg cramps late in the second half.
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard finished with 10 points despite attempting his first shot with just 2:25 remaining in the opening half.
Senior point guard Mitchell Kates led MIT with a game-high 20 points, albeit on 6-of-16 shooting from the field.
Senior forward Will Tashman added 15 points and nine rebounds for the Engineers, who entered the season ranked No. 1 nationally in Division III.
MIT was without senior starting center Noel Hollingsworth—a Division III preseason All-American—who missed the game due to injury.
With the 6’9” Hollingsworth out, the Crimson controlled the post, outscoring the Engineers, 38-20, in the paint.
“They pushed us around a little bit,” said MIT coach Larry Anderson, whose team surrendered 12 offensive rebounds which turned into 15 second-chance points for Harvard.
The Crimson also had the edge in the backcourt, finishing with nine turnovers to MIT’s 18.
But Harvard struggled holding onto the ball in the early going, opening the game with four straight turnovers.
MIT took advantage, building its 10-0 lead behind the play of Kates, who knocked down a jumper, finished a layup, and hit a three-pointer on his first three shots.
Harvard co-captain Christian Webster entered the game for sophomore center Kenyatta Smith with 16:25 to go, which helped jump-start the Crimson offense.
The senior wing got to the free-throw line with 14:44 to go, giving Harvard its first points of the game off a pair of free throws.
On the Crimson’s next possession, Saunders found Webster under the basket, and the senior finished an up-and-under layup to pull Harvard within six.
Travis scored the Crimson’s next four points by cleaning up freshman point guard Siyani Chambers’ miss and finishing a layup off an entry pass from Webster.
Saunders evened the score on a transition basket with 10:36 to go, and Smith gave the Crimson its first lead one possession later with a hook shot.
Harvard extended its advantage to as many as eight in the first half and went into the break with a 31-26 lead.
“We had a little jitters,” said Saunders, who scored eight first-half points. “I think we just had to settle down and get into the rhythm of the game, and everything kind of worked its way out.”
The Crimson opened the second frame with a 6-0 run to go up 11, and its lead never dipped below six the rest of the way.
In his collegiate debut, Chambers finished with nine points, three assists, and two turnovers in 36 minutes.
Rivard was the only player to play more minutes for the Crimson, shooting three of seven in 37 minutes.
Also making his first career start, Smith recorded eight points, eight rebounds, and five blocks in 21 minutes.

On Thursday night, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an email to undergraduates that included the word "alcohol" in the subject line. The rest of her message was a bit of a letdown.
Hammonds' email announced the new College alcohol policy, which was officially approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Tuesday. In her message, Hammonds wrote that the policies "emphasize a multifaceted approach to promoting a safe and healthy social life that will help forge the bonds of fellowship and community at Harvard." Not sure what that means? We aren't either.
If you're wondering what actually changed in the new policy, The Crimson's got you covered. Alternatively, if you're really set on reading the complete policy, Hammonds's email helpfully links to the new legislation in the Handbook for Students.
But does the ban on "activities that promote high-risk drinking, such as excessive and/or rapid consumption of alcohol, particularly of a competitive nature" leave room for beer pong? Let us know how you interpret that in the comments section below.

November 8, 1932: Hitler's Strength Now On Wane, Declares Fay
"The decline in the vote to Hitler's National Socialists is the most significant thing shown by the German national elections last Sunday," said S. B. Fay '96, professor of History, in an interview yesterday. "Since the vote for his party has declined from 37 per cent to 33 per cent of the total, Hitler has suffered his first major setback since the fall of 1930.
"Hitler is discredited in his claim made recently that he would have an absolute majority in the Reichstag. Many of his followers have lost faith in him since he has not made good his promises. Hitler is definitely checkmated and his National Socialist vote is likely to fall still further. A large proportion of former members of his party have voted for Hitler's two worst enemies, the Communists and the Nationalists.
November 5, 1955: One-sided Geniuses or Glorified Girl Scouts?
Each girl entering the freshman class at Wellesley this fall received a yellow introductory booklet describing life at the College. An essential element of Wellesley seemed to be Harvard, the editors implied. They defined it as: "Not strictly a part of Wellesley. We share it with Radcliffe."
Harvard men might object to this possessive definition, but even the most conscientious objector could not deny the importance of both colleges in life at Harvard. Radcliffe's eminent position was even proclaimed nationally two years ago, when The Saturday Evening Post entitled an article: "They're Wearing Lipstick at Harvard Now."
November 7, 1956: Young Republicans Herald Ike's Victory With Beer and Banners
With elephants leering down from all four walls and with "Peace, Prosperity, and Progress" strewn liberally around the room, the HYRC held its election night jamboree in the Hotel Continental last night.
Hundreds of Ike backers crowded into the Continental to drink the HYRC free beer and to throw out an occasional cheer as the election landslide came in. The discordant sounds of the "King's Men," an instrumental quartet of sorts, mingled with the mumblings and chatterings of the 300-450 present to make the whole affair something less than a spontaneous exhibition of political enthusiasm.
November 4, 1960: Kennedy at Harvard: From Average Athlete to Political Theorist in Four Years
John F. Kennedy entered Princeton September 1935. Although both a father and brother had attended Harvard, Jack decided against it. He had not equaled his brother Joe's excellent record at Cheat and perhaps did not wish to be merely Joe Kennedy's brother at another school.
The future Senator and Presidential candidate spent only three months at Old Nassau. Near Christmas he concocted yellow jaundice and withdrew. The next autumn he came up to Cambridge along with the 938 other members of the Class of 1940.
November 7, 1985: Selling a Piece of the Rock
Dr. Ernest G. Stillman '08, one of the Harvard's biggest financial supporters in the middle of this century, was almost as eccentric as he was rich.
Although like other alums he bankrolled swimming pools, baseball cages, professorships and construction in the Yard, he devoted much of his life to silviculture, donating a forest, a museum and some $1.25 million to Harvard to encourage scholarship in the field.
In his last will and testament, released upon his death in 1949, Stillman instructed his caretakers "to have my remains cremated and the ashes scattered in Black Rock Forest, Orange County, New York." In the same document, he donated to the University the 3800-acre parcel of land that borders the Hudson River, along with a sizable endowment.
