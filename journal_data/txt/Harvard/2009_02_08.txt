After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just four days after calling Wall Street bonuses “shameful,” the president had an even stronger message for financial executives: Going forward, no senior executives of a corporation receiving federal bailout money will be permitted to earn more than $500,000 a year. While taking note of the move’s limited potential impact and the political motives that likely underlie it, we embrace the president’s decision and hope it will foster both discussion and behavioral changes. Part of the president’s decision should be understood as a well-timed political move. The month of January witnessed accumulating reports of multi-million-dollar bonuses, corporate retreats, and profligate spending in corporations either receiving or courting federal bailout money. Then it was confirmed that Wall Street employees had received $18.4 billion in bonuses for 2008, in spite of dismal performance for banks as a whole. Meanwhile, the Obama administration, riding on a wave of high ethical expectations, has faced embarrassing criticism for political appointees accused of tax evasion and misuse of corporate privileges. Between declining consumer confidence and flagging expectations, it was a prime moment for the Obama administration to demonstrate a proactive, ethically driven engagement with the so-called “reckless culture” of Wall Street firms. The provisions in the president’s pay limit, now confirmed by the Treasury, will only have a limited effect. The government’s restrictions on executive compensation are firm, with opportunities for additional compensation only through the unpalatable option of restricted stock. The total savings to taxpayers, however, cannot be immense, mostly because the Treasury provisions have a narrow application. First, the provisions will not apply to the $350 billion of bailout funds already spent or allocated. Second, the provisions bypass large-time traders, brokers, and consultants, whose salary and bonuses often surpass the half-million-dollar limit. Third, healthier banks receiving funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program will be effectively exempted from the provisions. Finally, the Treasury’s directives for increased financial transparency may pressure companies to reduce luxury spending, but they cannot entirely eliminate it. Political moves, for all their shortcomings, can nonetheless be highly symbolic. In this case, the symbolism in the president’s declaration is both welcome and warranted. In a time of financial crisis, it is important for Americans to have greater faith in the banking system. When the government is doling out large numbers of taxpayer dollars, it matters that individuals feel that their tax money is being spent wisely. We can also hope that the message to corporate executives will be clear: Taxpayers expect discipline, especially from a sector that has come to be seen by many as inept or irresponsible. Otherwise, the distribution of public funds becomes, in the president’s words, “unfair.” In light of these factors, we hope that executives will rise to the occasion and make do with their salary caps. Wall Street’s image could not be much worse, and executives must take note that taxpayer and consumer confidence matters. In the long run, we hope that this debate sparks a deeper discussion on the extent to which lavish salaries and bonuses by CEOs can be justified, in times of crisis or otherwise. As for now, the salary caps will apply only so long as corporations are relying on the government’s bailout. In other words, the impetus is on executives to demonstrate, by leading their corporations to financial solvency, that they deserve the salaries they receive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Boston School Department’s budget crisis ensured that some jobs would be cut, the numbers announced by Superintendent Carol Johnson last week are staggering. A full 900 positions will be eliminated, including 403 in teaching.  This translates to a six-percent reduction in the city’s teaching staff  and a corresponding increase in class sizes, just as City Hall was turning its focus to boosting school performance.  The city cannot look to the state for help, as Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 has promised to hold education spending constant, but not to increase it for struggling districts.
Therefore, the federal government is the only actor capable of offsetting the cuts. However, a vigorous push from Senate moderates Ben Nelson and Susan Collins may keep the feds from helping Boston schools by slashing $40 billion in state aid from the federal stimulus bill.  Such Congressional politicking should not be allowed to damage our nation’s public schools.  The stimulus package must include enough money to at least partially salvage these jobs and those in other struggling school districts. When state and municipal budgets cannot sustain our public-school system, it is the obligation of the president and Congress to step in and help, even if that requires President Obama and the Democratic leadership to defy Nelson and Collins’ pressure. The alternative is just too dire.
There are obvious reasons to sustain school districts. Obviously, no one wants to increase class sizes or the number of teachers on the unemployment rolls. But education cuts hurt society in subtler ways as well. They can undermine the long-term prosperity of the nation, denying the America of 10 or 20 years from now the well educated workforce it will need. Harvard economics professors Claudia Godin and Lawrence Katz have estimated that increasing education led to a 0.37-percent rise in productivity among American workers since 1915.  Education cuts threaten to stifle this growth and jeopardize American productivity and long-run economic expansion. This effect could be particularly disastrous given that local political factors often prevent education cuts from being easily reversed. If shrinking budgets like those being implemented by the Boston School Department take effect during this recession and are not ended once it ends, the effect on productivity could be devastating.
Federal assistance will be critical in addressing shortfalls like these, but school districts should also find more creative ways to avoid deficits. The recession should provide an opportunity for administrators to go beyond the tried-and-true remedies of property-tax hikes and layoffs. New techniques, including efficiency analyses of individual schools, are needed. Moreover, the recession should spur those outside the public-school system to think of ways they can help. Students, at Harvard and elsewhere, should view the budget shortfalls as a call to serve their communities by volunteering at schools. Private foundations should also look inward and begin working to rebuild the American education system. It will take more than government to lift our schools out of this slump, and everyone must begin to do their share.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama has blamed the current economic crisis on the “ethic of greed” that pervades Wall Street. His view finds much sympathy on “Main Street.” After all, a quick survey of just a few of the financial industry’s titans yields nothing but front-page scandals—from Bernard Madoff, the mysterious asset manager “extraordinaire” who was revealed to be the mastermind behind a wealth-draining Ponzi scheme, to John Thain, the former Merrill Lynch CEO who spent a reported $1.2 million redecorating his office suite (complete with a $35,000 commode) at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer while his company posted incredible losses.
The general explanation being fed to the public for our current financial crisis also rests on this “ethic of greed.” Money-grubbing banks, so the tale goes, provided loans to homeowners who were clearly ill-equipped to repay them. Somewhere along the line, Wall Street CEOs and executives ignored their consciences and followed their wallets, seeking high returns while ignoring the potential ramifications of their imprudent lending practices.
There’s one major problem with these versions of the story, however. While the outcomes in this case may have been extreme, the “greed” that Obama blames is nothing new. Rather, it is inherent in the market itself. Wall Street CEOs and financial kings have never had any professional interest other than making as much money as possible. And, until now, we thought that was just fine.
The primary goal of a financial firm has always been to maximize monetary profits; unlike “nonprofits,” a financial company exists solely to make as much money as possible for its executives, employees, and shareholders. One might rightly characterize this profiteering spirit as “greed,” but, prior to the recent economic meltdown, such greed was never an issue for the public. Bernard Madoff’s investors did not care if their money fueled a Ponzi scheme as long as they received their regular returns. Shareholders of Merrill Lynch were unbothered as the company’s managers liberally applied corporate funds to beautify their offices, as long as they were paid their quarterly dividends.
Our complacency may have stemmed from the fact that, in a free market, there is a natural check on this profiteering mentality. A typical business transaction is guided by a classic cost/benefit analysis, in which a firm weighs the potential rewards of a given action against the plausible ramifications of such action. In the case of a financial institution, its investment decisions, lending practices, and general business choices are guided by the monetary risks and potential losses associated with those actions. Imprudent and miscalculating banks would thus be out of the game as a capitalistic consequence of their actions, while the pool of remaining banks (and the executives running those banks) would be of a higher quality, having demonstrated an ability to make prudent and wise decisions in the face of higher-reward—and correspondingly higher-risk—opportunities. 
But, with government-sponsored enterprises (like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are largely responsible for the financial crisis through their politically driven efforts to securitize mortgages that should not have been made in the first place), the emergence of government bailouts, and the overall shift to a more state-involved economy, we are beginning to see free-market assumptions wither away. Banks no longer must perform meticulous cost/benefit analyses for each and every loan or investment they make, and troubled financial firms can afford to take on even more risk knowing that the government and the American taxpayer will have their backs.
Greed is integral to success on Wall Street and was until recently a quality we celebrated during years of economic prosperity. Channeled correctly, it can fuel innovation, creative business strategy, and the completion of financial transactions on an enormous scale. Cut loose from its free market moorings, however, the profit motive may become dangerously misguided. Pumping taxpayer dollars into failing Wall Street firms will have all of the negative and none of the positive consequences of greed. Given no incentive to be prudent, we can expect them to do nothing other than what they’re best at—being greedy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To a mixed bag of ululations and disappointments, Zimbabwe’s main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, agreed to enter into a government of national unity (GNU) with fellow opposition leader Arthur Mutambara and the controversial incumbent, Robert Mugabe. Whatever the skepticism and whatever the argument, this deal is a necessary evil. 
This is not to say that those opposed to the deal are misinformed. In fact, there is a very legitimate case to be made against this deal. The power sharing deal was initially signed on September 15, 2008, between Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara after the disputed presidential election in March of that year. However, Tsvangirai’s party has refused to implement the agreement since September, demanding the cessation of human-rights abuses and citing the unilateral and inequitable distribution of key cabinet positions by Mugabe as a sign of insincerity. According to Tsvangirai, his party would not have been treated as an equal partner under the original stipulations of the agreement. The terms of the deal are somewhat improved with the opposition obtaining control over the Finance portfolio and co-managing the critical Home Affairs Ministry, among others.
In spite of these apparent improvements to the deal, opponents argue that it provides Mugabe with a political lifeline and could potentially sink Tsvangirai and the opposition into political oblivion. Here, history is not on Tsvangirai's side. For example, following catastrophic political disturbances in 1987, Mugabe’s party, ZANU, signed a Unity Accord with the then opposition leader Joshua Nkomo’s party, ZAPU. Although this accord led to the end of political violence, many perpetrators went largely unpunished while Nkomo and his party took largely ceremonial roles in the new government setup. For these reasons, the opposition to the current deal is concerned Tsvangirai may have been suckered into a deal with Mugabe not really intending to give him real power. If this were the case, how then would Tsvangirai back away and still remain credible? There are legitimate concerns that perhaps it would have been more advantageous for Tsvangirai to continue insisting on the parity that this agreement does not achieve. 
In our criticisms, however, it is important to take note that Tsvangirai’s decision is consistent with the very principle of democracy for which we clamor. After Tsvangirai had earlier yielded to the current deal that was brokered by the Southern African Development Community, it was up to the 60-member MDC national executive council to vote either in favor of or against participation. After an intense and charged internal debate that threatened to tear the party apart, the national executive council voted for participation. This decision represents an immense ideological shift by the MDC, a party that has always insisted on free and fair elections as the highway to political office. Like it or not, the party’s decision has to be respected. Simply, that is democracy. 
At times, idealism has to take the backseat and allow pragmatism to lead the way. This seems to have informed Tsvangirai’s decision. The MDC and various pro-democracy forces have attempted democratic change for over a decade. Yet these efforts have been brutally thwarted by the Zimbabwean government through the introduction of draconian laws, alleged human-rights abuses, and the skewing of democratic space against the opposition, among other measures. Surely, the world should one day demand accountability for these actions. Pragmatically, that time is not now. Mugabe has no intention of exiting the political picture and forcing him out is simply impractical. 
Naturally, this left the opposition with very few alternatives. The only plausible option was for the MDC to simply take the fight for democratic change to a new scene, to a new platform: an imperfect unity government. By agreeing to this compromise deal, Tsvangirai understood this. Mugabe is as much a part of the solution as he is the problem. 
Indeed, no ruler should be allowed to mismanage a country and expect the world to fold its arms. While the initiatives to address the Zimbabwe situation are very welcome, one cannot overlook the fact that this deal rewards political violence and repression at the expense of electoral popularity and acceptance. By endorsing power-sharing agreements (first in Kenya and now in Zimbabwe), African leaders have, in principle, set a dangerous precedent: dispute election results, hang onto power, then negotiate into a compromise arrangement.
This arrangement may be a painful pill to swallow, but history has shown again and again that, in convoluted situations, compromise is sometimes bittersweet. Even Nelson Mandela had to make painful concessions. If the opposition effectively capitalizes its parliamentary majority and its dominance in various urban and rural councils while remaining vigilant and principled in its delivery of duty, it will certainly survive this arrangement and usher a new democratic disposition for Zimbabwe. After all, this is a transitional government whose mandate is to ensure socioeconomic stability and facilitate the country’s return to democracy through free and fair elections—a means to an end. 
This government will be expected to expedite the crafting and adoption of a people-driven constitution that restores both Zimbabweans’ freedoms and civil liberties while ensuring the restoration of the rule of law, among other things. Will this inclusive government succeed, or will it falter and betray the long-suffering Zimbabweans? Any guess is a good one— the jury is still out. In the meantime, this deal should be given a chance. Zimbabweans have begun to dream again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 23, President Barack Obama reversed the Mexico City Policy, which stipulated that the United States would not provide reproductive health aid to non-governmental organizations that performed or promoted abortion as a means of family planning. He presented his decision as a conciliatory gesture, arguing that “for too long, international family planning assistance has been…the subject of a back-and-forth debate that has served only to divide us. I have no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate.” In this claim Obama is half-correct. He has indeed avoided a nuanced debate on this controversial policy, but his firm, agonistic posture on the issue is likely to trip up efforts to provide workable reproductive health services to women abroad and common ground on the question at home.
The Mexico City Policy was created by the Reagan administration in 1984 and announced at a United Nations population conference in that city. Contrary to claims made by various pro-choice organizations, the policy never forbade recipients from discussing abortion in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother’s life. Counselors were even permitted to discuss elective abortion if the woman asked. Moreover, the move aligned our foreign policy with the reasoning behind the Hyde Amendment to Medicaid appropriations bills, first passed in 1976, which prohibited federal funds from being spent on abortion in the United States. The policy bore immediate fruit: In 1985, the UN Population Fund repudiated the funding and advocacy of abortion as a means of family planning. Though the policy was reversed by Bill Clinton, George W. Bush restored it in 2001. 
Many abortion-rights supporters have claimed that the policy decreased the amount and quality of American aid for reproductive health abroad. The first objection is groundless. The rules had no effect on the size of appropriations; they merely redirected funds and resources formerly given to non-compliant groups to those that accepted the provisions. The second has some footing. When the policy came into force some major reproductive health providers, particularly some affiliates of the International Planned Parenthood Federation refused to participate, although 44 ultimately chose to. This intransigence, however, was entirely self-imposed and absurdly doctrinaire—after all, the federation does claim to advocate for a universal right to abortion on demand from puberty onward. Any practical difficulty in compliance would have been minor since, when the policy was implemented, abortion and related services accounted for less than one percent of IPPF’s budget. 
Others contend that the rules attacked freedom of speech. The charge is curious on its face; freedom of speech does not entail state subsidy of speech. But state subsidy of organizations that advocate particular causes can have the appearance of state support. This is exactly one of the problems the Mexico City Policy sought to avoid. The 1994 UN population conference at Cairo asserted the right of all states to determine their own abortion laws; non-intervention in the matter is then surely the safest course for America. But groups like IPPF are actively involved in agitating for changes in abortion laws across the globe. Indeed it even encourages affiliates to “bend” local abortion laws to their advantage. Obama’s reversal is already ruffling feathers, particularly in Latin America. One Honduran lawmaker went so far as to call it “a threat to the national legislation of my country.” The new policy, then, runs the risk of a backlash that would limit the ability of NGOs funded by the United States to provide non-abortion-related services.
The question, however, is about more than instrumental policy matters. It touches on the very shape of our reproductive health policy. The UN has committed itself to avoiding the use of abortion as birth control. Obama’s sudden shift in policy means that the United States will not follow suit. While it was in effect, the Mexico City Policy helped to shift the global family planning debate away from abortion and toward education and prevention. Various forms of prophylactic birth control—from the rhythm method to chemical contraceptives—are cheaper and safer, and they pose fewer ethical problems than abortion. Increased support for NGOs that use or advocate abortion as birth control will only lead to more abortions. 
Experience shows that rejecting that model is both feasible and advantageous. A review of the effects of the Hyde Amendment by the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute found that it reduced the abortion rate of women on Medicaid by as much as 37 percent, with a negligible impact on maternal mortality. If you think such results are not replicable in the developing world, look at Nicaragua. In 2006, it adopted one of the strictest abortion laws in the world, yet in the following year it saw a 58-percent drop in its maternal mortality rate. 
Most parties to the abortion debate, regardless of their views on its legality, want to see abortion become increasingly rare. Rather than embracing a policy that tried to do just that, Obama has given the upper hand to a tired but still dangerous agenda.
