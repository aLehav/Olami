After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
For all the fried, pre-finals brains out there that can't face another season of "Jingle Bell Rock" and "Let It Snow' on loop, here are some carol-free, wintry songs to get you in the mood for snow without driving you insane.
1. "Winter" by The Rolling Stones
Despite being written while the band was in Jamaica, this song doesn't contain many sunny lyrics. That being said, if the Stones could imagine a gloomy winter from the Caribbean, then we imagine you can do the opposite from chilly Cambridge.
2. "White Winter Hymnal" by Fleet Foxes
For the hipster in all of us, this Fleet Foxes classic will make you want to run outside and frolic in the snow.
3. "Hazy Shade of Winter" by Simon & Garfunkel
The most upbeat song on the list, "Hazy Shade of Winter" will have you gettin' jiggy with it and lip-synching in the mirror. What better way to raise your core body temperature?
4. "California Dreamin'" by The Mamas & the Papas
While this song might make you even more depressed that you're stuck in dreary Massachusetts during the winter months, we hope this tune will shine a little California sun into your dorm room.
5. "Snowblind" by Black Sabbath
Angry about the change of the seasons? Feel free to partake in some headbanging while listening to "Snowblind." There's no better way to clear your head before the next study marathon in Lamont.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What it is, my friend explains, is an investment in my brand. “When you bring a woman back to your room and put on these CDs, you’re stating something.” I thumb through my bright yellow checkout bag to reaffirm the presence of the Persian funk, Fon pop, Swedish electro-folk, and Khmer classical albums that I’ve bought off the Princeton Record Exchange’s discount rack. I nod, answering absently, “That would be nice.”
My brother, an all-American devotee of the Chili Peppers and The Doors, insists that I’ve forced a taste for world music. Whenever my car stereo choices get too sappy or too thuggish, too fast or too slow, I’m met with the familiar passenger-side refrain: “You wouldn’t like this if it were in English.”
To the best of my understanding, my music preferences are not deliberate; any signaling effect, however pleasant, is unplanned and incidental. The answer is not, however, that I enjoy songs incomprehensible to me simply as crunchy background noise. The lion’s share of my foreign music collection comes in three flavors: Hebrew, Spanish, and Arabic, languages I speak and understand in various degrees short of my native tongue.
But just as Hebrew songs work differently for me from Khmer songs, the factor of nativeness means that English songs work quite differently for me from Hebrew songs. The greatest difference? Not an easily sentimental person, I recoil from English-language songs that gush: Such mainstays as “I Will Always Love You,” “At Last,” and “My Heart Will Go On” shake me with revulsion. But by some linguistic mechanism, the walls come down when it’s Hebrew, Spanish, or Arabic—no matter how transparent the lyrics, I’ll even elect to listen to songs about things like love, loss, and pride.
I found my first favorite song in kindergarten, a driving Israeli ballad called “Noladti La-shalom (I Was Born to the Peace),’’ written by Uzi Hitman (what a name for him!) and performed in the 1980s by an erstwhile girl group called Sakseta. Still in pre-ironic territory, I never really thought much about the apple-picking, kicking dance they taught us to accompany the florid lyric, delivered in Hebrew to a classic Israeli minor key: “I was born to the melodies / and to the songs of all the nations / I was born to the language / and to the place, too / to the many, to the few / who’ll reach out a hand to peace / Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!” And although as I read my translation, my postmodern 20-year-old brain can’t help but smirk, shrug, and shudder all at once, I still love the damned song. You can bet I wouldn’t in English.
As a student of the Middle East and the Arabic language, I’ve been exposed over the last few years to a musical tradition both rich in artistry and soggy with sentimentality. But by the aforementioned change in consciousness that occurs when listening to a song in a learned language, I’m able to uncringingly enjoy the love theatrics of Lebanon’s Majda El Roumi, who intones: “No one can fill / your place in my heart. / How could your heart be so tough / with the one who loved you so? / No one can fill / your place in my heart / Tell me, my love! / Tell me, my love!” While I might not feel the depth of Majda’s frenzy, I’m at least inclined to listen on.
It’s been well established that shifting between native and foreign tongues can make for significant changes in cognition: As a recent Scientific American headline advertises, “Reasoning is sharper in a foreign language.” Investigating a set of cognitive biases related to the relative weighing of losses and gains, University of Chicago researchers found that when multilingual people used non-native languages, their biases dissipated, resulting in decisions “less biased, more analytic, [and] more systematic.”
Of greatest import to me was lead author Boaz Keysar’s underlying conclusion, that thinking in a foreign language “provides psychological distance” and “helps us disconnect from…emotions.” As I’ve thought before, listening in Hebrew, Spanish, or Arabic allows me a measure of control over the words I process, compared to an English that automatically bombards me with emotional cues, which in turn invites a machisimo cascade of stoicism and disgust.
In short, I’m hung up on world music because it allows me to be more human. Hebrew, Spanish, and Arabic verse, written or sung, allows me a measured access to aspects of myself—patriot, lover, non-neurotic—to which I’d normally prefer not to be attached. No, I probably wouldn’t like a good deal of it in English. Cognitively speaking, that’s sort of the point. Now if you’ll allow, I’ll get back to reading about war, drinking my scotch, and listening to Eres Tú.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just three days after the presidential election, the director of the CIA and former commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan David H. Petraeus resigned after news broke of an extramarital affair. The woman, Paula D. Broadwell, was his biographer and a Harvard Kennedy School graduate.
Americans are confused about the whole ordeal. According to CNN, 48 percent of Americans supported the resignation, while 48 percent opposed it. Americans are also split about Obama’s immediate acceptance of the resignation.
Why did General Petraeus resign? According to most news, he resigned because of his affair. However, I do not understand how being the director of the CIA and having a raging libido are mutually exclusive activities. It is as much of a non sequitur to me as “General Petraeus resigned because dandelions are yellow.”
In my opinion, there is a special ring in hell for husbands who cheat. Luckily, I am not married to General Petraeus (lucky for him, too). Had he not resigned, however, I could have benefitted from his services as an excellent commander and director. Not all good civil servants make good husbands, and not all good husbands make good civil servants. I would not sleep well at night knowing that I am protected by the watchful eye of Ricky Ricardo.
Which leads me to my main question: What would the world look like if all men who cheated chose to resign?
If all unfaithful directors of the CIA resigned, this article would have been written in German. More likely, I would never have been born to write it if Allen W. Dulles, the fifth and longest serving director of the CIA, had resigned before going as a diplomat to Eastern Europe in 1935. His efforts to bring America out of neutrality were crucial, and, like his foreign policy, his love life wasn’t neutral either. According to his sister, Dulles had “at least a hundred” extramarital affairs. Dulles ran espionage missions out of Switzerland before serving as CIA director, and his many romantic conquests included the queen of Greece and the wife of the publisher of Time magazine.
Infantry infidelity is no recent phenomenon either. As early as roughly 50 BC, the commander of the Roman army, Mark Antony, had a rather notorious affair with a lady by the name of Cleopatra. Perhaps if General Petraeus had waxed poetic about Ms. Broadwell, we might show him the same sympathy we give to Mark Antony: “Let Baghdad in Tigris melt!”
Think of the blows that would be made to the movie, music, and fashion industries if all cheating men had to quit their day jobs. Congress may be vacant by now. The economy would suffer greatly. If unfaithful men were all out of work, strippers would go belly-up (perhaps an unusual position for them). The only employed people left would be divorce attorneys.
Worse yet, imagine if all presidents who had extramarital affairs had resigned! Half the country would not have been purchased from Napoleon if Thomas Jefferson had resigned. If Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, had quit his day job, we would (once again) be speaking German. We may well be a bunch of Civil Rights-free communists without an interstate highway system if Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson or Clinton had up and quit. And who could have survived without the Capper-Volstead Act if Warren G. Harding had given up?
Perhaps General Petraeus’ affair shows that he is not good at keeping a secret (probably a useful skill for director of the CIA). Arguments can be made for why infidelity fosters a lack of trust. However, your trust is only ever broken if you thought something different beforehand. Before last week, I never made a point of thinking about Petraeus having sex with one woman, so my trust is not really broken. There was a time when I could turn on CNN and not have to think about David Petraeus’ sex life, and I am very nostalgic for that time.
David Petraeus joins a long list of poor husbands and good public servants. This is not to say that women are exempt. Women simply make up fewer public servants and are less likely to cheat. We are complicated and multifaceted creatures. Public servants will cheat, but the only people who should be resigning are their wives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard Gazette wrote about Harvard University Dining Services’ efforts to serve more sustainable seafood. The Gazette reported, “Students are seeing new species (swai, for example), as well as familiar offerings from more sustainable sources, such as Prince Edward Island mussels and shrimp caught in Maine waters.” While we appreciate efforts by HUDS to make its food more sustainable, the seafood served in our dining halls is far from as sustainable as it could be.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch releases recommendations for seafood sustainability based on fishing and farming practices that do not harm the environment. It rates all seafood under categories “Best Choices,” “Good Alternatives,” or “Avoid.” These ratings are among the foremost extant seafood sourcing guidelines. Unfortunately, HUDS stated in the academic year 2011-2012 that 34 percent of the money it spent purchasing fish was spent on fish in the Monterey Bay category “avoid” zone, fish that “are caught or farmed in ways that harm other marine life or the environment.” HUDS does not actively report these numbers or tell students whether the fish served in any particular dish are from the “avoid” category. An important first step for sustainability at HUDS would be more transparency about the food served in our dining halls: HUDS should take Monterey Bay Aquarium seafood guidelines into account and list information about the sourcing of their food on the ingredient labels of food served in dining halls.
However, we are convinced that if students knew that a significant proportion of the fish served by HUDS was unsustainable, they would demand that HUDS follow more sustainable practices. That so much of its seafood is bad for the environment should be a serious concern for HUDS. Although we as students do care about how our dining hall food tastes, it is certainly possible to prepare meals that are both tasty and sustainable. Food that is cheap but unsustainable is not worth long-term environmental damage.
Perhaps HUDS buys seafood from the “avoid” zone because it is less expensive than sustainable alternatives. If so, we would encourage HUDS to devote more of its budget to seafood so that it can purchase truly sustainable seafood, as it did for cage-free eggs. Otherwise, HUDS should simply serve less seafood: Our University dining halls should never be serving seafood whose sourcing damages the health of the environment and people.
Other universities across the country have set an important precedent for sustainable seafood sourcing. For example, the University of California, Berkeley was awarded a certification from the Marine Stewardship Council for its commitment to serving sustainable seafood in its dining halls. Harvard prides itself on sustainability, as evidenced by last week’s Gazette article. If HUDS wants to put this commitment to sustainable seafood into practice, however, it should publicly release information about the Monterey Bay ratings of the seafood it serves and only purchase fish that are sustainably sourced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine an AIDS-free generation. This could happen, but only if we take the necessary steps at this moment. This summer, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vowed that the United States would maintain its commitment to provide the funding and resources needed to achieve this historic milestone at the 2012 International AIDS Conference. Dec. 1 marks the 34th World AIDS Day. Although it is important to commemorate the millions of lives that have been lost to HIV/AIDS, it is even more crucial to recognize that this single day represents a greater movement to eventually end AIDS altogether. Impending sequestration cuts that could be enacted in January threaten the possibility of an AIDS-free generation.
Despite challenges combating a disease that continuously changes and adapts within the host cells of patients, recent research indicates that it may be possible to control the transmission of HIV. The HPTN 052 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, used a randomized clinical trial to understand whether antiretroviral treatment, a combination of drugs already used to treat HIV, could prevent sexual transmission of HIV among couples in which one member was HIV-positive. Remarkably, the study demonstrated that ATRVs as a form of treatment is actually a form of prevention: The uninfected partner does not contract the virus. By providing patients with treatment, transmission of the virus can be stopped.
As a result of Congress’ failed attempt to come up with a fiscal solution to last year’s debt-ceiling crisis, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the next decade (starting this January). Different sectors will be impacted differently by the cuts, but all will be hurt, and small programs will get hit the hardest. For example, sequestration will be disastrous to health research, an area that already struggles with receiving adequate funding. A 7.8 percent sequester is to be enacted for agencies such as the National Institute of Health, which will lose $2.4 billion, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($444 million), and the National Science Foundation ($538 million). On the whole, discretionary funding is projected to decline by $39 billion. In addition, global health funding will be slashed by 8.4 percent across the board. This reduction is estimated to result in an increase of global AIDS-related deaths by more than 60,000. Nearly 275,000 people will be left without AIDS treatment and services. Although the Budget Control Act was presented last year, there is still the possibility for Congress to enact another solution by January—a solution that would not put lives at risk.
The fight against HIV/AIDS is perhaps the single bipartisan issue of our time. Lauded by Bill Clinton as a legacy of the Bush administration, U.S. efforts to combat AIDS both at home and abroad must continue, even in the most pressing of economic times. Congress should take decisive steps to ensure that the U.S. remains an undisputed leader in the fight against AIDS. The fiscal challenge cannot be used as an excuse to slash domestic and global programs that are keeping patients alive. In the U.S. alone, the onslaught of devastating sequestration would bring life-saving research to a halt and leave thousands of people without the medicine they depend on for survival.
The time to fight the AIDS epidemic is now. In recent years, tremendous progress has resuted from research, prevention, and treatment initiatives funded by the federal budget. These allowances comprise a tiny portion of the federal budget relative to defense spending and tax breaks. As of September 30, the U.S. directly supported nearly 5.1 million people on antiretroviral treatment through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. This is a three-fold increase in four years, up from 1.7 million in 2008. We cannot afford to undercut this progress by defunding domestic and global programs.
This Saturday at 11:30 a.m., members of the Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition and ACT UP Boston, an AIDS advocacy organization, will meet outside of Senator John Kerry’s home to demand that funding for HIV/AIDS treatment programs be protected. As a member of the congressional debt super committee, he can significantly influence the outcome of the federal budget. GHAC will also be hosting a screening of “How to Survive a Plague,” a powerful documentary about the history of the AIDS movement and where it stands today. The screening will be followed with remarks from guest speaker Gregg Gonsalves, an activist featured in the film. This is the time. We invite you to stand with us on December 1 as we call on Congress to save lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1640 in Cambridge, Mass., the Bay Psalm Book became the first book to be printed in British North America. Centuries later, and about 100 yards from the original site, the Harvard Book Store christened its newfangled print-on-demand machine by producing the Bay Psalm Book once more.
This and other unique stories line the pages of the Harvard Book Store’s memorable history. The shop marked its 80th anniversary Thursday night with a party attended by members of the local literary community.
With $300 borrowed from his parents, Mark S. Kramer founded the Harvard Book Store in 1932. Over the years, the business has changed hands and moved storefronts, but the integrity and charm of the independent bookstore—currently owned by Jeffrey Mayersohn ’73 and Linda Seamonson of Wellesley, Mass.—remain a constant.
The Harvard Book Store has left its mark on Cambridge: The corner of Mass. Ave and Plympton St. was designated in 2007 as “Frank, Mark, and Pauline Kramer Square”  in honor of the store’s founding family. Even more numerous are the store’s intangible influences on the hearts and minds of local bookworms.
Dozens of guests sat chatting with friends amid the scent of paperback books, while others strode through the shelves, balancing a glass of cider in one hand and a novel in the other. Guests included loyal customers, booksellers, and local authors such as Vittorio Palumbo, who said he attended the event to celebrate the store where his self-published book, “Italian Days, Arabian Nights,” is produced on the shop’s Espresso Book Machine.
Harvard Book Store marketing manager Rachel Cass worked the popcorn machine, filling the room with the sound of bursting kernels to complement the jazz music playing in the background. Cass, who has worked at the store for more than six years, said, “We have awesome customers and an awesome literary community, which is what keeps us alive and what makes it a fun place to work.”
At the party’s opening, a woman stood in the center of the crowded room to give a toast, thanking Mayersohn, Seamonson, and former owner Frank Kramer for their unwavering dedication to the bookstore she has frequented since her childhood. Following the speech, the guests joined together to sing “Happy Birthday” to their beloved shop.
“We have a very supportive community,” Mayersohn said. “People will always tell me that we’re so lucky to be located where we are, across the street from Harvard and in [a town] which really has a strong literary tradition.”
That the Harvard Book Store has remained a Cambridge landmark after 80 years is all the more impressive in an era in which many independent bookshops struggle to stay relevant among e-readers and large online booksellers.
Though a physical shop, the Harvard Book Store strives to stay ahead of the technological pack. Along with its high-tech on-demand printing machine, it was among the first independent bookstores to establish itself online and invest in new digital inventory systems.
Mayersohn noted, “This is a challenging time, and I think that the stores that survive will have to continuously innovate to figure out where they fit and how they can prosper in this very changing, very different world.”
Yet he remains optimistic: “I think that bookstores are such an important part of their community, not only in terms of the books that they sell, but also as a venue for the exchange of ideas.”

Based on analysis of polls conducted during the November elections, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have predicted tension in the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and in future budget negotiations regarding Medicare funding,
The researchers drew from data collected from 27 different polls, including exit polls from election day and several conducted in the months leading up to the election.
Health Policy and Political Analysis professor Robert J. Blendon, co-author of the report, has produced a similar analysis for every presidential election since 1988. For this year’s study, he worked alongside John M. Benson and Amanda S. Brulé, both researchers at the School of Public Health.
Analysis of the data depicts a country sharply divided along partisan lines.
“On many of the issues, it’s almost as if people are living in two different countries,” Blendon said. “We knew that people were polarized, but we didn’t realize the answers would be far apart.”
Few issues demonstrate this polarization more emphatically than the Affordable Care Act, which 78 percent of President Barack Obama voters favored implementing or expanding—a sharp contrast to the 84 percent of Mitt Romney voters who favored repealing part or all of the law.
While the Affordable Care Act will likely be implemented as planned in 2014 following Obama’s November victory, doing so will not be a smooth process, Blendon said.
Republican governors control 30 states, while Republican congressmen control the House of Representatives. Blendon said these politicians, elected in large part by Republican voters who overwhelmingly oppose the Affordable Care Act, will likely refuse to implement key parts of the Act in their own states.
“Many people [who were] cheering when the elections were over said now the Affordable Care Act is law,” Blendon said. “In some parts of the country, it will be, but in other parts, this is going to drag on for many years.”
The polls also demonstrated that a majority of both Obama and Romney voters oppose cuts to Medicare, an area of the budget that House Republicans have proposed cutting back on in anticipation of the fiscal cliff.
“Seeing how opposed people are to some kinds of changes really drives home the point that I personally would not want to be trying to figure out these negotiations right now,” Benson said.

While most Harvard College students focus on what they will take away from a course, students who enroll in Sociology 152: “Philanthropy and Public Problem-Solving” this spring will have the opportunity to give back­—in the form of $100,000 in grants to Boston-area non-profits of their choice.
Students enrolled in this new course will split into teams based on area of interest. Each team will conduct research on a particular social issue, ranging from homelessness to education reform, and will eventually choose a local organization to provide with a grant.
The Once Upon A Time Foundation, based in Fort Worth, Texas, has donated $100,000 for students enrolled in the course to distribute to non-profits. The foundation has funded similar courses at Stanford, Princeton, Yale, and various colleges in Texas.
Harvard Kennedy School Senior Lecturer Christine W. Letts and Senior Research Fellow James L. Bildner will co-teach the class, which will be open to both College and Kennedy School students. “It’s an exceptional opportunity,” Bildner said.
The class of about 45 students will be evenly split between undergraduate and graduate students, the professors said at an information session about the course on Thursday.
Letts said that preference will be given to those students with little to no experience in the philanthropic realm. “We actually want people with fewer biases,” Letts said.
Unlike most courses at the College, students will have to submit a one-page essay to apply to the course. Acceptance to the course will be determined before shopping period begins.
The professors warned that the course requires a high level of commitment from students.
“You’ll have a lot of responsibility, more responsibility frankly than almost any other course,” Bildner said. “The non-profits’ beneficiaries depend on you.”
“This is more like a research project than a typical course in learning, where you are going to be discovering things and then moving on from that and evolving. I think that’s what’s completely fun about it and fascinating too,” Letts said.
Students will also have the opportunity to do site visits at various Boston non-profits and attend lunches with Letts and Bildner to continue class discussion in a more informal setting. Bildner said that he also hopes students will utilize online tools, such as Skype, to facilitate group meetings outside of class.
Brandon Liu ’14, a computer science concentrator, said he was drawn to the class because he is currently launching his own non-profit called Tech In the World, which seeks to provide top computer science students with opportunities to work on global health issues. Liu was one of roughly 10 students who attended the information session.
Samantha D. Luce ’16 said she was drawn to the class’s focus on research and group work. Luce said she thought the self-selecting nature of the class would translate to a class of very passionate and devoted students.
“I think it would be a really enriching experience,” she said.

Harvard President Drew G. Faust, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and Vice Chairman of the Banco de Chile Andrónico Luksic stressed the importance of collaboration between Harvard and Chile during the inaugural event Thursday morning for the Rethinking Chile at the Beginning of the 21st Century Seminar.
The seminar, hosted by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, celebrates the achievements of Andrónico Luksic scholars—15 Chilean scholars who have had the opportunity to study at Harvard since the Rockefeller Center created the program in 1999. The center founded the program through a generous donation from Luksik.
Thursday’s event drew an audience of people that spanned continents, from Harvard professors and students to the Ambassador of Chile to the United States.
Speakers praised the Rockefeller Center’s regional office in Santiago, Chile, which offers support to Harvard affiliates in the area and was the University’s first such global office.
Faust called Harvard’s program in Chile a “model in global engagement.”
The office has helped 843 Harvard students travel to various Latin American nations and 110 Harvard faculty members conduct research in Chile, according to Faust.
The inaugural event for the seminar, whose activities run through Friday afternoon, was followed by a round table discussion between leaders of various Chilean universities.
During that discussion, Andrés Benítez, rector of the Adolfo Ibáñez University, said he thought  Chilean schools could benefit by learning from Harvard’s emphasis on research.
“Harvard has three times [the] articles as all the universities in Chile in [a] given year,” he said
Benítez added that despite the importance of research, universities should be wary of sacrificing quality of teaching in its pursuit.
“A university that combines research and teaching has not been discovered yet, not even at Harvard,” he said.

Much of Harvard slipped into darkness for nearly two hours Thursday afternoon, resulting in the cancellation of classes and events, disruption of internet access, and the relocation of hundreds of students to the Science Center and the Quad, where power remained on.
The outage impacted a large swath of Cambridge, including most of Harvard Yard, the River Houses, and graduate student housing, according to Harvard Vice President for Campus Services Lisa Hogarty. The Kennedy School of Government, the Business School, and MIT were also affected.
The failure of a transmission line near Kendall Square knocked out power for nearly 17,000 customers, said Michael Durand, spokesperson for NSTAR, the electricity provider for Cambridge. Power was restored on campus by 6:14 p.m., Hogarty said, and service to all of Cambridge was restored by 7 p.m.
Though no one was injured during the outage, some students found themselves in tricky situations.
Michael Ardeljan ’13 had just stepped into an elevator on the sixth floor of New Quincy when the outage began.
“It was the worst timing,” said Ardeljan, who was on his way to a wind ensemble rehearsal. “At the moment I freaked out for a second, and then I pressed the call button and the emergency lights came on.
As Aldeljan waited for the fire department to arrive, friends and other Quincy residents gathered outside the elevator. After one of the students used a Kendo sword to partially pry the doors apart, Ardeljan took out his saxophone and joined in an impromptu jam session that had begun on the other side of the doors.
“It’s in the middle of thesis writing, so it was actually in a weird way a break from all the hectic-ness of the work,” Aldeljan said.
The fire department arrived shortly before 5:30 p.m. and pried the elevator doors open, Aldeljan said.
Hogarty explained that some parts of campus did not lose power because the University uses five distinct NSTAR electricity feeds, some of which were unaffected.
Around 6 p.m., back-up generators powering emergency lights and security systems began to fail, which would have disabled swipe access and locked students out of buildings. In anticipation, administrators dispatched dorm crew members to hold open doors, according to an email sent to dorm crew and obtained by the Crimson.
Harvard University Dining Services suspended dinner service at the Harvard Hillel, but most of the River Houses and Annenberg Hall remained open to serve what food they had already prepared before the outage.
Still, shuttles were crowded as hundreds of students made their war to the Quad for a hot dinner. The Harvard Alert System sent out emails and text messages throughout the evening informing students where food would be served.
“Usually, people trickle in, and there’s people sitting at every other table,” Pforzheimer resident Rebecca S. Goldstein ’13 said. “Now it’s relatively crowded, which it would never be on a weekday night."
Without internet, students across campus reveled in the darkness, playing loud music from a Grays Hall dorm window or throwing an “Apocalypse” party in the Quad.
“People think it’s the end of the world,” Kevin V. Jain ’14 said.
Harvard Extension School canceled all night classes in the Yard, William James Hall, and CGIS. The Institute of Politics canceled a much-anticipated panel with high-profile presidential campaign advisers, including David Axelrod, Eric Fehrnstrom, and Meet the Press’s David Gregory. All upperclassmen intramurals were canceled as well.
Students in Lamont Library were ushered out of the building following two announcements made by library administrators.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Red Line was disabled between the Park Street and Alewife stations during the outage, but the MBTA reported normal service minutes after power returned.
Cambridge Police spokesperson Daniel M Riviello said several area traffic lights were without power, prompting the department to dispatch officers to direct traffic in Harvard Square.

Felipe Calderón will make the move from Mexico City to Cambridge to assume a fellowship position at the Harvard Kennedy School in late January weeks after his six-year term as President of Mexico ends December 1.
The Kennedy School named Calderón its first ever Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow, a role he will fill through December 2013. The fellowship calls for engagement with the Harvard community through lectures, academic collaboration, and intellectual stimulation.
“This Fellowship will be a tremendous opportunity for me to reflect upon my six years in office, to connect with scholars and students at Harvard, and to begin work on the important papers that will document the many challenges that we faced, and the policy positions that we developed during my administration,” Calderón, himself a graduate of the Kennedy School, said in a press release.
His plans allign with the goals of the fellowship, which, among other things, aims to facilitate the transition from official public service to public life for leaders who have recently left office.
“This is an opportunity to get up close and get to know people who have been in these really rare positions and get some insights that aren’t available in reading biographies—to really see leadership up close,” said Peter B. Zimmerman ’68, lecturer in public policy and the fellowship’s faculty chair.
Calderón’s official affiliation will be with the Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government and he has no immediate plans to teach at Harvard
Undergraduate students have expressed hopes that Calderón will eventually make himself available to the entire University.
“In a couple of speeches he’s made, [Calderón] has talked of when he comes here he’s excited to work with fellow scholars and the undergraduates as well,” said Dorothy Villarreal ’15, president of Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA, an undergraduate Latino student group.
“His presence on campus in itself is going to be very important for the Latino community, just because we don’t have as many Latino leaders in the community as other demographics may have,” she added. Calderon’s own academic work at Harvard ended in 2000 when he graduated from HKS. Six years later he became Mexico’s second democratically-elected president. During his tenure, he was a champion of economic development and emphasized health-care and environmental reforms.
“I think he tackled issues that very few presidents would have approached or even acknowledged, so I think that’s commendable,” Villarreal said.

A Harvard senior kicked off a $5,000 fundraiser for a North Korean patient of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis at a dinner at the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Thursday evening.
The dinner, which marked the official launch of the “5K for NK” campaign, was attended by members of Harvard Undergraduates for Human Rights in North Korea (HRiNK) and potential student donors.
“I want to get more young people interested in North Korean humanitarian aid,” said Joshua Ra ’13, who started the project.
After traveling to North Korea last October and volunteering in local hospitals and clinics that treat MDR-TB, Ra was inspired to spread awareness of the disease and other hardships faced by North Koreans.
“I was struck by how many patients were around my age,” said Ra, a molecular and cellular biology concentrator. “If they did not get these medications, they would essentially be condemned to death.”
The campaign will support a MDR-TB patient in her twenties with two daughters. She has lived with TB for four years, but the disease has only recently developed into MDR-TB.
The patient was chosen by Dr. Stephen W. Linton, an associate at Harvard’s Korea Institute and the chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation, which provides medical humanitarian aid to about 1,000 patients in rural North Korea.
Ra said that even though North Korean politics receive a lot of media coverage, the difficulties faced by average citizens often go unnoticed by western audiences.
“Through this campaign, we’re hoping to shed light on the whole situation that gets covered up by politics,” said Rainer A. Crosett ’14, the co-head of HRiNK.
Ra said he hoped that focusing on one person and getting students to relate to her story would help spread awareness.
“I was really moved by the story,” said Joy A. Choi ’13, who attended the kickoff dinner. “I’m personally [persuaded] to donate to this cause, and I hope that other Harvard students will be encouraged to do so as well.”
Ra, who has raised over $900 so far, hopes to meet half of the cost of the medications by this Sunday.
“If we really invest in one patient, perhaps we can begin to make a larger impact by helping other numerous North Korean patients,” Ra said. “But it all starts by showing her, our one patient, that people on the outside do care.”

As a Harvard committee looks to examine the proper place of take-home exams in undergraduate courses in the wake of this fall’s massive cheating investigation, Yale administrators have discouraged their own faculty from administering take-home finals in response to the scandal at Harvard.
On Wednesday, The Yale Daily News reported that Mary Miller, dean of Yale College, wrote an email to professors this month urging them to consider switching to in-class examinations. Miller said her suggestion was directly prompted by Harvard’s scandal. Harvard is currently investigating about 125 students who are accused of inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Harvard administrators have continued to condone out-of-classroom examinations since the cheating scandal came to light. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent an email to faculty on the day the scandal broke instructing them to give clear instructions about appropriate collaboration on take-home assessments. However, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris has said that the Committee on Academic Integrity will continue to discuss issues surrounding take-home exams this academic year.
Harvard faculty have taken an even stronger stand in defending their choice to administer out-of-classroom exams. Several Harvard professors criticized Yale’s recommendation about take-home finals, suggesting that their rival institution’s approach was heavy-handed.
“I trust my students at Harvard not to cheat and don’t intend to bend my procedures to whatever advice Dean Miller of Yale College is giving the faculty there,” said Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who teaches the undergraduate course United States in the World 18: “Thinking About the Constitution.”
Classics lecturer Timothy G. Barnes, who will still assign take-home exams in Latin 134: “Archaic Latin,” agreed.
“It seems like an overreaction to me on the part of Miller at Yale,” Barnes said.
Barnes added that he would not have been happy if Harvard administrators had issued the same recommendations about take-home exams as their counterparts at Yale.
“If it was a suggestion, I probably would not have followed it,” Barnes said. “If it were an order, I would not have particularly liked being given that order.”
Government and Sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol, who co-teaches United States in the World 31: “American Society and Public Policy,” said she believes that professors should be allowed to make their own decisions about assessment methods.
“If Harvard told me that I should stop handing out take-home exams, I would stop teaching large classes,” Skocpol said. “I don’t think it’s the administration’s right to tell us to do that.”
Skocpol added that she thinks it is a “terrible idea” to make knee-jerk pedagogical decisions based on media pressure to condemn all forms of collaboration. She questioned, “If we discourage undergraduates from talking to each other, what’s the point of a university?”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a Stetson University professor who specializes in higher education law, predicted that other schools would follow Yale by making internal changes in reaction to Harvard’s scandal.
“I have a feeling that you’re going to have an arms race...especially among elite institutions,” Lake said. “There will be people beating their chests and saying that we’re doing this, we’re taking a strong approach,”
Lake declared: “This is a competition now.”

The fiery rhymes of Bryonn R. Bain, spoken word artist and visiting lecturer, filled the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Thursday night at a performance co-sponsored by the Harvard Progressive Jewish Alliance and Harvard College Speak Out Loud.
Bain, a graduate of Columbia and Harvard Law School, focused on “the prison industrial complex,” a term used to describe the burgeoning inmate population in the United States and the impact of the prison on the African American community,
“Every black man with sagging pants ain’t a criminal,” said Bain, “despite subliminal media messages to the contrary.”
In the first of two spoken word performances last night, Bain criticized those who claim that racism is no longer a problem, telling those people to “check the Thirteenth Amendment; slavery wasn’t abolished, it was just polished.”
As a second-year student at Harvard Law School in 1999, Bain was wrongfully arrested for vandalism outside a New York club. The police threw him against the wall and questioned his law school background, he said.
“The whole process is just dehumanizing,” said Bain, whose essay on his experience, entitled “Walking While Black,” was published in the Village Voice.
“I have all the degrees that the President has, plus one,” Bain said. “He ended up in the White House and I ended up in the jailhouse. How did this happen?”
The experience inspired Bain to educate young students about prison reform and to create a Columbia class called “Youth Voices on Lockdown” in 2003. The class, whose title was eventually changed to “Lyrics on Lockdown,” has been taught at New York University and The New School. Students in the classes spend part of the semester visiting a corrective facility.
Bain is currently teaching a course at Harvard called “Hip Hop and the Spoken Word.”
In addition to discussing mass incarceration and racism, Bain covered topics as varied as America’s fading spirituality and the death of creativity at the hour-long event.
The audience expressed their admiration of Bain through laughter, applause, and snaps at particularly smooth lines.
“I thought it was quite powerful,” said Daniel J. Solomon ’16.  “Anytime you connect politics to art, it makes it that much more potent.”
Bain’s new book, “The Ugly Side of Beautiful: Rethinking Race and Prisons in America,” will be published next week.
Bain ended his performance with a call for change.
“If we can use our privilege to raise awareness about these issues,” Bain said, “we have not only an opportunity but an obligation to do that in some way.”

While art galleries are normally quiet spaces, a new student art exhibition turned a visual display into a musical event. Thursday night marked the opening of “The Art of Sound,” an exhibition at the Student Organization Center at Hilles that combines students’ original visual artwork and musical compositions.
Sarah M. Ngo ’13, the SOCH Art Coordinator, came up with the idea for the exhibition when she noticed a gap between the artistic and musical communities.
“[Composers] and visual artists really would have a lot to say to each other if they were to get together,” Ngo said. “Musical and visual art have so many things in common—color, line, movement, you name it. It goes on and on.”
The exhibit, which will be on view in the SOCH through Dec. 15, includes a display of 11 pieces of visual work that were created in reaction to 11 different musical tracks. Visitors are invited to walk around the display and listen to the different compositions while observing the corresponding artwork.
Ngo worked with the presidents of the Harvard Composers Association, Aviva I. Hakanoglu ’14 and Lydia W. Brindamour ‘13, to find composers whose work would go well with the visual artists participating in the show.
The opening featured live performances of three of the compositions, as well as a video featuring the music and artwork.
Benjamin M. Woo ’13 composed a piano piece entitled, “For the Piano” for the exhibit, which Selena Kim ’15 responded to with a drypoint etching work titled “In Between.” Woo, who performed his composition at the opening, said he thought the exhibit’s incorporation of different kinds of art added value to both mediums.
“Thinking about how different art forms can interact with each other is a great way to look at painting,” Woo said, “because it sees them as more than a craft of a certain material—[it] is something that can really speak.”
James W. Curtin ’16, who attended the opening, said he was impressed by the intricate and professional nature of both the visual art and the compositions in the show.
“[It’s interesting] to see how art can physically represent [musical composition],” Curtin said. “I think they do a really good job of portraying the emotion that the composer is trying to convey.”

Spongy gel scaffold technology developed by Harvard researchers could enable cancer-fighting drugs and stem cells to be injected into patients without the need for surgery, according to a recent paper published in the journal “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.”
Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, led by postdoctoral researcher Sidi A. Bencherif, have created these sponges in many shapes—including hearts and stars—to demonstrate that the gels are injectable and possess shape memory.
Bencherif, also a researcher at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, said that when developing a square-shaped gel scaffold with pores large enough to trap and deliver cells, he was surprised to learn that it had a spongy mechanical structure that could be injectable.
“When I took [the gels] out for the first time [...] all the water came out because it act like a sponge, and as soon as you put them back into water, they would be squares,” said Bencherif.
The spongy gel scaffold is important because it provides a matrix in which drugs or stem cells can proliferate and differentiate once injected into tissue.
After reaching out to a colleague familiar with live animal research, Bencherif tested whether the spongy gel could be injected into mice affected with melanoma and breast cancer. The proteins and cells inside the sponge cured both types of cancer in the mice. According to Bencherif, previous scaffold technologies had only ever cured one of the two types.
One of the co-authors of the paper, Catia S. Verbeke, applied this spongy gel technology to test delivery methods of immune-response cells activated to combat cancerous tumors.
The SEAS researcher also noted that the interconnected pore structure of the spongy gel technology more directly targets cancer tumors than traditional treatments.
“To actively bring in cells in this polymer sponge, and in that environment present it with proteins or antigens from the tumor [...] basically is a more directed approach to kind of overcome that additional barrier,” said Verbeke.
Bencherif also expressed excitement about the rate at which this spongy gel technology could begin to be tested in clinical trials.
“We are lucky because this lab is partners with [the] Wyss Institute, and they move very fast from the benchwork to the clinical trials,” he said. “I believe this sponge-based vaccine will be in clinical trials two years from now.”
Bencherif also explained that by perusing comments on his paper posted on online forums, he realized the potential for additional applications of the gel technology to contraceptive drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and immunotherapy.

The power and scope of artificial intelligence technology has taken great strides in the past year as a result of the rise in deep learning research, a subfield of artificial intelligence that mimics distinctly human processes to engineer extremely advanced technologies, according to a recent New York Times article. Harvard scientists have been at the center of these advances in “deep learning” technologies, which can be found in some of society’s newest gadgets—from the iPhone’s Siri program to voice recognition programs in many automobiles.
In 1995, Paul Bamberg ’63, retired from teaching to devote himself to speech recognition research at a startup called Dragon Systems. The work done at Dragon Systems was fundamental to the rapid advancement in the field of voice recognition over the following years. Several acquisitions later, Nuance Communications—the new owners of the Dragon Systems’ software—has been involved with a number of high profile speech recognition software releases including the iPhone’s Siri and the systems used in cars.
“The recognition technology keeps getting better and better, and its getting better with no training data provided by the person who’s being recognized,” said Bamberg, a Senior Lecturer on Mathematics at Harvard. “Part of this is that processing power and memory have become so cheap.”
However, Bamberg cautions against calling what he did “artificial intelligence,” arguing that he only used standard methods of statistical analysis.
“My view is that with artificial intelligence, you write a program and it learns the right thing to do, so you didn’t build your own cleverness into it like neural networks...I don’t see that it’s artificial intelligence—it’s standard probability and statistics,” said Bamberg.
According to Ryan P. Adams, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the field of artificial intelligence has experienced many changes over the last couple of decades. Recent successes have caused artificial intelligence research to shift away from its traditional focus on mimicking human learning processes to a focus on statistical methods seen as better suited to more practical applications.
However, Adams said that deep learning is taking the field of artificial intelligence back to its roots in building computer programs that actually “learn” just like humans do.
“[Deep learning] is headed back toward the ideas of [artifical intelligence] being a central objective in what machine learning systems need to do,” said Adams. “And so within the last five or six years there have been a couple of nice technical insights [...] that have led to what amounts to it being possible to build large artificial neural networks.”
Artificial neural networks are named for their ability to mimic the brain. Similar to how the brain functions, these networks are structured to have a number of “neurons” connected in a network. It is now possible to build large artificial neural networks that are good at a wide range of tasks, from computer vision to speech recognition to predicting the functions of different proteins, Adams added.
Thinking ahead, Adams noted that artificial intelligence provides the foundation for revolutionary new ways to solve problems in computational biology, as well as in the study of social networks and economic systems.
“These technical insights have been branching out in a lot of different areas, and these advances have been very interesting for thinking about how intelligent systems need to work,” said Adams.

Samuel K. “Krishna” Dasaratha ’13’s research doesn’t involve mice or chemicals or lasers. He’s a mathematician, and his field of investigation is, in a word, curves.
Though one usually thinks of curves in the visual sense, Dasaratha defines a curve as a set of points that can be described by polynomial equations. He is focusing on sets of curves that have special properties and can be envisioned as geometric objects—novel research in a field that’s important for disciplines such as physics and cryptography. Dasaratha, a Newton, MA native and resident of Quincy House, has been studying these curves for nearly a year as a Mathematics concentrator.
Why curves? According to him, curves are “some of the easiest geometric objects to understand and visualize.” He says that he loves “being able to imagine the pictures behind the math.”
That passion has taken him to numerous math camps and to summer work at Williams College, where he studied number theory two years ago.
That was an especially good place to do math, he added, “because it’s in the middle of nowhere and there’s absolutely nothing else to do.”
His passion has also taken him to the classroom—not only as a student, but as a teacher, too. He spends time each week teaching math to first, second, and third graders through a program called The Math Circle. He also helps Cambridge schoolchildren of all ages with their homework in a mentoring group run by the Phillips Brooks House Association.
Dasaratha says that his hope is to teach these children that “math can be fun” and to draw others to the discipline that he finds so beautiful.
“There’s a lot of beautiful content that I run into when I’m trying to prove one of these theorems,” he said about his work.
Nonetheless, he jokes that his enthusiasm for mathematics is lost on some, pointing out that “the main comment I get from my friends is that I’m really spacey—because of the math I guess.”
Dasaratha is also the treasurer for “Responsible Investment at Harvard,” a group he says aims to “get Harvard to incorporate social responsibility in its endowment.”
The group’s most recent success was getting a measure on the Undergraduate Council ballot which, now that it has been enacted, will provide an opportunity for donors to choose whether their contributions to Harvard are invested in projects focused on creating positive social impacts on campus.
Though Commencement draws near, Dasaratha hopes to stick around college campuses for most of his life. He’s applying to graduate programs in the area, and aspires to become a professor. His ideal future, he said, is “to be able to do research for part of the day and teach when I get stuck.”
In the months left on this particular campus, Dasaratha is looking forward to his last appearance in Ghungroo, a showcase of South Asian dance and music produced by the Harvard South Asian Association. He said the show remains one of the most enjoyable things he’s done at Harvard.
“But,” the mathematician adds as a disclaimer, “I don’t dance well.”

Nearly nine out of ten medical school admissions officers support the MCAT 2015, the overhauled version of the medical school admissions exam, according to a Nov. 1 survey performed by the Kaplan Test Prep company.
The changes will significantly expand the material covered on the exam, “certainly increasing” the course load for premedical students, according to Owen Farcy, Kaplan Test Prep’s director of pre-health programs.
The new MCAT will require a broader knowledge of the advanced life sciences, including biochemistry, molecular biology, and cellular biology. It will also include a brand new section focused on the behavioral sciences, Farcy said.
These changes reflect what medical schools want to see in their applicants, he added. “Medicine has changed pretty dramatically since the last time the MCAT was revised in 1991.”
According to Farcy, The Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the MCAT, has determined that the changes in the test’s content reflect the developments in the medical discipline.
“It is the right time, and it is a good step to take,” said Oona B. Ceder ’90, director of premedical and health career advising at the Office of Career Services.
“The MCAT is designed to help pre-meds prepare the kinds of skills and competencies that help them be more efficient and compassionate physicians,” she said.
Ceder agrees with admissions officers that the MCAT 2015 better prepares students for medical school.
According to the Kaplan survey, 51 percent of medical school admissions officers consider an applicant’s MCAT score the most important admissions factor.
Ceder said that Harvard pre-meds should take that statistic with a grain of salt.
“The AAMC and medical schools are intensely committed to the holistic admissions and holistic review,” she said, adding that for Harvard applicants, medical schools place more emphasis on grades than they do the MCAT score.
“Medical schools know our classes[...]They are capable of assessing performance at Harvard,” she said.
According to the Office of Career Services’ medical school admissions data, medical schools consistently accept Harvard students at a lower average GPA and MCAT score than applicants from other colleges.
Despite the increase in course work that the MCAT 2015 will require, neither Farcy nor Ceder believes that the revamped test will deter students from pursuing medicine.
“Pre-med students overwhelmingly are a very determined lot,” Farcy said.
“Harvard tends to attract students interested in service,” Ceder said, adding that “the motivation to pursue medicine is this devotion to caring for and helping others.” She said she did not expect this motivation to wane among Harvard students.
Brendan S. Eappen ’16 said the test changes have not discouraged him from pursuing the pre-med track, but have pushed him to reconsider his course selection plans for the next three years.
He hopes to complete the pre-med requirements in time to apply to medical school the summer before his senior year—but that means taking many more courses up front in order to be fully prepared for the subjects tested in the MCAT 2015. That, he said, has caused him to consider taking summer courses and spending a summer rather than a semester abroad.
In this vein, Farcy said underclassmen pre-med students across the country should take preparing for the MCAT 2015 seriously.
“The reality is that these changes are coming in 2015, and there’s no reason to think they will be delayed,” he said.

UPDATED: Nov. 30, 2012, at 4:59 p.m.
Two Harvard Medical School physicians recently announced the launch of a new journal focusing on healthcare delivery. “Health Care: The Journal of Delivery Science and Innovation” will be distributed by Elsevier, a world-leading provider of scientific, technical and medical information products and services.
Co-founders Amol S. Navathe and Sachin H. Jain ’02 brought the initiative to life in the hopes of providing a novel vehicle for communicating recent advances in their discipline.
“There is an extraordinary amount of change going on in the health care system right now,” said Jain, a lecturer on healthcare policy. “There needs to be a rapid dissemination of learning as we send some of our best ideas of how to improve health care into practice, and we are eager to provide people with a new source to share.”
With hundreds of journals already available to the greater scientific community, new publications generally fulfill increasingly specialized niches. “Health Care,” however, targets a diverse audience by catering to both practical and intellectual interests.
“We are not only scientifically rigorous, but we are also interested in real-life applications,” said Navathe, a clinical fellow in medicine. “Our target audience is not only academicians but also health care policy makers.”
Ashish Jha, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, envisions an illustrious future for the journal, slated for release in late spring 2013.
“In the short term, I want the journal to be seen by authors as an important venue for their work,” said Jha. “Over the long term, I want ‘Health Care’ to be a journal where clinical leaders look to first when they think about delivery system innovation.”
Navathe and Jain encourage community involvement in their venture.
“We are viewing this as a community effort and as a vehicle to engage,” said Navathe.
An alumnus of the college himself, Jain emphasized the importance of undergraduate participation in particular.
“People who are Harvard College undergraduates are tremendously talented and have a lot of enthusiasm,” said Jain. “There is no reason they can’t start to make a difference as undergraduates. My time at the college was tremendously significant in that it gave me the inspiration that I needed in order to go forward in this space. The rest is history.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification and correction:
CLARIFICATION: Nov. 30
An earlier version of this article’s headline implied that the new publication “Health Care: The Journal of Delivery Science and Innovation” will be sponsored by Harvard Medical School rather than by two of its affiliates.
CORRECTION: Dec. 10
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Ashish Jha as a professor of medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health. In fact, Jha is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an associate professor of health policy and management at the School of Public Health.

Around 10 a.m. one morning on his way to work, Dr. Rudolph E. Tanzi stopped by a music studio to hear a new Aerosmith song. By 11 a.m. that same day, the Harvard Medical School neurology professor had finished a recording session playing his Hammond organ for Aerosmith’s newest album, “Music From Another Dimension!” and was striding into his lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he serves as the Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit. A few weeks ago, the album landed at number five on the Billboard 200 chart.
The record’s success is not the only accomplishment that Tanzi is celebrating this month; he is currently jetting across the country on tour for his new book, “Super Brain,” which he co-authored with spiritual guru Deepak Chopra. The book was also adapted into a PBS TV show. The tour is taking him all over the U.S., including Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, and New York. “Super Brain” has made the New York Times Bestseller List two weeks in a row.
“It’s all about using your brain rather than allowing your brain to use you,” Tanzi said of his book.
The book offers techniques to help individuals become active observers of their brains, so that instead of passively identifying with thoughts and feelings as their brains generate them, readers can control what they think and feel.
“It is important to recognize that ‘my brain is making me feel sad,’ just like ‘my stomach makes me feel hungry,’ Tanzi explained. “When ‘real me’ observes that, I can get out of being trapped in one specific center of my brain.”
According to Tanzi and Chopra, various mental strategies can help readers overcome problems like memory loss, anxiety, depression, and obesity.
Tanzi said that every night for eleven months, he worked on the book religiously from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., when his wife and daughter were asleep. In the mornings, he was occupied with what he is best known for–his genetics research.
Tanzi said he has been researching the molecular and genetic basis of neural diseases since 1980, when he participated in an investigation that culminated in the discovery of the location of the Huntington’s disease gene. Huntington’s disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms that often do not manifest themselves until an individual is 30 or 40 years old.  Even in the 80s, Tanzi was devoted to striking a balance between his scientific work and creative pursuits. Days were spent at the lab bench, and nights were spent with his band.
Since then, Tanzi’s lab has been involved in the discovery of three of the four genes that are known to cause Familial Alzhemier’s Disease: the amyloid protein precursor (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2.
“He’s been an extremely good mentor over the years,” said Robert D. Moir, a neurology professor at HMS and researcher at the Genetics and Aging Research Unit of MGH. Moir has worked with Tanzi on hypotheses involving the role of beta amyloid proteins in Alzheimer’s Disease for over 20 years.
A $5.4 million donation from the Cure Alzheimer’s Foundation last month will help fund Tanzi’s lab’s search for genetic factors that increase the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, as they sequence the whole genome of over 1500 individuals in Alzheimer’s-affected families.
Tanzi is also looking forward to collaborating with Aerosmith’s lead guitarist Joe Perry on a CD to be released in 2013, after the band concludes its tour in December. Additionally, Tanzi is planning to write a second book with Chopra focused on genetics. He said it will be similar to “Super Brain” with regards to its “science meets spirituality” flavor.
“That’s what keeps you excited about life,” Tanzi remarked of his music and writing. “When you’re doing what you love, you’re always happier.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 30
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Rudolph E. Tanzi attended a recording session with Aerosmith. While Tanzi did play the Hammond organ on the band’s album, the band members were not present while he recorded his part.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: December 1, 2012, at 12:00 p.m.
Students in all nine River Houses received sealed invitations under their doors early Friday morning professing to come from “Harvard’s Newest Final Club”—with the inflammatory statements that “Jews need not apply” and “Coloreds OK.”
The enclosed flyer, bearing a crest of a griffin encircled by a laurel wreath, invited recipients to the first introductory punch event of the purported social club “The Pigeon.”
The invitation listed three virtues, each with asterisked notes. The first principle, “Inclusion,” came with the footnote, “Jews need not apply.” The second, “Diversity,” was followed by the words, “Seriously, no fucking Jews. Coloreds OK.” And the third, “Love,” directed readers to the term “Rophynol”—a misspelled rendering of rohypnol, the date rape drug better known as roofies.
The flyer also instructed aspiring members to wear “Semi-Bro Attire” to the punch event, to be held at frozen yogurt shop Berryline at 11:02 p.m.—two minutes after closing time—on Dec. 13, or to send their regrets to a room in Mather House.
One student who lives in the five-person suite that includes the room specified in the flyer said that she and her suitemates were not involved in creating or distributing the invitations. The Matherite, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she said she did not want to be associated with language that she finds offensive, added that she and her suitemates have no knowledge of who was behind the flyers.
Also in the wee hours of Friday morning, two Northeastern University students vandalized a menorah on Northeastern’s campus. They were later identified in a surveillance video and will face disciplinary action at Northeastern. No evidence has been reported to suggest a link between the two incidents.
The mock invitations distributed at Harvard drew a swift response from College administrators, who summoned at least one student organization leader on Friday as they began investigating the incident.
Owen T. L. Bates ’13, president of the Harvard Lampoon, adamantly said his organization had “nothing to do with” the flyers, which he said were “basely crass” in a tone inconsistent with the Lampoon’s style of “pretentiously crass” humor. Still, he said he received an email and a phone call from the Office of Student Life on Friday morning asking him to meet with Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich. When they met midday on Friday, Bates said, Friedrich indicated that the conversation was prompted in part by speculation in the comments section of an earlier version of this article that the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, may have been responsible for the incident.
Though many Harvard community members guessed that the flyers were an attempt at satire of the exclusive all-male final clubs, they roundly condemned the inflammatory references in the invitations.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in an emailed statement on Friday that the flyers were “deeply disturbing” to her and others in the Harvard community.
“As Dean of the College, and as an educator, I find these flyers offensive. They are not a reflection of the values of our community,” Hammonds wrote. “Even if intended as satirical in nature, they are hurtful and offensive to many students, faculty and staff, and do not demonstrate the level of thoughtfulness and respect we expect at Harvard when engaging difficult issues within our community.” 
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14, president of the Harvard Black Men’s Forum, wrote in an email that he thought the invitations, regardless of their intent, had gone too far.
“As students of a university with a very peculiar history concerning ethnic and racial relations, we should be working together to build up each other,” Cleveland wrote. The first final club to admit a black member was the Spee, in 1965; the Porcellian had no black members until 1983.
“Publications that alienate specific ethnic and racial groups are not aligned with that goal,” Cleveland added.
The invitations are not the first of their kind. In 2010, a group of undergraduates distributed flyers under doors, in the tradition common to real final clubs, encouraging students to refrain from joining the clubs or attending their parties. Organizers claimed that Harvard’s eight male and five female final clubs, which are not recognized by the University, promote an exclusive and dangerous social environment. And in a similar campaign in 2011, organizers slipped letters under the doors of sophomore men asking them not to participate in punch in part due to the “unequal access to social space” enjoyed by the male clubs over the female ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day when the Houston Rockets really needed a spark of Linsanity, Jeremy Lin ’10 delivered.
The daughter of Rockets head coach Kevin McHale, Sasha, passed away on Sunday from complications from lupus at the age of 23.
In a show of solidarity for McHale, who has been on leave since November 10th for family matters, the team wore green patches with purple borders on their jerseys on Tuesday night against the Toronto Raptors, as green was Sasha’s favorite color and purple is the color associated with the fight against lupus.
In what must have been one of the toughest games for McHale, Lin gave arguably his best performance of the season.
After showing shades of the old Lin against his former team the day after Thanksgiving, the Harvard alum posted a double-double against the Raptors, with 16 points and 10 assists, and recorded his best shooting game of the season, converting on seven of nine attempts, including a three-pointer. Lin also tallied four rebounds and three steals to help catapult the Rockets over the Raptors, 117-101.
"Right now, it's an emotional time for the whole team,'' Lin told the press after the game. "We're missing our leader. Right now, we're just focused on coming out and playing the way we're supposed to play. Hopefully, when he is watching, he can be proud of us.''
The Rockets flew to Minneapolis on Wednesday morning to pay their respects and offer condolences to McHale and his family before flying south that night in a quick turnaround to face their next opponent, the Oklahoma City Thunder.
The Thunder, which entered the game riding a two-game winning streak, extended its run to three games as it earned a decisive victory, 120-98, over the Rockets, dropping Houston to 7-8.
After his stellar performance on Tuesday, Lin couldn’t help teammate James Harden get even with the team that traded him before the season. The Crimson grad failed to have a repeat performance in the second game in as many days, recording just six points on seven attempts.
Lin also dropped eight dimes, while Harden, returning to OKC for the first time since his trade earlier this year, struggled in his homecoming, missing his first four attempts and shooting just 3-16 from the field after sinking nearly 50 percent of his shots against the Raptors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the final snap at The Game signified the defeat of Yale for the sixth year in a row, it seemed like senior defensive end Anthony Russ’s role with Harvard sports might end. But for this psychology concentrator from Dunster House, though the football season is over, his connection to Crimson athletics isn’t.
Russ is roommates with former linebacker Garrett Barnard, and connects off of the gridiron by dating junior Kylie Keating, a midfielder on the lacrosse team.
In a continuation of our series, For Love or the Game, we asked Russ a slew of questions, then asked Barnard and Keating to guess his answers. So who knows the senior better? Who will prevail, the baller or the laxer?
Anthony Russ, senior defensive end
Favorite athlete: Scott Rolen was my idol when he was a Phillie. After he left, Brian Dawkins.
Pregame jam: Hard Rock, louder the better.
Secret talent: I can tie a knot in a cherry stem with my tongue.
TV show: Used to be Lost. Now I'll go with Game of Thrones. Or The Walking Dead on normal cable.
Favorite late-night food: Anything with meat usually suffices.
Superpower of choice: I would just be Wolverine. Healing factor, adamantium claws and skeleton and berserker rage? Total badass
Sport you'd play other than your own: Baseball, my first love.
Kyleigh Keating, sophomore midfielder and Russ’s girlfriend
Favorite athlete: Has to be someone who at some point played for the Phillies. (5 points)
Pregame jam: Any kind of heavy metal or up pace song that is NOT rap. (5)
Secret talent: He can tie cherry stems with his tongue  (10)
TV show: Walking Dead (10)
Favorite late-night food: Really anything that doesn't contain hummus...but specifically, anything that resembles pizza and contains meat or pretzels. (10)
Superpower of choice: He is a huge super hero nerd (right now he is wearing a Superman shirt)....hard to pick one but maybe flying? (0)
Sport you'd play other than your own: Baseball (10)
Total: 50/70 Keating has posted an impressive showing, but will she be able to hold off Barnard?  
Garrett Barnard, former linebacker and Russ’s roommate
 
Favorite athlete: Roy Halladay, anyone on the Phillies (5)
Pre-race jam: Anything Nickelback (with other roommate/teammate James Klein). I actually have no idea. (5)
Secret talent: He is an undercover book worm. He can read faster than anyone I know. Probably reads about 20 books a year leisurely. (0)
TV show: Fringe, How I met Your Mother, but most importantly Game of Thrones. (10)
Favorite late-night food: Half-Shell's Grilled Chicken Club with Spicy Fries or a hot pocket (10)
Superpower of choice: Being Suave. I love the kid to death but he has the worst game ever. Good thing he has Kyleigh now! Still don't know how that happened... (0, though perhaps Barnard should earn points for creativity)
Sport you'd play other than your own: Baseball, for the Phillies. I hate baseball season in our room. He is on the phone with his dad during every game. "Dad, Did you see that call? Utley was safe by a mile! That's complete Crap!" His Dad, "I know Anthony. That ump isn't making it out of stadium alive tonight." (10)
Total: 40/70 Although Barnard’s specifics about Russ garner him respect on our end (and possibly a few glares from his roommate), Keating edges him out for the victory!
Thanks for playing, guys! If you have any suggestions for other couples/friends/teammates to play “For Love or the Game” leave them below in the comments section!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Fordham comes to Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard men’s basketball team will get a chance to reverse history.
Last year, the Crimson (2-3) went into the contest ranked No. 21/22 against an unranked Rams team (2-4) that went 2-3 to open the 2011-12 season. It was, by all accounts, a matchup that favored an NCAA tournament-bound Harvard team built around two All-Ivy big men.
The Crimson was up, 27-24, after the first half and brought the score to a tie with three minutes to play in the second after falling behind in the opening minutes of the period.
But an invigorated Rams offense sealed the upset win with a three and a pair of free throws in front of a raucous home crowd.
Last year’s loss was a blip on Harvard’s radar as the team went on to win its next nine games, while the Rams finished 3-13 in the Atlantic 10.
This year, the situation is different. The Crimson lost its top four scorers from last season, and the team is trying to find its rhythm on both ends of the court and reverse its current two-game losing streak.
Despite putting up its second highest total of 78 points on Tuesday—including a career high 21 from sophomore forward Wesley Saunders—Harvard fell to an efficient Vermont offense which shot 60 percent from the field and amassed 85 points in the game, the most points allowed by the Crimson since 2010.
“We have been a very good defensive team, so it’s a little bit alarming to have a team shoot the way [Vermont] shot in the first half,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker after the loss on Tuesday.
Defensive breakdowns are not the only trend the team will seek to reverse against Fordham. With the exception of the season opener against MIT, the Crimson has consistently shot over 70 percent from the free throw line, but the number fell to 66, including 53 in the first half against the Catamounts after co-captain and wing Christian Webster—who ranked second in Harvard history in free throw shooting at the start of the season—missed his first five attempts.
When the Crimson takes the court on Saturday, Fordham will face an unfamiliar foe.
Of the five players who have started every game this season for Harvard, not one was in the starting lineup against the Rams last year.
The only freshman of the group, point guard Siyani Chambers, will look to build on a career high 16-point night against Vermont when he saw 39 minutes of playing time.
“We’ve got to get better ball pressure from [Chambers], but we are asking him to play almost the whole game, which becomes a little bit of a challenge,” Amaker said. “[He is the] quarterback of our team, and that’s a lot to throw at him as a first year kid.”
While the Crimson will bring fresh faces to the matchup, the Rams will play a veteran squad, returning four of the five who started against Harvard last year.
Sophomore guard Bryan Smith and senior forward Chris Gaston topped the scoreboard the last time out with 22 and 18 points, respectively.
Last year, Gaston led the team with 17.1 points per game and 9.9 rebounds per game, coming in second on his team in blocks and steals.
Also making an impact for Fordham this season, junior guard Branden Frazier—with 16.8 points per game this season—has put up game-high totals in scoring for the last three games, including a season-high 22 points against Fairfield.
Against veterans like Gaston and Frazier, Amaker will look to his rookies—especially Saunders—to continue to step up.
“We aren’t as deep [this year,] and we need Wesley to do a lot more for this team,” Amaker said. “You can see how efficient he’s been, but we need to get more help to him.”
After averaging 3.3 points per game with 14 minutes of playing time as a freshman, Saunders now leads the team with 15.6 points per game and is adjusting to his starting role.
On Saturday, Harvard will look to make a fresh start against Fordham and put last year’s loss in the past. The Crimson will attempt to right the ship after falling below .500 for the first time in the young season.
“[Fordham is] coming in with a lot of confidence, so I think we are just going to have to come out ready from the beginning, unlike we did tonight,” said Saunders, following Tuesday’s loss to Vermont. “If we compete and play hard, we’ll be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s basketball team squared off against Hofstra, it emerged victorious, becoming the first team in Ivy League history to prevail in a WNIT game.
This Saturday, the Crimson (5-2) will arrive at the Mack Sports Complex looking for a third straight win against the Pride (1-4). In their last meeting, Harvard topped Hofstra at the Mack, 73-71, before falling to Temple in the second round of the tournament.
“That was a pretty big game for us, [to be] in postseason play in the WNIT,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “We knew they were a pretty good opponent and we knew that we could make history by winning that game so we came out ready to play. They gave us a battle down to the last second so we’re excited to play them again.”
Last season, then-senior guard Brogan Berry led the Crimson with 26 points, missing just two field goals and one three in the first half while putting up 19. Junior Christine Clark was the second highest scorer, with 23 points and 13 in the first period.
Berry came out forcefully, with four early treys, and was able to quickly give Harvard a 5-3 lead. With an edge occasionally as large as 13 points, the Crimson held a lead it would not relinquish for the entire game, despite rallying efforts by the Pride in the second half.
Hofsta’s top scorer for the night was 6’0” forward Shante Evans. The then-junior led her team in points and rebounds for the third straight season last year, with an average of 19.2 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Against Harvard, she netted a double-double of 24 points and 16 boards. As of last Wednesday’s game against Marist, Evans leads the Pride all-time in rebounds with 1,045 in her career.
“Shante is a tough matchup for anyone,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She’s powerful, she’s athletic, she’s got great touch. She’s the whole package so we’re going to have to work hard.”
Evans is once again the leading scorer for her team this year, putting up 19 points in each of Hofstra’s last two contests.
“She’s just a beast in the low post [and is] extremely aggressive,” Golen said. “She’ll get offensive rebounds and I think a big thing for us is just going to be controlling the rebounds and stopping the drive.”
Second in scoring for the Pride is junior Annie Payton, who has averaged 10.8 points per game this year. The guard has been a power coming off the bench, and contributed 16 points against Marist.
In its last outing, Hofstra fell to the Red Foxes, 85-70. The Pride has lost by at least fifteen points in each of its last three contests.
Senior forward Candace Bond will provide defensive strength for the Pride, with a team-high average of 2.4 steals per game, and sophomore guard Andreana Thomas will provide backcourt strength as the team’s leader in assists.
“They’re a very athletic team so I think it’s going to be a tough matchup,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think they’re relying in some key spots on some young kids [and] so are we.”
The Crimson has seen a variety of scoring powers emerge recently. While junior guard Christine Clark was the top scorer in the first six contests and boasts a team-high average of 18.1 points per game, senior forward Victoria Lippert took over during Wednesday’s game against New Hampshire with a game-high 21 points. Harvard sailed to a 63-44 win over the Wildcats helped in large part by Lippert’s 17 points in the second half.
“The [prior] two games [Lippert] hasn’t been scoring like she usually does,” Golen said. “It was a very solid game for her [because] she had great hooks. She was able to complete those and put baskets in. It was a great confidence booster for herself and the entire team.”
Clark contributed 13 points against UNH and sophomore Temi Fagbenle followed in third with nine points. On the year, Fagbenle is third in points per game for the Crimson and had a career-high 15 points at Eastern Michigan last Saturday.
Lippert and Clark also provided pressure on the glass, each grabbing eight rebounds, while Clark and fellow guard sophomore Ali Curtis both handed out four assists.
“Someone different steps up each game and that’s a hard match for any of our opponents,” Delaney-Smith said. “If you look at Harvard and try to stop one of our statistical leaders, inevitably someone else is going to step up and that’s just terrific.”
The Crimson arrives at Hofstra on a two-game winning streak and is hoping to have another strong offensive showing against the Pride less than a year after making history against the team.
“We know they’re going to be hungry to see us and we know it’s going to be another pretty good game,” Golen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a three-game win streak, the No. 5/6 Harvard women’s hockey team (7-1-0, 6-0-0 ECAC) looks to continue its strong start to its 2012-13 campaign when it hits home ice this weekend.
The Crimson will take on conference rival Dartmouth (4-2-2, 3-2-1 ECAC) in a Friday-evening showdown at Bright Hockey Center. The following afternoon, Harvard will host the Russian women’s national team in a foreign exhibition match.
It has been a busy week for the Crimson. Coming off back-to-back wins last weekend against Cornell and Colgate, Harvard hit the ice again Tuesday evening, picking up a victory against non-conference foe Northeastern.
The busy schedule translated into a lackluster win over the Huskies. The Crimson will need to get its speed and attack back for its upcoming matches.
“We’re going to focus on us, and try and get that urgency back,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “If we are able to play 100 percent and find a way to dig down deep, even if we’re tired, then we’ll be in a great spot.”
The Big Green enters Friday night’s contest on the heels of back-to-back overtime games last weekend.
“Dartmouth is always a really challenging team to play,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “They’re very similar to us, just a hard-working, grind-it-out kind of team. It’s always a battle.”
This season, senior forwards Reagan Fischer and Laura Stacey lead the Big Green with nine points apiece.  Fischer has registered a team-high five goals this season, while Stacey leads the team with seven assists. Junior goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft is averaging a .907 save percentage on the season, with a 2.23 goals allowed average.
In last season’s first showdown between the two squads, Harvard netted an early first-period goal to take the lead, but Dartmouth stormed back with three in a row en route to a 3-2 road win. But the Crimson got the best of the Big Green the second time around, earning a 2-1 win in Hanover one week later.
“The Dartmouth game is huge,” Dempsey said. “They’re a big rival, and they always show up and play their best against us. We can guarantee that they’re going to come ready to fight. We just have to be ready from the get-go.”
Dempsey will look to continue to be a source of offensive firepower for Harvard. The senior leads the team with eight goals this season and nine assists for a team-high 17 points.
Fry has also been solid for the Crimson all season long.  The junior has the second-highest point total on the team, after racking up five goals and eight assists in the first eight games of the season.
Senior Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer have both been strong for Harvard between the posts. While alternating time in the net, the goaltenders are tied atop the ECAC standings, averaging a mere 0.75 goals against per game.
The duo have led the Crimson to top the standings in goals allowed, only letting six pucks past through the first eight games of play. The next closest team, Brown, has let in 17.
On Saturday afternoon, Harvard will take a break from conference play when it hits the ice again against the Russian women’s national team. The Russian squad, who is playing many different teams in the area, lost to Boston University, 6-5, on Monday night.
But playing at the international level will not be all that new for some of the Crimson players. Harvard coach Katie Stone also coaches the U.S. international team, which has included Dempsey and Fry, while Maschmeyer has experience playing as a member of the Canadian national team.
But the most important matchup of the weekend is the first one on the Crimson’s radar.
Harvard will look to keep its perfect conference record intact when it takes on its conference rival Friday night.
And after a mediocre showing in Tuesday night’s game, getting back to sharp play is the main focus for the team.
“We’re working on getting pucks deep and pressuring hard,” Dempsey said. “We’re going to have to strike early and be ready to go from beginning to end. [Dartmouth is] definitely going to be a team that is going to give us a really, really good game.”

November 29, 1918: Sanitary Engineers Needed for War Recovery
The war is over, and reconstruction in the recovered French territory has already begun. In the way of sanitation, water supplies and sewage disposal plants are already being put in order, cities are being cleaned, and the general processes of rehabilitation are said to be under way. Naturally this burden is falling upon the Engineer Corps of the army which in peace times has been in the habit of engaging in non-military enterprises, but the officers of the Sanitary Corps have been working with the engineers. It is not likely that the personnel of the Sanitary Corps will be increased; on the contrary, it will be decreased. Consequently, the special courses in sanitary engineering which were being organized in the School of Public Health of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will not be given and the courses in War Bacteriology now being given will not be repeated. Students who have been hoping to enter the Sanitary Corps and who doubtless are disappointed at not having this opportunity should not forget that the great profession of public health administration, with its many branches, is open to them and that there is no more honorable or useful work in the world than that of promoting human health and welfare.
November 28, 1923: Gandhi Will Go Down in History as 'Great Soul'
The following article on the life of Gandhi, the leader of the recent popular uprisings in India, was written for the Crimson by Mr. R. V. Gogate, an Indian who is now a student in the Graduate School of Education at the University. He is a native of the Indore State in Central India, and during his life in India was intimately acquainted with Gandhi.
"It is an exclusive trait of the human mind to be appreciative of anything that is transcendental whether that thing belongs to the physical, moral, or intellectual world. All normally developed human beings are as a rule fascinated by the presence of the true, the good, and the beautiful irrespective of race, caste, or any such man-made differentiation.Shri Krishna of the prehistoric India, Buddha, Jesus of Nazareth, Confucius, Mohammed, Zoroaster,—all these through the avenue of religion appeared before the human race and helped the human mind to evolve many of its rich potentialities of faith, righteousness, and spirituality. Personalities such as Ashoka, Charlemagne, Peter the Great, Napoleon, Mazzini, Shiwaji, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and others rose to eminence and power through sincere and farsighted service to their fellow men in organizing programs of human cpursuit of happiness in the worldly sense. He Attained World-Wide Attention. There has appeared on the scene, in our days, a man who is attracting just such attention of the entire civilized world. He is Mahatma Gandhi of India. He is a man who has tried and is still trying an experiment in the field of politics; the sanctifying of politics by the inception of moral and spiritual laws. Mr. Gandhi says that all that is immoral, unholy, and unjust in the life of an individual is equally so if it is found in the life of a nation."
November 29, 1947: Fire Dep. May Raid Classes Locked to Tardy Students
Raids by the Cambridge Fire Department were threatened yesterday if professors continued their locked-door policy as discipline for tardy students.
Deputy Chief Caldwell of the Lincoln Square Fire Station opposite Memorial Hall declared that it was illegal to lock the doors of lecture rooms unless the exits are equipped with panic-bars.
"The Chief himself might make an inspection during one of the lectures if the violations continue," Caldwell asserted.
Students last night named Charles H. Taylor '21, Henry Lea Professor of Medieval History, and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History, as the worst offenders. A quick investigation of New Lecture Hall, where Taylor's course, History 1, is given showed no panic-bars are provided. Many students, especially of History 1, were willing to agree that New Lecture Hall was one of the worst fire-traps in Cambridge.
Most felt that although the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge are noble and desirable endeavors, to say the least, they nevertheless could be just as easily fulfilled with the exits uncluttered by locked doors. The consensus of opinion seemed to be that safety and education were not incompatible.
"If this thing happens again, just call Trowbridge 0125 and ask for me," said the deputy chief last night.
November 26, 1963: Kennedy and Harvard: A Complicated Tie
John F. Kennedy '40 made his last visit to Harvard as a football fan. Taking a balmy Staurday afternoon off from politicking and official business, the President attended the first half of the Oct. 19 Harvard-Columbia football game.
He looked tan and relaxed; apparently he enjoyed himself although he did not express much emotion. Kennedy stood up to cheer only once as the teams moved up and down the field, scoring only three points apiece. Most of the time the President smoked a small cigar, chewed on his sunglasses, and chatted with aides Dave Powers and Larry O'Brien.
After watching the half-time show—in which both bonds razzed him lightly—Kennedy left Harvard for the last time to visit the grave of his son Patrick in a Brookline Cemetery.

Clad with images of leather, chains, and handcuffs, articles in media outlets from around the world are covering one of Harvard's newest organizations, Harvard College Munch. Munch is a student organization that meets once a week over a meal to discuss various topics related to kinky sex.
 
We present you with the funniest misunderstandings and quotes that have been said about Harvard and its new organization.

 
4. New York Magazine: "Munch becomes eligible for 'DAPA food grants' — which we think is Cambridge-speak for pizza money."
 
Yep, pretty much. 
 
3. Gawker: "The organization has been forced to hold its kinky sex forums in out-of-the-way dinning halls."
 
No Gawker, they meet in small private dining halls. And our dining halls just have one 'n'. 
 
2. MSN: "Another bonus is the group will be allowed to apply for more convenient, allocated meeting times, rather than confining their discussions to the all-concealing shadows."
 
Again, dining halls. I'm pretty sure they are well-lit too. Except for yesterday...too soon?
 
1. Fox News: "And you thought the only thing they whipped was the SAT."
 
The best lede in a story. Ever. And worst graphic. Ever.
