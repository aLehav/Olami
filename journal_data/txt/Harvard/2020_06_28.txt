After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is difficult to accept the release and consumption of any art that does not address our current reality. As protests against police brutality and anti-Black racism sweep the nation and the Covid-19 pandemic rages on, artists from Jessie Ware to The Chicks (formerly “The Dixie Chicks”) are choosing to delay the release of their albums. If now is the wrong time to deliver an album, there has to be a right time. But what exactly dictates the “rightness” of that moment: politics, public health, or (more likely) potential for profit?
Enter Phoebe Bridgers. On June 18, the irreverent and insightful indie rocker released her highly anticipated sophomore album, “Punisher,” a day early. “I’m not pushing the record until things go back to ‘normal’ because I don’t think they should,” she tweeted. “Here it is a little early. Abolish the police. Hope you like it.” Rather than wait for a shift in national focus, Bridgers acknowledged that to do so would contradict calling for meaningful change. With that message, she offered up her music to a world in desperate need of catharsis. “Punisher,” an intimate meditation on pain and trauma, delivers just that.
And is catharsis not what draws us to Phoebe Bridgers in the first place? This is not to imply that Bridgers intends to guide us through this particular social moment. Rather, she excavates her darkest emotions in ways both hyper-specific and universalizable. Bridgers is, according to one 2017 W Magazine profile, “Ms. Misery,” and misery loves company. Search Bridgers’s name on Twitter or Tumblr and you’ll be bombarded by a litany of posts delineating the causal relationship between the statements “I am sad” and “I am listening to Phoebe Bridgers.”
There is no shortage of sadness in the world and no shortage of music to hold up a mirror to that sadness. On “Punisher,” Bridgers doesn’t reflect anyone else’s sadness. She pulls us into her own.  “I’ve been playing dead / My whole life,” Bridgers sings on “I See You,” a line about depression she says she sat on for five years. “And I get this feeling whenever I feel good / It’ll be the last time.” She is as much a spectator of her life as she is the subject. “I dissociate when bad things happen to me, but also when good things happen,” she said in a press release for the album. Her first-person narration takes the form of this dissociation. She floats above each scene, chronicling her experiences in painstaking detail but delivering them in a detached monotone.
Her style, while often soft and slow, is not stagnant. Bridgers’s debut album “Stranger in the Alps” hinges on a single, upbeat break-up song (“Motion Sickness”), after which the energy drops to a lovely but persistent lull. On “Punisher,” the pace ebbs and flows. String-heavy overtures bloom into tender, acoustic ballads. Those ballads swell into symphonic choruses and spill over into angst-ridden bursts of energy. In an interview with Stereogum, Bridgers said: “There’s something amazing about being able to scream the words of some kind of trauma while jumping up and down.”
That emotional release is exactly the function of “Kyoto.” In it, she juxtaposes a narrative of out-of-body anxiety and resentment with whining horns and a punchy drumline. “I’m gonna kill you / If you don’t beat me to it” in the first chorus morphs to “I don’t forgive you / But please don’t hold me to it” in the next. The quick beat brings her anger, and her uncertainty about that anger, to life. A similar ache engulfs the chorus of “Chinese Satellite,” on which Bridgers pleads for some kind of faith. She sings “I want to believe / Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing / You know I hate to be alone,” her pitch rising and falling against a chorus of strings. Each song on “Punisher” builds to the next, fluctuating in pace and tone without sacrificing Bridgers’s singular voice.
For all the richness and beauty of the album’s first 10 tracks, the payoff comes in its final moments. It is here, on “I Know The End,” that the gravity of Bridgers’s feat sets in. The song opens with a musical fake-out, a soft, acoustic melody rife with lyrical motifs from earlier songs. At verse number three, the snare and bass come in, building in intensity beneath Bridgers’s frantic, fragmented anecdotes of Americana. “No, I’m not afraid to disappear / The billboard said ‘The End Is Near’ / I turned around, there was nothing there,” she sings, and, with a swell of horns and percussion, the song devolves into a chorus of incoherent wailing. The album’s wide-ranging tones and themes coalesce into almost six straight minutes of unadulterated ascent.
The jagged edges of “I Know The End” encapsulate the album’s meticulous crescendo. From its soft, instrumental opening to its visceral, sprawling end, “Punisher” is a masterfully slow burn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts from Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health discussed the state of the COVID-19 pandemic Friday, along with challenges associated with preventing new infections as lockdown restrictions ease.
The public briefing included eight panelists from the Harvard Medical School-led Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.
During the briefing, participants praised Massachusetts’s response to the pandemic. Panelists like Medical School professor Joia Stapleton Mukherjee praised the state’s contact tracing efforts.
“Massachusetts is leading the way in contract tracing efforts, especially with marginalized communities,” Mukherjee said.
Black and brown residents of Massachusetts test positive for coronavirus at a rate three times that of white residents. In response to such data, the state’s Health Equity Advisory Group urged the state earlier this month to better track data on the virus's spread and improve housing for marginalized populations.
In her remarks, Mukherjee also added that Massachusetts’s contract tracing efforts aim to make sure that potential COVID-19 infected patients have the resources necessary to wait out the pandemic.
“Around 15 percent of Massachusetts residents who are cases or contacts need social support,” Mukherjee wrote in her presentation. “Poorest and marginalized lack agency without the material means to protect themselves.”
Assistant Medical School professor Howard M. Heller said he largely agreed with Mukherjee’s assessment.
“I think we are setting an example in a lot of areas in terms of mandating the masks and the recovery or the reopening combined with really the surveillance that if we are starting to see a bump it will be noticed before it gets out of hand,” Heller said.
Mukherjee said the best reopening practices are rooted in testing, tracing, and supported isolation.
The panel also touched on how the pandemic may affect the reopening of college campuses across the state. MassCPR, the working group that led Friday’s briefing, has been in close collaboration with University officials to create a reopening plan for the upcoming fall semester. Asked about communication between MassCPR and the University, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley wrote that contact with administrators was ongoing.
“The experts within MassCPR have extensive and frequent interactions with Harvard leadership to help inform reopening strategies,” Daley wrote.
Daley and other panelists did not respond to further questions regarding what reopening strategy MassCPR would recommend to Harvard officials in charge of fall planning.
Still, Heller stressed that any strategy the University employs should be flexible and reflect the locations from which students travel.
“What percentage of students coming back from campus are likely to be infected and the number at the end of August might be different than the number right now,” Heller said. “But you can start planning; if by mid-August we start seeing the rates of positive testing is 20% percent in some of the states where students are coming from the plan might be different than it is right now.”
“But you can model out, see where your students’ coming from and see what resources we have for testing and also what resources we have for taking care of sick students,” he added.
With Harvard’s peer institutions announcing their plans to reopen, Heller mentioned that existing guidelines fail to address how to proceed with taking care of students who might have already been infected with and recovered from COVID-19.
“It’s an excellent and it’s an interesting question that I have not seen addressed by any of the guidelines,” Heller said. “As far as we know people can become reinfected. We don’t know how common that is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Americans have lost more than 170,000 years of potential life due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Black and Latinx people bearing the brunt of that toll, Harvard researchers determined in a study released June 12.
Led by Harvard School of Public Health professor Mary T. Bassett, HSPH researcher Jarvis Chen, and social epidemiology professor Nancy Krieger, researchers used the Years of Potential Life Lost statistic to specifically show disparities between racial and ethnic groups in the impact of COVID-19.
Chen said newly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention proved key to the findings.
“We were concerned fairly early on that the unequal situation in the United States in terms of systemic racial inequalities in health and socio-economic inequalities in health would be exacerbated by COVID,” Chen said. “When the CDC made data available in early May that gave the counts of COVID-19 deaths by race, ethnicity and age and started making that available for the national picture and also for the states, we wanted to use those data to see if we could really document some of these inequalities.”
To illuminate the unequal effect of COVID-19, the team used YPLL, a measure for the number of years collectively lost by a group of people due to a crisis. Chen said YPLL provides a new perspective on mortality rates in specific populations.
“Years of Potential Life Lost picks up this additional population impact and thinking about what's happening, particularly for deaths that occur at younger ages, and what is the impact of the years of lost life on the population,” Chen said.
The team calculated YPLL by approximating the total number of years between the age at death and age 65 for COVID-19 victims of different age groups and ethnicities.
That methodology revealed vast differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic Americans have lost 48,204 years, Black Americans have lost 45,777 years, non-Hispanic white Americans have lost 33,446 years, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have lost 8,905 years of potential life due to the COVID-19 crisis, they found.
Because datasets on COVID-19 mortality rates are incomplete, Chen said his team also studied excess mortality — the number of deaths above the expected value in pre-pandemic conditions — to further understand COVID-19’s disparate impact on racial and ethnic groups.
“We've done some analyses in Massachusetts looking at excess mortality, and we do see that the excess mortality – starting at the end of March and going into April – there's a large surge in all causes of mortality in Massachusetts,” Chen said. “It's worse in more disadvantaged communities, in terms of poverty or non-white racial ethnic composition are crowding. And it also is larger than the number of deaths or the rate of deaths that we're seeing attributed to COVID-19 specifically.”
Based on the findings, Chen said next steps should focus on finding and combating the causes of the unequal effect of COVID-19 through further research and through government action.
“We do know there's a long history of research showing relationships between racism, discrimination, structural inequality, and the risk of those chronic diseases,” Chen said. “There needs to be more research on that, and then also, efforts on the part of government and other stakeholders and communities to try to put in place the resources that would help people mitigate that risk.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Incoming Harvard Alumni Association President John J. West Jr. will begin his term as president on July 1.
West — who graduated from the Harvard Business School in 1995 — has previously served on the HAA Board of Directors, the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, and the Memorial Church Advisory Board.
The HAA Board is charged with nominating candidates for the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — and holding the Annual Meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association following Commencement Exercises. It bestows two awards annually, the HAA Award and the Harvard Medal.
The HAA Executive Committee — which consists of its president, four vice presidents, secretary, treasurer, and two at-large members — oversees the HAA Board. West served as the first vice president for the 2019-2020 academic year.
West first introduced himself as the incoming president as part of a video message welcoming the graduating class of 2020 on May 27. He told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that he believes it is crucial all alumni feel welcome in HAA.
“The relationships we make across the HAA as we connect across our diverse experiences are phenomenal,” he said. “The alumni community is here to support you. If you need help, I guarantee your fellow alumni will be there.”
West told the Gazette that he hopes to help alumni connect online, particularly in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Recent graduates have grown up in a world where social media is their platform,” West said. “It changed who they are, how they relate to people, and how they build friendships.”
Alice E. Hill '81, the current HAA president, praised West for his approach to the role.
“John’s warm and inclusive approach will really speak to Harvard alumni who are looking for ways to come together to serve their communities,” Hill told the Gazette.
