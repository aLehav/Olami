After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How exactly does one become a Supreme Court justice? On May 27, the Harvard Class of 2010 will find out, as this year’s commencement speaker is former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61. Souter is an excellent choice, and we commend the University for choosing a commencement speaker well known for his public service, instead of someone made famous through finance or other better-trodden paths of success.
Souter has spent his entire career in public service. He made his way up through the judicial ranks, serving on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals and as an Associate Attorney General in New Hampshire. As such, he is a strong role model for students tempted by the ease of applying for a job in finance, consulting, or another less altruistic profession with a convenient on-campus recruiting tool. Additionally, Souter inspires students to see public service as a lifelong vocation rather than a “second career” or side interest.
This announcement should compel the Harvard community to look carefully at its own commitment to public service and assess whether it is living up to its stated values. Former Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, once famously asked students of the College to “enter to grow in wisdom, depart to serve thy better thy country and thy kind.” Administrators, professors, students, and community affiliates alike should take this message to heart. To a significant extent, this is already happening. University Public Service Week was held last October, and President Drew Faust has expounded many times, including in The Crimson, on the virtues of public service—citing her own time with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as firsthand evidence. Last term, the Institute of Politics hired a career counselor to help students find post-graduation placements in public service. The Harvard Kennedy School is working with the White House Office of Personnel Management to find its graduates public service jobs on a national level. Still, there is much more to be done. All facets of the University, from academic departments to student organizations, should be involved in this community process of promoting public service careers.
As for the student body’s reaction to Souter, we caution against the extreme excitement or disappointment that has characterized students’ past reactions to the announcements of commencement and Class Day speakers—after all, there is no way to preemptively know the quality of the speech before the day of Commencement. The hype that preceded 2008 Class Day speaker Federal Reserve Chair Ben S. Bernanke ’75 starkly contrasted with students’ negative attitudes after his notorious ten-citation speech, during which many attendees left. On the other hand, last year’s Class Day speaker, Matt Lauer of The Today Show, was surprisingly enjoyable and enlightening. As such, students should not jump to conclusions, especially not negative ones, before the speaker actually delivers his or her speech.
Additionally, Harvard students would do well to appreciate that many other universities do not attract graduation speakers of nearly the same prominence as Harvard does, and we therefore should not take Souter’s appearance for granted. Last year’s commencement speakers at other Cambridge and Boston-area colleges included Arthur creator Marc Brown at Lesley College, former Wellesley College President Diana Chapman Walsh at Cambridge College, and actor Blair Underwood—who spent a week at Harvard as an Office for the Arts artist in residence earlier this year—at Emerson College. These speakers are undoubtedly worthy choices, but they do not have the cache of the University’s recent speakers, and it would be ungrateful of us not to appreciate our speakers on the basis of their cultural significance alone. Regardless of whether his speech inspires students to go into public service or is just interesting, the fact that Justice Souter is coming to speak at Commencement should make all seniors proud.

The problem: hordes of retiring baby-boomers, together with slumping tax revenues, have sent Social Security into the red several years earlier than expected. The current economic outlook puts the program’s solvency in jeopardy. So what does Congress do to save us from this impending disaster? The solution is obvious—pass a non-binding resolution!
This is not a false scenario: on Feb. 5, 2010, the non-binding House Resolution 1077 was introduced, declaring Congress’s intention to “stand with the American people to reject severe changes to social security, including any and all attempts to privatize [it],” instead promising to “make common-sense adjustments… to strengthen it for future generations.” As well-intentioned as this sounds, it’s nothing more than a way to bait Republicans into publicly picking sides on Rep. Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) proposals to cut and privatize social security benefits. A “no” vote would provide a potent sound bite for Democratic campaign ads during the upcoming midterm elections. Regardless of how one feels about social security, it’s easy to tell that H.Res. 1077 is essentially a Democratic National Committee press release in which every sentence begins with “Whereas.”
A non-binding resolution is any bill that, by definition, cannot progress into law. These toothless acts have come to plague Congress. For example, a typical workday in Congress (Feb. 2, 2010, specifically) saw the consideration of such gems as H. Res. 957, which honored NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson for his “historic achievements” in winning the Sprint Cup, a resolution “recognizing the goals of Catholic Schools Week,” one declaring January 2010 (which ended two days earlier) to be “National Stalking Awareness Month,” and one congratulating “Brescia University for 60 years of leadership in higher education.”
The fact is, non-binding resolutions are ineffective and only divert Congress’s attention from our nation’s myriad problems. The majority of these missives receive virtually no media coverage, nor do they influence government policy. It took Congress eight days after the Haitian earthquake to pass H.Res. 1021, a non-binding expression of “condolences and solidarity.” (During those eight days, they named four post offices.) The high-minded Congressional statement likely offered little solace to Haitians trapped beneath rubble and distracted from governmental efforts to bring tangible benefits to those in need.
Proponents of non-binding resolutions say they offer Congress a chance to express its opinion on issues outside its purview. But why should it? The most notable example in recent history was the late Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha’s resolution demanding an end to the Iraq War. It stimulated debate but ultimately failed to steer military strategy. Congress should propose binding measures for issues that fall within its powers and ignore issues that don’t.
Also on the agenda for Feb. 2nd were resolutions expressing support for Google in its struggle against Chinese censors, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, honoring civil rights activist Medgar Evers, and celebrating the 49th anniversary of integrated schools in New Orleans. All of these passed unanimously (Not even Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), the lone vote against the Jimmie Johnson resolution, could say nay). Though all in support of noble causes, these symbolic statements offer little more than an opportunity for Congress to pat itself on the back.
Our representatives should save their adulation for the nation’s Boy Scout troops, NASCAR drivers, and, yes, even our fallen civil rights heroes for the Sunday talk shows. The chambers of Congress are a place for doing things, not saying them.

When laws are referenced by Clint Eastwood movie lines, it’s probably a good idea to reconsider the policy. In the United States, “Castle Doctrine”, or “Make my Day Law”, gives liberal scope for homeowners to use violence against burglars as seen fit. Meanwhile, in Britain, where it’s legal to kill a burglar if you have to, but not if you want to, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge has just overturned the sentence of Munir Hussein, who chased a burglar down the street and gave him brain damage. The issue is delicate, mediating self-defense and personal revenge; consequentially, there’s an uncertain policy in Britain, and a dubious one in the United States. Self-defense is a priority, but a firm line must be drawn to prevent the burgled from simply taking the law into their own hands.
The United Kingdom law enables homeowners to commit as much violence as necessary, but only in self-defense (e.g. you may knock a burglar unconscious, but not continue to beat him whilst he is harmless), which seems justified. However, it came under question when Hussein continued to attack once the burglar had left the home. Although strictly against the law, Hussein’s family had just been tied up and he acted under extreme distress and anxiety. To pursue a man down the street is not technically self-defense, but under the exceptional conditions, it’s clear that Hussein’s act should not be treated as a typical act of violence.
Over on the other side of the pond—i.e. our own blessed soil— the presence of a burglar seems to render any form of violence acceptable, and shows the dangers of too generous allowances in the name of self-protection. In the majority of states, a form of Castle Law is permitted which does not require crime victims to avoid violence, but essentially enables homeowners to “stand their ground” and attack burglars simply upon their intrusion into the home. The policy ensures that burglary is repayable by death, and has led to several questionable homicides that cannot be construed as self-defense. In 2006 a 72-year-old client threatened a 23-year-old prostitute with a gun. She grabbed the gun from him, and did not flee, but instead chose to shoot the man. Although clearly under stress, why did the young woman need to kill an old man who was obviously no longer a threat? Even worse is the story of a man shooting a neighbor who banged on the door loudly during a dispute over garbage and, apparently, attempted to put his foot inside the man’s “castle.”
The threatening 72-year-old committed a serious offense, but for a citizen to kill him in response is a reckless act that should not be permitted without any form of retribution. Burglary is a crime, a terrible act that inflicts trauma on its victims, even in non-violent situations. However, we live in a democracy where criminals do not forfeit their human rights; stolen goods should not be repaid with death, as the punishment does not fit the crime. Those who experience felony often feel threatened—whether during a burglary or a street robbery—but it’s unacceptable for citizens to immediately react with violence. Such mentality leads to a Wild West attitude, when the general public has more freedom to shoot and kill than the trained police.
This form of Castle Law underemphasizes the importance of life in the face of home security, but it also encourages violence overall. Although some burglars may be deterred by homeowners with guns, others will simply come armed; there is almost twice the percentage of violent burglaries in the U.S. than in the U.K.. Thus it’s clear that a limit on defense against burglars must be drawn.
Self-defense should always be legitimate when homeowners have direct reason to believe that their life or safety is in danger, and express attacks from burglars ensure that self-protection is certainly permissible. Meanwhile, to shoot a man who steps foot in your garage is a crime, according to the age-old mantra that two wrongs don’t make a right, and should be dealt with accordingly. But in the spectrum between the two extremes, policy is less certain. Certain acts of violence from homeowners (such as to chase a burglar down the street) seem unnecessary, but under the circumstances are understandable and should not be compared to wanton acts of brutality. Self-defense is not an exact science, and while we should be wary of widespread rules condoning excessive violence, there should also be a case-by-case awareness of the stressful conditions of the burgled. No just system on this matter can make generalized rules, but in an age when few live in castles, our legal system should also evolve.

Cambridge residents expressed mixed feelings toward the Cambridge City Council last week after it failed to elect a mayor for the seventh time during its latest meeting.
After seven weeks of City Council meetings, none of the top three candidates—Councillors David P. Maher, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, and Henrietta J. Davis—have yet mustered the necessary five votes to win the mayoral elections, though Maher has managed four votes over the past four election sessions.
Cambridge resident Minka vanBeuzekom, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 2009, said that there is a problem with the voting system under which the Council currently operates.
In an open letter to city councillors earlier this month, vanBeuzekom called on them to justify the votes they cast for mayor. The current election procedure does not require the councillors to give any explanation of their votes.
“The people must demand an era of transparency and accountability in all our elected officials,” the letter said.
VanBeuzekom contrasted a December 2009 editorial by new City Councillor Leland Cheung, in which he stated he would evaluate the mayoral candidates “on equal footing,” based on “their ideas, experience, and track record,” with the current election situation.
“What happened to the resolve displayed in that thoughtful article?” vanBeuzekom wrote.
In recent meetings, councillors have acknowledged that it is crucial to elect a mayor, as he or she would be responsible for appointing chairpersons of other government committees. Councillors have also repeatedly alluded to the mayor’s responsibility of chairing the Cambridge School Committee.
But local pundit Robert R. Winters said that some of the councillors vying for mayor may be exaggerating the implications of not having a mayor.
Winters, who teaches at the Harvard Extension School, said that the Council’s lack of other agenda items makes the mayoral issue appear more pressing than it really is.
“It’s a red herring,” he said. “The consequences [of not having a mayor] are virtually none.”
School Committee member Marc C. McGovern said that despite the stalemate over the mayoral election, he does not want people to have the impression that the Committee is not doing its work, as it is currently presided over by Acting Mayor Reeves.
“It does make it more of a challenge when we don’t know who will occupy that seat permanently,” McGovern said. “[However], we have too much stuff to do to wait for the City Council to get their stuff together.”
The next City Council meeting will take place on Feb. 22.

Harvard has claimed four of the 29 Gates Cambridge Scholars this year—more than any other American university.
Charles R. Melvoin ’10, Thomas M. Barron ’09, John Kapusta ’09, and 2006 Harvard Kennedy School graduate Queen C. Nworisara-Quinn will pursue M.Phil degrees in Development Studies, African Studies, Musicology, and Innovation, Strategy, and Organisation, respectively, according to an announcement on Friday.
The scholarship, created in 2000 with a $210 million grant from Bill and Melinda Gates, provides full funding for non-British students to pursue graduate study at the University of Cambridge.
“The Gates [scholarship] envisions a group of folks who have been really well trained at Cambridge who will make contributions in their field and real change in the world,” said Paul A. Bohlmann, the Office of Career Services’ director of fellowships.
Melvoin, a History and Literature concentrator in Lowell House, will focus on studying development in China next year.
“My interest in the culture was really sparked by the movie ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,’ to be honest,” said Melvoin, who has studied Chinese since high school.
Melvoin—who is also a Crimson magazine writer and a member of the College Events Board—said that he hopes to gain the necessary background in economics and development at Cambridge to eventually work in China. He said he plans to participate in crew and live in Jesus College at Cambridge.
Thomas Barron, an Army ROTC cadet at Harvard who is currently training at Fort Benning in Georgia, will put his military service on hold to complete his yearlong degree program at Cambridge.
He said that his plan to study East Africa stems from his personal interest in the region. His parents met in Africa, and his two older brothers were adopted from Tanzania, he said.
Barron, a former Social Studies concentrator who graduated with a secondary field in African and African American Studies, said he plans to work on American foreign policy in Africa.
But before then, he said, he will be deployed to Afghanistan within months of his graduation from Cambridge.
“I see being well educated and a good critical thinker as extremely important to being a good officer,” Barron said.
He added that he views the scholarship as both an obligation and an opportunity.
“It’s very humbling,” Brown said.
John Kapusta, a recent graduate of Harvard’s joint-degree program with the New England Conservatory, is currently studying voice and French classical vocal music on a Fulbright scholarship in Paris, according to the Gates Cambridge Scholarship Web site. Kapusta will focus on performance studies while at Cambridge. He could not be reached for comment last weekend.
Queen Nworisara-Quinn, who graduated with a master’s degree in public policy from the Kennedy School in 2006, has been living in Tunisia this past year while working for the African Development Bank. After Cambridge, she hopes to focus on improving entrepreneurship and investment opportunities in Africa, according to the Gates Cambridge scholarship Web site. She could not be reached for comment.

Dartmouth College, whose endowment fell by 23 percent last year, announced yesterday that it will alter its no-loan financial aid program due to financial difficulties and will reintroduce loans for families whose income is between $75,000 and $200,000.
Financial aid for families within that income bracket will consist of scholarships, work-study, and a loan requirement ranging from $2,500 to $5,500 annually.
In addition, Dartmouth announced that beginning in 2010, juniors will be required to apply for funding for summer research and academic programs in order to ensure that the school’s funds are spent appropriately.
During the past two years, juniors who chose to pursue academic enrichment activities were automatically granted a “free summer term.”
But Dartmouth also said that it would increase its financial aid budget by 10 percent next year and noted that its tuition waiver and no-loan expectation will remain in effect for families who make under $75,000 a year.
The total cost of attending Dartmouth for the 2010-2011 school year—including tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board—will increase by 4.6 percent.
Under Harvard College’s current financial aid policy, families who make under $60,000 are not expected to contribute at all to the cost of attending college.
No undergraduates are expected to take out loans, and families who make between $60,000 and $180,000 are expected to contribute no more than 10 percent of their annual income toward college expenses.
Dartmouth’s financial aid announcement comes at a time when universities around the country are struggling with shrinking endowments and cutting expenses to adjust to new fiscal realities.
A report released earlier this year found that college endowments had decreased by an average of 18.7 percent during the year ending June 30, 2009.
Williams College also recently announced that it would reinstate loans as part of its financial aid policy.

Harvard Hillel Associate Director Michael Simon will leave Harvard at the end of the academic year to assume the role of Executive Director of Fiedler Hillel at Northwestern University.
After seven years with Harvard Hillel, Simon said he decided to put himself back on the job market when his wife Claire Sufrin also began looking for a new job.
Simon—who graduated from Harvard Kennedy School in 1997—took a job as Harvard Hillel Programming Director in 2003 after he contacted Harvard Hillel Director Bernard Steinberg. Simon later rose to the position of Associate Director.
Before coming to Harvard Hillel, Simon spent significant time in Israel, an experience to which he credits his decision to pursue a job in the Jewish community.
“[It was] a time that was very meaningful and very special because I was doing extensive Jewish learning for the first time since my childhood,” Simon said.
Throughout his time at Harvard, Simon spearheaded many educational programs for students, including Netivot—a yearlong program for Jewish undergraduates that includes a trip to Israel. He has also served as an advisor for the Harvard Hillel’s Undergraduate Steering Committee.
Students and Harvard Hillel leadership said they would remember Simon for his ability to develop close and personal relationships.
“We’re losing somebody who can connect really closely with students,” said Gabriella L. Soble, Director of Student Activities at Harvard Hillel.
Steinberg, who worked closely with Simon during his time at Harvard, said that when working with students, Simon “felt he was having a conversation with the future.”
“He’s able to make individual connections where people will feel comfortable because they know him,” former Hillel President Rebecca D. Gillette ’10 said.
Simon, too, said he considered the personal connections he made with people at Harvard Hillel what made his work most exciting.
“First and foremost I’ll miss the people and the relationships that I’ve developed,” he said.
Simon added that his departure would be a bittersweet experience, because while he was sad to leave his partners at Harvard, he was also excited to seek out new opportunities at Northwestern.
“Students are at the center and the heart of this work, and that will definitely be the case at Northwestern Hillel as well,” he said.

Four service projects organized by Harvard students won grant money from the Park Street Church’s Social Change Competition, church officials announced last week.
As part of its 200th anniversary celebration, the Boston church set aside $200,000 from its endowment to fund nine student service initiatives, according to Park Street Church Reverend John E. Chung.
A team of Harvard undergraduates, a team of alumni, and two graduate school-affiliated teams were selected as winners, and their grant awards totaled $84,250.
The Social Change Competition sought out proposals that would integrate Christian mission work with “sustainable” projects that would create lasting change, Chung said.
“We really feel that it’s not the money that’s going to change the world,” Chung said. “It’s the passion.”
Harvard Christian Impact, which won $27,950, proposed the creation of a tutoring program that brings together students from Harvard and the University of Pretoria at the Mamelodi Township in South Africa. Former Christian Impact co-coordinator Michael P. Silvestri ’10 said he was inspired to start the program after traveling to South Africa with Christian Impact in the summer of 2007.
The grant money will cover all the program’s costs through the summer of 2011 except for Harvard students’ travel and board expenses, according to Silvestri.
Silvestri said that he and other members of Christian Impact have worked with officers from the Phillips Brooks House Association over the past year to try to make their education project viable in the long term.
“What [Harvard] students have really proven that they can do well is to get into college. Ironically, that is exactly what these students in South Africa need,” said Harvard chaplain Patrick G. McLeod, who works with Christian Impact. “College education is the ticket out.”
A proposal by three recent Harvard alumni to bring new media to the community on the border between China and North Korea was awarded $25,000.
Eric I. Lu ’09, Edward Y. Lee ’08, and June-Ho Kim ’09 said they plan to use the money to buy camera equipment for their project. Kim said that they are planning to look for additional sources of funding for their travel and housing expenses in China.
“We want to teach [the border community] how to use this to not only express themselves and to find a way to think critically, but to think creatively, to ask questions, and to be good storytellers,” Lu said. “One of the things that give people a life is a sense of voice.”
Two teams of Harvard-affiliated graduate students also won grants.
Six graduate students from the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School will use $25,000 from the church to start a micro-finance initiative for small entrepreneurs in Kenya.
Park Street Church also awarded $6,300 for a future photography exhibit encouraging missionary work in the Park Street Church community to Harvard Dental School student Hyewon Lee and Harvard Medical School research fellow Leo K. Iwai.
The graduate students could not be reached for comment.

Over 1,000 students and members of the Harvard community congregated in Sanders Theatre on Friday for the Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert, which raised roughly $37,000 for relief efforts and advocated for long-term assistance to the earthquake-devastated Caribbean nation.
The event—which was organized by students and supported by the Office for the Arts at Harvard—will donate all proceeds from the concert to Partners in Health. Partners, co-founded in 1987 by then-Harvard Medical School student and now-Harvard professor Paul Farmer, has been operating community health clinics in Haiti for over two decades.
“We will stand with the Haitian population,” Farmer said in a recorded video statement shot from Haiti.
Farmer, who has helped to coordinate international medical relief efforts as the United Nations Deputy Special Envoy to Haiti, thanked the Harvard community for its efforts and called Haiti “our oldest neighbor.”
Harvard undergraduates began to mobilize a task force and plan the benefit concert shortly after the earthquake struck Haiti on Jan. 12.
Harvard faculty helped support student efforts by subsidizing production costs.
“The Harvard community has so many talented student performers, and a concert would allow us to draw from those varied artistic talents to make a united relief effort,” said B.A. Sillah ’12, executive producer for the event.
The sold-out relief concert featured original dance and musical compositions by Harvard students. Performances included a show by the Drummers of the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble, a dance by the Caribbean Club Dance Troupe to the beat of Haitian-born singer Wyclef Jean, and a rendition of Maya Angelou’s poem “Still I Rise” from the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College.
University President Drew G. Faust also delivered an opening address, and College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds offered a closing reflection.
Speakers at the event praised Harvard’s active and quick response to the Haiti crisis
But they also emphasized the importance of providing long-term relief and reconstruction aid.
“How can we claim compassion fatigue if we never show consumption fatigue?” asked Sebastian Velez, assistant resident dean of Kirkland House and a speaker at the concert.
Velez recounted how he and four Harvard students delivered immediate relief to Haiti after the earthquake in the form of food and medical supplies.
In an effort to foster continued involvement and awareness among Harvard students, the Student Alliance For Global Health at Harvard brought together 22 global health and development-related groups from across campus in the basement of the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub after the concert.
“The goal was to use the high energy at Harvard about helping Haiti and show students how they can get involved in long-term projects,” said SAGHAH Board speaker Michael B. Hadley.
Ryan C. Juntado ’11, who attended the concert, said he had “never seen anything like this before” in his three years at Harvard.
“Harvard for Haiti is a good example of what Harvard students can do when they come together about a cause they are passionate about,” Juntado said.

The Office of Career Services and the Office of International Programs have reunited under an umbrella organization that also contains the newly created Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives, after nine years as separate entities.
The restructuring is part of a College-wide effort to improve efficiency within the administration, following a semester-long trial period of increased collaboration between the OIP and OCS.
Robin Mount, former interim director of OCS, was promoted to director of the new organization—the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities. Mount’s promotion was accompanied by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris’s announcement of the creation of the Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives—which will oversee the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE) and the undergraduate social sciences research initiative proposed by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Mount will be responsible for overseeing all three organizations’ budgets. A leadership team comprised of current OCS and OIP administrators, as well as newly appointed Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives Director Greg Llacer, will help her coordinate activities among the three offices, she said.
The staff and the administrative structure will remain largely unchanged in the three offices—which are collectively responsible for helping students find research, international study, and employment opportunities.
From a student perspective, much will also appear the same, but the new administrative system will make the umbrella organization more efficient, Mount said.
The OIP has been traveling around campus since its inception in 2001.
The organization once dwelled in the “windowless basement of OCS,” according to an e-mail from former Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby. When Kirby removed the OIP from under the jurisdiction of OCS and placed it directly under the control of the Dean of Undergraduate Education, the OIP temporarily occupied Wadsworth Hall before moving to University Hall.
After leaving University Hall last summer, the nomadic office relocated yet again, this time to 2 Arrow St. In the fall, the OIP returned to Dunster St. across from OCS. Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives will occupy the third floor of OCS’s building.
Kirby wrote that at the time, he separated the OIP from OCS as part of a push to support increased international opportunities for undergraduates.
“There is no right or wrong bureaucratic structure. There are some useful overlaps (in internships) with what OCS and OIP do, and so a re-association can make sense,” Kirby wrote in an e-mail. “But the purpose of OIP has been above all academic: to expand the educational opportunities of Harvard students. Perhaps OIP has succeeded enough that it will thrive under any administrative structure.”
For her part, Hammonds said she thought that these changes would improve the quality of advising students received.
“It seemed to make sense to bring them all together so that students have a seamless experience with people who know about all the different kinds of fellowships, internships, and other opportunities. It made perfect sense to me that we put them back [together],” she said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification and correction:
CLARIFICATION: February 19, 2010
The Feb. 16 news article "OCS, OIP To Merge Under Umbrella" referred to a newly created office called the Office of Undergraduate Research Opportunities. To clarify, the correct title is Office of Undergraduate Initiatives. In an e-mailed statement, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris had referred to the office by both names.
CORRECTION: February 19, 2010
An original version of the Feb. 16 news article "OCS, OIP To Merge Under Umbrella" gave Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives the acronym OURO. In fact, the Office has no official acronym, according to its Director Greg Llacer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-educated neuroscientist Amy Bishop, accused of killing three colleagues at the University of Alabama on Friday, was also a suspect in an attempted bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor in 1993.
Bishop and her husband had been questioned by authorities investigating the delivery of a package containing two unexploded pipe bombs to Paul Rosenberg, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and doctor at Children’s Hospital Boston. Bishop’s concern that she would not receive a positive evaluation on her doctoral work from Rosenberg and previous violent behavior made her a suspect at the time, according to the Boston Globe.
While Bishop and her husband James Anderson were never charged with attempting to bomb Rosenberg, the incident is one of two recent revelations that tie Bishop to a criminal investigation.
Reports that surfaced after the Feb. 12 shooting revealed Bishop’s involvement in the death of her brother Seth Bishop in 1986.
Bishop, who was 19 years old at the time, shot her brother at least three times before fleeing the scene.
She was later brought into police custody at gunpoint, Braintree Police Chief Paul H. Frazier said at a news conference.
The detailed police report of the 1986 accident, which had logged the shooting as a “sudden death,” has disappeared, Frazier said.
But an investigative report filed several months after the incident has surfaced, leading to rumors of a police cover-up. Former police chiefs in charge of the investigations of the 1986 shooting denied these allegations to several news outlets.
Bishop, a biology professor at the University of Alabama, opened fire during a faculty meeting at the University’s Huntsville campus Friday afternoon. She killed three instructors and wounded three employees. No students were injured.
News sources point out that Bishop had been denied tenure and would have had to leave her position at the end of the academic year—a possible motivation for the shooting.
Bishop completed her undergraduate education at Northeastern University and received a PhD from Harvard in 1993. She became an assistant professor at the University of Alabama in 2003.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Jacqueline C. Hairston ’10 heard about Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’s office hours this semester, she immediately added the date to her Google Calendar.
“I marked ‘run over [to University Hall]’ on my calendar,” Hairston said. “I thought there was going to be a long line [of people].”
Though there was not quite a “long line” of students waiting to talk to Hammonds at her first office hours session last Friday, many students did take advantage of the opportunity to speak with the dean on a personal level. Almost all the available 10-minute time slots were filled, according to College spokesperson Jeff Neal.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Hammonds said she decided to hold office hours this semester because she was looking for additional ways to engage directly with students and hear about their concerns.
“Office hours is one way I would do it if I were still teaching, so I figured that was a good way to...allow students to come in and talk to me if they wanted to,” she said.
Hairston, who came to drop off an Association for Black Harvard Women publication to which Hammonds had contributed, called the dean “really cool.”
“She asked me to autograph it,” Hairston said with a laugh.
Hairston, a statistics concentrator, added she was surprised by how welcoming Hammonds was.
“She seemed very interested in what I was doing,” Hairston said. “We ended up watching the Real Life Statistics [General Education course] trailer on her computer.”
During Hammonds’s first year as Dean of the College last year, some students and House officials criticized her and the College administration for what was perceived as a lack of transparency and a disconnect from the undergraduate experience.
For example, though Hammonds initially stated that she planned to hold monthly teas with students, she has more often met students in other settings.
Hammonds said earlier this month that many of her interactions with undergraduates have taken place at student events and athletic competitions, where she said she found it difficult to speak one on one with students.
“Dean Hammonds had several very positive conversations [on Friday],” wrote Neal in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “She looks forward to doing it again in the future.”
Hammonds will hold three more office hours sessions this semester on March 5, April 9, and May 7, from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Students will be able to sign up for time slots at University Hall starting at 11 a.m. on the same days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University’s U.S. stock holdings expanded last quarter, indicating that the University is continuing its buying trend that began last spring after it had sold off the majority of those publicly-traded assets during the financial crisis of 2008.
According to a disclosure form filed quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission and released last Friday, the value of Harvard’s publicly-traded stock portfolio grew from $1.8 billion in late September to $2.26 billion at the end of 2009.
While the number of companies and funds in which Harvard holds stock grew—Harvard reported 124 holdings in the SEC’s 13F filing, up from 107 the previous quarter—the majority of the University’s assets remain invested in emerging markets. A large portion—72 percent—of Harvard’s equities remain invested in 15 funds that track markets in countries such as China, Brazil, and South Korea.
The increase in Harvard’s stock holdings is part of a broader reinvestment in the market by the University after it slashed its holdings in late 2008. As the stock market plummeted and Harvard reportedly scrambled for liquidity, the University’s stock holdings dwindled from $2.8 billion in Sept. 2008 to only $571 million three months later. But since then, Harvard has steadily increased its stock holdings, especially in emerging markets and Asia.
Friday’s filing details only a fraction of the University’s endowment—slightly less than 10 percent—and includes only U.S.-traded equities that are directly owned by Harvard. The report lists foreign companies traded on U.S. exchanges, but does not include the University’s investments in private equity, bonds, real assets, or foreign stocks.
Harvard’s internal stock holdings have tended to favor foreign stocks in recent years, and that trend has continued, according to this latest report. While the proportion of Harvard’s equity holdings invested in emerging market funds has actually decreased slightly, the value of those investments has grown by almost $200 million to $1.6 billion.
Last quarter, the University nearly doubled its investment in an index fund tracking Chinese markets, while selling off more than half its holdings in an index fund of Taiwanese companies. But Harvard also sold nearly all its shares of a Japanese index fund, reducing its holdings from $10.6 million to just $1,000.
In tapping into overseas markets, the University has also looked beyond exchange traded funds—which are traded like stocks and track major indices—and has directly purchased shares of foreign companies such as Tata Motors, an Indian car manufacturer, and Baidu, a Chinese search engine.
While last week’s filing was dominated by foreign holdings, it also provided glimpses of HMC’s domestic strategy.
Harvard purchased over $35 million worth of shares in Bank of America and invested several million dollars in other U.S. financial firms as well. Additionally, the University purchased stakes in companies that have been the target of high-profile takeovers, including Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, recently purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, and Cadbury PLC, recently acquired by Kraft Foods.
Harvard also invested in some brands well known to students, buying $45 million of stock in Marvel Entertainment and $4,000 of stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment for this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—When superstar Jeremy Lin fouled out with 1:15 remaining in regulation, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker didn’t hesitate. He sent in rookie Dee Giger, who had played a total of two minutes on the night to that point.
Amaker’s faith in his young guard was soon rewarded, as Giger drained a game-tying three in front of his team’s bench with 27 seconds to play and later hit a trio of victory-clinching free throws in the waning seconds of overtime.
The freshman and his three classmates combined for 53 points, and co-captain Lin added 18 in 32 minutes, to help the Crimson (16-5, 5-2 Ivy) escape with an 82-79 overtime victory over Yale (9-15, 3-4) at John J. Lee Amphitheater Friday night.
“We’re very excited to have pulled this game out,” Amaker said. “For our kids to battle back, and these young guys...to make some of the plays that they made to get us into position...I think we felt comfortable in that environment—not that we want to be in that situation—but we had certainly worked on it before, and I think it paid dividends for us this evening.”
Without Lin to shoulder the scoring load, Harvard turned to its underclassmen in the extra period.
First-year point guard Brandyn Curry, who was a perfect 5-of-5 from the floor in his second consecutive start, contributed Harvard’s first four points of overtime on a pair of free throws and a put-back layup. Following a Bulldog free throw, freshman forward Kyle Casey got to the line and knocked down a pair of his own to give his team a one-point lead.
A tough missed layup by Yale captain Alex Zampier led to a Crimson fast break, which ended on a crucial left-corner triple by rookie wing Christian Webster. The dagger extended the Crimson’s advantage to 75-71. Zampier cut the deficit in half with a fast-break layup of his own—two of his game-high 32 points—but two possessions later, Harvard went back to the ever-dangerous Casey, who collected team-highs of 20 points and seven rebounds on the night.
Coming out of a timeout, sophomore guard Oliver McNally drove down the right side of the lane and slid a one-handed pass to Casey, who attacked the hoop and drew a foul. Casey’s two free throws put his team back up by four with just under a minute to go in overtime.
McNally nailed two free throws following a Yale layup, but he then fouled out, leaving the final outcome in the hands of the four freshmen and sophomore Max Kenyi.
With the Bulldogs forced to foul immediately, Giger was sent to the line on consecutive possessions. Blocking out the noise of an enemy crowd numbering 2,091, the sharpshooter went 3-of-4 at the stripe.
Faced with 13 seconds to make up a three-point deficit, Zampier missed two potentially game-tying three-pointers, sealing the Crimson’s win.
Simply reaching overtime was no easy feat for Harvard, which trailed 51-47 at the 7:28 mark in the second half.
But after a Yale turnover, Curry whipped a no-look pass to Webster, who converted a three-point play and brought his team within one. Neither team would lead by more than three the rest of the way.
The outlook for the Crimson became especially grim just prior to the last minute of regulation. Co-captain Doug Miller came up with a huge block in the paint, but Lin was eventually called for his fifth foul on the possession, setting the stage for Giger’s big shot.
Down 65-62 with 42 seconds to go, Casey missed a straight-on three, but the long rebound made its way to Giger, who swished a right-corner triple to tie the game.
“Coach needed me to do something, and my teammates needed me to hit this shot, so I came in confident and took the open shot,” Giger said.
After Bulldog forward Michael Sands went 1-of-2 from the line, giving Yale a one-point lead with seven seconds to play in regulation, McNally sprinted down the court and drew a foul at the right elbow.
His first attempt bounced off the back iron, but he made the second to tie things up at 66. Zampier’s desperation heave was well off the mark, sending the Ancient Eight rivals into overtime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Victory tasted good at the ECAC Championship last year, and this weekend, Harvard men’s tennis was back for seconds. This time, though, the win was served with a hint of upset.
The Crimson, which was seeded No. 1 in the tournament last year, repeated its performance this weekend from the No. 2 spot. The squad strung together commanding victories against Brown in the quarters and Princeton in the semifinal en route to a tough but gratifying victory over No. 1 Columbia.
“Now it puts a target on us for the Ivy season,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “But we’re going to enjoy it today and keep getting better.”
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 2
The Crimson (4-2) triumphed over Columbia (4-2) in the closely-contested final match of the ECAC tournament yesterday. Winning by a score of 5-2, Harvard held on to all three doubles matches and then took four of the six singles.
“It was close—up and down,” Fish said. “The lineup could’ve tipped either way at any moment.”
The Lions entered the tournament ranked No. 52 nationally, a significant notch above Harvard at No. 63. But the Crimson players entered the match with focused intensity.
Harvard opened by narrowly winning each of the doubles matches, redeeming its loss of the doubles point to Princeton the day before.
“Going in, we had a fire burning,” said junior No. 1 Alexei Chijoff-Evans. “We really wanted to beat these guys, and it didn’t culminate in nervousness—it culminated in really impressive fight. I’m really pumped about what happened today.”
Chijoff-Evans exemplified that fighting spirit, refusing to admit defeat even when things looked grim. After winning the first set at the No. 1 spot, the junior found himself down 4-1, 4-0 in the second. But something clicked, and he soared back to a 6-4 victory.
“I realized that what I was doing wasn’t working,” Chijoff-Evans said. “I was being less aggressive. I stopped forcing play, I stopped going for winners, I was back on my heels. I decided to go back to what worked. Luckily he made a few mistakes, and I sort of caught fire.”
Chijoff-Evans’ exciting win was key for Harvard, which was mostly outmatched at the top of the ladder.
“That was a big win for us,” Fish explained, “Columbia outmatched us at the two and three positions.”
As predicted, sophomore Alistair Felton lost at the No. 2 spot and junior Aba Omodele-Lucien fell at No. 3, but three freshmen—Joshua Tchan, Christo Schultz, and Andy Nguyen—swept the bottom half of the ladder to secure the win for Harvard.
Tchan’s match was the clincher, ending with a marathon point that looked all but lost for the Crimson. After his opponent’s shot pushed him way out of the court, Tchan returned the ball around the net post to miraculously win the point, as well as the game, set, match, and tournament.
“It’s amazing—[Harvard and Columbia] are two really fine teams teeing off,” Fish said. “We happened to get the edge today.”
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 1
On Sunday, Harvard cruised past Princeton (1-3) in the semifinal by a score of 6-1. After dropping the doubles point, Harvard rebounded with a sweep of all the singles matches.
Chijoff-Evans won in straight sets at the top of the ladder, as did Felton at No. 2. Omodele-Lucien won a close match at No. 3 and the rookies Tchan, Schultz, and Nguyen closed out the bottom of the ladder in that order.
“It was a really fun match, and a great wake up call for us as to what it would take to win the doubles point [against Columbia],” Fish said.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
Harvard beat Brown (5-4) soundly on Saturday to start off the tournament. After sweeping the doubles matches for the first point, the Crimson won four of six singles matches to seal the deal.
“We played very good doubles,” Fish said. “The guys really buckled down for that [match].”
Chijoff-Evans won, 6-2, 6-3, at the No. 1 spot, and was supported by victories by Felton at No. 3, Nguyen at No. 5, and Hayes at No. 6. Omodele-Lucien fell, 6-4, 6-4, at the No. 2 spot, and Tchan lost at No. 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A loss in the final matchup of the regular season would not seem like a happy ending.
But for Harvard’s No. 5 men’s squash team, an 8-1 loss against No. 2 Yale could not dampen the fact that during a self-proclaimed rebuilding year, the team is still finishing better than last season.
“Any team that was close to us comparatively, we beat,” Crimson coach Satinder Bajwa said. “Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn. All of these teams were very strong, but we didn’t lose.”
In fact for Harvard (5-4, 4-2 Ivy), the only losses of the year have come against teams ranked in the top four, including Saturday’s defeat at the Bulldogs’ Brady Squash Center (12-1, 6-0), which gave Yale sole possession of the Ivy League title.
“I think Yale played the best squash they could have played last Saturday,” Bajwa said. “That may not happen again.”
“When we went to Yale, we went with very high expectations,” said junior Richard Hill, who plays for the Crimson in the No. 2 position. “We thought we could pull off an upset against them and have a shot at a share of the Ivy Title. Unfortunately, the Yale guys played better than us, and that showed.”
But for a Harvard team that finished 3-3 in the Ivy League last year, losing out on the regular-season title is not that bad.
“I think this year has been a rebuilding year,” Bajwa said. “We’ve got a little more depth than last year. We’ve got a lot more character in the three freshmen that came and joined the team. They filled the shoes of some big players that we had last year who graduated.”
One of these freshmen, in fact, provided the closest game of the day. Zeke Scherl, playing in the No. 3 position, lost to his opponent, Aaron Fuchs, in a tight five games.
“Zeke as a freshman has been doing well right up there at No. 3 which is not easy,” Bajwa said. “He has been a game, or sometimes points away from victory, and I think it’s just a matter of a breakthrough. I would like to have seen him win, but the fact that he came so close to winning—he may have turned the corner.”
Scherl won two out of the seven total games won on Saturday. Juniors Hill in the No. 2 position and Eliot Buchanan playing at No. 6 also claimed a set of their own, before each fell, 3-1.
The last three games for the Crimson came from co-captain Colin West, who finished his last regular-season competition for Harvard with another win, beating Yale’s Kenneth Chan by a 3-1 count.
West completed 2010 with eight wins and only one loss, to No. 1 Baset Chaundry from Trinity. For Bajwa, there will again be big shoes to fill for next year’s freshmen with the loss of West and co-captain Frank Cohen.
“We are expecting a very good crop next year, so there’s a very good vibe in terms of how well we are potentially going to do, and how this year has really showed us how well we can challenge the top,” Bajwa said.
Even though the Crimson has confidence in next year’s potential progress, there is still one more team challenge—the College Squash Association National Team Championships next weekend.
“We’ve put in all of the hard work, we are as good as we can be, we can’t get any better, but we can work on more of the mental aspects,” Hill said. “That’s just coming up huge when it matters and when the pressure is on.”
“We are working on closing out some of the games,” Bajwa said. “We were very unlucky losing some close games 11-9, 12-10, 13-11, so we are focusing on finishing each game or set.”
Coming off two losses, Bajwa believes his team will have to take the positives of close play and the mental intensity of being a few points down into next week’s competition.
“We feel that we have every opportunity to go out and play our best and really do well against Princeton,” Bajwa said. “We have very good aspirations. If that confidence is carried on to this Friday, it could be one of those bonuses.”
“The season may be over but we will be heading to the playoffs next weekend with a lot of confidence,” Hill added. “It’s not over yet. We still have a good shot at doing well and finishing on a high note.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a thrilling finish to its regular season, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) defeated archrival No. 5 Yale (9-4, 3-3) to claim its 17th Ivy League title Saturday afternoon. Despite the Bulldogs’ home-court advantage in New Haven, the Crimson emerged victorious with a 7-2 win.
As a result of its stellar performance, Harvard also claimed the Barhite Award, presented each year to the team with the best dual performance record nationally. This marks the 11th time that the Crimson has received this award.
“It feels awesome to win, especially now being a senior,” co-captain Katherine O’Donnell said. “We’ve been so close the last three years and we finally won, so this was the perfect way to end everything out.”
Playing with a three-court system, Harvard showed its top-to-bottom strength as it made quick work of Yale.
At No. 6, sophomore Cece Cortes took three consecutive games. No. 9 freshman Sarah Mumanachit followed suit with a 3-0 victory of her own. Both women finished out the regular season with spotless individual records.
In keeping with her well-known and much-lauded consistency, freshman Natasha Kingshott extended her winning streak at the No. 5 position. She took the match 3-0, thereby ending her regular season undefeated as well.
In the No. 8 position, junior Bethan Williams kept her team’s momentum and her undefeated season going with a 3-0 sweep.
Yet, not all of the first six matches went so smoothly, as sophomore Nirasha Guruge and junior Alisha Mashruwala experienced tough losses. Despite a strong record entering the match, No. 2 Guruge fell, 3-1, to Yale’s Alia Aziz. No. 3 Mashruwala likewise could not hang on for the victory as she lost, 3-1, to Sarah Toomey.
Six matches in, the Crimson was thus 4-2, teetering on the brink of clinching the match and the Ivy League title.
The decisive match turned out to be O’Donnell’s victory at the No. 7 position. Having lost in her previous match against Princeton, O’Donnell explained how the defeat helped her prepare for her match against Yale.
“Last week, I lost on Sunday,” O’Donnell said. “So I tried to turn it into a positive so I wasn’t so complacent this week.”
Indeed, O’Donnell was anything but complacent. She was the model of efficiency, sweeping her opponent, 3-0.
Following her teammate’s exciting victory, freshman phenom No. 1 Laura Gemmell once again demonstrated why she deserves all of the hype. Winning her match, 3-0, Gemmell ended her freshman season without dropping a single game.
“I think for squash, mentality is definitely part of the game,” Gemmell said. “That’s what I’ve been trying to work on a lot this year.”
“I came in wanting to attack and take advantage of every shot,” she added.
Rounding out the day’s excitement was co-captain Johanna Snyder.
“Johanna played at No. 4 instead of No. 7 this week, so she definitely stepped up,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said.
Even out of her comfort zone, Snyder easily won the match, 3-0.
Undoubtedly, a large part of the Crimson’s victory was the direct result of a roster with great depth.
“We have a very strong team,” Bajwa said. “Sometimes...certain players have a tough day and they come up a little short, but we have such a strong team that we can always count on a player to step up.”
Having put on such a strong display of athleticism at the Brady Squash Center, Harvard clearly demonstrated its superior skill level. But O’Donnell pointed out that the team’s success was not purely the result of its athletic training.
“Our team is really mentally tough,” she said. “It’s about how much you concentrate and your will to win.”
The Crimson will take its strong mentality and well-honed athletic skills on the road in two weeks when it travels to the CSA National Team Championships in New Haven.
“Now, we have to go and fulfill our overall ambition of being [national] champions,” Bajwa said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a long weekend for the Harvard women’s tennis team, and not just because of President’s Day.
The squad participated in the ECAC Tournament in the Murr Center, playing three matches in as many days. After winning its opening round match, 6-1, over Cornell, the second-seeded Crimson lost to Yale, 6-1, on Saturday. On Sunday, Harvard took third place in the tournament with a 4-2 win over Princeton.
“This was a key tournament for us to see where we were,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “And now we see where we’re at, and we’re ready to keep on moving forward.”
The tournament was riddled with delays throughout the weekend for the eight teams, including seven Ivy League schools. Harvard’s matches were delayed by over two hours on each of the first two days, and an additional hour against Princeton. The team spent over 20 hours in the Murr Center over the weekend.
“It was a long day for us,” sophomore Holly Cao said following the match on Saturday that finished over seven hours after it was scheduled to begin.
No. 62 Harvard (5-2) opened the tournament with a commanding victory over the Big Red (6-4).
“[Cornell is] a pretty athletic team,” Green said. “Our players hung in there the whole way.”
After helping her team win the doubles point, No. 79 Cao took her singles match, 6-3, 6-0, at the No. 1 position.
“Holly is one of the top singles players in the Ivy League right now,” Green said.
No. 86 freshman Hideko Tachibana won, 6-3, 6-2, at No. 2, and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans won in straight sets from the No. 4 spot, 6-1, 6-1.
With Harvard already moving on in the tournament, freshmen Kristin Norton at No. 3 and No. 95 Sophie Chang at No. 5 each won in a super tie-break, while sophomore Sam Gridley lost in her abbreviated third set.
On Saturday, the Crimson couldn’t handle No. 43 Yale (8-1). The third-seeded defending ECAC champion Bulldogs outplayed Harvard to take the first two doubles matches.
“Yale played extremely well today,” Green said. “They were on fire in the doubles. They were too much for us. We can improve on pretty much every category. It was a learning experience for us.”
But once Tachibana and Norton won their doubles match, the momentum momentarily switched to the Crimson’s favor, as the three opening singles matches went Harvard’s way in the first set.
“We were clawing our way back there, but it just wasn’t our day today,” Green said.
Only Cao was able to close out her opponent with a 6-2, 6-4 win to tie the overall score.
“I was definitely glad to win the second set,” Cao said. “I did not want to go to a third.”
Unforced errors hampered Norton’s second and third sets, as she lost, 0-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
“Kristin pretty much ran out of gas,” Green said. “But Kristin’s a solid player for us...and I’m sure she’ll learn...from this.”
Chang also dropped her last two sets after taking the first, losing 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
In the second trio of singles matches, Tachibana lost, 6-4, 6-3, to clinch the match for Yale.
Rosekrans forced a third set but then lost 6-3, 4-6, (10-6), as did freshman Alexandra Lehman, 7-6, 4-6, (10-6) playing at the No. 6 spot.
“We have a couple things we want to work on,” Cao said after Saturday’s loss.
Against top-seeded No. 46 Princeton (4-3), Cao won for the third time on the weekend to even the score after the Tigers took the doubles point.
Tachibana earned a point for Harvard in dramatic fashion, outplaying her opponent in the second-set tiebreak to take the match, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2).
Rosekrans won easily, 6-0, 6-1, while Chang rounded out Harvard’s winners with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) win.
Following the Crimson victory over the Tigers, Yale defeated fifth-seeded Dartmouth (7-1) to take its second-consecutive ECAC Tournament championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When sophomore guard Brogan Berry calmly stepped up to the foul line and sank two free throws to give Harvard a 15-point lead with 33 seconds left, there was a palpable sigh of relief on the Crimson bench.
It was one of the few relaxed moments that the Harvard women’s basketball team (14-7, 5-2 Ivy) could enjoy against Brown (6-16, 3-5) on its way to a 66-51 victory at Lavietes Pavilion Saturday night.
For the second-straight evening, freshman Victoria Lippert led the way for the Crimson, posting a career-high 27 points. The rookie shot 9-for-15 from the field and a perfect 7-for-7 from the charity stripe.
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith credited Lippert’s play to her being moved to forward.
“We were having her try to go around screens and she wants to go through screens,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a very physical, strong, powerful player. It was a brilliant idea on our part and she is happy and you can see the numbers show it.”
“She is a machine,” junior forward Emma Markley added.
The Bears looked out of sorts from the beginning, as the Crimson used a 2-3 zone to race out to 16-4 lead with 10:40 left in the first half. That’s when Brown began to employ a full-court press, causing Harvard to scramble.
“We want to able to break the press and still feel good about the sets we run,” Delaney-Smith said. “So if we are not getting into our sets, which we weren’t...we were trying to shoot quickly and it wasn’t always the right decision. Sometimes it was the quick decision that was the wrong decision.”
Two quick fouls by junior co-captain Christine Matera forced her to sit out the remainder of the half, and the Bears pounced, going on a 9-0 run.
“[Matera] is very controlled and methodical—she brings poise to our team.” Delaney-Smith said. “And I thought we lacked that in the first half. We needed that leadership on the floor to calm us down and let us know that things were fine.”
A fast-break layup by Brown guard Hannah Passafuime tightened the game to 24-23 with 1:49 left in the first half.
That woke up Harvard, which responded with a 15-4 run that extended into the second half, keyed by a three-pointer from Berry.
Matera was eager to return to action in the second half, scoring a three-pointer 30 seconds in. She finished with 12 points.
But Matera wasn’t the only one eager to reverse trends in the second half.
After Markley posted a humble four points, one rebound and one block in the first half, she came out of halftime with a vengeance, swatting away two shots in a single possession.
“Things just clicked in the second half,” Markley said. “I got a little angrier and a little bit more fired up.”
She was a force in the paint for the rest of the half, finishing with 17 points, seven boards and six blocks.
Yet despite the strong effort from Markley, Harvard was unable to put Brown away for good in the second half.
“Credit Brown for how scrappy they were, they played the underdog role well,” Delaney-Smith said. “[They played with] nothing to lose...They are deep—just [kept] putting waves of people at us.”
The Bears got as close as six following a layup from Christina Johnson with eight minutes left in the second, but the Crimson was able to respond.
Berry drove the lane to dish to a wide-open Miriam Rutzen for an easy lay-up. Rutzen then got a block on the other end of the floor, leading to two free throws for Lippert and setting off a 17-8 Harvard run to close out the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—It is not very often that a team’s leading scorer can have his lowest scoring output of the season and still be praised by the opposing coach for his offensive effectiveness.
But such was the case Saturday night when co-captain Jeremy Lin finished with five points on six shots in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s win over Brown.
“It looks like his point production has dropped, but his effectiveness hasn’t changed any,” Brown coach Jesse Agel said. “As his teammates have developed, he’s had to do less, and he’s done more facilitating, all to the greater good of their team.”
Facing double teams and early-help defense, Lin deferred to his teammates early and often, finishing with a game-high seven assists with just one turnover. When Lin was able cut to the basket and draw the extra defender, the guard was able to find his open teammates who knocked down the shots.
Although the 6’3 guard managed to finish with seven assists, Lin struggled to find his teammates early on. By the end of the first half, Lin had recorded just a single assist and had not taken a shot.
His lone field goal came with 11:22 remaining in the contest. With Lin holding the ball on the right wing, co-captain Doug Miller set a screen to the right of Lin’s defender. Lin jabbed left, then went right and finished with a layup
Lin’s five points broke his previous season low of six points, which Lin recorded twice this season in games against Army and Santa Clara.
YOUNG MONEY
Harvard basketball fans worrying about their program’s future when Jeremy Lin retires his Crimson uniform may have found their savior.
A day after dropping 20 points on Yale, freshman Kyle Casey finished with 27 points and nine rebounds on Saturday night, matching his career scoring high. Casey worked both inside and outside, knocking down three deep balls while also managing to have his way in the paint over weaker Brown defenders.
“That guy has a lot of potential, and he’s going to have a great four years,” Lin said. “It’s just a matter of time before he takes over the league, I think.”
Casey, who did not make a single three-point shot until Harvard’s 13th game of the season against Seattle, has since been lighting it up from deep. In Harvard’s last 10 games, the freshman has shot 12-of-21 from beyond the arc, a rate of 57 percent.
With less than six minutes left in Saturday’s contest, Casey’s shooting sealed the game for the Crimson. The rookie hit back-to-back three pointers, and Harvard’s lead would not fall below double digits for the remainder of the contest.
Casey matched his career high with just over two minutes left in the game. After classmate Brandyn Curry missed a three from the corner, Casey swooped in to pull down the offensive rebound. He exploded back up to the basket, dropping in the easy two.
EXECUTIVE DECISION
Following Harvard’s back-to-back losses to Cornell and Princeton, Amaker made the decision to switch up the Crimson’s starting lineup. With the new lineup in place, the Crimson has pulled out three straight victories.
Amaker has opted for a defensively-oriented lineup, replacing sophomore point guard Oliver McNally and freshman wingman Christian Webster with freshman Brandyn Curry and sophomore Max Kenyi.
The new, more athletic lineup has given teams trouble early on but has also allowed the Crimson to receive a scoring boost from its bench.
“Webster and McNally coming off the bench, being a little more offensively aggressive, is giving us the points and production we’ve missed coming off the bench,” Amaker said.
Webster has seen the biggest increase in production, finishing in double figures in each of the last three games after failing to do so for nearly a month.

In preparation for the upcoming Ivy League Championships, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team invited Northeastern University to Blodgett Pool for a practice meet on Friday night.
The Crimson excelled in the friendly, relay-based matchup, not only posting wins in 10 of 11 events but also gaining valuable experience for the championship tournament it will host on Feb. 25-27.
Harvard started off the meet with solid times in the swimming events.
The Crimson ‘A’ teams won the 3x50-yard butterfly relay with a time of 1:19.38 and the 3x50-yard backstroke relay in 1:22.72.
The ‘B’ teams also triumphed in a fair share of races, taking the 3x50-yard breaststroke relay (1:34.55), 3x100-yard medley relay (3:01.38), and the 200-yard medley relay (1:50.69).
The only race the Huskies won on the day was in the 500-yard freestyle, coming in three seconds ahead of the Harvard ‘A’ team in 4:47.90.
In the only individual swimming matchup, co-captain Alexandra Clarke came in first in the 1000-yard freestyle, recording a time of 10:21.21. Co-captain Kay Foley was second in 10:24.05.
When it came to diving, the Crimson took the top three spots in the 3-meter competition but allowed Northeastern to take second place in the 1-meter dive.
Junior Jenny Reese and freshman Brittany Powell had strong performances at the meet, finishing first in their respective diving fixtures.
Harvard has little over a week before vying for the Ivy League title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team struggled to come up with wins this weekend, but its co-captains, J.P. O’Connor and Louis Caputo, dominated as they have all season.
Harvard (2-12-1, 0-3 Ivy) fought against tough opponents but lost in lopsided bouts to Brown in Providence, R.I. on Saturday and Lehigh at the MAC on Sunday. The Crimson fell in similar fashion both days, losing to the Bears, 33-12, before falling to the Mountain Hawks, 37-11.
Despite not coming through with a team victory, the captains and coach were still proud of the way the Crimson grapplers showed energy on Sunday given their difficult loss the day before.
“We did better this weekend than last weekend,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We were outmatched, but we wanted to just fight, and they fought better today [than against Brown]. If they do that, they’re going to make a progression. and that’s what we want.”
LEHIGH 37, HARVARD 11
The Crimson suffered a tough loss to the No. 7 Mountain Hawks (14-3-1, 3-0-1 EIWA) on Sunday. In its final home match of the season, Harvard started off strong, but could not carry the momentum through all the matchups.
Freshman Steven Keith (125 lbs.) opened by defeating his opponent, 13-0. Keith got an early takedown and never looked back as he won by major decision. It was Keith’s 14th win of his first season with the Crimson.
“We get to choose what weight we want to start with, and I always start with 125 [pounds],” Weiss said. “I know [Steven] is going to go 100 percent and get fired up, no matter what.”
No. 1 O’Connor (157) continued his undefeated season, taking down his opponent Brian Tannen, 16-5, in front of a raucous home crowd. O’Connor notched takedown after takedown in a dominant performance. Every time Tannen looked ready to escape, O’Connor easily threw him to the mat, controlling his 24th win of the season from start to finish.
“Personally, I think I wrestled well,” a satisfied O’Connor said. “I just went out there and wrestled like I have been for four years now.”
No. 6 Caputo (184) finished off his home season strong with a 6-0 defeat of his opponent. After losing the past few times they have met, Caputo finally bested his rival, No. 15 David Craig.
“It felt really good today,” Caputo said. “It’s really neat to have this opportunity to have a rival and it’s great it went my way. It was a great opportunity and it was fun.”
But for the seniors, Sunday was the last day that they would step out in front of the home crowd, as the final match of the weekend marked Senior Day for Harvard.
“I honestly didn’t even think about it until one of my friends on the team said it was the last home match,” O’Connor said. “It kind of hit me, and I thought about it for a minute, but I tried not to think about it too much. It’s been a great ride and the season’s not over yet.”
BROWN 33, HARVARD 12
The Crimson began strong with a win from Keith, but the results were the same on Saturday as Harvard suffered its 11th defeat of the season and remained winless in the Ivy League after falling to the Bears (4-11, 1-2 Ivy).
Along with the rookie standout, the two seniors continued to set the standard for the Crimson, each picking up wins with impressive showings. O’Connor began what would be an undefeated weekend, pinning his opponent, Max Lewin, in 29 seconds. Fellow co-captain Louis Caputo captured a 6-0 victory at 184 pounds over Bran Crudden. Keith’s 13th win of the season came against Brown’s Greg Einfrank, but no other grappler could earn points as Harvard came up short.
With the team struggling in dual competition, Harvard will look to finish its team contests against Columbia and Cornell this weekend and move to the individual season. For O’Connor and Caputo, this postseason represents one last chance to earn titles at the EIWA Championships and the NCAA Championships.
“We’re going to finish the best we can and we’re gearing up for the individual,” O’Connor said. “Hopefully, I can finally get that conference tournament title. I’ve been to the finals three times.”
The grapplers’ coach is equally excited for the individual season, as Weiss wants to honor two of the Harvard program’s most storied competitors.
“Those two mean the world to me,” Weiss said. “They’re two of the most respected people I’ve ever coached as far as how people view them, and they’ve done so much for our program...The next couple of weeks are going to be real exciting. I want the best [for them] because they deserve the best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A two-win weekend would have given Harvard coach Katey Stone a share of the NCAA Division I career wins record for women’s hockey. But a weekend journey to splitsville means that Stone and the No. 5 Crimson will have to keep looking for the victory while the ECAC regular-season title hangs in the balance.
Rensselaer (14-11-6, 11-5-4 ECAC), which stands tied with Harvard (17-6-4, 12-6-2) for third in the ECAC standings, made a push for playoff home ice with a home 3-2 overtime victory Friday night. But the Crimson kept pace with the Engineers by responding with a 2-1 victory at Union (5-26-1, 1-18-1) on Saturday.
HARVARD 2, UNION 1
There’s nothing like a match-up against a league bottom-dweller to cure a hangover from a heartbreaking loss.
But try as it might, the Crimson couldn’t quite put Friday night’s loss out of its head by the time of its Saturday matchup against the Dutchwomen.
Maybe lingering dissatisfaction isn’t such a bad thing.
“Everyone was a little upset about the score on Friday,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “We came out a little stronger. We played with a little more intensity.”
The increased intensity proved necessary against a Union team that played better than its record might have suggested.
“Union was pretty tough—they hung in there with us,” freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “We kind of just got through it. We just struggled as a whole...they contained us really well.”
Certainly the game had a different feel than Harvard’s 4-0 victory over Union at home on Jan. 22.
“They definitely came to play,” junior forward Katharine Chute said. “They put out their best effort.”
And the Dutchwomen held the Crimson scoreless for the entire first period.
Finally, Buesser found the back of the net off a rebound for Harvard’s first goal since the beginning of Friday’s third period.
“Hard work got her that goal,” Bellamy said.
Less than seven minutes later, it was Randi Griffin’s turn. The senior scored a power-play goal off assists from defensemen junior Leanna Coskren and co-captain Kathryn Farni.
And the two-goal lead was enough to hold off Union, which scored midway through the second to put the game within one. Chelsea Heinhuis was the only Dutchwoman to solve junior Kylie Stephens, who made 13 saves in net for her first win since returning to the team last month.
“She did a great job,” Chute said.
The weekend gave Stone the chance to tie former Colby and Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson’s career wins mark, but Friday’s loss prevented President’s Day weekend from becoming a Stone coronation. Saturday’s win gives Harvard a chance to get Stone the nod in the regular season’s final weekend.
“She’s never one to boast about her career,” Buesser said. “It means something to be a Harvard hockey player. She’s built a program that is truly respected. It’s very much because of what she’s done and how she coaches.”
RENSSELAER 3, HARVARD 2
With a two-goal lead and 10 minutes left to play in regulation, it seemed that the Crimson had all the cushion it needed to cruise to its seventh-straight victory. But unfortunately for Harvard, that streak would be bookended by losses to the Engineers, whose forechecking style stumped the Crimson twice this season.
When Amanda Castignetti scored at 11:19 in the third, Harvard still a one-goal lead. But a little over eight minutes later, RPI senior Allison Wright found the puck on a breakaway. With 35 seconds left in regulation, she sent it past Bellamy.
“It was just a nice shot from the top of the circle,” Buesser said. “They had that one rush.”
Ironically, the period in which Harvard was outscored was the only one in which it managed to outshoot the Engineers, who held a 25-14 shot advantage through two periods.
“We don’t like to give up a lot of shots,” Buesser said. “We may have been too focused on offense and forgotten about defense. We need to get back to that mindset.”
But the Crimson didn’t figure things out fast enough to stop Wright, whose stick would again prove lethal in the extra frame.
Wright scored two goals within a minute of ice time to turn Harvard’s one-goal lead on its head, giving RPI a 3-2 overtime victory. The senior’s second goal of the night came 19 seconds into extra time—and mirrored the score of last year’s ECAC semifinal contest, when the Engineers ended the Crimson’s season in an overtime heartbreaker.
“I think they were able to win [a faceoff] on the offensive end,” Buesser said. “It was a backhand that went through a tiny hole in our goaltender.”
However small the hole might have been, it was just big enough to let the game slip through it.
“Friday night was tough,” Buesser said. “Coach Stone tells us to think about it till midnight and then put it behind us.”

Just as the Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s victory seemed inevitable, a three-goal comeback by Union in the final six minutes of the game threatened its triumph. But it wasn’t quite enough to overcome the Crimson.
Harvard prevailed with a 4-3 victory over the No. 16 Dutchmen (16-8-6, 10-4-4 ECAC) at Bright Hockey Center on Saturday night.
Led by sophomore forward Alex Killorn and junior goaltender Kyle Richter, the Crimson (7-15-3, 7-8-3 ECAC) swept first-place Union in regular season play.
“We realize that for every game and every win, the points are so huge since we are so close with these teams,” Killorn said.
And against the Dutchmen, every goal mattered.
After a scoreless first period, Harvard offensive standout Louis Leblanc left the game early in the second after taking a blow to his head from the puck. Leblanc was reportedly in good spirits after the contest, and the Crimson did not allow his removal to throw off its game.
Harvard proceeded to pull ahead in the second period with three goals in 14 shots. Freshman Alex Fallstrom started off the Crimson by sneaking the puck past Union’s Corey Milan from the right boards at 1:41. The tally gave Harvard some needed momentum, and about five minutes later, freshman David Valek converted on the rebound of junior Pier-Olivier Michaud’s blocked shot. Killorn logged the final goal of the period after junior Michael Biega won a battle for the puck in the corner and fed the rookie with a nice pass.
But the Crimson’s scoring spree wasn’t finished yet. Killorn’s second goal came on a power play about halfway through the third period.
“We were moving [the puck] around really well, and I got a nice pass from Alex Fallstrom,” Killorn said. “I just took a shot and beat [Milan] close side.”
“I think it is important that we are able to get a power play goal every night,” added Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, “because most nights it can be the difference.”
With a 4-0 lead and only 10 minutes left, the Crimson seemed to be in a good position for the shutout win. But the Dutchmen were just getting started.
Union led 34-26 in shots for the game, with 16 of these shots coming in the final period. The Harvard men could only hold for so long, and the Dutchmen scored their first goal at 14:27 off a power play. Determined to continue his team’s comeback, Union coach Nate Leaman substituted Milan in favor of another offensive player. The Dutchmen punched in their second goal with a six-on-four advantage in the last few minutes and logged their final score with only 3.4 seconds remaining in the game.
But time ran out on Union, and the Crimson stayed strong for the 4-3 win, leaving Donato pleased with his team.
“In general, I am very happy with the way the guys played,” Donato said. “We were much more disciplined with our decisions with the puck and taking penalties.”
Although every goal counted on Saturday night, Harvard’s defense kept it in the game. Richter led the squad with a standout performance between the pipes, logging 31 saves on the night.
“Richter was outstanding in the net all night,” Donato said. “Your goalie is always your best penalty killer, and I think Richter was there for us when the opportunity presented itself.”
The Dutchmen converted only one of their six power play attempts, demonstrating the Crimson’s defensive strength throughout the game. But the team did not overlook its breakdown in the last six minutes.
“I think it is obviously disappointing when they score three goals in [such a short] time span,” Killorn said. “A 60-minute game is something we’ve been working on.”
Finishing strong will be especially important for Harvard with tough games against conference rivals Cornell and Colgate coming up next weekend. The Crimson aims for victories against these two competitors to earn a bid for home ice in the playoffs.
Yet with Saturday night’s game, Harvard continued to prove its ability to defeat tough opponents.
“[Union] is a veteran team and at the top of our league for a reason,” Donato said. “I am very happy to get the win tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team started on fire against Rensselaer at the Bright Hockey Center on Friday, scoring two goals in the first two minutes. But the strong start was not enough as the Engineers rallied from behind to take the lead in the second period. Even though the Crimson (7-15-3, 7-8-3 ECAC) outshot Rensselaer (16-13-3, 9-7-2), 10-2, in the third period, the Engineers withstood the barrage and came away with a 5-4 road victory.
“It was one of those games that was a fan’s delight and a coach’s nightmare,” Rensselaer coach Seth Appert said.
And sure enough, the Engineers’ fans shook the arena with their cheers in the final minutes, as their team completed a two-goal comeback.
Harvard senior defenseman Jack Christian’s first goal of the year came 18 seconds into the first period, when he rocketed a slap shot from the left circle that crushed the post before rebounding into the goal. Just moments later, his teammate, sophomore forward Daniel Moriarty, deflected a shot into the Rensselaer net, but the tally was called back due to high sticking.
In the second minute, Crimson junior Michael Biega received a pass from freshman Louis LeBlanc and struck the puck past Engineer goalie Allen York for the second score of the game.
“I thought it was a wild first two periods,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We got off to a good start. We put a lot of pucks on the net in the first few minutes.”
Despite an early deficit, Rensselaer regrouped, and Engineers forward Jerry D’Amigo made the score 2-1 in the 11th minute, when he broke past Harvard’s last defender, cut hard to his left, and shot over the glove of junior goaltender Ryan Carroll.
“The last thing we talked about was doing the job on their big line,” Donato said. “D’Amigo had a goal, and [Chase] Polacek had two. That was probably the difference in the game.”
Harvard freshman forward Alex Fallstrom responded with a power play goal two minutes later, taking advantage of a holding penalty by Rensselaer.
But the Crimson’s lead would not hold up, for in the span of 20 seconds, the Engineers scored twice to tie up the game, 3-3. At that point, Donato decided to pull Carroll for junior Kyle Richter.
“We didn’t think the goals were great that went into the net and we wanted to make a switch,” Donato said. “We wanted to give ourselves a chance to have someone there that’s playing their best.”
Harvard came out in the second period more composed, passing the puck around to make the most of its possessions. In the fourth minute, the Crimson retook the lead.
Captain Alex Biega initiated the goal-scoring play when he attempted a slap shot, which made its way through traffic. After some jostling in front of the crease, freshman forward Conor Morrison picked up the rebound and directed it past the distracted goaltender.
But that would be the end of the scoring for Harvard, as Rensselaer tied the game late in the second period and took the lead for the first time on a power play, making the score 5-4. Despite outshooting the Engineers, 10-2, in the third period, the Crimson could not convert and came away with a disappointing loss at home.
“We had to be committed to doing the little things for the entire game and we got away from it,” Donato said. “Oddly enough, I thought that in the third period we played our best...as tough of a start as York had, I thought he was pretty solid in the third.”
York had 29 saves overall and shut out Harvard in that critical third period to seal the Engineer comeback.
“It was obviously disappointing,” Alex Beiga said. “We played about six different periods in three periods...[and] we got away from our game later on.”
Harvard has four ECAC games remaining—two at home and two on the road.
“I think every point counts, and we are trying to get as good a spot as we can going into the playoffs,” Donato said. “We want to try to get home ice…the next [few] games for us will have a large impact on that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, in sports, it seems that one team will always have another team’s number.
For example, coming into Saturday night’s matchup, the Harvard men’s hockey team was 29-5-3 all-time against No. 16 Union, including a 4-1 win in Schenectady on Jan. 22. That’s why it was not an enormous surprise that the inconsistent Crimson was able to pull out a victory at the Bright Hockey Center Saturday night, despite the Dutchmen’s position atop the ECAC hockey standings and their national ranking.
The key now will be building on the win. Harvard only has one winning streak the entire season, which came in mid-January. Since that streak, the Crimson has only come away with two wins in the past eight games.
The season has been especially up-and-down in ECAC play, in which Harvard holds a 7-8-3 record.
“At this point we have four games left, [with] a pretty emotional weekend next weekend with Cornell and Colgate coming in, so this was a huge win,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We’re obviously looking up and this gives us a chance for next weekend to really have a lot of opportunities to move up [because] this is a place we want to play in the playoffs.”
Future success all starts in net, where juniors Ryan Carroll and Kyle Richter have rotated throughout the season. Both have shown flashes of brilliance, but neither has been consistent enough to hold down the starting job.
Richter, for example, was phenomenal for over two and a half periods Saturday night, before allowing three goals in a six-minute stretch at the end of the game. The previous night against Rensselaer, he got the loss after allowing two goals, but that was only after he was subbed in for Carroll, who allowed three in just 14 minutes of playing time.
Continued strong play from Richter would be an enormous boost if the Crimson is going to make any sort of postseason run.
FINISHING STRONG
Regulation hockey games are played for exactly 60 minutes—no shorter, and, barring overtime, no longer.
For Harvard, taking that message to heart has been something that the team has been working on all season and that it still needs to make a reality.
That couldn’t have been more true Saturday night against Union. The Crimson took a 4-0 lead into the final six minutes of play against the Dutchmen, but almost let the advantage slip away. Union scored three times in that time span, two of those coming in a six-on-four situation with under a minute to go.
“We’ve definitely got to work on [finishing],” Richter said. “I thought it was a great game overall, but we have to look into playing a full game next weekend against some tough teams.”
YOUTH IS SERVED
Killorn scored two goals Saturday night, giving him nine on the year. That mark makes him good for third on the team behind a pair of freshmen forwards, Louis Leblanc and Conor Morrison, who both have 10 on the season. The fact that Harvard’s top three goal-scorers are all first- or second-year players bodes well for the future of any hockey team.
On his first goal, Killorn was able to get wide open in front of the net, where he received a pass from junior Michael Biega from behind the goal that he was able to slap in.
“It was weird because there was no one on me,” Killorn said. “I had like a second or two to just take a shot, and I ended up getting lucky.”
On his second tally, the sophomore was able to connect on another slapshot after assists from Morrison and another freshman, Alex Fallstrom, who sent him a nice cross-ice pass.
Leblanc, meanwhile, left the game early in the second period and did not return.
“I think he got hit with the puck in the ear or back of the head,” Donato said. “We’ll see where that ends up, but he seemed to be in good spirits afterwards, which is a good sign.”
Much like the team’s need to get consistent play in net, the team’s offensive youth will have to continue scoring at a high rate if its dreams of playoff success  are to come to fruition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of Friday’s women’s basketball game, Yale coach Chris Gobrecht’s face was as red as the ‘H’ on the center of the court. The Crimson (13-7, 4-2 Ivy), employing a lethal zone defense, stifled her Bulldogs’ offensive attack all night while creating plenty of offensive opportunities in the paint 94 feet away in a 88-65 win Friday at Lavietes Pavilion.
Harvard held Yale (9-12, 4-3) to 40.7-percent shooting for the contest, including just 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. The Crimson also effectively contained the Bulldogs’ reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week, Megan Vasquez, holding her to only 11 points.
Harvard set the tone for the game early, as junior Emma Markley won the opening tip and sent the ball to sophomore Brogan Berry, who penetrated through Yale’s man-to-man press and scored a driving layup only six seconds into the game. The teams traded baskets and the lead for the first seven minutes of the game until the Crimson began pounding the ball inside, opening up an 11-point lead with seven minutes remaining in the half.
The Crimson also took advantage of Yale’s full-court press, which allowed Harvard to beat Yale players off the dribble and prevented the Bulldogs from being able to help inside on Markley or freshman Miriam Rutzen, who contributed nine points off the bench.
“[Gobrecht] plays a lot of physical man-to-man face guard, and I thought we handled it really well,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
However, it was freshman Victoria Lippert who benefited most from the Bulldogs’ sub-par press, as most of her game-high 21 points came off drives to the hoop.
“There was a lot of good passing action tonight,” Lippert said. “My teammates really set me up.”
Many of those passes came from Berry, who tied her career high with nine assists and also added 15 points and a steal.
Harvard had trouble scoring in the paint when junior Emma Markley was called for her second foul with 9:18 remaining in the first half, and the Crimson was forced to finish the first half with their most significant post presence on the bench.
Yale was able to cut Harvard’s double-digit lead down to seven with a 5-0 run just before the break as Markley sat and watched from the bench, but that was as close as the Bulldogs would get for the rest of the game.
“Young errors, bad passes, bad decisions—they kept [Yale] in the game,” Delaney-Smith said.
When Markley returned in the second half, she continued to maintain her dominance inside, converting a left-handed hook shot over two Yale defenders.
The Crimson continued to dominate in the second half and stretched the lead to 22 with 11 minutes remaining in the contest. Yale cut the lead down to 12 with less than five minutes left and appeared poised to make a run, but the Crimson connected on three consecutive three-pointers to stretch the lead back to 21.
The Crimson defense, led by the inside presence of Markley—who had four blocks to add to her 16 points in only 19 minutes on the court—forced Yale to launch 21 three-pointers, most of which were heavily contested.
However, Delaney-Smith questioned some of the fouls called on her post defenders.
“[Yale is a] dirty, nasty, physical team that took all threes, and they [went] to the line more than us,” she said.
All but one Crimson player scored Friday night, contributing to the balanced attack that is a big part of Harvard’s success. The Crimson also dominated the paint, outscoring the Bulldogs, 56-30, from close range.
The Crimson’s inside presence was a constant source of frustration for Gobrecht, who was assessed a technical foul in the second half when she didn’t agree with a foul call against her Bulldogs, and her critiques of the officials could be heard over the Harvard band.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Harvard’s season was hanging in the balance. Yale forward Jordan Gibson’s layup at the end of the first half made the score 34-25 in the Bulldogs favor. The Crimson labored for much of the opening period, scoring just five points over the final 10 minutes of the frame.
“I can’t repeat it,” joked Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of his halftime speech. “I wasn’t pleased with the latter part of the first half and how we played.”
Whatever Amaker told his players apparently made an impression as the Crimson opened the second half on fire.
The run began with a drive and finish by freshman forward Kyle Casey. His classmate in the backcourt, Brandyn Curry followed with a layup and then a deep three-pointer.
Next, co-captain Jeremy Lin scored six straight points. His first bucket came when Casey found him on a backdoor cut, and he finished with a reverse layup. Minutes later, Lin buried shots on consecutive possessions. The senior standout grabbed a defensive rebound and took it coast-to-coast for an uncontested lay-in, before driving into the middle of the lane for a floater.
A lefty hook from co-captain Doug Miller and a three from the left corner by freshman forward Christian Webster capped the 18-4 run and turned a nine point deficit into a five point lead.
“I thought our kids responded very well,” Amaker said. “I was very pleased to see how we came out in the second half and inched our way back in it and made it a game. It was an incredible basketball game from that point forward.”
SPICY CURRY
After Lin fouled out with 1:15 remaining in regulation, Harvard needed someone to step up and run the offense.
Curry proved he was up to the task. The freshman’s ability to create looks for his teammates and score himself was instrumental to the Crimson’s win.
“Bradyn in particular was outstanding with his play, with handling the ball and scoring,” Amaker said. “We needed all of that.”
At the start of overtime, Curry drew a foul on a drive and knocked down both free throws to give Harvard an early lead. The next time down the court Casey and Webster missed in the paint, but Curry raced to the weak side where he grabbed the offensive rebound and converted the put back.
“I just felt that I had to be aggressive—a little bit more aggressive—and just make plays for my teammates, and get us the win,” Curry said.
Under the freshman’s direction, the Harvard offense did not skip a beat. It was able to build a four-point lead and induce the Bulldogs to foul for the final minute of the game.
“As a matter of fact, I think their offense is better without [Lin] sometimes,” Yale coach James Jones said. “I wasn’t surprised one bit that they were able to make shots.”
Curry’s success was not limited to the final minutes. He scored a total of 15 points and was perfect from the field, including 2-of-2 from three and 3-for-3 from the foul line.
His biggest hoop of the night might have come with four minutes left in regulation. Trailing by three, Curry had the ball at the top of the key. The rookie started right, switched directions by dribbling behind his back, and drove all the way to the hoop. Curry banked home a layup as Bulldog forward Greg Mangano fouled him, and the guard hit the ensuing free throw to tie the game.
“Bradyn was tremendous throughout the evening,” Amaker said. “He’s playing with a great deal of swagger and confidence.”
COMING UP BIG
The big concern going into the game for the Crimson was the matchup in the frontcourt. With three of its top five forwards out of the game, Harvard was very thin on the frontline and needed good minutes from Casey and Miller.
Both players delivered.
Casey started the game by hitting three straight three pointers in the first eight minutes. The freshman saw 41 minutes of action and finished as the Crimson’s leading scorer with 20 points and its leading rebounder with seven boards.
Miller logged 34 minutes and tallied six points and three blocks, but his biggest contributions were buried beneath the stats.  The co-captain grabbed three offensive rebounds, and each time he found an open teammate on the perimeter that knocked down a three.
“These kids are exhausted from the [number of] minutes they’re playing,” said Amaker of his big men. “Certainly we needed them out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its last contest at Rivier was postponed due to inclement weather, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was forced to endure a different kind of storm on Saturday, as a torrent of Tiger hits and kills proved to be too much for the Crimson (0-5).
Despite the return of co-captain Gil Weintraub, playing in his second game this season, and strong performances from freshman setter Rob Lothman and co-captain Eric Kuld, Harvard got off to a slow start in the first set of Saturday’s Ivy League matchup in the Malkin Athletic Center, allowing Princeton (3-4. 0-1 EIVA) to take a 4-0 lead early in the first set and cruise to the 3-0 victory.
“I think anyone who watched that knew that it wasn’t really a great performance,” Weintraub said. “We have a lot to work on.”
About midway through the first set, it looked as though the Crimson might be able to dig itself out of an early hole, as strong service by sophomore outside hitter Matt Jones brought the Crimson within two points of the Tigers. But Princeton’s consistent hitting allowed the Tigers to pull away from Harvard and come out of the first set with a 30-24 victory.
The Crimson stayed on pace with Princeton for the first few points of the second set, but once again, scoring runs put the Tigers out ahead.
Although the gap was close at times, the lead would never change. Steady blocking from Princeton won it the game, 30-23.
Because Harvard wasn’t serving well in the first two games, the team was forced to switch to float serves in the third set. This shift in tactic, though necessary according to Jones, allowed Princeton to dig the ball out more easily and for their offense to take over the game.
“We gave up points in runs; we missed three or four passes in a row,” Jones said. “Once they have that lead, it’s hard to fight back.”
Big hitting from Princeton junior outside hitter Vincent Tuminelli carried the Tigers in the third set.
Although the game was tied at four, Princeton steadily pulled ahead of the Crimson in a similar fashion to the second set.
Although Harvard rallied after a timeout near the end of the game to bring the game within four points, the consistent Princeton offense overtook Harvard and coasted to another 30-23 win.
“We don’t have a very deep bench right now, so we’re forced to play with a lot of rotations,” Weintraub said. “It’s a little uncomfortable for us right now. I think we just have to work through that. Good teams can overcome these obstacles.”
Weintraub led Harvard with 12 kills on the day. Lothman also had an impressive game, recording 20 assists for the Crimson. Kuld and Jones contributed nine and six kills respectively, while sophomore middle blocker Nicola Ivica recorded five block assists.
Defensively, freshman setter Derek Jansma led the team with six digs.
Entering Saturday’s matchup, the Crimson had lost its first four games, most recently to Baruch in three sets on Feb. 4. Princeton beat Harvard last year as well in three close sets.
The Tigers’ Tuminelli led the charge against Harvard with 15 kills, followed by Carl Hamming with 12 kills. Scott Liljestrom contributed 41 assists for Princeton. The dominant trio led the Tigers’ offensive effort to defeat the Crimson in three sets.
Although Harvard was swept, the Crimson was able to win the first game point each time, a testament to the team’s composure with the game on the line.
“It’s good to be resilient and not give up,” Weintraub said. “But I think it’s more important not to be put in that position where you’re so far down that it’s not even possible to come back.”
Although the team was disappointed by the loss and by Harvard’s inability to play to its potential, the Crimson is looking forward to tomorrow night, when it will travel across town to MIT in search of its first win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a week after sweeping both the men’s and women’s track and field competition at the Battle of Beantown, both Harvard track teams were left playing second fiddle to home team and Ivy League rival Princeton this Saturday at the annual HYP Meet.
The Tigers, with 105 points, more than doubled the Crimson score of 48 in the men’s competition after 17 events. Yale finished third, with 27 points.
On the woman’s side, things weren’t much better for Harvard, which suffered a 90.5 to 47.5 defeat by Princeton in 15 events. The Bulldogs once again finished third, with 21 points.
Despite not coming out on top overall, the Crimson still enjoyed a number of individual successes.
For the men’s team, freshman Kenneth Wang Kan won both the long jump (7.02 m) and the triple jump (14.43 m). It was his second consecutive week winning both events.
“I was really pleased with the way Ken competed to get the double win,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Princeton has a strong group of jumpers, and Yale has a guy for the last few years that has really dominated the event...[Wang Kan’s] a great competitor, a real special talent.”
Wang Kan’s teammate, sophomore Steven Geloneck, qualified with the top time in the 60 meter dash but finished second overall in the event. The same thing had happened one week earlier to Geloneck in the Battle of Beantown.
On the women’s side, the freshmen had the most success. Olivia Weeks won the triple jump event, with a 12.10-meter leap. Fellow first-year Mary Hirst took the title in the high jump, with a 1.65-meter bound, while her teammate, junior Dina Emde, finished second. To top it off, freshman Ashtynn Baltimore and sophomore Christine Reed also finished one-two in the 60-meter hurdles, with respective times of 8.88 and 8.95 seconds. It was an improvement for both, as Baltimore finished second and Reed seventh in the same event last weekend.
“We’ve got some outstanding freshmen,” Saretsky said. “They’ve done a great job of getting after it and competing all season long. It’s a special group, probably one of our most talented groups of freshmen to come through here, but they’ve also been putting in the work day-in and day-out in practice and they’ve been doing the little things that are so critical in our sport.”
For Weeks, it was her second consecutive week winning the triple jump.
“I had fouled a few of my jumps [early on], so I had to get down some consistency and some rhythm...to be able to jump well,” Weeks said.
Hirst, who missed the first few competitions of the season with a torn meniscus, also continued to impress with her first place finish. The win marked her first victory of the season.
“I was pretty sore and tired from my other events, but my coach and I were joking that when I’m tired, I perform the best,” Hirst said. “I just stayed focused and jumped high...It was really fun and exciting to get back into [it] again.”
Despite winning the morning jump competitions, the Crimson did not have as much success as it had a week earlier in the running events.
After finishing first in the 500-meter dash a week ago, freshman Carlyle Davis finished second to Princeton’s Danielle Glaeser Saturday in the 400-meter dash. Harvard junior Brian Hill, who won the men’s 500-meter dash at the Battle of Beantown, finished second on Saturday to the Tigers’ Russell Dinkins in the one mile run. Freshman Jeremy Gilmour, coming off a first place finish in the 3000-meter run, finished fourth in the one-mile.
The women were also victorious at the Battle of Beantown in the 4x400 yard relay, but finished second to Princeton this weekend. The men, who won that event a week ago as well, did not place in the top three this time around.
“I think overall, it was a good competition for our group,” Saretsky said. “The competition itself is going to be a bit different so I always try to tell the kids on our team what they can control, and they can’t control how fast the people next to them run.”
Despite not coming out on top this weekend, the team isn’t too disappointed with its performance.
“It’s about what we expected where we’d be at,” Saretsky said. “On the men’s side, that’s the first time we’ve beaten Yale in a dual- or tri-meet since I’ve been here, so from that perspective, it’s good to get over that hump. We weren’t elated about it and doing cartwheels...but I really do feel as if we’re making strides.”

As 10 Harvard faculty members found themselves speaking their minds in what is normally snow-covered Cambridge, Professors Michael J. Sandel, George M. Church, George M. Whitesides '60, and Nicholas A. Christakis managed to find a good excuse to enjoy sunny SoCal doing basically the same thing at the TED2010 conference last week.
The annual TED, or "Technology, Entertainment, Design," Conference is an annual gathering dedicated to disseminating "ideas worth spreading." Under a strict time limit of 18 minutes, speakers ranging from Bono to Bill Clinton share what inspires them to do the unique work they do.
Emerging from under the rock that he calls "spring leave," Sandel discussed moral dilemmas similar to those presented in his course Moral Reasoning 22: "Justice." Urging people to engage their moral convictions in evaluating policy, Sandel instructed those in attendance "to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument." Sandel proposed a return to substantive moral discussions concerning policy issues.
Whitesides discussed how the application of simple problem-solving methods can be used to work out complex problems. Citing the examples of cathedrals built of individual stones and the binary code that allows for computers and the Internet, Whitesides urged attendees to seek simple solutions to their complicated questions.
Church discussed the applications of synthetic biology to increasing food, potable water, and fuel supplies. According to tweets from the event, he also talked about producing better pharmaceuticals and increasing viral resistance among humans and livestock.
Christakis discussed his work analyzing social networks in order to locate clusters of people within the network who display qualities such as obesity and altruism. Christakis also analyzed so-called "happiness" and "unhappiness" clusters, finding happiness clusters in the center of social networks and unhappiness clusters on their periphery.
"If I made you sad or gave you germs, you would cut ties with me," Christakis said.
For some sweet pictures from the event, take a look at TED's slideshow or Flickr. And if you missed out on Harvard's little version of the conference, check out The Crimson's photo gallery or video from that night.

Samuel B. Novey ’11 says that he’s passionate about three things: running, education, and burgers. Like any good multitasking Harvard student, Novey isn’t content to enjoy these things one at a time. He’s decided to put them together.
Novey, who bills himself as Burgerman, plans to run the Boston Marathon in April while wearing a burger costume. Having made a killer YouTube video, he’s asking individuals and businesses to give him money to complete the wacky task, hoping to raise $100,000 to benefit the charity Citizen Schools.
Each Saturday leading up to the marathon, Novey invites community members to accompany him on a two-mile training run. All those who jog alongside Burgerman will receive free burgers from Harvard Square's b.good at the end of the run.
On the first of these weekly runs on Saturday, Novey said that 30 people came to exercise and eat.
Novey has run the Boston Marathon for the past two years. Last year, he noticed a fellow runner in a burger costume. After chatting with the sandwich-clad man, Novey learned that he was sponsored by b.good. Novey sent a limerick to the owner of b.good, asking to be the next Burgerman—and before he knew it, he was wearing the 12-pound stretch Lycra suit around his hips.
His main concern about running in a hamburger suit? “It’s really important to be able to pee before and during a marathon,” he said. “I’m a little concerned about how that’s going to work.”
Novey has worked for Citizen Schools, an organization which brings volunteer teachers to middle schools to share their knowledge through after-school programs, for the past two years. “Normally when Burgerman sees a problem, he just throws some ketchup on it, and that usually makes it better,” he said. But when it came to the problem of improving education, “this was just not something that could be solved by ketchup. We need some resources.”
Novey said that he received 50 individual donations within the first two hours after his fundraising campaign opened on Friday. He hopes to raise more money through his forthcoming Web site, which he promises will “really knock your buns off.”

The Real-World Economics Review Blog has taken two economic blogosphere truths to heart: polls are fun, and fruitlessly blaming people for messing up the economy is even more so. They’ve opened online voting for the Dynamite Prize in Economics, which is to be awarded to the three economists with the heaviest involvement in “blowing up” the economy. True to form, several Harvard minds are at the top of the list.
A perpetual favorite among economic bloggers, former University President Lawrence R. Summers is on the shortlist for working to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and collaborating with Greenspan and Wall Street to prevent efforts to regulate derivatives.
Fisher S. Black ’59 is a candidate for his contribution to the Black-Scholes model, which the blog claims to be "bogus" and misleading, resulting in an "explosive growth of financial derivatives."
Though Summers and Black are the only two Harvard mainstays to make the list, other bloggers think Harvard’s representation shouldn’t end there. Angry Bear, an economics blog, backs the idea that those who can’t, teach, lamenting that Professor N. Gregory Mankiw (“author of the textbook that corrupts more Econ 101 people than any other”) and Harvard Business School Professor Michael C. Jensen were excluded from the list.
With Valentine’s Day behind us and the Black Eyed Peas concert less than two weeks away, we can’t help but wonder: Where is the love? Would the world truly be better off if Harvard were to stop teaching economics? Humanities departments would burgeon, post-Ec 10 lunch lines in Annenberg would dissipate, and former ec concentrators—no longer wishing to strut down Wall Street—wouldn’t be disappointed when said jobs eluded them. Such a world would have to be governed by a powerful force. Some call this force cynicism. Some call it communism.
Alas, no one calls it realistic.
