After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has charged a committee to generate a formal assessment of the undergraduate Program in General Education—the first of its kind since the program's inception in 2007.
Recruiting members for the committee is the first step in a year-long process, according to committee chair and chair of the Philosophy Department Sean D. Kelly, who said he hopes the review will be completed by the end of the 2014-15 school year.
According to Kelly, who was appointed in December by Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris to spearhead the review, the committee will spend the rest of the spring semester and the summer term compiling a list of questions that will be used to survey students and faculty members about the program.
The committee will be comprised of approximately ten faculty members from SEAS and the divisions of Arts and Humanities, Sciences, and Social Sciences and will generate a report based on survey responses.
“We’re going to look at the data we’ve got and try to formulate a story about what the strengths and weaknesses of the program are and make some proposals about how it could be changed,” Kelly said.
Although the review committee has not yet officially convened, Kelly said he has already met with students and faculty members informally to gauge their perspectives on the program. He added that some students have said that they wish more of their concentration requirements would also satisfy Gen Ed requirements.
“It might be not ideal for the students that they can't satisfy [Gen Ed] requirements by taking a course that they are otherwise already interested in,” Kelly said.
During his informal interviews with students and faculty members, Kelly also said he has noticed a disparity in course sizes within the Gen Ed program.
“A very large percentage of the students who satisfy a certain kind of Gen Ed requirement will turn out to satisfy it by taking one of only a very small number of courses,” Kelly said.
Professors in the program have also noticed that there is a large demand for some courses rather than others, and, as a result, many must limit their course sizes.
John E. Huth, a physics professor who teaches the popular general education course Science of the Physical Universe 26: "Primitive Navigation,” said he has had to lottery course enrollment in order to foster a better learning environment for his students.
“I want to make contact with as many of the students as possible,” Huth said. “There’s sort of a scaling limit. When you go beyond a certain number of students you sacrifice that contact.”
After the review committee completes its report, Smith will bring it before the faculty, who may vote on recommendations for the Gen Ed program. These recommendations would in turn become the new guidelines for the program should the committee provide them.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated who Philosophy Department Chair Sean D. Kelly has interviewed informally in his early work as head of the committee tasked with reviewing the Program in General Education. In fact, Kelly has met with students and members of the faculty to gain feedback on the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Members of the Undergraduate Council announced plans to form a Council endowment, reform student outreach efforts, and train representatives to better interact with students during their general meeting on Sunday.
Citing their recent meeting with Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 explained to the Council that they will not be receiving funding from the University this year.
Student Relations Chair Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 and Ivy Yard representative Charles A. Scherr '17 discussed ways in which the UC is planning to utilize alumni donations. Although Mayopoulos and Goffard have previously expressed a desire to seek alumni funding, the meeting marked the first time that the UC leaders discussed the creation of an endowment.
According to Scherr, the UC has already been in contact with an alumnus who is helping them plan and create the endowment. The funding will likely come from UC savings and alumni donations, Scherr said.
While the timeline remains tentative, Council members emphasized the importance of securing savings.
“It’s just something nice to have for the UC down the road,” Scherr said.
The UC subsequently shifted its focus to discussing ways that representatives may better communicate with students—an effort that Goffard and Mayopoulos have repeatedly said is the top goal of their administration.
Mayopoulos also addressed feedback he had received from UC representatives about current problems with Operation Ghost Protocol. The measure, which was passed by the Council in early February, requires UC members to be in their respective dining halls on Fridays to distribute surveys and answer students’ questions.
Mayopoulos said that the current implementation is “a little messy,” and pledged to introduce legislation next week with revisions. In the anticipated amendment, Mayopoulos said he would change the frequency of the Friday meetings to every other week and consider alternative ways to convey the Council's initiatives.
Mayopoulos also introduced a mockup of a UC weekly update that the Council might plan on distributing, and Council members brainstormed other methods of conveying Council endeavors more effectively and at a lower cost.
“We are trying to find a balance between talking to people and not overwhelming them,” Mayopoulos said after the meeting. 
In a similar communications effort, Oak Yard representative Giora A. Ashkenazi '17 asked Council representatives to consider attending a workshop held by the leaders of Room 13, a student-led peer counseling service.
“It’s a huge step for people to realize that we really do want to listen,” Ashkenazi said of the training, which he said would equip representatives to listen to students who wish to discuss their troubles or “more sensitive issues” with the Council members. The majority of UC members expressed interest in completing the program and are working to schedule a time in the near future.
The UC also tabled a vote on a proposed Harvard Student Agencies video contract, the pricing of which Goffard described as “too expensive,” and approved another spring grants package, allocating about $12,500 to various student groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving program has touched the wall on its 2013-2014 season as six swimmers and one diver competed this weekend in the NCAA Championships in Austin, Texas. Junior diver Mike Mosca was the top performer of the weekend, earning an All-American title.
Mosca had his first NCAA appearance last season, when he finished 28th on the three-meter board and 32nd on the one-meter board. This year, he was able to improve in both events.
On the first day of competition, the Ivy League champion took on the one-meter board, coming in 30th with a score of 291.15. The second day brought Mosca to the three-meter board, coming in 13th place with a score of 367.70 in the preliminary heat and 392.65 in the consolation finals.
Mosca’s performance on the three-meter board made him the first Crimson All-American diver since Craig Narveson ’94. Mosca is the 153rd All-American in Harvard history.
“I’ve learned two new dives since last year, both on the one-meter and three-meter,” Mosca said. “I’ve got a harder list, and I think I’m just a bit more confident in my dives.”
Five swimmers joined Mosca in Texas to compete at the national level. Freshman Eric Ronda was the only other individual competitor, while senior Danny Crigler, junior Griffin Schumacher, sophomore Jacob Luna, and freshman Jack Manchester competed in four different relay events.
“The more people that get to go the better experience it is overall,” Mosca said.
In his first NCAA appearance, Ronda captured 28th place in the 200 breaststroke and 39th in the 100 breaststroke. During the regular season, Ronda swept the two breaststroke events three times, most recently against Penn on Feb. 8. The freshman took second in both events at the Ivy Championship meet.
“He set the tempo in his race right away, which is a skill he’s been trying to work on all year,” Harvard coach Kevin Tyrrell said. “Doing that at this level was very important for him.”
Crigler also had a strong weekend in his final competition as a member of the Crimson. The senior anchored the freestyle relay in 43.7 seconds. In the same race, Schumacher had a personal best time in his lead off leg, touching the wall in 43.36. Schumacher, Manchester, Luna, and Criger came in 27th in the event.
The 400 freestyle relay was one of four relays in which Harvard competed across the three days of swimming. The combination of Schumacher, Luna, Manchester, and Crigler took the 25th spot in both the 800 and 200 freestyle relays. The Crimson’s best finish of the day came in the 400 medley relay in which the team claimed 22nd place.
Though it failed to crack the top 20 in any of the swimming events, Tyrell said that the chance to compete at a national level gave the Crimson experience that will aid the squad significantly next season.
“In order to get better ourselves we need to compete against people who are better than us,” Tyrrell said. “The challenge of coming here is good for this year, but more importantly it really sets us up for next year to be successful within the Ivy League.”
The experience was especially beneficial for the two freshmen—Ronda and Manchester. With three seasons left to compete for Harvard and thus three more opportunities to make it to the NCAA Championship meet, Tyrell hopes that the experience of competing in Texas will allow the pair to improve drastically next year.
“The two freshman…now can see and understand what the whole season looks like versus [this past] year when they [came] in and [didn’t] really have an understanding of it,” Tyrrell said. “They can help lead the program, not only by swimming fast, but they can really give some perspective to all the other swimmers, including the incoming freshmen.”
Coming off of a season in which the Crimson captured both the dual meet and Ivy League titles, it was fitting for Harvard to end the year with NCAA success. With five of the six athletes who competed returning next year, the team is hungry to continue its success in the pool and on the board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Exactly one week after his team battled for a spot in the Sweet Sixteen, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker released a statement declaring that he will remain with the Crimson for the 2014-2015 season.
The announcement came 11 days after Amaker’s name was linked with the job opening at Boston College, following the Eagles’ firing of Steve Donahue.
Through four media availability sessions in Spokane, Wash., where his squad competed in the second and third rounds of the NCAA Tournament, Amaker elected not to dwell on questions regarding the BC rumors.
“There’s nothing for me to address, to comment on,” said Amaker last Wednesday, the afternoon before the Crimson took on the Cincinnati Bearcats.
Ten days later and three thousand miles farther east, Amaker finally had something to “comment on.”
"After thoughtful deliberation, I continue to realize my heart is at Harvard," stated Amaker in Harvard Athletics’ official press release. “To teach, lead and serve at this amazing institution, and in this special community, is truly meaningful to me."
The 2014-2015 campaign will mark Amaker’s eighth as the coach of the Crimson.
This past season, Amaker led his team to a program-best 13-1 Ivy League record, amassing 27 wins on the year—another program-high. In its most recent contest against Michigan State in the third round of the Big Dance, Harvard came back from a 16-point second half deficit to take the lead, 62-60, with only seven minutes separating the team from the Sweet Sixteen.
The late run was in part a result of a lineup change made by Amaker. The coach decided to go small, with only one true forward playing in the post. The strategy worked, and it took the Crimson just over six minutes to go from a 16-point deficit to a tie-game.
While Harvard ended up falling, 80-73, to the Spartans, the contest marked the team’s fifth March Madness game in three years. Prior to 2012, the Crimson had not taken part in the Big Dance since 1946.
In the press release on Saturday, Harvard's Nichols Family Director of Athletics Bob Scalise voiced his confidence in Amaker moving forward.
"Tommy is a great leader, a great coach and a great educator," Scalise said. "He is an inspiration to many in the Harvard community. We are excited he will continue to lead our men's basketball program."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (12-6, 8-2 EIVA) kept itself in the hunt for the top EIVA seed as it saw off Sacred Heart (9-16, 3-8 EIVA) in straight sets. The win marked the Crimson’s seventh-straight home victory at the Malkin Athletic Center, and the sixth time in that streak the match only lasted three games. The contest was closer than the final score suggests, with the Pioneers pushing Harvard to its limits in both the second and third games.
Harvard coach Brian Baise emphasized after the game the old mantra that ‘great teams find a way to win’. Despite not playing its best, the team still pulled out the victory, a common thread in several key wins thus far this season for Harvard.
“I thought we played okay, not our best,” Baise said. “But the most important part of a successful team over the course of a season is to win when you’re not at your best. To win like that today showed a lot of composure and a lot of heart. It was a good to finish the way we did.”
Co-captain Nick Madden echoed the same sentiments after the game. The senior had picked up EIVA Defensive Player of the Week honors for three consecutive weeks entering Friday’s contest. Against Sacred Heart, the outside hitter had another fine defensive effort with a game-leading 13 digs to go along with five blocks.
“I think we came out pretty good in game one,” Madden said. “We had a few rough patches in games two and three, but we came back. I think it’s good to not be playing your best but still go out and get the win.”
After Harvard coasted to a first set win by 25-17, the crowd may have been expecting more of the same to follow. However, the Crimson was unable to ever really get its nose out in front in what was a back-and-forth second set. Service errors kept the contest closer than Harvard may have liked. Two crucial errors were committed by the White brothers as DJ, at 21-21, and Casey, with Harvard up 24-23, gifted Sacred Heart points.
In the end, the Crimson was bailed out by its opponent, who committed consecutive errors of its own after tying it up at 24 points apiece to hand Harvard the victory, 26-24.
In game three, the Crimson dropped to a 18-12 disadvantage as the Pioneers came out swinging. But facing the deficit, Harvard showed why it is the No. 15 squad in the country, as the team rallied hard for another 26-24 win.
Unable to cope with the newfound offensive momentum from the hosts, Sacred Heart found itself tied, 24 all, after holding the substantial lead and facing serves from junior DJ White. White paced the Crimson offense with 13 kills to go along with 12 digs on the defensive side of the net, his third double-double of the season. Serving for the match, he put the team on his back, and two points later, Harvard walked off the court having dug out the win.
“We made some errors,” Baise said. “Some of it was mental errors. Some of our decisions, especially in that third game, were not the kind of decisions we like to make. [In] the second game, we missed four serves, and you’re not going to win many games when you win that.”
“When we’re playing our best we don’t do those things and at this time of the year, we should have the composure to make the right decisions,” Baise added. “Everyone’s going to make errors but our mental game, I think, needs to be a little better.”
The less-than-stellar performance, while still a victory, is a small blip in an otherwise strong season for Harvard. After starting the season ranked No. 13 in the preseason poll before falling out of polls, the team has worked itself back into the rankings. The team is optimistic as it heads into the final sprint of its 2014 campaign.
“I think we have a pretty consistent offense right now,” Madden said. “We’re getting a real feel for where players are strong, and where we’re weak, and we’re capitalizing on our strengths. I think our serving is getting a lot better, and honestly, when we’re serving and passing well, as we were at points against Ball State and Ohio State [over spring break], we’re a really tough team to beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the long and cold winter, the Harvard men’s lightweight crew team swept the University of Delaware in its debut performance of the spring season, finishing in first for the three varsity eight boats as well as the freshmen eight.
One of Harvard’s stronger performances on the day was the race by the second varsity eight, which finished in 6:23.8, nearly seven seconds ahead of the Blue Hens.
“I would attribute the success today to the incredible amount of fitness we have,” captain Alexander Bonorris said. “We put in a really good, high-volume, training session in the time we were in Florida over the winter, and the momentum from this trip really carried over.”
The largest margin of victory was the 20-second difference made by the freshmen eight, which finished in 6:16.2.
“The freshmen’s win was huge, we always like to see that,” junior Connor Mangan said.
Mangan also highlighted the 3V boat’s win as an impressive finish, as the Crimson came from behind and won the race in the last 500m, finishing at 6:27.1. The Harvard 1V finished at 6:08.1. Both of these victories came through a narrow time wedge, with Delaware finishing less than two seconds behind in both races.
Bonorris rowed stroke for the first eight and Mangan was in the seventh seat for the second varsity.
This year, Harvard has been shackled by the Massachusetts winter, which kept the crew from getting onto the Charles until about 10 days ago, an unusually late start for the spring season. The lack of time on the water has posed a challenge to the Crimson’s performance.
“It’s not a weakness, it’s just a reality,” Mangan said. “We haven’t been on the water very long, and the rowing today was definitely not perfect. If we row better, we’ll go a lot faster.”
“While our fitness is strong, it is natural for the rowing to be raw,” Bonorris added. “We need to improve efficiency and technical prowess.”
The final matchup of the dual race was between two Crimson freshmen fours competing against each other. The final freshmen eight split into two four boats, A and B, with the “A” boat taking the win with a finishing time of 7:36.3.
“The team is young, probably the youngest team I can remember,” Bonorris said. “There are a lot of freshmen and very few seniors, which you usually never see, and the improvement curve continues to be really steep.”
The unusual distribution of age doesn’t seem to bother the team.
“There is a lot of positive energy and enthusiasm from top to bottom,” Bonorris added.
Next week, Harvard opens its Ivy League racing against Penn and Cornell in Ithaca.
“Cornell is always tough, we’ll hopefully have a good weekend with them,” Mangan said. “It’s good to know we have a lot of speed to gain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
25 March 2014
Dear Harvard Community,
On behalf of our basketball program, we can’t thank you enough for the incredible support that you have shown to our basketball team during and since our recent NCAA Tournament run, as well as all year long!   We have been truly amazed by the friendship and support that so very many of our Harvard colleagues and neighbors have shown us.  We feel privileged to be a part of this community with you, and we were honored to represent Harvard over the past weeks.
It was truly special to have so many of the Harvard community with us in Spokane, despite the great distance from our campus!  And it was amazing for us to hear about the many Harvard groups across the country who gathered to cheer on our team and show their school pride.  No one is more proud to “be Harvard” than we are.
It has been a thrilling few weeks, but we want to thank you as well for the constant support all year long, which propelled us to our 4th straight Ivy League title and our 3rd straight trip to the NCAA Tournament.   To the band, cheer teams, faculty, staff and all members of the Harvard Community, THANK YOU!
As always, a very special THANK YOU to our students!  They continue to fight for our team in a positive manner that is truly representative of this great institution.  I continue to be very proud of what you do—and how you do it.
Congratulations!!  Thank you!!  And Go Crimson!
Coach Tommy Amaker

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin recently broke up. Usually, a married couple breaking up is called separation or divorce, but Paltrow blogged that what they did is actually “conscious uncoupling.” Did Gwyn go to Harvard? I thought coming up with pretentious names for everything was our thing (“concentration” instead of “major” and “tutor” instead of “RA”). For all you non-celebrities out there, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to consciously uncouple (read: break up).
Step 1. Be conscious. In his paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", Princeton cognitive philosopher Thomas Nagel says that an organism is conscious “if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism” (Nagel 436). Is there something that it is like to be you? Good. You’re qualified to break up with someone.
Step 2. Be a couple. You see, the “un-” prefix in the word “uncoupling” implies that there is a state (i.e. the state of being a couple) that you intend to undo (“un-” is a prefix that adds negation to a word). If you are not in the state of being in a couple, then there is nothing for you to “un.”
Step 3. Have a desire to no longer be in said couple. Did your significant other cheat on you? Do you have arguments about the fact that you named your child after a fruit? If so, it might be time to uncouple with them. N.B. If you still want to be in a couple with this person, do NOT uncouple with them. As aforementioned, “un” implies that you will be ending the state of being in a couple.
Step 4. Execute the uncoupling. Text message is best: “hey, dnt wanna be a couple anymore. uncoupling. ttyl.” Phone call is second: “Sorry I got your voicemail. We need to talk…”. Not saying anything but just ceasing communication is third: “Has anyone seen the other half of this couple?” All three of these methods definitely won’t make you seem like a jerk.
Step 5. Be a celebrity. If you’re a normal person, you should for sure feel uncomfortable to be so stuck up as to say you’re “uncoupling.” Unless you’ve done something like act in "Shakespeare in Love" or name your album "Mylo Xyloto," just break up like the rest of the world.

By this time, you should have received most if not all of your college decisions. Some of you may feel really happy about your decisions while others may feel understandably dejected. Regardless of how you feel, you now need to go forward with the next step of this college process. So after getting over the initial excitement or disappointment of your offers, you have to take the time to decide where you will end up. This decision is not one you can take lightly, so before you declare where you want to spend your next four years, here are some things to consider.
Your Financial Aid Package: The amount of financial aid you can receive from an institution can be the main reason you decide to go to one college over another.  When you receive your package, check over the all details to make sure you understand it all. Especially take note of: 1) how much the college is giving you, 2) how are they giving you the support (i.e. scholarships or loans), and 3) how much you are expected to contribute. Misreading your financial aid package could mean missing vital information that could alter your decision. If you discover that your package is inaccurate or less than what you might need, talk immediately to someone from your college’s financial aid office or change your package to something more suitable for you.  A bad package can turn a dream school into a nightmare.
Location, Location: Your college may be 20 minutes away or 20 hours away from where you currently live.  It is important to determine if you can get used to being far away from home for most of the year. You also have to keep in mind the type of area  that surrounds the college. Maybe some of your colleges are in the middle of a bustling city. Others may reside in small quiet towns. If you know you wouldn’t be able to survive going to a school surrounded in an environment you might detest, you may want to location heavily.
Academics and Extracurriculars: You are presumably going to college to learn, so a great way to determine the best college for you is to recheck all the courses they offer.  Do any of your colleges provide courses in a field you are extremely interested in? Sure, you may change your major while you are there, but it is nice to see if your colleges can give you options that you can really benefit from. Likewise, checking out the clubs and organizations your schools have may make it easier to narrow it down. Maybe one of your schools has team in a sport that you love playing or want to try out for.
Personality and Catering to Your Needs: Something as important as a school’s academics is the type of people the college attracts.  The best way to check this is to go to visit colleges, either on your own or through a visiting weekend the college may hold. If you do this, you may want to consider some questions: Are the professors there people who you truly believe you can learn from? Do the staff seem friendly? Can you connect with your fellow students? Is the college able to take care of your needs whether it is a disability or an food allergy?  You do not want to be stuck in a college where you feel uncomfortable or at a disadvantage.
By considering these topics before you choose where to matriculate, you have a greater chance of choosing the best place for you to learn. Even though the college you eventually choose may not be perfect, it may just be the perfect fit for you. Lastly but most importantly, remember to respond to your offers of admission before the deadline!
