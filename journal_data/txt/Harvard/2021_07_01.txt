After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michelin-starred chef Mark R. Ladner plans to return to where his distinguished culinary career began by opening an Italian restaurant called Bar Enza in Harvard Square this September.
Bar Enza will be located in the Charles Hotel, at 1 Bennett Street, in a space that previously housed two other Italian restaurants, Rialto and Benedetto, which closed in 2016 and this past April, respectively.
Bar Enza is a collaboration between Ladner — who grew up in Belmont, Mass. — and the Lyons Group, which owns more than two dozen restaurants and hospitality venues across Massachusetts.
Ladner said in an interview that Bar Enza would resemble a “Parisian brasserie,” an informal restaurant that serves drinks and simple or hearty food.
“It’s big, it’s very lively, and the food is nourishing and comforting,” he said. “Obviously, informed on my background, it will be somewhat polished, but it is not intended to be intimidating or elitist or fussy or contrived. It’s just good, honest, simple, local, Italian-inspired cuisine.”
“I’m planning on sourcing very, very good, high-quality proteins and certainly local produce and importing a lot of my favorite products from Italy,” he added.
Taking inspiration from the flexitarian diet — which encourages eating less meat — Ladner said he plans on serving “small portions” with “very high quality proteins” at the restaurant. Bar Enza’s menu will have a variety of pastas, salads, vegetable antipasti, finger foods, and cocktails.
“There is an opportunity to snack and pick and not have to commit to a full meal, just for people to nibble on things while they’re catching up with a friend,” he noted.
According to Ladner, his team decided to name the new restaurant Bar Enza after the Enza, a tributary of the Po River in northern Italy.
“Part of the inspiration, culinarily, comes from the region of Emilia-Romagna, specifically between Parma and Reggio Emilia, which is the crest of the breadbasket of northern Italy, some of the most fertile lands there,” Ladner said.
Ladner began his cooking career at Café Fiorella in Harvard Square, which closed in the late 1990s.
“I started cooking – actually making pizza – in Harvard Square when I was in high school in the late ’80s,” he said.
After going to culinary school in Providence, R.I., Ladner returned to Boston to work at Olives — a pasta restaurant — before moving to Manhattan, N.Y. He later became the executive chef of Del Posto, where he won two Michelin stars and a James Beard Award for Best Chef in New York City. Del Posto also received a rare four-star review from The New York Times during his time at the restaurant.
Ladner said he still remembers frequenting the Charles Hotel when he was younger.
“I remember going to the jazz club with my mom, the Regattabar. Over the years I ate at Rialto a number of times,” he said. “I always had this fantasy of coming back later in my career and doing something in and around Harvard Square, sort of a homecoming for me in a way.”
“I’m really really excited to be back in Harvard Square after all these years,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With their current contract expiring Wednesday, Harvard offered its graduate student union a two-month contract extension on Monday. The union will vote on whether to accept the extension next week.
The University proposed the extension and a move to federal mediation during a Monday bargaining session, the penultimate one before the contract expired on June 30. At the final bargaining session on June 30, rank-and-file members left the Zoom in protest after the University reaffirmed its offer of one-time bonuses for salaried Ph.D. research assistants and teaching fellows instead of the percentage wage increases demanded by the union.
“A temporary extension means that all the terms and benefits of the current contract will remain in place and provides our two bargaining teams the opportunity to continue the discussions at the table and make progress toward an agreement,” Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email to University affiliates on Wednesday.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ Bargaining Committee voted unanimously to reject mediation, which would bring in an official from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to help with negotiations.
Despite being “very far apart on many, many issues,” HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said in an interview that he feels the two sides are making progress, especially in informal smaller working groups with union and University representatives.
“A mediation at this point I just think would slow things down,” he said.
On the other hand, the Bargaining Committee’s vote on the extension offer was an even 5-5, prompting it to open the vote up to the entire membership.
HGSU-UAW members will be able to vote on the extension after the union’s membership meeting on July 6, with voting open until July 9. The Bargaining Committee will not issue a recommendation to membership.
“I think there are pros and cons to both sides,” Bargaining Committee member Ash E. Tomaszewski said. “I personally feel better making this a democratic process.”
Mancilla agreed, noting the high levels of membership engagement at the open bargaining sessions and a recent open letter signed by more than 600 students committing to organize a strike if contract negotiations between Harvard and the union were not resolved by June 30.
“Six hundred student workers, or more at this point, have signed onto the strike commit letter,” he said. “There’s a lot of attention, and a lot of people are following and engaged in this process. People are coming to the open bargaining sessions, and so it just felt right to expand this decision on that.”
The extension would push the agreement’s expiration from June 30 to August 31 as the two parties continue negotiating. If HGSU-UAW votes to extend its contract, the union will maintain access to the negotiated arbitration procedure for non-discrimination and harassment cases. HGSU-UAW will also not be able to go on strike while the contract remains in effect, though the union is allowed to organize for one.
Regardless of whether the union votes to extend the current agreement, benefit funds expired on July 1 and the University will continue to “uphold the status quo of our working conditions, such as compensation, workload, workspace materials, and vacation,” the Bargaining Committee wrote in an email to HGSU-UAW membership. In addition, both parties are legally obligated to continue negotiating in good faith.
The University will “honor its continuing obligation to bargain in good faith with the intent to reach an agreement,” Garber wrote.
Mancilla said he envisions next Tuesday’s meeting to be a space where members can ask questions of the Bargaining Committee and draw their own conclusions on the extension.
“It’s more in the hands of membership,” he said. “It’s up to them to make up their own minds. It’s not up to us to make a pitch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council’s Government Operations, Rules & Claims Committee began the process of hiring a new city manager at a meeting Tuesday morning.
During the meeting, councilors debated the initial steps for the city manager search, including soliciting candidates and hiring a search firm.
The City of Cambridge operates on a “council-manager” form of municipal government, also known as Plan E, in which executive power is invested in a city manager appointed by the City Council, which performs legislative and oversight functions.
The Council has had an up-and-down relationship with current city manager Louis A. DePasquale since appointing him to the role in 2016; his current contract expires in July 2022. In June, he controversially decided to ban remote public comment during in-person public meetings after more than a year of residents participating via Zoom, according to reporting by Cambridge Day.
Tuesday’s meeting began with testimony from Bernard F. Lynch, a former city manager in Lowell, Mass. who consults on hiring for municipal government positions, answering the committee’s questions about the search process.
Lynch shared that the undertaking will not be as simple as releasing a job posting. He said he expects up to a 20-week process between “information gathering, the actual recruitment and the interview process.”
Lynch and the councilors also discussed whether the search process should begin with screening deliberations in a smaller setting or before the full council.
Lynch said he would recommend against the latter because public records laws would mandate those conversations be on the record, noting the importance of confidentiality in protecting the integrity of the selection process.
On the other hand, Councilor Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80, who attended the meeting but is not a member of the Government Ops committee, argued the entire City Council should be involved in the selection process.
“We would be missing an opportunity to involve the whole council in literally the most important job we have,” Nolan said. “Otherwise it doesn’t seem like the process is treating all the councilors equally.”
Committee members went on to debate the necessary qualifications for both a search firm — which has yet to be hired — and the city manager.
Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler asserted the need for a diverse pool of candidates and to step away from city-manager-specific resume qualifications when reviewing finalists.
“We haven’t had candidates who are women or people of color as finalists or as city managers in the history of Cambridge,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “I do really want to make sure that with this process that we’re breaking out of that mold of how the city manager process has been traditionally done.”
Committee members also discussed considering internal candidates for city manager, budgeting the search, and setting term limits.
Near the meeting’s end, the committee unanimously passed two motions: for DePasquale to appropriate funds for a consulting search firm, and for Sobrinho-Wheeler and Councilor E. Denise Simmons, who chairs the committee, to review search processes to select the consultant.
Simmons said she believes the Government Ops committee should ultimately pick a screening committee who evaluates candidates.
She added that the process is a balancing act between the council’s and the public’s varied interests.
“I want diversity in the pool, I want the richness, I want the participation,” Simmons said. “But I don’t want us to tip it such that it contaminates ... the process so that some of the better candidates, particularly if they are coming from farther away, won’t come because they don’t want to be put out there.”
“I would recommend that we lean into the idea of having this screening committee that does that work with the proper training,” Simmons continued.
