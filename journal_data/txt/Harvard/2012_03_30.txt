After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many of the newly accepted prospective members of Harvard’s Class of 2016 undoubtedly spent yesterday evening celebrating their admissions letters with their families. Today, they must begin to consider the more practical issues of college attendance, including cost. The Crimson has reported that next year, as in the past, Harvard’s cost of attendance will increase. Cost of attendance, which has risen at a rate of between 3.5 and 4 percent for the past few years, will be $54,496 for the 2012-13 school year.
Harvard has announced an accompanying increase in financial aid funding, increasing the amount available by 7.5 percent. Indeed, Harvard has stayed true to its conviction to make a Harvard education possible for everyone, even low-income families; its dedication to providing financial aid to a large percentage of students is impressive and commendable. However, Harvard’s tuition increases follow a national pattern of tuition and fee hikes at both private and public colleges. As most universities do not have the resources to fund financial aid programs as expansive as Harvard’s, these increases are alarming.
Like our peers nationwide, we are worried about the increasing cost of higher education. A report by the College Board notes that in the past decade, “Published tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year institutions increased at an average rate of 2.6 percent per year beyond inflation.” Over the same time period, tuition and fee rates at public four-year colleges and universities rose at an average of 5.6 percent a year beyond inflation for average out-of-state charges of $29,657 per year. To attend these universities, many students feel obligated to take out student loans; however, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, student debt in America has now topped $1 trillion and students increasingly feel their post-graduate pursuits stymied by high levels of debt.
As we have noted before, Obama recently came out with a commendable plan to address the rising cost of tuition at colleges across America. His project takes an important first step by providing a way for some students mired in debt to gain relief in the form of lower interest rates and by providing more information to prospective students about the affordability of college. Nonetheless, these policies can only be a first step; with the cost of higher education rising at such high rates, broader reform seems necessary.
Of course, Harvard’s own financial aid program generally provides most aid in the form of direct grants that do not have to be repaid. As students we are thankful that we can receive of the best financial aid in the country here; indeed, many of us would not be able to attend this institution if it were not for the generosity of Harvard’s alumni donors and the concerted efforts by Harvard’s Financial Aid Office to ensure that all students receive sufficient aid.
For many high school students newly admitted to college, cost will be a large factor in deciding which university to attend. We hope that, through policies like Obama’s recent plans for student loans, the government will ensure that college education remains accessible and affordable for American students. Beyond this, the Harvard Financial Aid Office should ensure that it continues to provide sufficient aid so that no member of Harvard’s Class of 2016 is deterred from attendance for lack of funding.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this editorial stated that under the revised terms of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, financial aid is only guaranteed to families that earn up to $150,000 rather than the previous $180,000. Under the new policy, families earning above $150,000 are still likely to receive some aid.

Thanks to advances in radiology, neonatology, and other medical technologies, we are able to observe, treat, and deliver babies much earlier than ever before. With these advances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that the fetus is anything but a living human person, leaving pro-choice advocates with little room to make their case. From the moment of conception, the embryo is a unique, self-integrated organism, directing its own development on a continuous, uninterrupted path toward infancy, childhood, and adulthood. Science settles the question at the heart of the abortion debate—that of fetal personhood—in favor of the unborn.
This is where the debate has its natural conclusion. However, some wish to continue the abortion debate as an issue of “bodily autonomy.” These individuals hold up Judith Thompson’s violinist thought experiment as proof that abortion is morally justifiable, even if the fetus is a human person. Thompson begins by postulating that the fetus is a human, thus declaring common ground with pro-lifers in an attempt to undermine their position. She draws an analogy between pregnancy and the situation of a woman whose vitals were attached in her sleep to those of a dying violinist. When she wakes up, Thompson asks, does the patient have the right to unhook the violinist and end his life? Thompson asserts that she does on the grounds that he "threatens her bodily autonomy.” She further concludes that a pregnant woman has a similar right to “unhook” herself from her unborn child. However, even if the woman’s right to kill the violinist is accepted, this analogy is deeply flawed and does not justify a right to abortion.
The first shortcoming of Thompson’s theory is the false parallel made between having sex and being hooked up to a violinist in the middle of the night. Women don’t just wake up pregnant; pregnancy almost always is a natural consequence of deliberate actions on the part of the mother, a consequence for which she must bear some moral responsibility. The only exceptions would be the small fraction of pregnancies resulting from rape. Only in these cases, which make up about 1 percent of abortions in the U.S. each year, can Thompson’s imaginative scenario have any relationship to the circumstances of pregnancies, and even in these cases, her argument fails for other reasons.
Perhaps Thompson’s most egregious oversight is her failure to recognize the moral importance of the parent-child relationship. Parents have special responsibilities to their own children—an intuitive concept, enforced by American family law. Until their children reach adulthood, parents are legally and morally obligated to care for them. They must provide a safe and healthy environment for their children, whether they are adolescents, toddlers, infants, or still in the womb. A person who refuses to feed his own children breaks the law: He can and should be sentenced to time in prison. On the other hand, a person who does not feed someone else’s child commits no prosecutable crime. Thompson’s argument completely ignores this crucial distinction.
This flaw proves fatal to the violinist argument, as can be illustrated by modifying the original thought experiment. Suppose, for example, that the violinist were the patient’s own two-year-old daughter. The thought experiment would yield a very different outcome: No mother in her right mind would allow her own child to die, even if she were “threatening her autonomy.” Parenting requires personal sacrifice: All children limit bodily autonomy! This imposition does not justify the deliberate taking of a human life.
A third, philosophically broader failing of the violinist analogy involves the instrumentalization of the human person. In any given moral decision, a person can be treated as a means to an end or as an end in himself. Traditional morality holds that people should always be treated as ends in themselves, while the progressive view implicitly asserts that some people are to be treated as ends, others as simply means. That is, it allows those with power over others, such as the mother over her child or the patient over the violinist, to use that power to their own ends.
And so Thompson, champion of those who perceive the abortion debate as an issue of bodily autonomy, falls short of proving her point by presenting a situation absolutely without analogy to pregnancy. Her attempt to justify abortion despite fetal personhood reduces her argument to a poorly conceived notion of rights, one in which parents owe nothing to their children and in which some people have a basic human right to kill other people. If some people are means and others ends, who falls into which category? What’s to stop us from killing the old, the disabled, and any others who threaten our bodily autonomy? Such considerations return the debate to the question of fetal personhood, and proponents of abortion are left having to contend that a self-developing organism with a unique set of human DNA is something other than a nascent human person. With such an unviable position as this, is it any wonder Thompson and others have sought a way out?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If it was not shattered already, the myth of a post-racial American society has been thoroughly torn to pieces in the last few weeks. The racial profiling and murder of two Americans—one Arab and one Black—has underlined the need for stronger solidarity between these communities and a resistance based on what is becoming an increasingly shared struggle. In one case, a woman’s hijab was the trigger for violence; in the other, violence was excused through reference to a teenager’s hoodie. By examining the linkages between Islamophobic and anti-black violence and how they are both justified, we gain a clearer picture of what is at stake in the newest struggle against American racism.
On Wednesday, March 21, Fatima el Himidi returned home from school to find her mother lying unconscious in a pool of her own blood. Lying beside 32-year-old Shaima Alawadi’s body was a note: “go back to your country, you terrorist.” Like thousands of other residents of El Cajon, Calif., Alawadi was from Iraq, and she had left her native country for America in 1993. Alawadi left and found a better life in this quiet San Diego suburb, but it was a vitriolic brand of American racism and Islamophobia that would brutally claim her life.
The details of Trayvon Martin’s murder are, by now, much more familiar to many of us. A young black man was walking home in a small Florida town when an older man of mixed white and Hispanic descent named George Zimmerman started following him, eventually confronting the boy and gunning him down in broad daylight. The police accepted Zimmerman’s self-defense plea and for weeks refused to act despite the obvious flaws in the plea’s logic. Only in the wake of national outrage has the police begun a more thorough investigation, but as of yet Zimmerman has been neither charged nor arrested.
These killings reflect an increasingly virulent form of racism that has emerged in the last decade, as explicit expression of racial hatred has become taboo and those who espouse ideologies of white supremacy and its numerous ideological bedfellows find different codes with which to express their beliefs.
Notice, for example, how Republican presidential nominee Newt Gingrich uses phrases like “poor children… have nobody around them who works” and “food stamp president” to garner support among white voters. These references draw upon a history of racist caricatures of urban black communities and so-called “welfare queens” that are patently obvious to all of us but which avoid the key words he knows he can’t use anymore. The persistence of racism at the national level is extremely dangerous and allows accused murderers like George Zimmerman to avoid punishment.
Trayvon Martin’s hoodie has been singled out by commentators as an apparently threatening piece of clothing that is “as much responsible for his death” as the man who shot him, according to Fox News commentator Geraldo M. Rivera. Rivera’s statement is an outrageous example of victim-blaming, and it makes little sense. How could a hoodie be responsible for a murder?
It is only when Martin’s race is highlighted that Rivera’s claim makes sense, as he is rather obviously invoking the image of a “dangerous black man in a hoodie” to inflame the public. White men in hoodies rarely provoke public fear (unless they are Klansmen). For Rivera, and arguably in much of the discourse around the case, wearing a hoodie has come to stand in for being black. This kind of racist subtext is so barely veiled that it’s practically text (as Yo Is This Racist pointed out), but it retains a veneer of legitimacy because it remains implicit. Instead of blaming the color of his skin for his death, Rivera blames his hoodie. As a result, his statements are not explicitly racist, but they could only make sense if you are a racist.
Shaima Alawadi’s hijab has come to play a different but related role. Alawadi was targeted explicitly because she was a Muslim, as the threatening note beside her body makes clear. However, because Arab and Muslim Americans cannot be identified by their skin color, it was her head covering that marked her for death.
One of the most surprising aspects of the Alawadi case has been the lack of a nationwide uproar at her slaying. Although Arab and Muslim Americans have publicized the case as a horrifying example of the increasing racial hatred directed against their communities since 9/11, the mainstream media have been relatively quiet. Islamophobic representation of Muslims and Arabs fill the media, characterizing these communities as violent terrorists in the same way African American youth are characterized as criminals.
Yet it has been difficult to square the image of Muslim terrorists with a San Diego housewife brutalized for her religion. Indeed, Alawadi’s Muslimness is represented in the public arena most notably by her absence. And thus far, Muslim and Arab-American communities targeted by a decade of police surveillance, FBI entrapment, hate crimes, and spying on mosques have yet to mount a substantive campaign for justice.
Despite this, Muslim and Arab-Americans have been fighting back against the government’s war on civil rights and against the Islamophobic climate that has emerged. The struggles ahead will require solidarity building based on an awareness of the shared experiences of African-, Arab-, and Muslim American victims that these cases highlight. Wearing neither a hoodie nor a hijab is a reason for murder, and standing up to racial hatred means opposing all of its forms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past couple weeks were notable for two highly publicized atrocities: namely, the massacre of Afghani civilians by an American soldier and the massacre in France of soldiers and then Jewish schoolchildren by a Muslim fanatic. Pundits, frothing at the lips, interpreted the atrocities to fit their pre-existing positions—Muslims are angry, soldiers are mentally disturbed, America should leave Afghanistan, etc. Instead of entering that conversation, I think more can be gained by considering the response to the atrocities than by analyzing the atrocities themselves.
These two mass killings demonstrated how random, single-event atrocities receive disproportionate attention in the public sphere. Writers and television anchors use these events to advance a certain narrative when, in reality, these events are more the product of chance than any other factor. Momentary chemical imbalance in combination with a natural proclivity for violence will produce occasional human tragedies in any environment. Yet these events that are, first and foremost, random receive significantly more press, and therefore influence, than premeditated and orchestrated human tragedies of a far larger scale.
Naturally, one begins to suspect that the media, or, you know, “mainstream media” is the source of this imbalance. The response to these two events appears to feed ammunition to that suspicion. Following the attack in Toulouse, the pundits of our time all agreed with one of two propositions: Either Mohamed Merah was mentally ill and happened to be a Muslim fundamentalist, or he was a Muslim fundamentalist who happened to be mentally ill. This choice between viewing him as insane or a jihadist is one with two bad options. The same can be said for the choice between viewing Robert Bales in Afghanistan as either insane or a deranged soldier.
But blaming news outlets for providing storylines people tune in to may be comforting, but it is not truthful. Pundits—not ones on college newspapers, but ones with mortgages to pay—do not comment on events freely, but on events they know will be read. The same goes for television producers. Ultimately, the human mind is the guilty party. We are simply not wired to see tragedies in an objective or rational way.
The attention given to these atrocities illustrates the very worst instincts of human nature—the preference for a show over truth and the preference for simplicity over complexity. Unfortunately, this fetishization of single-event atrocities extends beyond the front pages of newspapers and into real political decision-making. Let’s consider a couple aspects of the War on Terror to see the influence of this phenomenon.
First, taking a long view, let’s analyze the product of the War on Terror. The approximately eight million refugees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are perhaps the strongest evidence that slow and continuous tragedies are tragically ignored in the public sphere. In the former, America settled for a sectarian “thugocracy” when a pluralistic democracy failed. In the latter, America accepted a tribal thugocracy years ago and is still looking for an excuse to get out. In the process, billions of dollars, with unimaginable opportunity costs, were spent, and hundreds of thousands died for a state of affairs that could have been arrived at with significantly less cost in money and lives. Alas, this tragedy is a multidimensional and continuous event, so the human mind pays it little attention.
Second, let’s consider how the fetishization of single-event atrocities affects terrorism itself. Political assassinations are as ancient as politics itself, but terrorism is relatively recent, only becoming a global phenomenon in the 1960s and 1970s. Political scientists often explain the relatively modern birth of terrorism by either cheaper access to explosives or the dramatically uneven balance of power in world affairs. Those factors explain the impetus for terrorism, but not its effectiveness.
Let me say something obvious: The priority of terrorism is not to kill citizens, but to terrorize. Therefore, its effectiveness is derived almost entirely from its effect on the gut, not the head. This truism points to a theory for terrorism’s recent existence. If terrorism seeks to create terror, then the information age is its greatest asset. The instantaneousness of media and its overwhelming presence in our lives encourages terrorism. Inadvertently, modern technology enables the priority of terrorism— instantaneous and communal shock.
Frankly, there is no grand solution to this human shortcoming. However, awareness may be a first step.

The truck once part of Harvard Skate will now return as the Plaza Taco food truck, run by Harvard University Dining Services.
Plaza Taco will be stationed outside the Science Center, approximately where Harvard Skate once stood. Though scheduled to officially open at 11 a.m. on Monday, April 2, it will roll into public view on Friday, March 30.
The truck will be open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for a test period of six weeks—from April 2 to May 18.
“We knew we wanted to do something, and tacos are a very popular food truck item,” Crista Martin, Director for Marketing and Communications at HUDS, said.
HUDS received its official license to open Plaza Taco Thursday, after passing inspections earlier this week.
The food truck will serve four different types of tacos: pork, chicken, beef, and vegetable. The beef taco will feature HUDS’ recurring favorite dinner option, Korean Barbecue, while the veggie taco will include seitan, or wheat gluten. Each type of taco has its own ingredients, but customers can also opt to customize their meal.
Chef Martin T. Breslin, Director for Culinary Operations at HUDS, and his team worked on the recipes and had several tastings before finalizing their menu. Breslin’s favorite is the beef taco.
“To put [Korean Barbecue] into a beautiful taco is delicious,” Breslin said.
The tacos shells will come from Tortilleria La Nina, founded by Boston-based, Mexican Chef Jamie Mammano.
The tortillas are made fresh daily in Everett, MA using authentically grown American corn, lime, and filtered water.
The taco truck will accept BoardPlus, Crimson Cash, and regular cash. The tacos, which Breslin describes as “double size” and a “value meal” will be $4.75 apiece. Four drinks will be offered: coke, diet coke, and water will cost $1.75 while lemonade will be $2.25.
All the tacos will be made at the Greenhouse Café and then taken to the food truck, where two students will sell the tacos.
“Currently I have some students that work at Lamont Café. We got a nice response during spring break of students looking for work. We have probably about 12 [student employees],” said Kim Smith, manager of Lamont Library Café, Barker Rotunda, and Dudley Café.
According to Martin, samples will be available on opening day, providing the weather is fair. People can also provide feedback on Plaza Taco’s Facebook and Twitter pages. If the input is positive, Plaza Taco will return in the fall.

Tasty Burger, a burger restaurant in Boston, will open a second branch in Harvard Square this fall, replacing the current 7-Eleven at 40 JFK Street.
The eatery, which will keep its first location behind Fenway Park, serves burgers, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, and salads with locally produced ingredients.
The restaurant’s affordable prices attract families, tourists, and students from the surrounding area. Current prices allow patrons to enjoy a cheeseburger, root beer, and fries for less than seven dollars.
Tasty Burger’s current location has been quite successful since it opened in 2010, according to David A. DuBois, Tasty Burger co-owner and chef.
But, according to DuBois, the owners have always wanted to expand their business beyond their current location at Fenway.
“I have been trying to get a restaurant in Cambridge for a while,” DuBois, a former Cambridge resident, said. “It just wasn’t in the cards until now.”
They originally planned to open a second branch in Davis Square. However, when their plans fell through, owners decided to look into a location in Cambridge.
“Personally I couldn’t be happier,” DuBois said. “I’ve always wanted to come home to Cambridge.”
DuBois ate his first burger from Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers when he was just seven years old.
He grew up eating Charlie’s Kitchen’s ‘double cheeseburger special’ and said that their food shaped his love for burgers today.
Despite other popular burger restaurants in Harvard Square, DuBois said that Tasty Burger’s unique menu will differentiate its food from other Cambridge burger joints.
The menu currently features thirteen types of specialty burgers, including veggie patties and turkey burgers that DuBois called “the best in the city.” Unlike Bartley’s and Charlie’s, Tasty Burger serves “flat patty” burgers chargrilled in a cookout style, DuBois said.
Dubois hopes to open the restaurant next fall, after renovations to the space.
The owners will need to redesign the store to include a completely new kitchen.
After renovations, Dubois said that the restaurant will look more “polished” than the current location in Fenway, which was built in an old gas station.
Owners of other burger restaurants in Cambridge said that they had become accustomed to contending with rival businesses.
“There’s always going to be competition, especially in Harvard Square,” said Anthony S. Ackil ’99, co-owner of another Cambridge burger restaurant, b.good.

Harvard Medical School has opened a new Center for Primary Care using funds from a $30 million anonymous donation gifted specifically to improve the quality of primary care training.
HMS instructor and co-director for the center Andrew L. Ellner ’97 defines primary care as the first contact a patient has with the health care system. The term also includes the doctors who provide long-term care to patients.
“In contrast to a specialist who focuses on an organ, a primary care physician studies the whole body system and develops a relationship with the patient,” Ellner said.
The new center looks to fix what both Ellner and center co-director and HMS professor Russell S. Phillips call the “crisis in health care.”
“We spend too much and get too little,” said Ellner.
According to Ellner, there have been many improvements in biomedical research, but little improvement in the health care system. Additionally, there is a shortage of primary care physicians because few students choose to study primary care, Phillips said.
“[Primary care] should be a team-based effort but that’s not the case,” he said.
He mentioned that a lack of support from other doctors, nurses, specialists, and hospital workers can push primary care physicians to work longer hours to provide adequate care while being compensated less than their peers in other fields of medicine.
Phillips identified two types of medicine—cognitive work and procedural work. Work by primary care physicians is deemed cognitive work, but procedural work receives better compensation. The lower compensation deters many students from studying to become primary care physicians.
“We want to raise excitement for primary care among the students. It hasn’t been the sexiest of choices, but it is one of the most important,” said Ellner.
Phillips mentioned that “a strong base of primary care is critical for our country. States with better primary care have higher quality of care and lower costs.”
Ellner said that students sometimes feel that primary care is not where the intelligent doctors go.
“We need our best and brightest to work [in primary care,” he added.
Ellner hopes the center can improve medical education by teaching students to work in teams and to work with the body as a system rather than focusing on individual diseases.

After a writing career that spanned more than six decades, feminist poet and activist Adrienne C. Rich ’51­ died Tuesday at the age of 82. Rich’s work, which includes numerous collections of poetry and prose essays, explored themes of women’s rights, racism, and politics.
“No poet with her linguistic gifts has done as much to make more of the world outside of poetry. She was clearly one of the major poets of her time,” said English professor Stephen L. Burt, who teaches and studies Rich’s work.
Her writing would evolve drastically during the course of her lifetime—a shift that mirrored her sometimes tumultuous personal life.
“She was a remarkable, generous, passionate woman,” said Frances Golden, Rich’s longtime literary agent.
“She was a tiny giant. She was very short, but her words and her poetry spoke very loudly.”
In 1953, Rich married Harvard Economics professor Alfred Conrad, with whom she had three sons.
In the 1960s her work grew increasingly radical, and poems like “Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law” began to reflect a more critical view of the traditional roles of wife and mother.
“The experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me,” she wrote in an essay published in 1982.
After moving to New York in 1966, Rich became more involved in feminist and anti-war activism. She eventually separated from Conrad, who committed suicide a few months later.
In 1976, Rich began what would be a lifelong relationship with the writer Michelle Cliff. It was at this time she began writing extensively on her personal experiences as a lesbian woman and female sexuality more broadly. She publicly came out when her “Twenty-One Love Poems” collection was published that same year.
Cliff and Rich moved to Santa Cruz, Calif. in the 1980s and lived there together until Rich’s death.
Rich was unafraid to mix politics and art. She often used the critical attention that her poems garnered for political purposes.
In 1974, Rich was awarded the National Book Award, but refused to accept the honor individually. Instead, she and two other female nominees decided to share the prize in a gesture of female solidarity.
solidarity.
In 1997, Rich declined a National Medal of Arts to protest the “cynical politics” of the Clinton administration.
“[Art] means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the power which holds it hostage,” she wrote in a letter to the National Endowment of the Arts.
Golden, who represented Rich for more than 25 years, said that Rich continued writing until her last days in spite of macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis—the chronic condition that eventually caused her death.
Rich completed a poetry collection—which she had said would be her last—only a few weeks ago.
“I wept when I got the final manuscript,” said Golden.
Rich published 30 books over the course of her life, all of which are still in print. Between 750,000 and 800,000 copies of her works have been sold, according to her publisher W.W. Norton and Company.
“She had the most profound respect for the power of the written word,” said her son, Jacob Conrad. “She wanted her legacy to be her writing.”

Those who look to religious scripture for guidance should support the rights of the LGBTQ community not despite their religious convictions, but because of them, said author Jay Michaelson in his talk “God vs. Gay” on Thursday night at Hillel.
Michaelson is the author of the bestseller “God vs. Gay: The Religious Case for Equality” and the founder of Nehirim, a national organization of LGBT Jews and allies. Michaelson’s work focuses on religion, spirituality, sexuality, and law, according to his website. Michaelson argued that present understandings of the Bible’s views on homosexuality are based on an overly narrow reading.
“Only six verses out of 31,000 even talk about same-sex intimacy,” said Michaelson. “But even those are obscure and subject to interpretation.”
There is no definitive answer to how narrowly or broadly biblical passages should be interpreted, said Michaelson. He pointed to the sixth commandment–thou shalt not kill–as an example.
“Two chapters later there is a discussion about the death penalty,” he said. “The Bible is not an answer key, it’s a question key.”
In addressing Leviticus 18:22, the controversial passage that reads “thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination,” Michaelson again emphasized the applicability of range of approaches.
The Hebrew word “Toevah,” since translated into “abomination” in today’s Bible, originally meant “a culturally relevant taboo,” said Michaelson. The broad term was used to describe same-sex acts, but it was also used by Egyptians to describe the act of eating with Israelites, among other things.
“I am onboard with the Bible being literally true,” he said. “Yet the Bible still has to go on to define the scope. We have to determine what is the wrong part, and what is the right part of this passage.”
Michaelson ended his lecture with a scene from Huckleberry Finn in which Huck is concerned that he will go to hell if he does not turn in Jim, an escaped slave, but ultimately decides to protect his friend.
“This isn’t a moment Huck is going to hell. This is the moment Huck becomes an adult and overcomes his prejudices,” said Michaelson. “By defying the teaching of his church, he’s actually fulfilling the highest aspirations and intentions of the religious community of which he is a part.”
Nicholas J. Mendoza, a Harvard Divinity School student, said that Michaelson’s religious approach fills an important gap in the gay rights discussion.
“I think by arguing theologically instead of politically, Michaelson meets an important need,” said Mendoza. “It is absolutely an original approach, and it speaks entirely in terms of religious thought.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the first fiscal quarter of 2012 drawing to a close on Saturday, Massachusetts’s leading political campaigns have spent much of the past few weeks scrambling to raise last-minute funds and boost what will be their first financial reports since January.
The mandatory filing date, which accounts for funds raised and spent in the first three months of 2012, is not until April 15, but recent convention suggests some campaign’s could release these numbers as early as next week. Either way, the filing will be one of the most important insights yet into the state of each of the major campaigns for U.S. Senate and Massachusetts’s open Fourth Congressional District seat, analysts said.
“Money drives everything in campaigning. Period. End of sentence. While polls can vary, money is money,” said Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh. “There’s no way to get around it because it is one of the few quantifiable measures you have of what kind of support you have and where it is.”
In anticipation of the deadline, a number of campaigns engaged with voters through contests that encouraged voter engagement. Various efforts asked for financial support and attempted to encourage grassroots participation.
In an email to Fourth District voters with the subject line “A Deadline Approaches,” Joseph P. Kennedy III asked his supporters to help provide the momentum now he would need to gather for the fall. He also launched a special “Raise the Roots” fundraising initiative among volunteers, singling out special “grassroots superstars” to feature on his campaign website.
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign, which has focused on grassroots efforts since its inception, recently launched a NCAA tournament-themed political organizing challenge to engage supporters.
Fellow Democratic Senatorial candidate Marisa DeFranco has made similar appeals.
It is no surprise that much of the fervor has been limited to non-incumbents, Marsh said. For candidates like Sen. Scott Brown and Sean Bielat who have established donor networks, such efforts are less pressing.
“Often times when you are a new candidate, and you are just getting known, you have networks of money out of state that know you better than donors in your state,” Marsh said, citing the large out-of-state support Warren has received and Kennedy is likely to.
Such money is helpful, Marsh said, but often means little when it comes time to vote, and to make up for it, candidates will spend a lot of money setting up large grassroots networks that pay for themselves in votes.
“People who give you $25, $10, $100—those people are more likely to vote for you and work for you,” Marsh said.
Still, with the general election roughly six months away, the most important thing for Warren is that she fundraises more than her opponents, political analysts said. Warren has out-raised Brown each quarter since she entered the race last fall, but as of the end of 2011, she still trailed the incumbent by half—nearly $6 million.
“She’s done surprisingly well for a first time candidate, that said, no matter what she’s going to have to close the gap,” Marsh said.
The date will also bring the first financial reports from Kennedy, who entered the Fourth District race in January and is suspected to have a great deal of fiduciary backing from within the district and beyond, attributable largely to his family’s political prominence.
For Kennedy’s chief opponent, Bielat, who trails the Democrat by a wide margin in recent polls, the numbers could make or break his campaign, analysts said.
“As for Bielat, be on the lookout for large checks from national Republican players from out of State. If those dollars are not coming in, then those players do not consider his campaign a good investment,” former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71 said.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ new mechanical engineering and electrical engineering concentrations will provide students with the opportunity for more unique and personalized plans of study.
Unlike the existing engineering sciences concentration, which requires students to choose an area of specialization, the new concentrations will be standalone options for those who are interested in a more focused academic experience.
In order to successfully seek accreditation for the new degrees, SEAS must develop new classes that satisfy specific requirements.
“Having a degree which says ‘Mechanical Engineering’ or ‘Electrical Engineering’ puts a couple more content constraints on it than just ‘Engineering Sciences,’” said SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie D. Dahleh.
The addition of the mechanical engineering concentration will be accompanied by a new upper division course that will satisfy accreditation requirements. According to Dahleh, SEAS “now has the faculty capacity” to do so.
Multiple new courses are also planned for the electrical engineering concentration.
“The current plan is to add a couple of upper division courses, at least one of which will be largely hands-on and laboratory design based,” said Dahleh.
The new concentrations will also provide employers with a better sense of a student’s background and skill set.
“It will help give them more credibility in the job market for certain careers,” said Samuel B. Kesner, a lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at SEAS.
Dahleh noted that the structure of the engineering concentrations in SEAS will shift once the new concentrations are announced.
“Because we are creating these two focused concentrations, that allows us to free up engineering sciences, so it no longer has to be used as a mechanism to do an electrical engineering or mechanical engineering degree,” Dahleh said. “There will be some areas of focus, a breadth requirement, and a depth requirement, but it won’t be limited.”
Joost J. Vlassak, SEAS area dean for materials science and mechanical engineering, also emphasized the additional freedom that would be given to engineering sciences concentrators.
“For the students, this means that they will be able to tailor their Engineering Sciences program more to their own interests,” he said.
Dahleh suggested that the creation of the new concentrations was prompted by students’ desire to identify with their respective disciplines.
“If you say, ‘I have a degree in electrical engineering,’ people know what that means, whereas if you say to someone, ‘I have a degree in engineering sciences,’ it’s less clear,” said Dahleh. “They want that sense of identification both while they are here and when they go out into the workplace,” she said.
Students also welcomed the new additions.
“I think it’s great that these are becoming full fledged concentrations,” said Adrian W. Jones ’15.
Because the concentrations could be introduced as early as the next academic year, they also may be feasible options for those already enrolled in the College.
“I actually came to Harvard planning on concentrating in engineering and I believe that I will specifically study electrical engineering,” said Jones.

Connor P. McKnight was 30,000 feet above the ground with his cell phone off when an email arrived in his inbox offering him a spot in Harvard College’s Class of 2016.
En route to the admitted students visiting weekend at the College of William and Mary, it was not until he touched down on the tarmac in Williamsburg, Va. that he turned on his phone and glanced at his unread messages.
“I checked my email and there it was,” he said. “It’s like all this hard work has finally paid off and it’s exhilarating.”
McKnight had not even called his parents to give them the good news at the time of the interview.
Many of the 1,260 students who received offers of admissions shared McKnight’s feelings of elation.
Rather than opening his email notification immediately at 5 p.m., Robert T. Fitzpatrick of Boston elected to wait until he was at home, away from his friends.
“I didn’t believe it really,” Fitzpatrick said of the email notification from Harvard.
Still skeptical, Fitzpatrick logged on to the portal for accepted students on the admissions office’s website. Fitzpatrick said he only believed his good luck when the portal opened and the music started playing.
Fitzpatrick, whose brother James P. Fitzpatrick ’12 is president of the Hasting Pudding Theatricals, said he was also accepted at Brown, but will probably attend Harvard.
Jason F. Friedman of Atlanta, GA was taking a five minute break from play rehearsal when he checked his phone and saw the email from Harvard.
“I was just shocked when I opened my email,” he said. “My heart definitely skipped a beat.”
Although Friedman’s email from Harvard arrived right at 5 p.m., he said he was unable to log on to Yale’s notification portal until after 6 p.m.
Friedman said he is waiting to hear about financial aid at Harvard before making his decision. The University of Georgia, where he has received a full scholarship, is among the schools he is considering.
At 5 p.m., Rory O’Reilly of Elmont, N.Y. said he was lying on his bed playing upbeat music and refreshing the admission’s office portal repeatedly, waiting for the email.
When asked what he liked about Harvard, O’Reilly said, “It’s kind of like Hogwarts, you know.”

After instituting a set of rule changes to limit concussions in football, the Ivy League’s Concussion Committee will recommend a number of policy changes to the league presidents to protect student-athletes playing men’s and women’s hockey, lacrosse, and soccer.
Student-athletes should expect to see several of the same changes made for football put in place for their sports, according to Ivy League Deputy Executive Director Carolyn Campbell-McGovern.
“A lot of the  recommendations from the football report were naturally going to be applied to other sports as well, particularly the education components, sideline testing components, and any other of those types of enhancement,” Campbell-McGovern said.
After becoming the first conference to implement concussion-prevention measures for football, the Ivy League is furthering its pioneering role in concussion safety with these recommendations.
“We are leading other conferences,” said Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris. “I don’t know of any conference looking at this in the same manner that we are. We really see this as an area that we can be a leader in terms of the medical care safety of our athletes as well as in terms of the research we contribute to our collective understanding of concussions and athletics.”
Harris said it would be too early in the process to speak about what may be recommended, but did confirm that reports have now been written by the sport-specific subcommittees. On Wednesday, Harris and the rest of the multi-sport core committee convened in New York to discuss the recommendations made by the lacrosse and soccer subcommittees. The core group, which includes Harvard Head Athletic Trainer Brant Berkstresser, as well as other trainers, physicians, and administrators, will review recommendations made by the hockey subcommittees in April.
The committee is co-chaired by two presidents—David Skorton of Cornell and Jim Kim of Dartmouth.
Michael J. O’Brien, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School as well as a practicing doctor in the Children’s Hospital Boston’s Division of Sports Medicine, mentioned a number of specific changes he’d like to see enacted.
O’Brien, who works in CHB’s concussion clinic, said that he sees 300-400 concussions each month, 98 percent of which come from sports-related injuries. O’Brien said that rapid, on-the-field diagnosis of head injuries could be helpful.
“The biggest risk is not the athlete who gets hit across the middle and is out cold,” O’Brien said. “The bigger risk is the athlete who gets injured, flies under the radar a little bit and gets a hit a few more times in that game or in the next two or three games. The injuries to that athlete tend to be exponential, their threshold to injury is much worse, and the damage is exponential. Using computer based testing to get objective information rather than just reporting symptoms would help.”

Former United States Secretary of State James A. Baker III received the 2012 Great Negotiator Award Thursday. The award, given by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School and the Future of Diplomacy Project at Harvard Kennedy School, recognizes individuals who have made a lasting impact through their work in negotiation and dispute resolution.
The event featured a panel discussion with Baker led by HKS Professor R. Nicholas Burns and Harvard Business School Professor James K. Sebenius.
Baker, who served as President George H.W. Bush’s Secretary of State, amassed a wealth of experience in the United States government as the Secretary of Commerce for President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. and the Secretary of the Treasury for President Ronald Reagan.
As he related the hectic life of a Secretary of State through tales of his greatest accomplishments—the reunification of Germany within NATO and the Gulf War Coalition—Baker shared negotiation advice with the audience.
“You’re never going to be a good negotiator unless you are willing to walk away from a negotiation when it isn’t going to succeed,” Baker said. “You don’t ever stake out a maximalist position. If you’re not ready to walk, you’re not going to get anywhere.”
During the discussion, Baker also offered his opinion on matters including the United States’ economic standing, Korean unification, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“If we didn’t have the dollar as the reserve currency of the world, we’d be Greece,” Baker said.
“But you don’t want to hear from the Secretary of the Treasury today, you want to hear from the Secretary of State,” Bake said, referring to his experience in both positions and sending a wave of laughter through the audience.
Event attendees pressed Baker for his opinion on Gulf War issues, including the efficacy of the Patriot missile defense system in deterring Israel from reacting to Iraqi attacks and the refusal of minor concessions to Saddam Hussein in calling for his forces to leave Kuwait.
“We’ve heard a lot of stories about James Baker’s actions during that time, and it’s interesting to hear his firsthand account to either corroborate or tweak the official history of the situation,” said HKS student Christopher W. Gustafson.
Over 275 attendees packed Ames Courtroom in the Law School’s Austin Hall during the three-and-a-half-hour event.
The attendees were mainly students and faculty from the Law, Kennedy, and Business Schools.
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow underscored the significant role Baker has played in world events of recent memory.
“This is a great man,” she said. “The world is different because of the actions, steps, and negotiations undertaken by James Baker.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Community youth marched the streets of Boston Thursday, joined by Harvard students and alumni, to protest Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority fare hikes and service cuts, as well as rally for a discounted youth pass.
The Youth Affordabili(T) Coalition—comprised of 21 greater Boston area youth groups—led what they called the March for Opportuni(T).
The organization advocates for a youth pass that would grant discounted transportation for youth ages 12 to 21.
The potential fare hikes would affect college volunteers and high school participants in after-school programs run by the Phillips Brooks House Association.
PBHA offers reimbursements to participants in some programs, and hikes would significantly impact PBHA as a non-profit.
Victor M. Flores ’13, PBHA after school and in-school programs officer, spread the word of the protest to on-campus organizations and local high schools.
“At Harvard, we sometimes forget that we’re a part of this larger community,” Flores said.
Jackson F. Cashion ’13, an inactive Crimson editor who attended the rally, is currently working with a group of 10 colleges in Boston to push for a university pass.
“College and high school students here don’t have cars. We rely on the T,” Cashion said. “We have more in common than we think, and [college students] should support them.”
Protesters marched from the Park Street T Station to the MBTA Transportation Building, chanting for “Youth Power” and brandishing handmade and printed posters.
Students requested meetings from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and the other state representatives, which were all unsuccessful. Patrick and other state representatives did not grant meetings, instead sending staff members in their places.
A small group of students who were hoping to speak to Richard A. Davey of MassDOT were turned away by security at the door, saying the group needed to be accompanied by David V. Jenkins ’03 of the Alternatives for Community and the Environment, who helps support the youth coalition.
Students were upset with MassDOT’s reluctance to speak with them.
“We want to speak for ourselves. This is our fight. We want to show how much we care,” said Denysha Jackson, a junior at Fenway High School in Boston who lives in Roslindale and takes the T to school.
Students spoke in front of the Transportation Building and chanted as workers inside 10 Park Plaza stared down through the glass and security guard blocked the doors.
The march continued to the State House, where students spoke about their attempts to speak to representatives.
After the rally, many students pulled out their CharlieCards and walked to Park Station to take the T back home.
The MBTA board will present their budget proposal to the Massachusetts legislature on April 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard released a new College-wide alcohol policy Friday, ushering in an era of greater University regulation over undergraduate drinking.
The new guidelines, intended to standardize currently inconsistent enforcement of alcohol policy across the 12 Houses, outline how alcohol should be handled and distributed in a variety of settings—from students’ dorm rooms to social events sponsored by the College.
Harvard’s new policy, which has been in the works for months and is released in the wake of a scandal over fraternity hazing and drinking practices at Dartmouth College, will go into effect next fall after being reviewed by faculty. The guidelines specify the quantity and type of alcohol that can be served, how it can be advertised and licensed, and when it can be offered. The new policy includes no mention of jurisdiction over final clubs or Greek organizations.
While the College aims to tighten its grip over unsafe drinking on campus, it has loosened its restrictions on hard liquor. In response to student feedback, mixed drinks will once again be allowed at House formals.
When mixed drinks return to House formals next year, the College will view the relaxed policy as a pilot program to test whether students are able to drink hard liquor responsibly.
While House Committee Chairs applauded Harvard’s decision to reintroduce hard liquor to formals and incorporate other student feedback into the new policy, some questioned the guidelines’ vagueness about drinking games and punishment for infractions.
HARD TIMES
The document lays out one alcohol policy for all House formals.
It states that mixed drinks can contain only one type of liquor and must be served by a professional bartender approved by the Office of Student Life. While beer and malt beverages can be distributed at an open bar, mixed drinks must be purchased or disbursed through a drink ticket system.
Adams HoCo Co-Chair Jackson F. Cashion ’13 called the change “a good step toward treating us like adults.”
Cabot HoCo Co-Chair Laura S. Hinton ’13 echoed Cashion. Calling formals “a really important part of House life,” Hinton said, “Serving only beer and wine can be restrictive.”
The College’s move to reintroduce hard liquor at both on- and off-campus House formals reverses two decisions made over the past two years to restrict mixed drinks at these semester-end events. In April 2010, the College banned hard liquor at on-campus formals after the Cambridge License Commission decided that it would no longer issue all-liquor licenses to students. A year later, in March 2011, administrators extended the hard liquor ban to off-campus House formals.
Quincy HoCo Co-Chair Catherine G. Katz ’13, who, along with all the other HoCo chairs previewed the policy at a meeting Tuesday night, pointed to the reintroduction of hard liquor as evidence that the College took student input into consideration when drafting the guidelines.
“They could easily have taken a very hard-line policy and said no,” Katz said. “The fact that they were willing to try [the pilot program] shows they were willing to listen.”
Over the past year, the College has made an effort to solicit student feedback on the new policy at seven meetings. When these meetings generated low student turnout, the alcohol policy committee turned to an online survey for students last month. Next week, the College will hold three more student meetings to solicit feedback on the new policy.
IT’S MY PARTY 
 The new guidelines seek to clarify the College’s alcohol policy by examining terms such as “social events on campus” and “private party.”
The policy defines the former as “organized functions held in House common areas...or non-residential facilities...where alcohol is served.”
At these events, the policy said, beer, wine, and malt drinks will continue to be allowed, while hard liquor will still be banned. Kegs will be permitted at non-athletic social events—perpetuating the ban on kegs at tailgates which has long irked attendees.
The events must be registered and may not serve alcohol for longer than five hours. For parties longer than two hours, partygoers must get in line for alcohol at least thirty minutes before the event ends and receive their drink at least fifteen minutes before the conclusion of the party.
A “private party” under the new policy constitutes an event hosted by one or more students, in their own room or suite, where guests are allowed by personal invitation only.
If all hosts of the event are 21 or older, then kegs, beer, wine, malt drinks, and hard liquor will continue to be permitted at these private events.
Students seeking to host a private party are required to meet with their tutor before hosting their first party of each academic year. While the policy states that hosts must also demonstrate a “satisfactory understanding of strategies to create safe social environments,” as well as comply to state laws, it does not elaborate on how administrators, House Masters, and tutors will operationalize such standards.
SOBER REMINDERS
When it comes to the details of actual alcohol consumption—particularly drinking games—the policy is vague.
The document states: “Activities that promote high-risk drinking, such as excessive and/or rapid consumption of alcohol, particularly of a competitive nature, are not permitted. It is expected that hosts will plan parties where drinking is not the central activity.”
Asked on Thursday whether the new policy permits students to play beer pong, a College administrator who spoke on background declined to respond.
Winthrop HoCo Co-Chair Marissa C. Friedman ’14 said she was concerned that the new policy’s “vague language” about competitive drinking games would leave each tutor to enforce the regulation as he sees fit.
“There are going to be some tutors who see any drinking game as a competitive high-risk drinking game and will shut it down...versus other tutors who are going to be very lax about it and say it’s okay as long as people aren’t chugging a handle,” Friedman said. “The vague language doesn’t really allow for University consistency, which I think could be a problem.”
Leverett HoCo Co-Chair Gary D. Carlson ’13 said that the HoCo Chairs expressed concern about the new policy’s ambiguous wording, particularly with regard to punishment, at their meeting on Tuesday.
“Nobody knows where the line is for Ad Boarding,” Carlson said. “That just causes fear among the student body.”
But Katz defended the policy’s wording. “It’s good that they are leaving some of this up to the autonomy of the Houses to deal with things as they see fit,” she said.
DRINKING PROBLEM
The College’s new policy seems to be unlike anything that has come before it. While predecessors do exist, they are brief or hard to find.
The 2011-2012 Handbook for Students offers guidelines about drugs and alcohol that are much shorter than the policy released Friday. By searching Google, students can also find a more detailed form of the old alcohol policy in a document titled “Alcohol and Drug Policy for RD manual” on a Harvard iSite website
Friday’s announcement marks the culmination of a year-long effort by the College to universalize its inconsistently enforced alcohol policy. In March 2011, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds began taking quiet steps to crack down on campus drinking, publishing an op-ed in The Crimson about alcohol use the day before the alcohol-soaked illicit tradition of River Run. She also sent a memo to House Masters instructing them to enforce the College’s alcohol policy more consistently.
Later that month, the Pforzheimer HoCo canceled its biannual Pfoho Golf event, where groups of students traveled to designated rooms, called “holes,” which offered alcoholic and non-alcoholic refreshments. The House Masters said that the event did not adhere to the College’s ID-checking policy for House-sponsored events.
The month ended with Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson’s announcement banning hard liquor at off-campus House formals.
Amid these reforms, the College convened an alcohol policy committee that spring and charged the group of administrators and students with drafting new guidelines for on-campus drinking.

Jeremy Lin ’10 has joined fellow New York darling Amar’e Stoudemire on the sideline. Out since Saturday with a sore left knee, Lin has now missed the Knicks' past two contests, watching victories over Milwaukee on Monday and Orlando on Wednesday from the bench.
“Just thinking that more rest would be beneficial right now and that’s basically it,” Lin told reporters prior to Wednesday’s contest. “Just trying to make sure that we give me a chance to rest so that I don’t force anything before I have to.”
Lin’s exact return date is unknown.
"He's just going through the treatment process and he could be day-to-day,” said Knicks interim coach Mike Woodson. “How long that is I have no idea."
In Lin's absence, New York has won two games in dominating defensive fashion. The squad beat Milwaukee, 89-80, on Monday and Orlando, 108-86, in Wednesday’s matchup. Forward Carmelo Anthony led the way, scoring 28 and 25, respectively, in the contests.
Lin’s next opportunity to return to action will be Friday at 7:30 p.m. when the Knicks travel to Atlanta to take on the Hawks.
With 15 games left to play, the Knicks currently sit at eighth place in the Eastern Conference standings, 2 1/2 games ahead of ninth-place Milwaukee. The top eight teams in each conference make the playoffs.

Remember Zach Boden?
In the fall, the freshman from Atlanta emerged as a standout player on the Harvard football team.  In his rookie season, Boden gained significant playing time as a running back.  He was twice named Ivy League Rookie of the Week and averaged 6.1 yards per carry on the season with six touchdowns.
Boden’s story continued to unfold earlier this spring when he decided to join the baseball team while still fully participating in football offseason workouts.
When Boden made his decision to join the team, he was unsure of what his role would be.
“I have no idea really how much I’m going to play,” Boden said, “Or if I’m going to play at all this season.  I’m just going out there, meeting some new guys and hoping to see the field a little bit this year.”
Now, playing in the outfield for the Crimson, Boden is second on the team in hitting with a batting average of .343.  He has recorded four runs and two RBIs so far this season.
Boden has proven to be a valuable player both on the football and baseball field.  With Ivy play beginning this Saturday, Boden will be a key player to watch for the rest of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even if the Crimson is long gone from the NCAA tournament, your allegiance to Harvard can still play a role in who you cheer for this weekend in the Final Four. Unfortunately, a true Harvard fan has good reasons to root for and against each of the powerhouse teams remaining. Below, we present each case and leave it up to you to decide who to pull for.
Kentucky
Reason to root for Kentucky: If you want to thank the Princeton Tigers for sending the Crimson to the tourney by beating Penn this year, cheer alongside them for a cat to retake the throne on top of the basketball food chain. The whole cat family is still licking its wounds after watching last year’s all-canine Connecticut Huskies-Butler Bulldogs matchup. Therefore, the top-seeded Wildcats seem like an obvious underdog team to root for.
Reason to root against Kentucky: On the other hand, if you are still recovering from Harvard’s loss to Princeton in last year’s one-game playoff, it may be too soon to root for another big cat.
Louisville
Reason to root for Louisville: If you squinted hard enough, you could have confused Louisville in its black uniforms with Harvard when the Crimson goes with an all-black look.
Reason to root against Louisville: Louisville’s logo is a cardinal showing off its pearly whites with a mean snarl. The only problem, as pointed out by the true Harvard man watching the Elite Eight with me, is that cardinals don’t have teeth. Every time Louisville takes a step forward, ornithological awareness takes a step back. Be a smart Harvard fan and oppose ornithological ignorance.
Ohio  State
Reason to root for Ohio State: The Chairman of the Ohio State Board of Trustees Leslie Wexner has given just under $20 million to The John F. Kennedy School of Government's Center for Public Leadership. The multi-billionaire was inaugurated by Harvard  University into the Society of John Harvard Fellows and serves as a visiting lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Reason to root against Ohio State: Ohio State’s mascot is the Buckeye. What is a Buckeye, you might ask? Well, it’s a medium-sized deciduous tree that produces yellow-green panicles…but not in Massachusetts. While the plant is present in nearby Maine, New Hampshire and New York, it is absent from the great Bay State. If that silly tree thinks it doesn’t need Mass., then we certainly don’t need it.
Kansas
Reason to root for Kansas: On Nov. 23, the Jayhawks lost to Duke. On Jan. 21, the Blue Devils lost to Florida State, a team Harvard topped during the season-opening Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. So if the Jayhawks come out victorious this weekend, you might as well consider the Crimson national champions. Go Crimson!
Reason to root against Kansas: James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, brought the infantile sport to Kansas University in 1898, establishing one of the first collegiate basketball programs. The sport quickly grew to hundreds of other schools and began to rival football, a game with strong roots at Harvard. Over 100 years later, it’s still okay to be bitter towards KU for getting the game before such a prestigious institution as Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a big sports year for Harvard alums. There was Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 quarterbacking his way into the hearts of Bills fans and being rewarded with a $59 million contract. There was Matt Birk ’98 continuing a stellar career with the Baltimore Ravens and being named the 2012 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. And of course, there was Jeremy Lin ’10 reenergizing the New York Knicks and spreading bad, vaguely racist, puns across the nation.
All three of these stories were noteworthy in their own right. But their cultural relevance was enhanced by the novelty involved: a quarterback from a hyper-academic FCS program making it big in the NFL, a thinking man excelling at a position – offensive line – that is often characterized as brutish, a point guard from a school and team that had not even won a conference title in the Ivy League in over half a century.
Amidst all of this, there was the continuation of Crimson athletic success in more traditional arenas, including the start of a professional hockey career for Harvard senior attack man Alex Killorn. Killorn, who just signed a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning of the NHL on March 19, will be joining a long tradition of Harvard alums in the NHL including friend and former teammate Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, of the Montreal Canadiens.
“It might be a coincidence that all these Harvard athletes are finding success professionally in the same year,” Killorn said. “But it’s obviously emblematic of athletics at Harvard just growing stronger as the years go by. I know Harvard takes a lot of pride in its athletics, and we have young guys like Louis Leblanc excelling in addition to the more famous examples like Lin. I’m just excited about getting the chance to be part of that tradition.”
Killorn is currently in Norfolk, Va., playing for the Lightning-affiliated Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League. Assuming he can work his way up and find a spot as a dressing member of the Lightning’s 20-man roster, Killorn would be the 26th  former Crimson hockey player to see time on the ice in the NHL. Killorn is set to finish his course requirements and graduate with the Class of 2012 in May.
“I’m not going to speculate about fitting myself into their team, I’m just going to try and play to the best of my abilities,” Killorn said. “I’m trying not to focus on stuff that’s out of my control. Instead I’m going to work as hard as I can, and hopefully I’ll get a shot.”
A prolific scorer during his time at Harvard, Killorn leaves the Crimson with 53 goals and 109 points—both of which are the most for a Harvard skater since the early 2000s. In addition, Killorn capped off his Crimson career with first-team All-ECAC and first-team All-Ivy honors in 2011-12, and finished fourth in the nation with 0.68 goals per game. He also helped catalyze a late-season run that propelled Harvard all the way to the ECAC finals and the first winning-season since 2007-08.
“This last month has been great, especially to go as far as we did, all the way to the ECAC finals,” Killorn said. “We started the year a little rough but ended it competing in the finals with a team [Union] that has a real chance at being the national champion. Especially considering the lack of team success that had kind of defined my four years at Harvard, it was great to kind of turn it around and to really end on a high note.”
With seven other members of the Crimson having already been drafted by NHL teams, Killorn and Leblanc can serve as ready examples of what is possible for athletes coming out of Harvard.
That said, there are no guarantees. Leblanc seems to have established himself for the foreseeable future, playing in 37 games for the last-place Canadiens, but the future is less certain for Killorn, who will have to prove his worth in the upcoming season.
“I’m definitely excited to sign a contract and start my pro career,” Killorn said. “Norfolk is a great place to start, and hopefully I can work my way up. It’s something you obviously dream of when you’re young—this is the pinnacle of the sport.”
The road ahead for Killorn will be an exciting one, but one that is not uncharted for Crimson alums. We ought to remember that the hockey program continues to churn out athletes in a way few other Crimson sports have.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing 15-6 loss to Bryant on Tuesday, the Harvard softball team gathered together and discussed its mistakes. The pitching staff had walked 13 batters and hit two others while the defense committed three errors that led to five unearned runs.
“Nobody felt good after that game,” co-captain Rachel Brown said.
In all, the team decided it had lacked the focus and mental toughness necessary to achieve its potential. An additional practice on Wednesday night was added to the schedule to work on those issues, because after losing three of its last four contests, the team had to rediscover its early-season stride, and fast. The Cornell game was quickly approaching.
Before the 2011 season, the Crimson spent every offseason practice thinking about beating Cornell. After losing to the Big Red in the Ivy League Championship Series, the team was mentally preparing for their rivals in each fall and winter preparation session, wanting desperately to take down No. 1.
On Friday, the roles will be reversed.
Thanks to Harvard’s sweep of the 2011 league championship series by a combined score of 9-0, it is now the Crimson (12-7) that has a target on its back and the Big Red (9-10) that will do anything to reclaim glory.
“I know the added incentive that comes from losing a championship series,” senior Jane Alexander said. “Their effort will be ramped up.”
But Cornell shouldn’t expect to host a complacent Harvard squad content with its Ivy victory last season, Alexander said. This team is not ready to return to second place.
“The seniors all have a very vivid memory of losing to them our sophomore year, and the emotion that came from that game has stuck with us through the years,” Alexander said. “We made sure we didn’t relent in the offseason, even after a successful season.”
The team’s offseason focus wasn’t on display in Tuesday’s home opener though, as it suffered the loss to Bryant. Brown, the reigning Ivy League Pitcher of the Year, struggled mightily for the first time this season, surrendering five runs in just over four innings of work. The last time Brown took a loss and gave up as many runs was a year ago against none other than the Big Red.
Despite the difficult afternoon for Brown, Alexander is confident that the team’s star pitcher will be able to continue carrying the team this weekend.
“She’s a fantastic pitcher and…every single one of us knows she will have a great outing this weekend,” Alexander said. “I’m more confident in that than anything in the world.”
Beyond Brown, the whole squad is working to rediscover its early groove in advance of Friday’s contests. After winning seven of eight games in California over spring break, the Crimson has dropped three of its last five contests since coming back east.
“Our team should have an immense amount of confidence because we have played and beaten some very good teams,” Brown said. “But on the flipside, we’ve had some adversity recently. This sport is very humbling. We need to play with confidence but also not take any team lightly. We set a high goal for our season and [Tuesday] proved it’s not going to be easy.”
Focus and desire shouldn’t be lacking Friday as Harvard faces the team that Brown considers to be its biggest rival.
“Any conference game has a lot of added emotion, but any game against Cornell has even more emotion,” Alexander said.
After seeing the squad in the Ivy Championship in back-to-back years, the Crimson won’t be fooled into complacency by the Big Red’s current 9-10 record. Cornell is 3-2 in its last five games as its bats have caught fire. The team is collectively hitting nearly .350 over the stretch.
Many of the Big Red’s struggles can be pinned on a pitching staff that has surrendered seven runs in six of its early-season contests. Without ace Elizabeth Dalrymple, who graduated last spring, to anchor the group, four pitchers have started games with limited success. No matter who is pitching Friday, Cornell will play tough at home. It has posted a 56-12 record in Ithaca over the last four years in advance of the 2012 home opener Friday.
After Friday’s doubleheader, Harvard will travel to Princeton (3-16) for two more games on the following day. And, while Brown admitted that the four-game weekends can be both physically and mentally exhausting, Alexander said that the adrenaline can be relied upon to keep the team performing at an elite level.
“The added emotion in the game helps you to not get fatigued,” Alexander said. “You are running on the emotion that goes into a conference game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The road can be a merciless, unforgiving place. The Harvard baseball team has found that out the hard way.
Before its win over Holy Cross, the Crimson had lost 10 of its last 11 games by fewer than two runs per game.
The Crimson (2-16) is coming off its second win of the season against the Crusaders. Harvard jumped out to an early 7-0 lead against Holy Cross (11-10), but found itself desperately clinging to a one run lead in the 9th until senior left-handed pitcher Brent Suter came in for the save.
This weekend, Harvard will meet Cornell (13-4-1) and Princeton (6-9) to open Ivy League play.
Both the Crimson and the Big Red—who Harvard will face on Saturday—struggled last season.
Last year, Harvard was 9-36 and at the bottom of the Rolfe division. The Crimson floundered both at home and away.
Similarly, Cornell was 10-30 overall, at the bottom of the Gehrig division, and struggled both at home and away.
And in their two meetings last season, the two clubs split decisions.
Harvard won the first game in dramatic fashion when then-junior designated hitter Marcus Way blasted a walk-off grand slam to shock the Big Red and take the game, 11-8.
The second game was all Cornell. The Crimson dug itself into a double-digit deficit in the second inning and was never able to reestablish itself. Big Red outfielder Brian Billigen had six at bats in the game with two homeruns and 4 RBIs to lead his team to an 18-5 win.
This season, Cornell looks to be a completely different team.
Breaking program records left and right, the Big Red cleaned up a three game series to end a successful spring break trip to Virginia. Cornell has its best record through 18 games since 1906 and is coming off four wins and a tie, all while being on the road. The Big Red is the only Ivy League team to head into the season opener with a winning record.
Senior outfielder Brian Billigen is the spark to the Cornell offense, batting .452 with 22 RBIs and four homeruns. The Pennsylvania native was named Ivy League Player of the Week on March 6 and has built a blistering 16-game hitting streak.
In contrast, Harvard has sputtered on the road to begin this season.
“[The win against Holy Cross] gives us a lot of momentum going into this weekend,” sophomore catcher Steven Dill said. “Getting that win was big for us. It gives us a lot of confidence, especially since we have been losing a lot of close games.”
Harvard will not be at home until April 4, when it hosts Boston College. It plays a total of 22 road games to start its season.
Although the Crimson has struggled, the return of Way from injury is sure to give the offense a boost.
“He’s a leader on the field. He has a great lefty stick for us,” Suter said. “He’s got a lot of power and is a good hitter all around.”
“It feels incredible to be back, especially because I didn’t know if I was going to be back until the end of the season,” Way added. “At this point, after getting injured and thinking that may be my season and career…I’m just happy to be out there.”
Way, the hero of the Crimson’s win against the Big Red last season, will be another offensive piece to a Harvard team that has been picking up its hitting.
Sophomore Carlton Bailey will be another player to watch this weekend in the Ivy League opener. Bailey leads the Crimson in batting average with .346 and is third in slugging percentage with .423.
Harvard will have to be stingy defensively against the red-hot Big Red offense.
“Fielding bunts...that’s kind of been our Achilles heel,” Suter said. “But we are getting better in that area. We’ve been fielding a lot of ground balls…working on turning two. We know if we want to win these games, we are going to have to get that double play going.”
Princeton is coming off its spring trip on a high note, winning its second series of the year. Alec Keller and Sam Mulroy have been dominant for the Tigers, hitting for a combined 31-for-73, with 28 RBIs, 18 runs, and four homeruns. Mulroy  is also sporting a nine-game hitting streak going into the weekend.
The Crimson dropped both matchups last season to Princeton.

Want to procrastinate online, but feel like you're wasting time?  The Harvard Resource Efficiency Program (REP)'s new blog is procrastination with a purpose.
Run by Natalie L. Jacewicz '13 and Isabella A. Wechsler '13, the blog is titled "There's a Hole in my Ozone and Other Awkward Problems". A compilation of various fun—and alarming—environmental facts and advocacy projects, the blog seeks to inform with humor. Comics, Victoria's Secret models, and funny YouTube videos are all included—there is even a reference to "Obe Wan Cannoli" and a video of talking fruits and vegetables.
Releasing factual but unintimidating environmental information is one of the blog's main goals. "We wanted to start up a blog that has very digestible stuff for people to read," Jacewicz said. "It's not that you have to become the equivalent of an environmental nun and give up everything. I think it can be intimidating to try to make your life greener, but little things can really make a difference."
The blog suggests that readers make small changes, including taking shorter showers and unplugging electronics when they are not in use. For advice like this, and more, check it out.

Every Friday, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
March 27, 1874: Humorous Articles
In reading over with care our college papers we find, as a general rule, that the various themes which meet our eyes apply directly or indirectly to college rules, college customs. This certainly ought to be expected, from the nature of these papers. I do not wish even to argue that this is not perfectly right; but I should like to call attention to the fact that a certain class of articles are not as a general rule popular, although their character might at first lead one to expect otherwise. I refer to humorous productions.
In the first place, a humorous article to be popular must of course have reference to some circumstances interesting to its readers. Now the leading newspapers of the present day are full of such articles to a greater or less extent. The writers of these articles, having greater experience than the contributors to college papers, are more capable of writing so as to please their readers; further, they have a greater field of operation, since they are not confined to productions which have their application in any one direction. Besides, newspaper contributors have a much less cultivated class of readers to address; as a general rule but few of the humorous writings of the daily papers are pleasing to the more cultivated classes of society. It is true such writing pleases the majority of people, but in college the greater number of the students make some pretension to culture, while outside it is the cultured who are in the minority. A humorous article to be worthy of the name must be well carried out, and unless those who attempt to write them have considerable experience they cannot expect to succeed.
March 31, 1911: How Harvard Men Serve
Believing that a resume of the number of Harvard men (graduates or former students) employed in important positions as public servants would be of general interest, The Crimson has compiled statistics dealing with this subject, which are given below. The phases of work investigated are: the Supreme Court, Congress, the Cabinet, the State Executives, and the consular and diplomatic service. The figures were taken from various sources, the main ones being the "World's Almanac" and the "Harvard University Directory."
In the Supreme Court, we find a Harvard graduate, Oliver Wendell Holmes '61. He was appointed in 1902. In the 61st Congress there are thirteen Harvard men: three of these are in the Senate. They are H. C. Lodge '71 of Massachusetts, J. Bourne ex-'77 of Oregon, and B. Penrose '81 of Pennsylvania. Of these, Mr. Lodge is perhaps the best known; he has served in the Senate since 1893 and has been on many important committees. Of the ten Harvard men in the House, the oldest is A. Douglas '74, and the most recent one is A. J. Peters '98. Four of these ten are from Massachusetts, three from Ohio, two from Illinois, and one from Wisconsin. It is worthy of note that over half of these men are not from the East, although Harvard is sometimes accused of being a strictly eastern college.
March 30, 1971: Eerie Echoless Room Torn Down with Lab
The only place at Harvard where you could hear yourself think has been destroyed. The acoustical laboratory and its ancchoic chamber, housed in its own building on Oxford St., were torn down last Thursday and Friday.
An anechoic chamber is a completely echoless room, acoustically isolated from the outside world. A person inside the room can hear his own heartbeat because there are no distracting outside noises or internal echoes.
The rare properties of the anechoic chamber are achieved with foot-thick concrete walls and special sound-absorbing wedges protruding into the chamber from the ceiling, walls and floor. A metal grate is suspended in the center of the chamber from which measurements and observations can be made.
Harvard's chamber was built by the Office of Naval Research in the late 1940's in connection with research by Frederick V. Hunt, then a professor of Physics. The ONR has supported numerous research projects at American universities since World War II. Hunt has now retired from Harvard and no longer needs the anechoic chamber.
March 25, 1977: First Adam, Then Eve
A quick look down the roster of some of the Radcliffe sports teams will tell you that something unusual is happening to women's sports at Harvard. Radcliffe basketball—only two upperclasswomen, senior Sue Williams and junior captain Katherine Fulton; swimming—a 21-woman team of which only two were upperclasswomen, senior captain Jane Hendricks and junior Sue Schwartz; field hockey—only three upper class members, senior captain Ann Dupuis, senior Karen Lindsley and junior captain-elect Lucy Wood; squash—three of the first seven squashers were freshwomen.
Where have all the older players gone? Does junior year bring arthritis or a bad back or varicose veins? It seems almost as if the player that survives through sheer endurance is made captain by virtue of her perserverance.
Well, maybe these "older" women can sense they aren't needed—or wanted. In the past couple of years, due to greatly increased funding, the efficient administration of 60 Boylston, and, perhaps most importantly, an active campaign by the admissions office to recruit and admit talented women athletes, the country club swimmer or girl's school hockey player has given way to the achievement oriented athlete—the female jock.

1. Harvard's inaugural sex week has just ended. Did you learn any new tricks, or maybe discover a new fetish? Or is your sex life still the last thing on your to-do list? If so, get out there this weekend and cross it off.
2. Reflect. Reading period begins in less than a month, so what have you done this semester? Have those grandiose goals been accomplished, or have they been thrown into your overflowing laundry basket?
3. President Obama is finally considering repealing tax benefits to oil companies. Why? He thinks their $4 billion—yes, billion—in annual profits justifies shifting these tax benefits into more research for cleaner alternative fuels.
4. Mitt Romney is rumored to gain the support of former president George H. W. Bush. As of late, Romney has been the expected Republican nominee, and even Rick Santorum can't help but admit that Romney will likely win the nomination.
5. The Pope and Fidel Castro walk into a bar…or, rather, a nursing home. This week, the Pope visited Castro, the octogenarian dictator of Cuba. Previously an atheist state, the country's relations with the Catholic Church have improved recently. Aside from church-state relations, rumor has it that conversation topics included staying in power—and, of course, Ke$ha.
6. Today in Washington, D.C., weGrow, dubbed the "Wal-Mart of weed," is opening up a store that offers just about everything needed to ease that chronic back pain. The shop's doors will open right as a city law permitting residents to purchase medical marijuana takes effect. Looks like the budget isn't the only thing going up in smoke.
7. "The Hunger Games" opened last weekend, destroying the box office competition and claiming the third highest opening of all time after "The Dark Knight" and the last "Harry Potter" film. Yeah, we were shocked too.
8. Now that we know "what's their name again?" and "haven't heard of him" are playing at Yardfest, what are your expectations for the festivities this year? One question that's been lurking in the background: What happened to the days of Sara Bareilles and Kid Cudi?

Ever find yourself looking for another way to channel your inner Lin, now that Ben & Jerry's "Taste the Lin-Sanity" flavor is out of the picture? Then check out Mr. Bartley's new burger, inspired by the now infamous Harvard grad.
After Ben & Jerry's public relations screw-up, many franchises have steered clear from celebrating Jeremy Lin's success with their products. But Bill Bartley, the owner's son, said the Harvard Square restaurant wasn't all too worried about pushing some people's buttons. "If you don't have a sense of humor, don't do it," he said. "I've made mistakes, but I've stuck with what I've done. Don't be a coward!"
Made with a simple yet satisfying mix of mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce, "The Jeremy Linsanity" burger is bound to convert even the most loyal LeBron junkie into a Knicks sympathizer, at the very least.
The burger has been featured on Bartley's menu for almost a month and has already started to draw crowds in. "For some reason, it's selling much, much better than 'The Republican,'" Bartley said.
So does this burger pass the taste test? With flying colors, according to employee Glynnis E. Cronin. "It's like eating a giant meatball," she said.

Next Monday at 5 p.m. is comedy hour, courtesy of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
According to the Boston Globe, members of the Lampoon have challenged the Harlem Globetrotters to a half-hour game of basketball on "a specially constructed court on Bow Street." If the Lampoon's track record against high-profile sports teams is any indication of how the alleged "humor masterminds" will fare, Monday's game is sure to be amusing. After suffering a crushing defeat against the Boston Bruins in a game of dodgeball last fall, we think it's safe to say that the only thing worse than the Lampoon's athleticism is the Lampoon's sense of humor. Best of luck to our friends down at 44 Bow Street!
