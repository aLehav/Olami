After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The program for “An Adult Evening With Shel Silverstein,” which ran until August 31, forewarned the audience that the “show is not suitable for children.” This might seem like a surprising disclaimer to accompany the work of an author best known for child-friendly poems, but the play took on a lot, from wild obscenities, to killing horses, matricide, infanticide, and being raped by a bunch of Koreans (we never find out why the Koreans are in the story specifically, but it gets dwelled on). The show was the last of Harvard-Radcliffe Summer Theater’s run, and was made up of a series of eight short scenes. Director Joey R. Longstreet ’16 and his cast of four were able to get plenty of subtle and over-zealous laughs with the material at hand, but the script itself left something to be desired.
Longstreet took a simple approach to the play as a whole. The set design by Samuel H. Rashba ’15 was all black and minimalistic; costume designer Olivia R. Miller ’16 dressed the actors simply, in black T-shirts and jeans. This gave the show a feel reminiscent of an underground improv show, which gave silverstein’s bizarre comedy some sense of genre.
The two acts each had four scenes—all containing classic strands of Silverstein—making for equally hilarious, odd, and awkward “adult” themes dropped into more or less innocent scenarios.
Instead of migrating completely from his beloved childish poems, Silverstein maintained the same narrative rhythm. Scenes go from the mundane to the hysterical at the drop of a hat. The same way that Silverstein lists gruesome, fake symptoms of a girl skipping school in his poetry for children, he likewise includes crass lines meant to make skin crawl in his adult play—the least offensive of which went something like “My dog will suck out your corneas, chew them up, and piss in your eye sockets.” These moments are meant to be funny, and many of them are, but many also felt forced. Some just felt like Shel Silverstein stories with a quick break for an outburst of obscenities, as in “No Dogs Allowed.” In that scene, a woman attempting to convince a country club waiter that her dog was her husband used foolish, childlike quips, but after a few minutes of this fun-for-the-whole-family hoax, the woman started cursing and hurling insults that were certainly for adult ears only. Even though the actors often succeeded in making those uninspired moments funny, the delivery of the bawdier scenes sometimes fell flat.
But those scenes that were successfully delivered were greeted by uproarious results: “Abandon All Hope” dealt with facing one’s fears, and “The Lifeboat is Sinking” featured a character trying to choose between murdering his mother and murdering his wife. The purely nonsensical “No Stronking” stood out because it was well-acted, simple, and full of the soon-to-be-learned symbolic moral. Anna G. Kelsey ’14 carried many of the scenes as she deftly put on the faces of a jealous wife, annoyed “valley girl” saleswoman, and gruff waitress.
Perhaps Longstreet’s best decision was his careful placement of signs throughout the production. Each scene featured its own sign with the scene’s title hung on the wall, and with each blackout the actors removed signs from the wall and took them through the door, dropping them on the ground. It appeared at first that these awkward piles of signs were all part of some technical difficulty, breaking the suspension of disbelief. In the final scene, however, the pile becomes bigger and bigger as a sign vendor throws dozens of signs on the ground, unable to find any sign adequate for an imploring woman’s needs. She wishes that she and her husband could have showed signs to one another, even acting out an entire conversation that could have saved her marriage. But, as she tells the vendor, the only sign that would’ve been useful to her was one that read, “It’s too late.” This scene consolidates the production’s central message: that signs not only serve to tempt readers into defying them, but can also oversimplify communication.
Silverstein’s adult stories don’t hold a candle to his “A Light in the Attic,” but Longstreet and his cast of players did an excellent job considering the material. HRDC’s production managed to drive home a powerful message, which was vital in terms of the cohesion of Silverstein’s diverse scenes.

Cherry A. Murray, Dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences since 2009, has been appointed to the U.S. Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, the U.S. Department of Energy announced in August.
In that role she, along with the 18 other scientists, engineers, and former government officials drawn from a variety of institutions, will advise U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz on issues ranging from research activities to national security policy.
Murray will sit on the science subcommittee of the board and will take part in quarterly meetings.
Although her new appointment represents an additional commitment outside her role as dean, Murray noted that her involvement in the board might foster connections that could benefit SEAS affiliates.
“I believe that serving on committees like this is beneficial to Harvard: to be engaged in Washington and to be able to connect SEAS faculty and students with people in government and at other important science and engineering institutions,” Murray wrote in an email.
This is not the first time Murray has been asked to serve in an advisory role in government. In June 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Murray to the national commission that investigated the BP oil spill to prevent future spills from offshore drilling. In January 2011, the seven-member committee released its final report to the President, and Murray’s involvement ended shortly thereafter.
Since 2008, Murray has also served as chair of the National Research Council’s Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences. Murray’s term as chair will end in January 2014, a change that Murray wrote “will free up a significant amount of time to undertake my new responsibilities to the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board.”
Murray, who received her B.S. and Ph.D. in physics from MIT, is also the John A. and Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Moniz, who began his term in May 2013 following the departure of former Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, praised the intellect and diversity of the newly appointed Secretary of Energy Advisory Board.
“These individuals represent some of the best and brightest in their respective fields and it is a great privilege that they have agreed to offer their expertise to the Energy Department,” Moniz said in a press release. “Having a diverse set of voices around the table will ensure that the Department has a strategic approach to the nation’s energy, science, nuclear security, and environmental stewardship future.”

Underneath cloudy skies with temperatures in the 60s on Sunday evening, students twirled cotton candy and jumped on a moon bounce at the College Events Board’s Welcome Back Event, which attendees said they enjoyed but thought was not well publicized.
The annual event in Tercentenary Theatre, this year called the Magic of Summer, was originally planned for Sept. 1, but was rescheduled to the later date. Many students said that despite the chilly weather, they still enjoyed participating in the activities.
The event included tire swings, hula hoops, a DJ playing music, as well as a dunk tank featuring House Masters and the Dean of Student Life, among others. Harvard University Dining Services provided dinner that included burgers, corn on the cob, and pasta salad.
“It’s pretty cool. There’s a lot of different games,” James E. Piltch ’17 said. “I like that [people] aged 18 to 22 can jump on the moon bounce.”
Other students said they enjoyed the music played by the DJ on the steps of Memorial Church.
“I like the music, and that they take requests,” Fatima M. Bishtawi ’17 said as she sat with her friend on the colorful chairs on the grass.
Deanna L. Emery ’17 also enjoyed the musical selection.
“The music makes it seem festive,” Emery said. “There’s a lot of activities.”
Although most attendees said that the event itself was fun, several also added that they were not aware of the event happening until Sunday evening. Annie Dai ’17 said she learned about the event through Facebook statuses that said that Annenberg was closed for dinner.
“It was a surprise to come down to dinner and find that there was no food,” Jude D. Russo ’16 said as he ate his dinner on Widener steps.
Kyle Gobrogge, a freshman proctor, was unaware of the event before it started on Sunday evening.
“I didn’t hear about it until I heard the music, and then I came to see what was going on,” Gobrogge said.
Others wondered if the event was not well publicized due to rescheduling.
“It was [well publicized] last week, but I forgot it was rescheduled to today,” Amanda J. N. Mozea ’17 said.
CEB co-chair Laura Hogikyan ’14 declined to comment on the event and did not respond to requests for comment on students’ claims that the event was poorly publicized.

Two Harvard scientists have built a transparent, artificial “muscle” that uses electrical charges carried by ions, not electrons, to produce sounds.
In a video press release, the two postdoctoral fellows—Christoph Keplinger, a fellow in chemistry and chemical biology, and Jeong-Yun Sun, a fellow at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—demonstrated how their speaker can play classical tunes.
Keplinger, who along with Sun was a co-lead author on an article on the project published last month in the journal Science, said that although the speaker is a modern technology, the inspiration for the research stemmed from basic biology.
The speaker is made of rubber membrane sandwiched between layers of gel. Exploring the research field of stretchable electronics, the scientists aimed to overcome some of the disadvantages of their chosen technology, ionic conductors.
“People have used ionics first, and then because of semiconductors and the computer, people began to use electronics,” Sun said. “Using soft actuators, we are going back to ionics again, or iontronics.”
In a related review also published in Science, John A. Rogers, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote that these actuator technologies are “promising and remarkably simple.”
Philipp J. M. Rothemund, a SEAS research assistant who worked with Keplinger and Sun on the project, said that the speaker has much promise for future application.
“We have shown two things: it is highly transparent and it is very fast, meaning we can make the lens itself the electronic part,” Rothemund said. “We can make the car window or the front of your iPhone a loudspeaker.”
Beyond novel applications for entertainment, the invention may eventually be used to save human lives.
Keplinger said that ionic conductors are “easily made biocompatible,” meaning they can be integrated into a living system.
The speaker, he said, provides a foundation for future developments in intervention surgery.
“The artificial muscle actually outperforms natural muscles,” Keplinger said. “They are stronger, faster, and more efficient.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite concerns that the setup of newly renovated Old Quincy, with its many single and double bedrooms without private common rooms, would prevent residents from successfully hosting parties in their rooms, students still managed to socialize this past weekend.
The building, now renamed Stone Hall, comprises a mixture of singles and doubles with shared cluster common rooms, and suites with private common rooms. During last spring’s housing lottery, rising juniors and seniors generally shirked Old Quincy, citing among their reasons for doing so the perception that the common spaces in the dorm would not allow students to host parties.
But students living in Stone Hall said that residents were able to successfully host gatherings the first weekend back.
Adam O. Brodheim ’16, who lives in a suite with three doubles and a private common room, said he and his roommates hosted a party Saturday night for freshmen in his former entryway.
“It’s a nice-sized common room for a party,” Brodheim said. “We’re very happy with it.”
Herby R. Raymond ’16, who co-hosted the party with Brodheim in his own two-bedroom suite, said that on Saturday his private common room managed to fit up to 40 people at once.
Other Stone Hall residents reported hearing multiple people hosting gatherings throughout the weekend. Abel Deandreis Colina ’16 described the number of parties as “noticeable.”
Students who occupy the single and double bedrooms without private common rooms said that while they generally liked their rooms, the setup was not ideal for hosting parties in traditional Harvard style.
“Doubles and singles are not big enough for parties,” said Tony Khikmatov ’16, a Stone Hall resident. “The common rooms not in suites are small.”
Yasmin Issari ’16, who lives in a double bedroom in Stone Hall without a private common room, called Stone Hall a “beautiful building” and praised its common spaces, but spoke of the rooms themselves with less enthusiasm.
“When I think of how awesome Quincy is, I don’t think of my room,” Issari said.
Stone Hall is the first completed product of House Renewal, Harvard’s ambitious, more than $1 billion plan to eventually renovate all 12 upperclassman Houses. Administrators have called Old Quincy a “test project” for the House Renewal process.
Leverett’s McKinlock Hall is currently undergoing construction and is slated for completion by next fall. Construction on Dunster, which will be the first full House to undergo renovation, will start in 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After holding a 1-0 lead for the majority of Sunday afternoon’s game against Davidson, the Harvard men’s soccer team let its second game of the season slip away with just over two minutes left on the clock, losing 2-1.
Though the Wildcats (2-0-1) dominated the possession game early in the first half, the Crimson (0-2) was able to hold Davidson off, and the game went to halftime tied, 0-0.
Harvard picked up its speed of play in the the attacking third in the second half and had a number of close chances before netting its first goal of the season just over an hour into the game.
In his second game in the Crimson uniform, freshman forward Ashi Geberkidane capitalized on a towering cross from senior midfielder William Giahos to put Harvard on the board.
“Giahos was everything,” Geberkidane said. “We had the build up all the way from the back and then straight up to Giahos. Giahos took a great touch out wide and crossed it in. All I had to do was be there; right moment, right time.”
But the Crimson’s lead would not last.
Twelve minutes later, Wildcat senior defender Ryan Malden responded with a long shot that barely snuck past Harvard senior goalkeeper Brett Conrad. Harvard took only one more shot before Davidson freshman forward Max Pragnell broke away at the top of the box and directed the ball low and hard into the left corner of the net.
“I’m certainly proud of the team, but it was a bummer,” Geberkidane said. “I thought we had it. It was a disappointing goal but we’ll come out tomorrow and work hard and be out there again next week.”
With seconds on the clock, Crimson captain Ross Friedman came close to tying it up with a header from the left side, but Wildcat goalkeeper Andrew Kenneson made his third save of the night and clinched the win for his squad.
Though Harvard was unable to win, the Crimson improved upon its offensive performance from its season opener Friday, when Iona shut out Harvard in a 3-0 win at Soldiers Field.
“I thought we had more energy from the beginning to the end of the game,” Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We created a lot of chances. I think we have to finish our chances a little cleaner, but I think we had a lot of energy on both the defending side and the attacking side. They fought from the beginning to the end and that is going to be something we can build on.”
After failing to break through Davidson’s defense in the first half, Harvard looked to take advantage of space off the ball in the second.
The Crimson took 16 shots—seven more than in its previous game—but was unable to capitalize on seven corner kicks.
“[Junior forward] Hiroki [Kobayashi] was playing very well with a lot of energy and making good runs in and causing problems,” Lehrer said. “We wanted him to get behind the other team, and we thought they did a good job of backing up and taking care of the space behind him. When they didn’t, we tried to take advantage of that.”
Conrad spent all 90 minutes in goal for Harvard for the second straight game and made three saves while allowing two goals.
The Wildcats split the goalkeeping responsibilities between sophomore Matt Pacifici—who played the first 60 minutes—and Kenneson. Pacifici made seven saves and picked up his second win of the season.
Though Davidson committed 12 fouls to Harvard’s 10, the Crimson picked up two yellow cards in the second period.
In his second game at the helm, Lehrer—hired after the 2012 season—was impressed with the performance of his freshman class.
Out of the seven freshmen on the roster, six have seen playing time in the first two games. Geberkidane leads the team with three shots on goal.
“The freshmen have been a huge addition to the program,” Lehrer said. “They’ve hit the ground running and integrated into the team with the upperclassmen. The seniors brought them in the fold and made them welcome, and they are a very strong group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, the Harvard women’s volleyball team struggled to find its footing in non-conference play to open the year. In 2012, the team arrived in Hanover for its first Ivy League game, a loss at the hands of Dartmouth, with eight losses and just two wins under its belt.
This year, however, a different storyline has emerged for the Crimson.
In the team’s opening weekend, young starters and experienced upperclassmen worked through first set losses to top Holy Cross, 3-2, on Friday, and Hofstra, 3-1, the next night at the Malkin Athletic Center during the eighth annual Harvard Invitational.
Despite the graduation of Taylor Docter ’13 and Beth Kinsella ’13, anchors of last season’s team, Harvard (2-0) was able to hold an edge in hitting percentage through the whole weekend.
“We really just hit our stride and started playing our own system,” co-captain libero Natalie Doyle said. “Everybody calmed down and played relaxed and did their jobs. When everybody does their jobs, our system works, and we came out with the win.”
The Crimson starts the season with a 2-0 record for the first time since 2009.
HARVARD 3, HOFSTRA 1
It was a banner night for sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte who finished the evening with 12 of 17 total blocks. Holte eclipsed her previous career high of nine blocks, set against Dartmouth in October 2012.
Junior Kristen Casey and sophomore Kathleen Wallace provided power at the attack, together notching 23 of the team’s 51 kills through four sets. Holte was third in kills with nine.
The first set was hotly contested, after Harvard saw a seven-point lead erased by a 10-3 Hofstra scoring spree. The Pride and Crimson traded points, with Hofstra taking the set, 28-26.
The second set was equally tight, with neither team holding a lead of greater than two points. A final kill by Holte gave the Crimson the set, 25-23.
The third and fourth sets also went to Harvard, as the Crimson offense hit at or above .125 for both sets to end the tournament in Harvard’s favor and prevent a fifth set.
HARVARD 3, HOLY CROSS 2
It was down to the wire as Holy Cross pushed Harvard to five sets in the Crimson’s season opener. The Crusaders set forth a defensive effort that saw freshman libero Emily Popp tally 31 digs against Harvard’s attacking unit.
“The Holy Cross defensive team was very good,” Crimson coach Jen Weiss said. “It’s the best it’s been in a while, so hats off to them playing really scrappy.”
Harvard last faced Holy Cross in a 3-1 win last season at home. This year, the win came less easily.
Junior Caroline Walters led the Crimson in kills with 11. Walters and sophomore Jennifer Shults also played the net effectively with six and seven blocks, respectively.
“I think we finally got our system in place,” Weiss said “That was our first time out to play; [Holy Cross had] already played. We just did a really good job in trying to stay disciplined.”
Freshmen Corinne Bain and Grace Weghorst were the two rookies to take the court on Friday night. Bain started at setter, Kinsella’s old position, while Weghorst was subbed in at outside hitter.
“The freshmen have been a great addition,” Weiss said. “They’ve made our practices a lot more physical and challenging. Corinne and Grace got to get out on the court, and they did a nice job. That was our expectation, and we welcome them. They’ve got a long career ahead of them.”
Bain made her debut with a double-double of 10 kills and a team-high 31 assists. Weghorst provided the second-most attacks on the team, 28 for the night.
“We’ve got a really deep team, and everyone is still working for spots,” Doyle said. “The freshmen are doing amazing in practice and absolutely killing it on the court. Corinne’s serve was monster today, and Grace really got up there. She’s got insane hops.”
The game was the first at Harvard, not just for the five freshmen on the team, but also for the Crimson’s two new assistant coaches, Arturo Rivera and Jeffrey Aucoin.
