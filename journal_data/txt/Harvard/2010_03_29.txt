After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Never a stranger to controversy, Harvard’s conservative publication, The Harvard Salient, has once again caused a minor furor on campus. A Mar. 13 feature by Patrick T. Brennan ’11 has many students up in arms about the author’s apparent insensitivity toward certain racial and cultural groups, and dismissal of the ethnic-studies program at Harvard. When evaluating the purpose of a liberal-arts education, we think that fields such as ethnic studies provide critical opportunities for students to expand their views on the world; as such, ethnic studies has every right to exist as part of the curriculum that Harvard students may elect to study.
Programs like ethnic studies are products of a progressive educational philosophy, which recognizes that, as our understanding of the world around us changes over time, so should the ways in which we define a good education.
Harvard is an old institution, and there is certainly value in maintaining tradition and carefully considering which fields are legitimately worthy of study. However, there is no reason to impose academic imperialism on subjects by evaluating certain “classic” fields of study as fundamentally more deserving of attention than others. Subjects like rhetoric, logic, and astronomy may have been the foundations of education in the classical world, but we are now two thousand years removed from the fall of Rome, and the academic occupations of modern scholars should necessarily be different from those of the ancients.
In addition to resisting academic chauvinism that dictates the worthiness of academic subjects, it is also necessary to restrain from politicizing academic subjects and dismissing them based on such unsubstantiated and reductive labels. It is factually incorrect and morally dangerous to arbitrarily assign a political tag to a field of study—something that is often done by those advocating for more of an emphasis on “classical” subjects. There is simply no connection between a “liberal” approach to education and “liberal” national politics. Recognizing the contributions and historical significance of multiple cultures and civilizations is a matter of intellectual open-mindedness, not a left-wing conspiracy to diminish the importance of the white Anglo-Saxons. Boxing certain fields into politically liberal and politically conservative categories (e.g. ethnic studies versus classics) is tremendously detrimental to the ideal goal of having both intellectual and political diversity in all academic areas.
What students learn in college does not suddenly cease to be important upon graduation. Those who question the necessity of a field like ethnic studies need only look at the rapid pace of economic globalization and the constant movement of groups of people within the U.S. and around the world to see that the study of ethnicity, as well as interracial and intercultural interaction, is more pertinent than ever.
Moreover, the use of interdisciplinary approaches is one of the greatest driving forces of academia and of innovation in the world at large, and colleges should make an effort to prepare students appropriately. Fields like ethnic studies or women, gender, and sexuality are worthwhile academic pursuits because they train students to utilize a wide range of methods when engaging in intellectual inquiry. Even relatively “traditional” methods-based disciplines are not as pure and unified as they are frequently made out to be. Within a department like history, scholars can approach the past with an eye toward intellectual developments, cultural and social change, or economic and financial trends. Some of the criticism relating to the malleable nature of subjects like ethnic studies versus those like history is therefore unwarranted and inaccurate.
The establishment of ethnic studies as a secondary field introduces a new way of thinking. It serves as a counterweight to the kind of academic chauvinism that puts forth the risky proposition that some degrees are more important than others. An avid student of the Eurocentric, so-called classical model of Western education would be wildly ill-equipped to understand the broad, socio-cultural forces that shape current events in the national and international spheres. Purposely ignoring the experiences of non-Western peoples would be like looking at the world with one eye closed—with a massive blind spot and no depth perception at all.
In general, expanding the curriculum in response to student demand is a positive thing. Some of the more recent concentration fields, such as neurobiology and human evolutionary biology, were reactions to calls for new ways to organize the study of biological sciences. Similarly, the ethnic studies secondary field program likely resulted at least in part from the advocacy of students who contended that it would fill a gap in the current academic program at Harvard. These changes and additions represent admirable efforts to make academic study more comprehensive and reflective of student interest.
One of the stated goals of the ethnic studies secondary field at Harvard is to “focus on the broad canvas of the human experience.” Surely, there cannot be a more appropriate statement of what it truly means to pursue a liberal-arts education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As one of many the freshmen who eagerly awaited Housing Day, I was slightly overwhelmed by the impassioned spirit that each House displayed. Upon seeing the Mather gorilla ascend the stage without hesitation during my Ec 10 lecture, I began to question the extent to which House spirit influences the student body, and what purpose it could really serve. Rallying House spirit is a fine way to build general excitement for Housing Day. However, pre-Housing Day rabidity hurts the possibility of a freshman being happy with their Housing assignment. Therefore, instead of expending energy on the days leading up to Housing Day, Houses should simply reserve their spirit for the day itself.
The videos, dancing mascots, matching t-shirts, and general paraphernalia in which House members bedeck themselves are wonderful ways to promote solidarity within the Houses. They give newly sorted freshmen a reason to take pride in their homes for the following three years, and they cultivate an individual personality for each of the 12 Houses, giving freshmen a unique House-wide culture to which to look forward.
But the best way to galvanize future House residents is to express House pride during and after Housing Day—not before. As a way of promoting Housing Day itself, active House spirit works well. Yet as a plug for the individual Houses, it unnecessarily builds freshmen hopes about a situation they cannot control. Since many are randomly slotted into Eliot or Cabot, which lie at opposite ends of FlyByBlog’s rankings as well as opposite ends of campus, ranking Houses based on their projected personalities can set up unfair expectations and, worse, can ultimately disappoint.
Therefore, until Housing Day, getting students to favor certain Houses over others serves no purpose as, in the end, they will be forced to accept and make do with whichever House they are assigned. Once freshmen know where they will live for the rest of their college careers, however, House unity can begin to make a difference in how they view their assignments. Often, students seem to be happiest in the Houses where they least expected to be, but no matter how many times proctors and peer advising fellows repeat this statement, their efforts are undermined by the House one-upmanship that goes on over e-mail lists.
Granted, House spirit mongering is largely harmless, serving largely to add to existing reputations. For example, before I stepped inside Adams House for the first time, enough upperclassmen had either raved or warned me about its supposed “artsiness” that I thought I had an idea of what to expect from the residents. Students’ perceptions of each House are fairly set based on what they hear from sophomore, juniors, and seniors; existing promotional videos or performances only add to a House’s standing as “crazy,” “artsy,” or “elitist.” As long as Houses keep negative impressions from creeping in, some of these preconceived notions, however stereotypical, serve well in bolstering House pride and celebrating tradition.
As underscored by countless administrators in their attempt to reassure nervous freshmen, the housing lottery is indeed random. House spirit may make students want some Houses over others, setting up expectations while knowing full well that they may not be fulfilled. Nothing can be done about the assignments, however hard we may pray to the river gods. Call me a river atheist; I got Pfoho. But who’s complaining?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Extremism occurs among the political left and the political right.  But some would have you think that violent extremists are all conservatives.
I know to take death threats seriously.  My home was under special police watch during part of my 14 years as a U.S. Congressman.  Eventually, a man went to prison for threatening to kill and dismember me because I opposed the legalization of marijuana.
However, real threats should not be conflated with harassment.  Joining them into a combined number is a dishonest political effort to sway public opinion by making the number of threats seem larger.  Likewise, it’s wrong to give unbalanced attention to threats against Democrats with little regard to threats against Republicans.
After the health care vote, Democratic lawmakers Bart Stupak of Michigan, Louise Slaughter of New York, and Tom Perriello of Virginia reported threats.  Rep. Betsy Markey (D-CO) asked for police to watch her home.  Republican leaders like House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) immediately condemned these threats, as did Tea Party groups.
Politico reported, “There hasn’t been any hard evidence . . . but Democrats have tried to draw the link between the harassment and the sometimes-inflammatory rhetoric that tea partiers and Republicans deployed in opposing the health care overhaul.”
Lack of evidence did not stop some from depicting political opponents as dangerous.
Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) accused protesters of “stoking the flames” of violence.  Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) accused Republicans of “aiding and abetting . . . terrorism.”  President Obama used the claims for a fundraising appeal.
But where was their outrage about threats to kill Sen. Jim Bunning (R-KY) only three weeks prior?  Bunning was menaced for filibustering against $13 billion in deficit spending to expand unemployment benefits.  And how about House Republican Whip Eric Cantor (R-VA), who opposed the health-care bill?  When a bullet was fired into his office window, Cantor reported it to the police—not the media—to avoid inciting violence.
Regardless of how extreme the new health-care law may be, it’s wrong to threaten or commit acts of violence over it.  Selective condemnation of violence is also wrong and should not be used to malign people for partisan purposes.
Overheated rhetoric also knows no political bounds.  In an MSNBC discussion of civility and threats in politics, progressive host Ed Schultz didn’t like it when I mentioned his February statement about former Vice President Dick Cheney’s heart, “We ought to rip it out and kick it around and stuff it back in him.”  Ed now defends his words as a metaphor about heart transplants and who receives health care.  But if the left feels free to use such figures of speech, why do they condemn the language of the right?
From representing Oklahoma City in Congress, I know that Timothy McVeigh’s deadly federal-building bombing was not the act of a mainstream political activist.  Those on the left tend to overlook another mass murderer, the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, who sent 16 deadly package bombs to advance his extreme environmentalist throwback agenda.  They also ignore the violent trashing of Seattle by socialist-leaning anarchists.
Republican and Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kerns reported multiple death threats from homosexual activists because she criticized their lifestyle.  In California, many Proposition 8 supporters reported similar threats.  But gay rights activists mourned the murder of a gay leader—San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk—by a fellow Democrat.
Many more examples exist.  Violence against political figures is not new and the motives are diverse.  I’ll always remember seeing President John F. Kennedy in person a few hours before he was shot by a communist sympathizer in 1963.  One survey counted that nine U.S. presidents have been attacked (four killed), as have three presidential candidates, seven U.S. Senators, nine congressmen, eight governors, 11 mayors, and 17 state legislators.
The point is simple:  Extremism and violence historically exist on both ends of the political spectrum.  Nobody should seek to advance their politics—as we are witnessing now—by pretending that menacing fanatics are all at one end of the political spectrum.  Nor should occasional use of common metaphors (“hit list,” “targeting” politicians for defeat, etc.) be mistaken as threatening.
Obviously, many Americans are angry.  But anger need not lead to violence.  Those who mock groups like Tea Party protestors are often trying to provoke them—a provocation that must be resisted.
Like millions of Americans, I see the new health-care law as a danger to civil liberties, an overreach of federal constitutional authority, a job-killing mandate, and a step toward bankrupting America.  Most recent polls show that a majority of people oppose the measure.
The American way to change this is through quiet revolutions known as elections.  The controversy should be resolved in the political process.  Overheated rhetoric is protected as free speech.  But it’s over the line and wrong to suggest that either major party favors the use of violence instead.

All too often, a great idea for an application can’t shake the burden of an awful name. The company SimulScribe, for instance, which converted voicemail messages into emails, was doing a steady business, but the founders felt their name was holding them back. People couldn’t remember it or even spell it, which made it impossible for them to sign up online. When co-founder James Siminoff heard a friend say he was tired of “phone tag” after a series of missed messages, Siminoff called his chief marketing officer at 6:30 a.m. and tried to buy the domain PhoneTag.com. It was already taken, so the company spent $30,000 to buy the rights from the previous owner. Though pricy, the rebranding may have paid off: Despite charging users, PhoneTag continues to hold its own, even against free competitor Google Voice.
Names are a crucial factor in the success of any company, yet far too often startup software companies give themselves or their products hastily picked names that don’t do them justice. Web 2.0 companies in particular have silly, nonsensical-sounding names with doubled o’s and e’s that are either made up or taken from a foreign language. No one wants to do business with a company named Oyogi or Qoop. Bad names are hardly a new phenomenon, but product names have likely taken a turn for the worse in the information age because computer scientists tend to be really bad at naming things.
Scientists in most other fields have come up with standards to keep names simple and professional-sounding. Biologists give species Latin names, physicists name things after famous physicists, while chemists have schemes to generate names that are highly descriptive. But more often than not, names in the world of software tend to involve nerdy references, inside jokes, and, most commonly, puns. If a byte is eight bits, what do you call four bits? A nybble. Are you laughing yet?
Open source software, a set of applications built by programmers for programmers, is particularly plagued by an epidemic of bizarre and even offensive names. The most popular image-editing program for Unix is called the GIMP, which purports to be an acronym, but it is either a pejorative term for a disabled person or a submissive sexual role in BDSM (à la “Pulp Fiction”). The popular audio compression codec Ogg Vorbis sounds like it was named after a troll in the Harry Potter series, and the Linux installer Kororaa, whose name is based on the Maori word for little penguin, is downright unpronounceable.
The developers of Ubuntu, the popular flavor of Linux that is installed on the computers in the Science Center, showed questionable judgment by picking a name that is a pretentious reference to an African philosophy. But to make matters worse, Ubuntu developers mucked up their clever release dating system with a completely ludicrous set of nicknames. Each release of Ubuntu is dated by the year and the month—9.10, for instance, came out last October—but the numbers are also paired with an alliterative combination of an obscure adjective and a rare animal, yielding such gems as Edgy Eft, Intrepid Ibex, and Jaunty Jackalope. It makes pompous names like Mac OS X Snow Leopard seem almost reasonable by comparison.
In the pantheon of bad programmer names, recursive acronyms must sit near the top. It’s a perverse concept popular with MIT alums in which one of the letters in the acronym stands for the acronym itself. A relatively benign example is the web scripting language PHP, which stands for PHP: Hyptertext Preprocessor. Older, stranger examples are the free operating system GNU (GNU’s not Unix) and related spinoffs: Cygnus (Cygnus—Your GNU Support), a now-defunct company which provided support for free software, and Wine (Wine is Not an Emulator), software which helps run windows applications on Unix.
The strangest names seem relegated to products only other programmers use, so it may be that programmers are smart enough to pick good names when they know it matters. More likely, names help determine the success of a brand, and bad names just don’t make the cut.
One big exception, as it is in many things, is Google. The name comes from a deliberate misspelling of googol, an obscure term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes. Google adheres to several tricks in the bad name playbook by combining an obscure, nerdy reference with a dorky misspelling. Yet the name has become one of the company’s biggest assets, and is even included in the OED as a verb.
Google may be the exception that proves the rule. While Google could overcome its quirky name and lack of advertising by providing the best product in the industry, many recent web startups don’t have quite so much to offer. Hopefully the next generation of entrepreneurs will realize that a good, sturdy name can make a huge difference for their product. If anything, there will be a lot fewer superfluous o’s and e’s cluttering up the internet.

“All you people, can’t you see, can’t you see...” a group of high school students sang to the tune of the Backstreet Boys’ “Larger Than Life” yesterday afternoon to a crowd gathered on Cambridge Common. “...How much we love clean electricity. Every time you say, we won’t pass your bill, that is a tree you’re gonna kill.”
The four juniors from Northampton High School slept in tents on Cambridge Common last night as part of The Leadership Campaign, organized by the statewide organization Students for a Just and Stable Future. The campaign is calling for 100 percent clean energy in Massachusetts by 2020.
The high school students joined nearly 100 allies, including students from colleges such as Amherst, Boston College, and Northeastern, to lobby for the passage of a bill in the Mass. State House and State Senate that would create a task force to form recommendations for the achievement of their energy goals.
The event included a rally with speeches by student leaders, members of the Cambridge City Council, and Institute of Politics Visiting Fellow and former Seattle Mayor Greg J. Nickels, who led the coalition encouraging mayors to sign on to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol.
“This movement is our revolution,” Cambridge City Council Member Leland Cheung said of his support for environmental causes. “When people say the time isn’t right, that’s complete and utter bullshit.”
This morning the students will march to the Mass. State House to lobby for the bill’s passage. According to Dominique M. McCadden, a Northeastern undergraduate and SJSF’s statewide campaign coordinator, the group hopes that last night’s event and a final sleep-out on Boston Common will encourage legislators to pass the bill by Earth Day on April 22, the day after the final sleep-out.
Jonathan M.L. Rosenthal ’13, SJSF’s statewide communications coordinator, said that the organizers wanted to keep this sleep-out “completely legal,” unlike their previous events held last semester on Boston Common, which has a strict curfew. Rosenthal said that when the organizers realized that Cambridge Common also has a curfew they asked the City Council to grant an exemption.
Although the city was unable to grant the permit on such a short notice, Cheung will introduce a bill to the City Council next week that will allow it to grant exemptions more easily. City Councillor Craig A. Kelley even slept out with the group last night because of the “symbolic” power of the night.
SJSF founder Craig S. Altemose, a student at the Kennedy School and the Law School, said before the event that the Cambridge Police were “just here to protect us.” In fact, the Cambridge Police seemed supportive of the group’s peaceful protest.
“You call that noise?” the police broadcasted from their car as the crowd cheered. “They want to hear you in Central Square. Let’s hear some noise!”

In the midst of March Madness, members of the Harvard community played in a basketball tournament of their own yesterday afternoon, competing for glory on the court and raising money to support cancer research.
Twenty-one teams participated in the 3 on 3 tournament, which was organized by the Harvard Cancer Society and brought in over $300 for the Jimmy Fund, a Boston-based charity that supports cancer research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Brian L. Butler ’12, co-chair of the Hoops Against Cancer program within HCS, said that he and co-chair Christopher J. Guenard ’12 chose to work with the Jimmy Fund to support a local organization that has made a large impact in promoting pediatric cancer research.
“[The Jimmy Fund] has been very receptive,” Guenard said. “They gave us a lot of stuff to use, and that is something we like to continue relationships with.”
Butler and Guenard said that holding a basketball tournament raised awareness of the importance of cancer research among many people who were not familiar with HCS’s mission. Though the tournament was a relatively small fundraiser compared to Relay for Life, which raised over $125,000 last year, Guenard said that it was effective in broadening support for cancer research activities.
“It’s a core group of people who do stuff like Relay for Life,” Guenard said, “so [the basketball tournament] is a good way to outreach to a different group of people.”
The teams started off in round-robin play and were seeded in a single-elimination tournament bracket from the results of the round-robin. The team of Collier W. Winters ’11, Collin T. Zych ’11, and Dexter B. Monroe ’13 took home first place and a prize of three iPods.
Participants said they enjoyed spending the afternoon playing basketball while also showing their support for cancer research.
“We just thought it was a great cause,” said Douglas W. Miller ’10, a member of the men’s varsity basketball team. “Some of my friends just wanted to have fun together and just relax and play some pick-up basketball.”

Assistant Director of the Core Program Charles G. Ruberto ’88, the administration’s primary contact for students seeking information about the Core and for faculty teaching Core courses, announced in an e-mail Friday that he will be leaving for a new position outside Harvard.
Following the merger of the Core and General Education offices this past summer, Ruberto, who had held his post since 2005, took on some additional roles related to General Education.
“All administrative functions related to the Core have been part of the Gen Ed office since last July, and most of the work of supporting courses has been merged into one set of processes,” wrote Associate Dean of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen in an e-mail.
Susan W. Lewis, who had been director of the Core Program, retired last June.
Professor of Science Robert P. Kirshner ’70 wrote in an e-mail that he worked with Ruberto to find support staff for his courses this year.
“As you know, the size of a class is unknown until study cards are filed, so there’s a delicate balance to be struck between signing up sufficient staff of TFs and making sure you don’t waste money by having too many,” he wrote. “He seemed to understand all sides of this and made good choices about how many TFs to commit.”
Kenen wrote that in the coming year most Core courses will be “revised and submitted for Gen Ed, with only a handful remaining solely in the Core program.”
She added that about half of the class of 2012 has switched to General Education, as have a several students in the class of 2011.
“We expect those numbers to increase, so the amount of work that is specific to the Core has already been dramatically reduced and will continue to decrease,” she wrote.
Students with Core questions can now contact Kenen or Associate Director of the Program in General Education Anne Marie E. Calareso, or e-mail core@fas.harvard.edu.
“We’ll continue to work with students on all of those issues in order to ensure that all students under the Core program are able to meet those requirements in order to graduate,” she wrote.

A pilot program to fund medium-sized parties in the Houses, including those where alcohol is served, earned the approval of the Undergraduate Council yesterday night.
After more than a year of refinement and administrative review, the Student Initiated Programs fund will launch in Pforzheimer and Quincy Houses—whose House Masters agreed to the pilot program—granting a maximum of $423.50 to an approved party in each of the two Houses later this semester. The Houses will match the UC funds.
Spearheaded by the UC Student Initiatives Committee, the program began accepting applications last Friday from residents of the participating Houses, and will continue to do so until this Friday. Following a review by SIC and the House Masters, selected events will occur during the weekend of April 9 or April 16.
“It’ll be a joint decision between the House Masters and the Student Initiatives Committee,” SIC chair Mallika Khandelwal ’11 said of who will receive the funds. “I think at the end, it’ll depend upon the value that this event will provide to student life and particularly House life.”
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that the two pilot parties will be medium-sized events—larger than the private dorm room parties which are funded by the DAPA grants that the UC supports, but smaller than dining hall parties. Future SIP events may be larger in size, Hysen said.
In order to keep to a medium size, Hysen said that while the parties must be open to the public, organizers cannot use public channels of communication—postering, e-mails to House lists, or public Facebook postings—to advertise their parties.
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke said yesterday that the dining hall, Junior Common Room, and Masters’ residence had been designated as appropriate-sized venues for the parties.
According to Hysen, the UC plans to have the program fund one or two events in every House per year beginning next fall,
“A few of the Masters wanted to see how the pilot works before committing themselves,” he said, “but none of the Masters were entirely opposed to the idea.”
A portion of the funds may be used to purchase alcohol. In this case, the SIP money will also be used to pay for supervision by two Beverage Authorization Team members and a Harvard University Police Department detail, which Gehrke said “gives everybody the assurance that these events are going to be safe.”
The UC party grants program—which disbursed $1,750 per week to private student parties for four years before it was disbanded by then-Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam in 2007—was condemned for facilitating underage alcohol consumption.
But the current pilot has been approved by both Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
During yesterday’s meeting, the UC also approved plans to distribute free t-shirts in the dining halls on Thursday night to drum up spirit for the April 3 lacrosse game against Duke and passed the first of two election reform acts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Business School Student Association decided Wednesday to deny a request to include the signing of a business management ethics oath during this year’s Class Day festivities.
“Patrick [S. Chun ’04] and I are very strong advocates of an oath for professionalism in general,” said M. Scott Daubin, co-president of the Student Association along with Chun. “But we are weighing more than just our personal likes and dislikes.”
The MBA oath—a voluntary pledge that aims to “professionalize” business management in light of the recent financial crisis and criminal activities of business executives by creating a shared code of ethics similar to the Hippocratic Oath—was inspired by a Harvard Business Review article published in October 2008 that laid out a set of standardized values for business managers.
The oath garnered significant media attention upon its creation and has since continued to be featured in discussions of business education.
Last spring, several Business School students developed a version of this oath for the MBA Class of 2009 to sign and organized a ceremony at Class Day with the special permission of last year’s Student Association presidents. A total of 60 percent of the MBA Class of 2009 signed the oath­­—half of whom signed on Class Day.
Chun and Daubin, who are both second year MBA students, cited administrative policy and concerns over inciting controversy during Commencement celebrations as reasons for declining the request for an oath-signing ceremony this year.
According to Business School policy, no student groups other than the Student Association are permitted to hold events on Class Day.
Moreover, The MBA Oath Leadership Team—a group of Business School students who have spearheaded efforts to disseminate the ethics oath—is not an official student group, which presents another barrier to participating in Class Day ceremonies. Daubin said that the inclusion of the oath signing would amount to an “explicit endorsement” of the organization promoting the MBA oath by the Business School.
In addition, there exists a “strong vocal minority” at the Business School that opposes the oath, Chun said.
A poll taken by The Harbus—the Business School’s student newspaper—in September showed that 59 percent of polled members of the Class of 2010 did not plan on signing the oath.
“We wouldn’t want to ruin [that minority’s] Class Day,” Chun said. “We think that goes against the idea of Class Day, and we have to do what is in the benefit of the whole student body.”
Andrew N. Sridhar, a second year MBA student who wrote an editorial critiquing the MBA oath in The Harbus, noted that the wording of the oath incorporated elements that could be construed to further a liberal political agenda—such as a promise “to create sustainable economic, social, and environmental prosperity worldwide.”
Members of The MBA Oath Leadership Team said that the language of the oath has been modified but remains similar to last year’s version.
The Business School administration has final say over Class Day activities and could overturn the Student Association’s decision. The Oath Team plans to launch a marketing campaign in the hopes of rallying enough support among the student body to earn the oath ceremony a spot at Class Day, said Lawrence M. Estrada, a second year MBA student and a member of the  Team.
At least 10 business schools worldwide have adopted the MBA oath. Current business practitioners can also sign the Management Oath, which contains the same language and was signed by about 200 members of the Forum of Young Global Leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January.
“From my perspective, I’m pretty amazed at the amount of progress that’s been made in literally a year in terms of students who have signed up and infrastructure built to create a body of oversight,” said HBS Professor Rakesh Khurana, who has been involved with the movement since its inception.
But the global recognition attained by the movement has not gained it support among the student body at the Business School, according to Chun and Daubin.
“The only thing the Oath Team has done on the HBS campus this year was  hold one panel of professors, which was a great event,” Daubin said. “Otherwise, they’ve been writing editorials in external news sources like The Washington Post.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what has nearly become a hip-hop concert that still hopes to appeal to a variety of musical tastes, hip-hop artist Wale will be among the three acts featured at this year’s Yardfest, the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission announced Friday.
Wale, the stage name of 25-year-old Washington, D.C. rapper Olubowale Folarin, will be performing along with fellow hip-hop artist Kid Cudi and indie folk singer-songwriter Patrick Park.
The addition of Wale gives the fifth annual spring concert—scheduled for April 18 in Tercentenary Theatre—a distinct hip-hop bent, breaking away from the tradition of pairing artists from disparate genres. That decision, according to HCC director Synne D. Chapman ’11, was a consequence of prioritizing high-quality artists that fit their logistical constraints over the simple maintenance of genre diversity.
CEB vice-chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr. ’11 said last Monday that rap was the top-ranking genre on their survey of students last fall, giving credence to the designation of hip-hop as the main genre at Yardfest.
Still, Anastos maintained that there was some variety in the choice of artists, saying that the selection came as a result of two different perspectives.
“One was that we should have a diverse group. The other was that we should have a hip-hop show and that we should make it awesome,” he said. “I think we’re pumped that we can do both of those.”
Wale has released five mixtapes and one full-length album entitled “Attention Deficit.” Debuting on Nov. 10, 2009, the album surged to the number 21 spot on the Billboard 200 in its first week, helped by popular singles like “Chillin”  and “Pretty Girls.”
Contract negotiations to bring Wale to campus continued through the middle of last week, Anastos said.
Even by the time Kid Cudi’s performance was announced last Monday, Wale’s performance had not been finalized.
The last time three artists performed at Yardfest was two years ago when Joey DeGraw performed briefly in between his brother Gavin DeGraw and the Wu-Tang Clan.
This year, Park will open the concert, with Wale following and Kid Cudi finishing.
“We were really fortunate to be able to do that this year,” Anastos said about the number of musicians at this year’s concert. “Putting together three artists was clearly not an easy task, but a lot of people from the CEB and the HCC worked hard to make it happen.”
But regardless of the number or genre of the artists performing, Chapman, who is also a Crimson magazine editor, said that, at its core, Yardfest is more than just a free concert in the middle of the Yard.
“It’s the only event all year when the entire undergraduate population comes together to have fun in the sun, weather permitting obviously,” Chapman said. “If you don’t go to Yardfest during your time at Harvard, you’re missing out on your experience here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Staff members across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are reporting varying degrees of recovery from last year’s sweeping reductions in staff positions.
After facing the largest hit to the endowment in decades, the University announced the elimination of 275 staff positions in June 2009. An additional 531 staffers accepted an early retirement package offered by the University.
In interviews with The Crimson last week, staff workers across FAS said that high levels of stress have followed less than a year after the comprehensive staff reductions, even while many positions have been replaced.
“It’s been a challenge to pick up the slack,” said Helen Lewis, a staff assistant in the linguistics department, noting that employee streamlining has been a trend across the nation. “Of course that causes a lot of stress.”
Though the linguistics department’s small size prevented staff cuts, reduced hours have forced remaining staff members to fit the same amount of worknto a smaller time frame, according to Lewis.
One humanities administrator, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid conflict with her superiors, said that reductions in staff hours have imposed additional burdens on faculty members who find themselves performing administrative duties.
The individual added that cuts in budgets for meetings and food have limited the amount of time she spends with her colleagues and faculty members in the department.
“When you cut out that time,” the administrator said, “something is missing.”
The Classics Department was able to fill a position that had been left vacant when a staffer took the early retirement package, but the department has still faced the loss of “institutional knowledge” possessed by the individual, according to department administrator Theresa T. Wu.
Staff reductions have not been limited to academic departments. The College’s Office of Administration and Finance—members of which declined to comment—also lost two of its six staff members, and the Advising Programs Office and the Office of Student Life have been coping with staff streamlining.
“It meant that the people who were left behind really stepped up,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “The staff commitment has been extraordinary.”
FAS Associate Dean Robert G. Doyle, who oversees five media and tech-related FAS services and a staff of 46 employees, said that while no full-time positions were cut, he eliminated all temporary positions and reduced what he described as the basic services that they typically performed.
But not all staffers said that cuts have strained their departments. In some of the larger academic departments, administrators were able to avoid laying off full-time positions.
For example, financial associate and program coordinator for the African and African American Studies Department Melissa B. Huser credited the balanced work level to the fact that her department did not lose any staff members last spring.
In addition to the restructuring, FAS is training administrators to use a new digital budgeting tool known as the Harvard University Budgeting Service.
As the budgeting process begins for the next academic year, Wu said that the recent decrease in the FAS budget deficit has relieved some of the tension.
“Now I’m just used to things,” she said. “It was scarier last year.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 29, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 29 news article "Stress of 2009 Staff Cuts Lingers in FAS" incorrectly stated that the University eliminated 275 staff positions in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In fact, 275 staff positions were cut across the University, and not just in FAS.
The article also stated that 531 staffers accepted an early retirement package offered by FAS. In fact, the figure represents the number of staff workers from across the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The postponement of the dream”—those were the words used by University President Drew G. Faust earlier this month to describe the University’s stalled billion dollar expansion in Allston, a development plan that would have replaced a part of Allston’s industrial lots with a cutting-edge research center.
Last year’s economic crash brought plans for an integrated space for Harvard’s scientists to a skidding halt, exacerbating the University’s at times strained relations with Allston, whose residents have long viewed development plans with skepticism. Though Harvard has committed resources for community improvement, Allston residents are still calling for increased two-way communication to ease the sense of insecurity associated with the construction pause.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Faust said the University will now seek to “rebuild the trust between the community group and Harvard,” after halting construction due to financial constraints.
The University has taken concrete steps in recent weeks to improve its relationship with Allston by sponsoring community programs.
In an effort to continue promoting the vibrancy of the community—one oft-cited goal of Harvard’s expansion in Allston—during the past year the University has orchestrated the opening of a free ice-skating rink in a former Volkswagen dealership and the disbursing of community development grants to organizations like the Fishing Academy, which sponsors fishing trips for Allston youths. Harvard has also recently leased empty office space from its large real estate holdings in the neighborhood to an environmental nonprofit.
But the jobs, the increased business activity, and the revitalization associated with a cutting edge research facility that would have drastically altered the Allston’s urban landscape now seem a rather distant reality to most residents.
Faust has reiterated her commitment to maintaining an open line of communication with the Allston community and met with members of the Harvard Allston Task Force over breakfast in February.
“I have tried to be as open as possible in explaining how the downturn has had an impact on our financial capacities and how it has forced us to reconsider the speed and nature of our aspirations,” Faust said.
Many Allston residents said they appreciated the University’s efforts thus far to develop the community, but there remains a lingering sense that Harvard should improve the transparency of the planning process to demonstrate its receptiveness to the community’s concerns.
“I think there isn’t much of a relationship right now,” Allston resident Harry Mattison said. “If you’re going to have a partnership there has to be honest, open, and frequent dialogue—right now it’s certainly not frequent. That’s where we need to start.”
While community members have faulted the University for not being particularly transparent about its plans for future development and the state of its finances, interviews also reflected a sense of optimism that the appointment of the Allston Work Team—a group created shortly after the University announced that it would halt construction indefinitely on the Allston Science Complex and charged with recommending strategies for Harvard’s expansion into Allston—signals a turning point in the University’s on-going relationship with Allston.
“I might say it’s a very hopeful time, that this appears to be the first time the University has encouraged and sponsored interaction with the great resources of its academic community,” said Allston resident Bruce Houghton.
Houghton added that prior to the creation of the work team, Allston residents only had access to community relations officials, an approach he called “ineffective and shortsighted.”
Taking a long-term view, Faust said that both Harvard and Allston would stand to benefit from increased openness.
“I’ve tried to say, ‘Here are the realities,’” Faust said. “Now let’s work for a common solution because we all share a desire to have this be the most wonderful community and the best set of neighbor relations and the best context for all of us to live together, because we’re going to live together for the next however many centuries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A professor studying corporate organization, a pioneer in stem cell research, and an expert in 18th-century French literature may not share much outside of being leaders in their fields, but thanks to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, the three will have one title in common—House Master.
Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana, Natural Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton, and French and Comparative Literature Professor Christie McDonald and their spouses will lead Cabot, Eliot, and Mather Houses as House Masters next year, Hammonds announced Friday in an e-mail to the College community.
Along with Khurana at the helm of Cabot House will be Tobin Project Acting Executive Director Stephanie Khurana. Educational consultant Gail O’Keefe will join Melton, who also co-directs the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, at Eliot House. McDonald will be put in charge of Mather House, along with her husband, McGill University Associate Professor of Medicine Michael D. Rosengarten.
“Each of the new Masters—Professors Rakesh Khurana, Doug Melton, and Christie McDonald—are leading scholars in their fields,” Hammonds said in a statement. “But more important than their scholarly contributions, they are, alongside their spouses, wonderful, outgoing people who have a passion for working with and mentoring students.”
THE PROCESS
Last semester, Hammonds was left with the task of filling House Master positions in almost a quarter of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses. Within a span of two weeks during the end of 2009, Cabot House Masters Jay M. Harris and Cheryl L. Harris, Eliot House Masters Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted, and Mather House Masters Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73 announced that they will step down from their positions at the end of the academic year, citing a variety of reasons ranging from a heavy workload to a general feeling that this academic year would be an appropriate one to have as their last.
As soon as the Masters announced their departures, Hammonds began the House Master search by canvassing faculty members potentially interested in the opportunity, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said in February. Each House subsequently convened advisory groups—comprised of tutors, students, and staff—that met with House Master candidates. These committees provided nput on interested faculty members via questionnaires, but Hammonds ultimately made the final decisions, Nelson added.
THE PICKS
An author of three books and an organizational sociologist by training, Khurana conducts research on corporate leadership and teaches a doctoral seminar on management and corporate governance. Along with his wife Stephanie, a former co-founder and CEO of technology company Surebridge, Khurana will bring his three children—Sonia, Nalini, and Jai, who are 13, 11, and 7 years old, respectively—to Cabot House.
Melton, one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and in 2009, has garnered acclaim as a leader in field of stem cell research. This year, he co-taught the introductory course in the newly-created Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentration. O’Keefe, his wife, works to improve high-risk students’ access to quality education as part of the Education Collaborative for Greater Boston.
McDonald, a world-renowned scholar of 18th-century French literature, focuses her research on the relationship between literature and the social sciences and arts. Her husband, a cardiologist, is the associate dean of the Center for Continuing Health Professional Education at McGill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While it is not every year that a Dean of the College has the opportunity to nominate a House Master—much less three—House residents’ responses to Evelynn M. Hammonds’s Friday announcement of the appointments of next year’s Masters in Cabot, Eliot, and Mather Houses remain unsettled.
Several undergraduates in Cabot, Eliot, and Mather said over the past weekend that they didn’t know enough about the incoming Masters to have formed a solid opinion on the professors who will lead their Houses starting next academic year.
Students attributed this sentiment primarily to the secrecy surrounding the selection process, which prevented most students from meeting the candidates.
“I think I have seen her name before on various faculty lists, but I haven’t had a whole lot of interaction with her. I don’t know much about her.” said Mather House resident Brian P. Eggert ’12 about French and Comparative Literature Professor Christie McDonald, who, along with her husband Michael D. Rosengarten, were named Mather’s new House Masters.
The case was similar in both Cabot and Eliot Houses. “I’ve never met him and I don’t have any experience taking his class,” said Eliot House resident Andre D. Gabriel ’11, in reference to Natural Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton. Melton and his wife Gail O’Keefe will become the Eliot House Masters at the end of this semester.
“I read a little profile on them, and they seemed nice,” said Cabot House resident Amelia H. Lin ’11 about Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and his wife Stephanie Khurana. “I know a person involved in the selection, and I trust they have good judgment.”
But for students familiar with the appointees, enthusiasm replaces ambivalence.
Xiang “John” Du ’12, an Eliot House resident and Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator, said he learned about Melton’s appointment through an exclamation point-filled text message from a friend. Having taken the introductory course in the newly-created concentration, Du said that he has had several conversations with Melton on topics ranging from the regeneration of the liver to the state of the Boston Celtics.
“I talked to him a couple times after class. He’s very receptive,” Du said. “He’s a really fun guy to talk to.”
In contrast, other undergraduates said yesterday that they had been uninterested in—or entirely unaware of—the House Master selection process.
“I knew that we were getting a new one, but I didn’t know that they had been chosen,” Cabot House resident Andrew J. Leiman ’12 said.
Several students said they would reserve judgment until they meet the appointees.
“I don’t know how his bio will tell me more about how great a House Master he will be,” said Anna M. Kamerow ’11, an Eliot House resident.
But what many students, including Mather House resident Claire W. Shepro ’10, could agree upon was that the bar has been set high by the incoming House Masters’ predecessors.
“I hope that Christie and Mike can top that because they’re hard acts to follow,” Shepro said, referencing outgoing Mather House Masters Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73.

Three weapons, 12 Harvard qualifiers—one national champion. Sophomore co-captain Caroline Vloka took home the gold medal and national title in the sabre, while teammate and fellow sophomore captain Noam Mills placed second in the epée at the NCAA Fencing Championships this past weekend. The men were led by sophomore Valentin Staller and freshman Tommasso di Robilant, who finished sixth and 12th in the sabre and foil, respectively.
Vloka won the title in a narrow 15-13 victory over Duke’s Rebecca Ward on the second day of the four-day competition, held at Gordon Indoor Track. The two also competed for the championship in last year’s tournament, with Ward walking away with a decisive win over Vloka.
For the sophomore, this second opportunity was a chance for redemption.
“Last year I was really nervous, but this year I was mad,” Vloka said. “I came in with the confidence that I needed and just believed that I could do it.”
This mindset made all the difference for Vloka.
The sophomore became only the second female national champion for the Crimson and the first female champion since Emily Cross ’08-’09 claimed the title in 2005. Vloka defeated Ohio State’s Margarita Tschomakova in the semis to advance to her second consecutive final-round appearance.
“To win, I knew I had to fence harder than I had ever fenced,” the champion said. “The only reason I beat [Ward] is because I gave it my all.”
Teammate Noam Mills, the No. 1 seed in the epée, fell, 15-10, in the final round to Penn State’s Margherita Guzzi Vincenti to claim the silver medal. The sophomore defeated another Penn State competitor, Anastasia Ferdmann to advance to the championship round.
Despite the loss, Mills and Vloka both were awarded first-team All-American honors.
In the foil, sophomore Shelby MacLeord garnered an 11th-place finish, while senior Artemisha Goldfeder placed 12th. Both competitors were given All-American Honorable Mention awards. The title winner for the foil was Columbia/Barnard’s Nicole Ross, who defeated Penn State’s Doris Willette, 15-9, for the gold.
Like Vloka, Ross had come close to the championship in previous year’s tournaments but had been unable to capture it until this weekend.
“This year, I think I just brought a lot more experience to the table,” Ross said. “I stayed really calm both days and was extremely patient in every bout.”
Although the Crimson men’s team cannot boast a national champion, its six qualifiers all posted consistent performances, keeping Harvard in fifth place overall. Staller’s showing was good enough to earn him a spot on the All-American Second Team while di Robilant garnered All-American Honorable Mention honors.
Also competing for the Crimson were freshman Michael Tom, who finished 21st in the sabre, junior Hao Meng, who placed 16th in foil, and sophomore James Hawrot and senior Karl Harmenberg, who captured 14th and 16th in the epée, respectively.
“This year was an especially tough NCAA championship,” Staller said. “I think we did very well...and [it] bodes well for the future.”
The future does look bright for the Harvard team, which is graduating only six seniors after this season.
Both squads are heavily dominated by talented freshman and sophomore classes, including Vloka, Mills, and Staller. Of the qualifying 12, nine were either freshmen or sophomores, indicating the potential for continued strong showings in the seasons to come.
“We’re poised to do very well in the next few years,” Staller said. “I think getting the experience of this really hard tournament will help everyone move forward.”
A particular boon for the Crimson was the home-field advantage, allowing all team members, their families, and the Harvard community to attend the event and support the athletes.
“I really see the Harvard fencing team as kind of a family,” Vloka said. “Having all of them here able to support me was just amazing.”
The Crimson finished fifth overall in the tournament, falling to Penn State, St. John’s, Notre Dame, and Ohio State. But Harvard was able to defeat conference rival Princeton, which captured the Ivy League crown earlier in the season.
With the promise of talented underclassmen—including a national champion and several All-American athletes—the Crimson fencing team’s fifth-place finish could just be the beginning of the squad’s success in years to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Brown’s Kara Kelly notched an early second-half goal to put her team in front, 10-3, few of the fans at Harvard Stadium could have imagined that the Harvard women’s lacrosse team would have an opportunity just 24 minutes later to send the game into overtime.
Thanks to 7-1 run to close out the game, the Crimson set up for a draw control down by a single goal with 1:01 left to play.
But despite winning the possession and finding multiple opportunities to score in the final minute, Harvard was unable to come away with the goal it needed to complete the comeback, as the Crimson (3-4, 1-2 Ivy) fell to Brown (3-3, 1-2) on Saturday afternoon, 11-10.
“The crowd thinks it’s a great comeback, but in reality, it’s a game we probably should have won,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I’m not happy with it—that’s the bottom line.”
The Crimson took possession off the draw control thanks to a hustle play from sophomore Tyler Petropulos, who was fouled diving for the loose ball.
With possession, Harvard advanced the ball up the field, and with 28 seconds left, Crimson sophomore Melanie Baskind let a shot fly at the goal. But the attempt sailed wide right.
Harvard got one more chance to even the score, getting the ball to freshman Micaela Cyr behind the cage. Cyr swung around and attacked the goal with five seconds to go. With just one tick left on the clock, Cyr attempted to get a shot off but was fouled by a Bears defender just before the final horn sounded.
After a brief conference, the referees put one second on the clock and granted Cyr a free-position shot. Lined up several yards away from the goal, the rookie had time for just one step before letting the shot go.
But Brown goalkeeper Isabel Harvey stepped in front of the ball, securing the victory for her team.
“I knew I only had one second, so I just tried to get in as far as I could and shoot it,” Cyr said.
Co-captain Sara Flood got the second-half run started for the Crimson, using a move to beat her defender and find an open path to the goal for her first score of the game.
Freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen followed with a score less than three minutes later, getting fouled in front of the net and then scoring off a free-position shot.
Harvard then took possession and managed to get the ball to VanderMeulen in front of the net. VanderMeulen was fouled again, but this time her free-position shot was knocked away by Harvey. Flood brought the Crimson within four, picking up the rebound and sending it home—forcing the Bears to take a timeout.
“[Harvard] played so hard that second half and forced turnovers and had good pressure,” Brown coach Keely McDonald said. “You just tell the kids to keep playing their game.”
Coming out of the break, the Bears slowed the pace of play down, passing the ball around the perimeter to milk the clock.
Harvard eventually took back possession with nine minutes left when co-captain Delia Pais picked up a loose ball.
The Crimson scored three goals in just over three minutes off free-position shots from freshman Danielle Tetreault, VanderMeulen, and Petropulos to get within one with 4:14 left.
After Petropulos’ goal, the Bears won the ensuing draw control and began to stall again. With 2:33 to play, Harvard was whistled for a foul, setting up a scoring opportunity for Brown.
Senior goalkeeper Katherine Martino deflected the Bears’ first shot attempt, but Brown’s Tara Rooke put back the rebound to give her team a two-goal lead with 1:39 left.
Baskind answered 38 seconds later, taking a pass from VanderMeulen in front of the net and then beating Harvey to set up Harvard’s final possession.
But the Crimson’s first-half deficit was ultimately too much to overcome.
In the opening frame, Harvard was fully outplayed by the Bears, surrendering nine goals and losing nine of 12 draw controls. Brown was led by sophomore attacker Kaela McGilloway, who notched five scores in the opening frame.
“To me, the real issue is the first half,” Miller said. “Until we fix the fact that we feel other people out and wait for them to set the tone, it doesn’t really matter what we do in the second half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a one-goal loss to Brown, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (4-4, 1-2 Ivy) took out some of Saturday’s frustration on Bryant University (1-8, 1-2 NEC) in a 19-4 trouncing at Harvard Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
The 15-goal differential was the Crimson’s largest margin of victory this season.
“I think we kind of used the Brown game as fuel to come out and show that we can play better than that,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “I think that it was a good effort all around...We wanted to prove that we know what we need to do.”
The team’s focus was apparent in the beginning of the game—despite opening up a 10-0 lead in the first 17 minutes of the contest, Harvard hardly celebrated after each goal.
The Crimson controlled the direction of the game for most of the first half, rarely retreating into defense and allowing only one goal in the first 20 minutes. VanderMuelen led Harvard’s initial surge, completing a hat trick seven minutes into the game and scoring five goals in the first half.
“There was a little bit of a feeding frenzy early, a lack of structure, but we just out-athleticized them,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said.
The Crimson led at halftime, 13-2. The two Bulldog goals—one of which came on a free-position shot—came at a point when the game was already out of reach.
“It’s just hard [for Bryant] because there’s such a discrepancy in terms of upgrading from Division II—it’s a different world,” said Miller of the Bulldog’s recent transition into Division I athletics.
In the second half, the Crimson took fewer shots and could not match the multitude of goals that it had to start the game. Still, freshman Micaela Cyr opened the half with a score in the second minute—her fourth consecutive goal going back to 6:41 in the first half.
Harvard did not relent altogether—of its six second-half goals, three came in the last two minutes of the game. Freshman Mariel Jenkins scored on a free-position shot with 1:41 left, and VanderMeulen scored her sixth goal of the game with 1:13 left in regulation, though it was her only goal of the half.
“I had a little bit more pressure in the second half—they decided to faceguard me,” VanderMeulen said. “First half, I happened to be open, [but in the] second half others were working to get open too.”
No Crimson player scored more than one goal in the second half.
Harvard’s rookies were paramount to the team’s victory over the Bulldogs. Of the 19 goals on the afternoon, 17 came from the team’s first-year players.
“It’s a trial by fire [for these newcomers], and we’ll be better for it long term,” Miller said. “I just think this year we live with peaks and valleys and some young decision-making.”
VanderMeulen and Cyr led the team with six goals and five goals, respectively. Jenkins scored twice in the game, and freshmen Alexis Dal Col and Danielle Tetreault each added one goal of their own. Sophomore Melanie Baskind, playing her first season of lacrosse, had two scores.
The two remaining goals came from sophomore Tyler Petropulos, who scored with 7:43 remaining, and co-captain Sara Flood, who accounted for the other goal.
Though Bryant was limited to two goals in the second half, the team had possession more often and had more scoring opportunities. The Bulldogs took 14 shots in the second as opposed to only seven in the first.
“Second half, I thought [Bryant] just did a better job just staying in structure, getting the ball, getting some good clean looks,” Miller said.
Despite a better offensive performance, Bryant converted poorly. Beyond its twelve missed shots, the team was also only 1-of-5 on free-position shots in the second half. Senior goalie Katherine Martino had six saves, four of which came in the final frame.
“I think we were pretty angry about yesterday—we didn’t stay in our system, we didn’t stay in our structure [against Brown],” VanderMeulen said. “I think we were all just ready to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For much of Saturday afternoon’s game, the No. 16 Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s offense was as cold as the heavily-bundled fans packed on the shady side of Harvard Stadium.
But as the crowd moved to the sunny side of the building, the Crimson attack began to warm up as well.
After falling behind, 9-3, early in the third quarter, Harvard (5-2, 1-1 Ivy) was able to stage a massive comeback in the second half and come away with a 13-11 victory over Dartmouth (2-4, 0-1).
“I’m really proud of them,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “It’s a group that really believes, and they know if they work hard, they can be pretty successful.”
After Dartmouth opened the game by holding the ball for nearly three minutes and then scoring on freshman goalie Harry Krieger, Harvard retaliated.
Freshman Peter Schwartz hit sophomore Jeff Cohen with a pass directly in front of the net, and Cohen threw it past Dartmouth goalie Fergus Campbell to tie up the game.
Sophomore Terry White then took a pass and made a nice move inside, bouncing the ball past two defenders and into the goal to give the Crimson the lead. Just 12 seconds later, junior Dean Gibbons tallied his first goal, a line drive he fired past Campbell to give his team a 3-1 advantage.
But from there, Harvard struggled. Dartmouth’s Ari Sussman responded first, notching a goal despite from a hit from a Crimson defender that sent him flying into Krieger.
Before the period was over, two more Big Green goals put the team ahead, 4-3.
The second quarter was dominated by Dartmouth. Campbell made four consecutive saves during a long Harvard possession early in the period, including two great stick saves off shots from Gibbons and Schwartz.
On the other end of the field, Krieger had trouble stopping the Big Green attack. Dartmouth rattled off three goals in the period, including two in the final minute, to send the Crimson to the locker room down, 7-3.
“It was obviously a very disappointing second quarter,” Tillman said. “I give Dartmouth a lot of credit. They controlled play.”
After the Big Green quickly gained an 8-3 lead in the third, Dartmouth displayed crisp ball movement on its next possession. Kip Dooley took a pass in front of the net and put the ball through Krieger’s legs.
Down 9-3, the Crimson saw itself behind and again needing to make a run.
“Staring down six goals, obviously it’s a lot to think about,” Tillman said. “But our guys did a great job. No one panicked, everyone stuck together, everybody believed we were going to win the game.”
And win the game they did. Gibbons got the Harvard offense going, splitting two Big Green defenders for a goal.
The Crimson then scored twice in 12 seconds—a backdoor goal by sophomore Kevin Vaughn followed by Gibbons’ third score, a line drive he fired over Campbell’s left shoulder off an assist from Cohen.
Gibbons then reciprocated by assisting on Cohen’s second goal. Eight seconds later, freshman Alex White scored to bring Harvard within one.
With 23 seconds remaining in the quarter, Dartmouth responded with a score from Chris Costabile, but though the third period ended with a 10-8 Big Green lead, momentum was on Harvard’s side.
“I think when things went bad, we started worrying about what was going bad, and then we just got back to doing what we wanted to do,” Tillman said.
The Crimson opened scoring in the final period when sophomore Andrew Pataki scored his first goal of the year off a pass from classmate Evan Roth.
The Crimson was then able to tie up the game when freshman Jeff Molinari darted two defenders and bounced the ball past Campbell. Cohen put the team ahead with his third goal, and freshman Jack Doyle added the eventual game-winner.
After a Dartmouth goal pulled the Big Green within one late in the contest, Terry White provided the dagger, giving Harvard the 13-11 win. Once again, the Crimson had pulled off an improbable comeback.
“We’ve shown it a couple times this year,” Cohen said. “And I think that’s something really special about our team—no matter how many goals we’re down, we can come back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And the calls just keep on coming.
The Harvard softball team (6-14) was once again victim of the “illegal pitch controversy,” a trend that started this year following criticism of illegal pitching mechanics demonstrated by pitchers around the nation. But despite the confusion surrounding the newly-enforced rule, the Crimson was able to pull out two wins at Fairfield University (11-13) yesterday after failing to come back from behind at Quinnipiac (11-14) on Saturday.
“Our coach told us that these would be the last games before Ivies start,” Crimson sophomore Rachel Brown said. “So we took what she said to heart, and we wanted to get ready for the games that really matter and to work out our small kinks and problems.”
Some of those problems are influenced by external factors. Against Boston University on Thursday, co-captain and pitcher Margaux Black was called for multiple illegal pitches that aided an 11-run first-inning outburst for the Terriers. This weekend, it was Brown’s turn to receive the tough calls from the unrelenting umpires.
“The illegal pitch controversy is a difficult thing,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “There is a huge inconsistency with how they’re calling these pitches. The umpires need to get it together in order to make the game better.”
HARVARD 10, FAIRFIELD 5
Black started the game against the Stags, allowing two runs and five hits in three innings of work. The Crimson had to wait until the fourth inning to answer back, and the team did so in style.
Sophomore Jane Alexander started the engine, as she launched a leadoff triple to left-center field. Sophomore Whitney Shaw, coming off a solo home run the day before, hit a sacrifice fly to bring Alexander home.
Freshmen Jessica Ferri and Kassy Shiotani, senior Stephanie Krysiak, and co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, each had an RBI in the inning—part of a six-hit, five-run outburst.
“Jane started off the inning with an important triple,” Brown said. “A thing on the team is that hitting is contagious, so everyone just jumped on board. We have to find that way to light the fire and start getting runs in every game.”
Fairfield got one back in the bottom of the inning before Harvard had another five hits in the top of the sixth, resulting in four more runs for the Crimson.
Sophomore Julia Moore, who allowed just one run in three innings of relief, came away with the win—the first this season for a pitcher not named Rachel Brown.
Schellberg and Shaw each had three RBI, and Shiotani scored three runs.
HARVARD 1, FAIRFIELD 0
The opening game of the doubleheader was a classic pitching duel between Brown and Stag Sarah Minice, as the Crimson only had to come up with one run to seal its fifth win of the season.
Brown sparkled in a complete-game, one-hit shutout, ringing up six and retiring 18 straight batters.
Harvard had two hits in the first three innings before getting on the board in the top of the fourth.
Freshman Mariel Sena walked and advanced to second on Shiotani’s fielder’s choice. Krysiak’s single helped Sena make it to third safely, and Schellberg flew out to bring Sena home.
The only other hit of the game came in the seventh, when Schellberg hit a single to right field. The co-captain leads the team with a .321 average.
QUINNIPIAC 3, HARVARD 2
Given the way the Harvard offense started out on Saturday afternoon, it seemed that its 10-game losing skid would finally come to an end. But the Crimson squandered two leads to let the hosts take the win.
The game sprung to life in the second inning when Harvard scored its first run of the day.
Ferri was up first for the Crimson. She struck out but advanced to first on an error. A wild pitch by Quinnipiac sophomore Heather Schwartzburg allowed Ferri to get to second, and the rookie came around on groundouts from junior Emily Henderson and Shiotani.
It didn’t take long for Quinnipiac to respond with a run of its own after an illegal pitch allowed the Bobcats’ Katie Allendorfer to reach home plate.
Shaw saw a chance to break the tie and sent the ball out of the park in the third inning for her first home run of the year.
But Quinnipiac rallied once again, plating a pair of runs off Ferri in the bottom of the inning to take the 3-2 lead.
Both teams were then quiet for the rest of the afternoon, as Bobcat reliever Heather Schwartzburg struck out nine in four innings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite starting the season 0-11 in the non-conference portion of its schedule, Saturday’s victory over New York University (4-14, 0-5 EIVA Hay Division) moved the Harvard men’s volleyball team (3-12, 3-1 EIVA Hay Division) into sole possession of second place in its division.
Playing in front of a supportive crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson captured its first home victory of the season with the 3-1 win (30-28, 28-30, 31-29, 30-22).
“The team played phenomenally,” said co-captain Erik Kuld, who led the team with 26 kills. “Best game of the year.”
After trading the first two sets, Harvard orchestrated a comeback in the third set, recovering from a late six-point deficit to take the lead and the momentum heading into the fourth.
Trailing 16-22 in the third set, the Crimson managed to climb back, knotting the score at 25 with a block from senior Soren Rosier.
After a missed serve from co-captain Gil Weintraub, Harvard tied it up again behind a kill from sophomore Matt Jones.
Kuld then snatched the lead for the Crimson, getting a spike to fall. But the Violets regained the lead with a kill from Pattrick Dodd, which forced the Crimson to take a timeout.
Harvard came out of the timeout on a tear, tying the game at 28 with a block and then taking the lead after NYU was whistled for too many touches.
The Violets tied the score at 29 with a kill from Luke Hamlet, but gave the lead right back to the Crimson with a service error.
Harvard closed out the set when Weintraub set up Kuld on the outside, who finished with the kill.
“We knew we could beat them,” Kuld said. “We came in expecting to beat them. When things started going right, we really just accelerated.”
With the 2-1 lead and momentum on its side, the Crimson came out on fire to start the fourth set, taking 10-6 lead behind a Weintraub kill.
But NYU did not give up without a fight, chipping away at the deficit until it tied the score at 17. But just when the Violets started to get back into the game, Harvard stepped up.
Kuld put the Crimson ahead, 19-17, with an ace, and then up by four with a tip. Kuld then demonstrated his versatility, coming up with blocks on back-to-back points to put his team up, 26-20.
[Kuld] did everything tonight,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “He anchored our passing, had some key blocks. He really stepped up today.”
“Erik Kuld at the end of game four—just unstoppable,” Weintraub added.
Weintraub gave Harvard match point, notching his tenth kill of the contest. Jones closed it out with a thundering kill, his 22nd of the match.
The Crimson dominated offensively, finishing with 73 kills. Freshman Rob Lothman orchestrated the offense, finishing with 61 assists—a career high.
But it was when Harvard broke down defensively that the Crimson let the visitors back into the game.
After taking the first set, 30-28, NYU came out strong in the second, jumping out to a 14-11 advantage. The Crimson climbed back, tying the score at 15, but an attacking error put the home team down, 22-18.
Harvard got within three after Kuld notched two kills, and then within one following a kill from Jones. But the Crimson did not come closer than that, as it dropped the set, 30-28.
“We had a streak in the middle of the [second] game where we made a series of errors,” Baise said. “They started hitting really well. We started fighting back at the end, but it was too late.”
Harvard recovered from the setback in the second game, though, taking the final two sets to capture its third win of the season.
Luckily for the Crimson, its wins have come at the right time—in conference play.
“We had something to prove that we’re not to be counted out,” Weintraub said. “We’re going to be a contender this year and I think we’re making a great statement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With each new season come great expectations.
With the season-opening weekend now in the books, the Radcliffe Lightweight and Heavyweight crews both made solid starts to their seasons by displaying strong performances in their races on Saturday and Sunday.
While the lightweights stayed home on the Charles River to host Buffalo, the Heavyweight crews traveled to San Diego to participate in the Crew Classic.
SAN DIEGO CREW CLASSIC
Powerhouse crews from all over the country descended upon Mission Bay, Calif. for the 37th installment of the San Diego Crew Classic, and the Radcliffe Heavyweights showed why they belong in the conversation for national honors this season.
Both the Black and White varsity eight and second varsity eight crews qualified for the final round on opening day of competition on Saturday.
The 14th-ranked varsity eight finished third in its heat, edging out UC Davis by less than a second—6:59.45 to the Aggies’ 6:59.52—to claim a spot in the finals. No. 3 Virginia led all varsity eight crews with a time of 6:39.00.
“We had a little of trouble at the start of the race,” captain Laura Huppert said. “But we eventually found our rhythm. What mattered to us though was that we got the job done, and we did what we needed to do [to qualify for the finals]. It was a good opportunity to figure out what we needed to work on for Sunday and get out there on the course.”
The competition was not nearly as close for the Black and White second varsity, as Radcliffe finished second in its heat with a time of 7:13.78, a comfortable 11 seconds ahead of the next boat in its race.
But the Black and White’s momentum would end there.
In Sunday’s final rounds, both crews struggled on the water, as the varsity eight took fifth place with a time of 6:53.33. Once again, Virginia led all crews, followed by USC, UCLA, and Washington State.
Meanwhile, the second varsity finished sixth in its respective heat, finishing just 2.47 seconds behind UCLA with a time of 6:59.54.
Both crews used the Crew Classic as an opportunity to prepare for league competition, and the Black and White is hoping that the trip out west will pay off for the relatively young crews.
“It’s great to race—so many boats so early in the season,” Huppert said. “We’re really excited to keep building for the rest of the season, and we expect nothing but an upward trajectory.”
HARVARD VS. BUFFALO
A chilly Saturday morning with strong tailwinds provided challenging conditions for the Radcliffe lightweights.
Regardless, both the Black and White varsity eight and second varsity eight had no problem taking care of Buffalo, finishing with times of 7:03.93 and 7:13.04, respectively, while the Bulls—which sent only one boat to the Charles—completed the course with a time of 7:17.04.
“It was challenging conditions for everyone out there,” Harvard coach Heather Cartwright said. “[The tailwind] increased significantly through the second half of the course and the water got a lot rougher…but I thought that our athletes did well today. For our first race, it was a good beginning for us.”
The winner of the race was decided early on, as the varsity eight gained a considerable lead in the first 500 meters of the course, pulling ahead of both the second varsity and the Bulls.
“We got off to a good start by establishing a very good rhythm in the first half of the race,” Cartwright said.
With the departure of three seniors from last year’s crews and a large freshman class, Cartwright brings back a team filled with both experience and youth—while the varsity eight is filled with mostly returning starters, more than half of the team is comprised of freshmen.
But last weekend’s race proved that the Black and White has the perfect balance of leadership and raw talent to succeed this season.
“Going forward we have a lot to work on,” Cartwright said. “We have to gain more speed, and we need to refine our technique and work on our race plan…But we definitely rowed well for our first race.”
The Radcliffe heavyweights will remain on the road next week, as they will travel to Brown to begin conference competition. The lightweights will remain on the Charles to take on Georgetown on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captain Alex Meyer traveled to Columbus, Ohio for the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships seeded 20th in his only event. But after 15 minutes, the Crimson senior had left that ranking in the dust.
Meyer competed in the 1,650-yard freestyle last night in Ohio State’s McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion, taking 14th in a time of 14:58.14. By finishing in the top 16, Meyer earned All-American honors—the first such distinction for a male Harvard swimmer since Geoff Rathgeber ’08.
“I’m really happy with [the race],” Meyer said, “It was my first time under 15 minutes, and I dropped about seven seconds from my time at [the Ivy League Championships] a few weeks ago.”
Meyer’s personal best may have resulted from a bold new strategy—one that pushed the swimmer to his physical limits.
“My coach told me, ‘You’re going to go out and set the pace and try to hang on,’” Meyer explained. “I went out four or five seconds faster than I usually do in the first 500 [yards]. I could feel the difference. I was hurting pretty bad at the back end of the race.”
But Meyer did hold on, far outpacing his original seed to cap a stellar Crimson career with his first All-American distinction.
“It feels great,” Meyer said. “[Earning All-American honors] has been a goal since I came to Harvard.”
After demonstrating his potential to shatter previous times, though, Meyer is not ready to call it quits on a promising swimming career.
“I’m going to focus on open water,” Meyer said. “I want to keep training for the next year or two.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After going eight games without a victory, Harvard’s baseball team has built up a three-game winning streak thanks to a sweep of yesterday’s doubleheader against Hartford.
The Crimson (6-11) took down the Hawks (5-10) in close 6-5 and 6-4 decisions at Fiondella Field in Hartford, Conn., continuing the long stretch of road games at the top of Harvard’s schedule.
In both games, the Crimson relied on all aspects of play to overcome early Hartford leads.
“Our bullpen and pitching in general did an outstanding job, the hitters did what they had to do, and the defense played great as well,” sophomore Brent Suter said. “Everything came together.”
This was especially true late in both games, when Harvard’s clutch hitting and relief pitching became crucial to secure victories in the final innings.
HARVARD 6, HARTFORD 4
In the second of the teams’ matchups, effective pitching by Suter to start the game and by freshman Joey Novak to finish it up kept the Hawk bats at bay and allowed the Crimson’s hitters take the lead.
After a scoreless opening frame, Hartford got an unearned run off a Harvard error in the second. But the lead was short-lived, as junior Sam Franklin was walked, stole second, advanced to third on an error, and finally made it home off of sophomore Jeff Reynolds’ single up the middle in the top of the third.
In the fourth, junior Dillon O’Neill stepped up on defense and made a huge diving catch on a sinking line drive in center field to preserve the tie.
“Having [O’Neill] out there at center field today was absolutely huge for us,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said.
Reynolds led the Crimson offense with four RBI, including two off of a two-out double that helped put Harvard up, 4-1, in the top of the fifth. The Hawks answered quickly with a homer and three runs to even the score again.
But O’Neill, Franklin, and Reynolds combined efforts at bat to break the tie and give the Crimson a two-run lead in the top of the seventh inning. Novak struck out Hartford’s first two batters, and Franklin got under a pop-up to left field for the final out to secure the victory.
HARVARD 6, HARTFORD 5
In yesterday’s opener, Harvard overcame some powerful pitching by the Hawks’ starter and some unexpected pitching challenges of its own to come out with the win.
To start off the game, a first-inning error allowed Hartford jump ahead, and the Hawks continued to score in the next two frames.
“The error turned into a run, and next thing you know, we’re down 3-0,” Walsh said.
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s bats were kept silent by Hartford pitcher Matt Thatcher, who took a no-hitter into the top of the fifth.
“We were taking good swings and making good hard contact, but we just didn’t have much to show for it,” Walsh said.
Harvard’s starting pitcher, junior Eric Eadington, was taken out after three innings due to stiffness in his forearm, but fellow junior Daniel Berardo came in and gave up only two hits in another three innings of play.
Hartford was up, 5-3, by the end of the sixth, but the Crimson rallied in the top of the seventh and scored three runs to take the 6-5 lead.
Sophomore Jonah Klees came in for Berardo, who took a Hawk hit to the hip, and struck out one Hartford batter in the final frame.
The final out came on a crucial play by Harvard’s defense, when O’Neill chased down a hit at the left center-field wall. The center fielder got the ball to junior shortstop Sean O’Hara, who then made a powerful throw to junior captain Tyler Albright at the plate, just in time to beat what would have been Hartford’s tying run.
Yesterday’s success was critical for the Crimson considering its upcoming schedule.
“It’s definitely big to get some wins under our belt,” Suter said. “And it’s a good feeling going into this midweek game and especially the Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WEST HARTFORD, Conn.—Last season, a doubleheader in which the Harvard baseball team managed to score only three runs would likely have put the Crimson on the wrong end of a sweep. If Harvard’s bats weren’t clicking, the team’s inexperienced and inconsistent pitching staff could not be counted on to pick up the slack.
This year, the Crimson’s strength lies on the mound, and while Harvard crossed home plate on just three occasions on Saturday in a twinbill against Sacred Heart on the University of Hartford’s Fiondella Field, the Crimson managed to split the pair of seven-inning games.
In Game 1, defensive lapses and an anemic offensive showing squandered a stellar outing by sophomore pitcher Conner Hulse in a 1-0 Harvard loss to the Pioneers.
The Crimson rebounded in the nightcap, riding a home run by junior captain Tyler Albright and a sixth-inning rally to a 3-2 victory.
“I feel like we played good baseball today, but we could have played a lot better,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said.
“With the pitching we’ve got a good idea, but we’re not there defensively and offensively yet.”
HARVARD 3, SACRED HEART 2
With its bats lying dormant on Saturday, the Crimson needed a boost in Game 2 of its doubleheader against the Pioneers. Enter Albright.
With his team down, 1-0, in the top of the fourth inning, the Harvard captain jumped on the first pitch Sacred Heart pitcher Troy Scribner threw to him and blasted an opposite-field shot over the right-field fence.
“Basically Coach [Walsh] just said, ‘Jump on the fastball,’” Albright said. “I just figured, ‘What the hell?’ Let’s just go after the first pitch. It was kind of surprising to hit it to the opposite field. It kind of felt like it turned around the team a little bit.”
Harvard was able to add two more runs in the sixth, and sophomore pitchers Marcus Way and Will Keuper held down the fort on the mound. Way allowed just two runs in five and two-thirds innings of work, and the lefty Keuper wiggled his way out of trouble to nail down the save.
“I didn’t think Marcus had his good fastball today, but he pitched well enough,” Walsh said. “[He] kept them off-stride with the breaking ball. Keuper came in and did a nice job...He’s shown a lot of composure.”
Way has been particularly valuable to the Crimson, excelling on the mound while mashing at the plate. He is third on the team with a 3.68 ERA and leads the squad in slugging percentage.
SACRED HEART 1, HARVARD 0
Hulse pounded the strike zone with a blistering fastball in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, holding the Pioneers scoreless into the bottom of the sixth.
“Conner pitched a hell of a game,” Albright said.
But the Crimson offense provided its emerging ace with no margin of error, and when the errors came, the game went for Harvard.
With two outs in the sixth, Sacred Heart’s Mike Drowne hit a high fly ball to left. Harvard junior Sam Franklin seemed to have it squared up, but he lost the ball in the sun and it hit the grass for a double.
Hulse buckled down and induced a ground ball to third off the bat of Pioneer Steve Tedesco. Sophomore Jeff Reynolds fielded the ball at third base with a backhanded stab and considered tagging Drowne before throwing to first. The hesitation cost Reynolds, and his toss sailed over senior first baseman Dan Zailskas’ head, allowing Drowne to score the game’s only run.
“[Making the tag] is a decent play when the ball’s hit to your backhand and you have to make the long throw,” Walsh said, “but it got [Reynolds] out of sync, and he’s gotta throw the ball across the diamond. You wish you played on turf all the time, because then you would have known to one-hop it over there.”
But all hope was not lost for the Crimson players, who loaded the bases in the top of the seventh and final inning with no outs and seemed on the verge of a comeback.
Harvard’s chances for victory seemed even more realistic when Franklin hit a screaming line drive to left, but Tedesco quickly deflated the Crimson’s aspirations. The Sacred Heart senior snatched the ball out of the air with a leaping grab and unleashed a strike to home plate, gunning down sophomore right fielder Brent Suter, who had tagged from third.
With runners on first and second, Albright grounded out, and Harvard suffered a 1-0 loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of the season, Harvard coach Joe Walsh envisioned a deep starting rotation with a pair of studs at the top. It turns out he just didn’t know who they would be.
With junior Max Perlman continuing to recover from Tommy John surgery and last year’s most effective starter, sophomore Brent Suter, limited by his play in the outfield, the Crimson has turned to second-year hurlers Conner Hulse and Marcus Way to anchor the staff. After Saturday’s doubleheader against Sacred Heart, it became clear that the pair is up to the task.
“Last year, [the sophomores] were thrown into starting roles as freshmen, but they’ve been able to mature a lot,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “They got a lot of innings in the bubble and at practice this fall, so they’re emerging as our top pitchers now.”
Hulse began the day with a stellar outing, amassing a strikeout per inning as he overwhelmed the Pioneer batters.
“Conner pitched a hell of a game,” Albright said. “We needed somebody to step up—as coach said, somebody to be a bulldog—and he showed it in that game, just attacking hitters.”
Hulse worked five scoreless innings, for the most part outdueling Sacred Heart’s senior ace, Corey Corcoran. The sophomore relied heavily on his fastball, which often blew right by the Pioneer bats.
“I thought Conner had an exceptional fastball today,” Walsh said. “He’s throwing as hard as I’ve ever seen him.”
Hulse and Corcoran appeared destined to push the contest to extra innings before defensive lapses undermined the Harvard pitcher’s shutout bid. With two outs in the bottom of the sixth, Hulse forced leadoff hitter Mike Drowne to pop up to left field. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the ball drifted directly into the sun, preventing junior Sam Franklin from making a play. Sophomore Jeff Reynolds then misplayed a seemingly-harmless ground ball, allowing Drowne to come around and score.
Despite Harvard’s eventual 1-0 defeat, Hulse posted a dominant stat line—six innings pitched, no earned runs, four hits, and six strikeouts—that left Walsh encouraged about the status of the rotation.
“We made a lot of little mistakes,” the coach said. “Yet, if you try to look at the positive things, we had great starting pitching.”
That solid work on the mound continued with Way, who proved equally effective, if not dominant, in the nightcap. The sophomore cleanup hitter did double duty all day as the designated hitter but still managed a strong outing through 5.2 innings.
With a mix of offspeed pitches, Way kept the Pioneer hitters guessing, yielding back-to-back hits only once.
“I didn’t think Marcus had as good a fastball today, but he pitched well enough to keep them offstride with the breaking ball,” Walsh said.
Way allowed just five hits and one walk—the only free pass issued by a Crimson pitcher on the day—and departed the game in the sixth with a 3-2 lead.
But Harvard’s strong effort on the mound didn’t end with the starters, as sophomore Will Keuper came on in relief to earn the save. After striking out Jared Balbach looking to end the sixth, Keuper showed the poise that has characterized his second year, working out of a jam in the final frame.
Sophomore Mike Olszyk drilled a first-pitch double to left center, giving the Pioneers a chance to tie the ballgame, but Keuper quickly notched two strikeouts and a lineout to close the game and earn the Crimson a split on the day.
“Keuper came in and did a nice job after a leadoff double,” Walsh said. “He showed a lot of composure.”
As the offense continues to look for a rhythm early in the season, Harvard will rely on its pitchers to keep the squad competitive. With the sophomore class emerging to anchor the rotation and the bullpen, the Crimson has finally seen its tremendous depth on the mound blossom into a dominant group.
PERLMAN’S STATUS
While the squad is content with its strong starters thus far, Harvard still awaits the return of staff ace Perlman. Twelve months after Tommy John surgery, the hurler was on pace to make an impact this year before experiencing biceps tenderness in practice.
“[Perlman] had it checked out and it was nothing, but he’s been very tentative with it since,” Walsh said. “He has not thrown hard since. It’s hard to push somebody when they’re coming back from Tommy John, but he was doing so well. I don’t know what to expect.”

CORRECTION: March 30, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 29 sports article "Pitchers Shine in Second Season" incorrectly stated that junior Max Perlman had his surgery 14 months ago. In fact, the surgery occurred 12 months ago, according to Perlman's father.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While revenge may be sweet, the Harvard women’s water polo team learned it isn’t always easy.
During the opening of this year’s season, the Crimson faced rival Marist in a tight battle but fell, 12-10. This Saturday, in its last competition before Northern Division play begins, Harvard (11-9) again fell by two goals to the Red Foxes (7-12), losing, 10-8, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
“It was a good game,” sophomore Ita Barton-Kettleborough said. “We kept fighting all the way through, but we couldn’t quite finish it.”
The first quarter started with a rampage from Marist as the Red Foxes took a 5-2 lead, with back-to-back goals from Marist senior Rachel Sunday, who was a thorn in the Crimson’s side the entire match.
“We just got off to a slow start,” Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy said. “[Sunday] had a great game. It’s just frustrating that we didn’t play as well as we could have. I think if we played them a third time we would beat them.”
Maintaining a three-point lead, the Red Foxes continued to put the pressure on McCarthy, taking a 7-4 lead into the locker room at halftime.
“We had a couple of runs where we really meshed as a team and other parts where we didn’t quite manage to cover each other as well,” said Barton-Kettleborough, who scored once for Harvard.
The first eight minutes of the second half proved a test for the Crimson, as Marist’s Sunday placed two more in the back of the net. Harvard remained scoreless in the third period, trailing, 9-4.
“I think we were a different team [from February] and they were a different team, but the game was quite similar,” Barton-Kettleborough said. “Both teams had parts of the game where they played really well and other parts where it didn’t go so well.”
While the Red Foxes owned the third period, the Crimson took control of the final eight minutes, scoring four goals to Marist’s one.
Freshman Aisha Price completed a hat trick for Harvard, while sophomore Shannon Purcell scored twice. Sophomores Devan Kennifer and Monica Zdrojewski joined Barton-Kettleborough in tallying one goal each.
“We had a really nice rally,” McCarthy said. “We almost came back and won it, but it was just too little, too late.”
“We really left it all in the pool in the fourth quarter,” she continued. “That’s our team, we aren’t going to quit.”
Missing from the Crimson’s score sheet was freshman Elise Molnar who remained out of the pool with a concussion sustained over spring break.
“We have such a small team that anytime someone is sick or injured it definitely affects the dynamics of the team,” McCarthy said. “We are not dependent on any one player, but we have a very small roster, so its important for everyone to stay healthy, stay uninjured.”
Even with Molnar out, Harvard continued to put pressure on senior opposing goalie Jessica Getchius. But with Getchius’ nine saves on the night, Saturday’s game became another learning tool for the defeated Crimson.
“There were definitely good points in which we had good play as a team,” Price said. “We’ve realized we have a lot to work on individually as players, and [in terms of] figuring out how to help each other look better and play well.”
“It was a case where we played as a team, and we lost as a team,” Barton-Kettleborough said. “It was a team effort all around.”
While Harvard will not face the Red Foxes again this season, the team looks forward to its next four matches, hopefully with Molnar back in the lineup. With five weekends until the Eastern Championships, the Crimson faces two games each against rivals Brown and Hartwick.
“It’s a matter of figuring out how to work better as a team,” Price said. “We are obviously learning a lot. We have [two weeks] before our next game, so we are just trying to work harder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and freshman Joshua Tchan teamed up in doubles to earn two victories for the Harvard men’s tennis team, which split the weekend with a loss versus No. 24 Duke and a win over Quinnipiac at the Murr Center on Friday. The Crimson (9-7) was beaten soundly by the Blue Devils (7-5), 4-0, but Harvard bounced back in the evening to get a 6-1 victory against the Bobcats (4-1).
“All in all, it was exactly what we hoped,” Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “Our goal was to come out and play a great team and hope not to get injured, because we have an Ivy opener against Columbia and Cornell next week.”
HARVARD 6, QUINNIPIAC 1
Harvard dominated the second game of its doubleheader with a 6-1 victory over the Bobcats Friday evening. The match provided a great opportunity for the team members that rarely see action.
“The second match against Quinnipiac was a chance for our guys who don’t get much exposure to play,” Fish said. “We like to coach a deep squad—it’s just that you can’t always get them into a match. We love to see them play because they work just as hard as anyone else, if not harder. We may need all these guys to get through the Ivies.”
The Crimson swept the doubles point, with Chijoff-Evans and Tchan taking No. 1 doubles, 8-5, freshmen Christo Schultz and Will McNamee winning at No. 2, 8-3, and sophomores Davis Mangham and Mac McAnulty getting an 8-3 win on the third court.
“It was great for our doubles team to practice,” Fish said. “We are really getting some rhythms on running our plays. The matches were good points. The scores were not all that close, but the points were good, so our guys could just keep working on the things they want to do better and get some momentum with it.”
In singles play, Harvard continued to dominate, with Chijoff-Evans recording a 6-2, 6-0 win at No. 1 and Mangham sweeping two sets, 6-0, 6-0, at No. 5. Sophomore Alistair Felton, Schultz, and McAnulty also won in straight sets.
“It never hurts players to get a win,” Fish said. “We play a really tough schedule, and we play some of the best teams in the country...so we want to remember how to win.”
NO. 24 DUKE 4, HARVARD 0
Duke came into the match ranked No. 24 in the country, and even without its top singles player, Henrique Cunha, the Blue Devils quickly took care of business in a decisive 4-0 victory, sweeping the doubles match as well as No. 2, 4, and 6 singles.
The Crimson was also missing junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Andy Nguyen, its No. 2 and 3 singles players, respectively.
“The Duke game was a terrific match for us,” Fish said. “They are playing without their No. 1 player, who is one of the best guys in the country from Brazil, and we are playing without our No. 2 and 3 players—Aba and Andy. They’re not big injuries, but we didn’t want to risk them here, because once you’re in the Ivies, that’s what we are really competing for.”
Chijoff-Evans and Tchan got a victory in No. 2 doubles, defeating Duke sophomore Torsten Wietoska and junior Alain Michel, 8-6. But just when Harvard seemed to have a shot at taking the doubles point by sending number its top team into a tie break, Felton and Schultz could not pull it out, losing to Blue Devil senior Dylan Arnould and sophomore David Holland, 8-7 (12-10).
“I was very, very pleased with the way our kids played doubles, right up and down the line,” Fish said. “To have the doubles go down to tie breaker at No. 1 with a brand new team [was great].”
With both teams facing doubleheaders, the Crimson and Duke agreed beforehand to stop the match if one team gained a 4-0 lead. Felton fell to Arnould in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, at No. 2 singles, Holland defeated Schultz, 6-3, 6-3, at No. 4, and Blue Devil sophomore Luke Marchese won against Mangham, 6-2, 6-2, at No. 6 to seal the victory for Duke.
All three of the remaining matches—Chijoff-Evans, Tchan, and captain Michael Hayes—were in the third set after splitting the first two.
“The three other matches that were on were still in the third set,” Chijoff-Evans said. “We weren’t playing with Andy, we weren’t playing with Aba, it doesn’t look close, but if the match was played out full, it would be 4-3.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long winter spent training indoors has quickly paid dividends for the Harvard women’s golf team.
A week after traveling to Florida over spring break to play outdoors for the first time since the fall season, the Crimson returned to the Sunshine State this weekend for another dual match and took home yet another victory—the squad’s fourth straight.
Harvard downed Lynn University, 298-326, Saturday afternoon at Boca Woods Country Club in Boca Raton, Fla., following up last Thursday’s win over the University of Central Florida.
“I was curious to see, after being home for a week and not getting to practice every day, if we could continue over some of the work we did over spring break, and we did that very well,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said.
The 6,050-yard, par-72 Lakes Course was less tricky than others on which the team had practiced down south, and it showed, as all five of the Crimson’s top scorers broke the 80-stroke barrier.
Four scores were counted in the team event.
Captain Claire Sheldon had the lowest total overall with an even-par 72—also her season low.
“I actually played with her on Friday, and her game looks very, very good right now,” Rhoads said. “She’s the farthest along coming out of the winter that I’ve ever seen her.”
Though Sheldon emphasized a need to continue working on her short game, she echoed her coach’s glowing evaluation of her play.
“I’m hitting the ball well, and my swing feels good,” Sheldon said. “At this point in the season, that gives me a lot of confidence. I feel like I didn’t lose ground over the winter—if anything, I improved my swing.”
Sophomore Jane Lee and freshman Katie Sylvan each turned in a three-over 75, tying for second.
After impressing her coach with a second-place performance last week, Lee continued to prove that it wasn’t a fluke.
“It’s not a surprise anymore,” Rhoads said. “It’s just the level she’s playing at right now. Her game looks solid, it looks repetitive...the results are speaking for themselves.”
Lee credited a newfound mental strength which has brought improvement in her second year of competition.
“Even though some of my shots weren’t so great, I always felt in control of my game,” Lee said. “I never got flustered or worried. It was actually one of the most relaxed rounds I’ve had since I’ve been at Harvard.”
A native of San Diego, Calif., the rookie Sylvan has faced a different sort of challenge in getting accustomed to a variety of climates, including a winter in Cambridge spent indoors.
“You always wonder the first time when someone hasn’t taken a break, and then they do take a big break, how will they react when they come out?” Rhoads said. “Obviously she’s reacted very well.”
Right behind Lee and Sylvan was sophomore Christine Cho, who fired a 76—one stroke better than Maha Haddioui, who had the lowest score amongst Fighting Knight golfers with a 77.
Crimson freshman Chloe Atlchek rounded out her team’s scoring with an 86, while Lynn had three players record rounds of 83 and a fourth one stroke behind.
In addition to the team play, each school had individuals participate as well.
Harvard junior Mia Kabasakalis and senior Sarah Harvey finished with scores of 77 and 82, respectively.
The Fighting Knights’ best individual performer was Ai Kongpaisarnnatee, who recorded a 79.
The Crimson will now prepare for a shorter trip, as it will travel to Cape Cod this Saturday to battle Dartmouth and Brown.
The shift back to playing in the conditions of the Northeast—adjusting to more layers of clothing and varying ball flights—will be critical for the rest of the season, but Rhoads expressed confidence in his team’s attitude.
“If we’re doing our job, we tend to be very good at thinking about things correctly, about trying to control what we can control,” Rhoads said. “If we keep that idea in mind, I think the transition will be fine.”
With the Ivy League Championships less than a month away, timing now becomes everything. Rhoads stressed the importance of ensuring his team is playing its best when the stakes are highest.
“Golf likes to cycle,” Rhoads said. “To be at our peak cycle right now would be dangerous for Ivies. If we’re in the middle of our cycle, then that’s a good thing. Everything’s going to be about how hard we work, and how well we work, between now and Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With mantras like, “There is no ‘I’ in team,” coaches customarily encourage their squads to become unified as a group.  But this weekend, the Harvard track and field team followed a different mindset: “Divide and conquer.”
With both the UCF Invitational and the Stanford Invitational taking place this past Saturday, Crimson coach Jason Saretsky split his team between the sunny climates, with sprinters, jumpers, and throwers traveling to Orlando, Fla., and middle-distance and distance runners going to Palo Alto, Calif., to compete in more individually-focused meets.
“The Stanford meet and the Central Florida meet are less about team competition and more about individual effort,” Saretsky said. “That’s why I was so pleased with how well the weekend went. I thought we got a lot of good things done in both places.”
Despite the squad’s separation, Harvard was represented well from coast to coast. Between UCF and Stanford, the Crimson team members earned multiple victories, strong finishes, and personal bests.
“Overall it was an awesome weekend for Harvard track,” Saretsky said. “I thought we were getting some great work and some really strong performances, and I am really pleased with how things went.”
UCF INVITATIONAL
The meet started strong for the Crimson women when freshman Sydnie Leroy captured a second-place finish in the pole vault with a height of 3.50 meters in one of the first events of the day. She was shortly followed by freshman Olivia Weeks, who claimed Harvard’s first win of the competition with a victory in the triple jump, posting a mark of 12.24 meters.
Junior Jessica Fronk then earned another title for the Crimson in the javelin event with a throw of 45.79 meters—a mark that cleared her closest competitor’s effort by 7.5 meters.
The men’s side had its own share of success led by co-captain Jack Brady, who captured three top-three finishes. Brady started off with a decisive victory for Harvard in the discus throw, posting a mark of 49.01 meters that surpassed the second-place finisher’s score by almost 11 meters.  He then led the Crimson in the hammer throw by earning the runner-up title with a score of 56.74 meters. Juniors Eric Clayman and Ablorde Ashigbi closely followed him to help Harvard claim a two-four-five finish in the event.  In the shot put, freshman Edwin Brucker and Brady recorded the top-two collegiate marks of 16.40 and 15.78 meters, respectively, and co-captain Justin Grinstead earned a second-place finish in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 54.15 seconds.
“It was a small meet to work on [improving] our team with some good performances and some PB’s,” Grinstead said.  “I think it is pretty promising because people were able to do some good times, but it still shows areas where we need improvement, so it is helpful.”
STANFORD INVITATIONAL
The Stanford meet is “known for fast times and really good races,” according to Saretsky, and the Crimson measured up well to the competition.
“We had twelve athletes out here, and six of them ran their lifetime best, so there were a number of standout performances,” Saretsky continued.
The top finisher of the meet from Harvard was junior Claire Richardson, who placed second in the 5,000-meter race with a time of 16:20.98.
On the men’s side, junior Dan Chenoweth earned a third-place finish in the same event, crossing the line in 13:59.43, and was closely followed by senior Chas Gillespie, who posted a time of 14:02.19.
Sophomore Darcy Wilson took fourth in the 1,500 meters at 3:53.82, and sophomore Brian Paison and freshman Jeff Homer posted strong times for the Crimson in the 800-meter competition.
“I think this weekend sets us up well for the outdoor season, and we were able to take advantage of some really good weather,” Saretsky said. “We’ve got some more work to be done in order to get where we want to go, but this is shaping up to be a strong season, and the program will continue on its path to getting better.”

Have you ever wanted to go head-to-head with some of Harvard's best athletes? Yesterday, you had your chance.
Following the excitement of March Madness, the Harvard Cancer Society’s 3-on-3 tournament took place yesterday afternoon. The event raised over $300 for the Jimmy Fund, a Boston-based charity group that supports cancer research for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and targeted a different audience than many other HCS events.
The winning team of juniors Collier Winters and Collin Zych and freshman DJ Monroe, all members of the football team, received iPods for their accomplishments, but everyone came away with the rewarding feeling of having helped support cancer research.
Over 21 teams participated in the tournament—the brainchild of sophomores Brian Butler and Chris Guenard, co-chairs of the Hoops against Cancer program within HCS—including varsity basketball co-captain Doug Miller. Participation ranged from freshmen to seniors, and even alumni signed up to play. While Miller’s team definitely had the height and size advantage out of all the teams in the competition, in the end, it was the quickness and sharp shooting of Winters, Zych, and Monroe that took home the gold.
Zych, next year's football captain, and Winters were both All-Ivy selections in 2009—Zych at defensive back and Winters at quarterback.
The event follows the HCS Date Auction, which happened earlier this month and saw athletes like former Olympian junior Emily Hughes, women's basketball sophomore Brogan Berry, and men's basketball co-captain Jeremy Lin up for bid to benefit HCS's work.

Just in case winning two national titles in her first collegiate squash season wasn’t enough, Harvard freshman Laura Gemmell was the obvious candidate for one more honor. This morning, the College Squash Association named her a first-team All-American, an accolade that Gemmell easily deserved after finishing her campaign with a perfect 16-0 record.
Gemmell was not the only member of the national champion women’s squash team to be honored. Four of her upperclassmen teammates were named to the second team: co-captain Johanna Snyder, juniors Alisha Mashruwala and June Tiong, and sophomore Nirasha Guruge.
Guruge and Mashruwala have both been All-Americans in each of their college seasons, with Guruge earning her second straight selection and Mashruwala earning her third.
For a team that has already won the CSA National Championship, the Ivy Title, and the Barhite Award, which recognizes the team with the best dual record in the country, these All-America honors are just icing on a very big, yummy cake.

Spring break’s uncharacteristically warm and sunny weather brought hoards of people out of the libraries and into the light, inspiring them to indulge in one of Harvard students’ favorite pastimes—Ultimate Frisbee. And while we all may enjoy a quick pick up game with friends, the occasional wayward toss can turn the Yard into somewhat of a minefield for unsuspecting tourists.
These unfortunate collisions could be a sign that we ought to work on our technique, or maybe just leave the sport to the members of Red Line and Quasar, Harvard’s men’s and women’s Ultimate Frisbee club teams.
While some traditionalists may question the legitimacy of this pastime-turned-sport, the club teams are some of the most active on campus, and Red Line has existed since the 70s, although under various other clever monikers. Quasar is a slightly newer team, but both are making waves amongst national competition.
As of March 25, Quasar was ranked 18th in the Ultimate Players Association College Women’s Division, and Red Line was in a tie for first in the College Open Division with the University of Oregon, who dealt it one of its few losses of the season.
Both teams will continue play over the next few months, so maybe we can all pick up a few tips in time for Cambridge’s next sunny day.

He led all Ivy freshmen in assists, steals, and three-point shooting percentage. But perhaps the most impressive thing about guard Brandyn Curry's rookie season—a year in which he earned an honorable-mention All-Ivy selection from Basketball-U.com while twice being named Ivy League Rookie of the Week—was that he was playing hurt.
Curry said today that he plans to undergo surgery Wednesday to repair a torn left patellar tendon—an injury suffered at the end of his senior year at Hopewell High (N.C.).
Nonetheless, Curry gutted it out this past season, getting action in all 29 of the Crimson's games.
"It couldn't get better, and it couldn't get any worse," Curry said of the ailment.
The point guard estimated he was playing at about 80% his freshman year, as the injury affected his responsibilities on defense and his jumping ability significantly.
"For instance, the worst was guarding Louis Dale or Kemba Walker on a crossover," Curry said. "My first-step explosion, changing direction was a lot slower than normal, and I couldn't really jump."
Towards the end of the 2009-10 season, the condition worsened, as Curry began to compensate by placing more pressure on his right knee.
He expects to be out for at least 4-6 weeks after the operation.
"I know I can't run for at least three weeks," Curry said, expressing hopes of working out during the summer.

Where's cheap sushi that doesn't suck?
Sushi's a funny kind of creature.
Thankfully, we've come a long way from the days when the very concept of raw fish was repulsive, but still, it can be hard to find a place that pleases both wallet and palate. The key to good sushi is really the freshness of the fish—and if you're used to eating the stuff in Japan, just about no restaurant in Boston will satisfy you. In that case, O Ya, the stratospherically-priced sushi joint anointed the best new restaurant in 2008 by The New York Times, might do the trick.
But most of us live on budgets. The best local option near Harvard Square is Blue Fin, in Porter Square Exchange Mall. Nosh on decent quality sushi for low prices. Plus, it's surrounded by fun, casual Asian eateries. Avoid the other sushi bar called Masa's Sushi Bar (replacing the old Kotobukiya Sushi Bar). it's not worth your time. To get here, you can either walk up Mass. Ave. or take the T one stop to Porter Square.
A bit more expensive and regarded as very good is Fugakyu in Brookline, accessible by the 66 bus. (Get on at JFK and Eliot St, get off at Harvard St. at Beacon St.) And then there's Genki Ya, also in the same neighborhood. Their schtick is organic sushi, but really, it's just plain delicious—and reasonably priced!
My friend throws in a recommendation for Snappy Sushi in Davis Square. They have lunch specials in the $10 range. Not bad!
What is the best cupcake you ever had and where?
There's a saying goes something like "The best cupcakes in life are free." So I would have to say that the best bites I ever had were that time Kickass Cupcakes donated a box to the STUFF magazine office. I was interning at the time, writing e-mail blurbs and researching male bikini waxes, subsisting on HUDS bag lunches. Not only were they bag lunches, they were salad bag lunches. So there I'd be, munching on baby carrots, lettuce, and apples, trying to convince myself that I was enjoying myself. (Or that I was doing something good for my health.)
So when I saw that sumptuous variety box ranging from s'mores cupcakes to mojito cupcakes, it brightened my week with the efficacy of a diabetic's blood sugar spike. "Super Chocolate" cupcake topped with bittersweet choco ganache, you take my cake.

Campus  mailing lists were sent into a misguided flurry of excitement over the  prank announcements that Weird Al Yankovich and Michelle Branch will be  Yardfest Artists this coming April 18.
Students received at least two faux advertisements. One prank e-mail went out at 10:02 p.m. over Eliot House's e-mail list, proclaiming that Weird Al  Yankovich would be an artist at this year's Yardfest. Yankovich is the author of the smash hit “White and Nerdy,” a parody  of Chamillionaire’s “Ridin.”
The creator of the Yankovich e-mail, Paul B. VanKoughnett '12, also sent out a  similar e-mail announcing Michelle Branch's presence at Yardfest. In the e-mail Branch was noted to be “a  zero-time Grammy award winner,” who is “kind-of-well-known for her hit  singles.”
As funny as these  announcements may be, they are untrue. The College Events Board  vice-chair, Stephen Anastos Jr. '11, and Crimson editor Synne D.  Chapman '11, who is the director of the Harvard Concert Commission,  confirmed that there are only three artists performing at this year’s  Yardfest.
“Yes, the e-mails about  additional Yardfest artists were pranks.” Chapman said in an e-mail,  “Patrick Park, Wale, and Kid Cudi will be performing at Yardfest, and  that is our complete and final lineup. We're really excited about the  artists we have, and from what we've heard, so is the rest of campus.”
Maybe next year, Harvard.

Angela Su '12, one of three Eleganza executive producers, was recently profiled in Teen Vogue for her work combining fashion and community service. In order to figure out how Su ended up in the pages of the international fashion and lifestyle magazine, we went straight to the source and talked to Su herself.
FlyBy: How did it come about that you were profiled in Teen Vogue? 
 
Su: I read Teen Vogue, and I'm part of their mailing list. They send out e-mails periodically. They have these things called "advertorials," which are basically a cross between an advertisement and an editorial. Basically they send out an e-mail that reads "To the Teen Vogue It Girls: Do you give back to the community? Write your story, and we'll feature you in an issue of Teen Vogue." So, I just sent them an e-mail explaining my involvement with Eleganza, and they published it.
FlyBy: How did you get involved with Eleganza? 
 
Su: My freshman year, I was publicity chair, so I was responsible for making sure that people came to the show and, basically, for raising awareness. I got involved because someone handed me a flyer in front of the Science Center that read "Do you love fashion? Are you interested in fashion? finance? publicity?" I thought that this would be a very good place for me, and, after going to the information session, the message of Eleganza really spoke to me. So, I decided to get involved.
FlyBy: How does Eleganza give back to the community?
Su: All profits from the show are donated to the Center for Teen Empowerment in Boston. Last year, for instance, Eleganza was able to donate $4,500 to the Center. 
 
FlyBy: What fashion advice to you have for fellow undergraduates? 
 
Su: Contrary to popular opinion, fashion is not dead at Harvard. I think that's a perception that needs to be challenged. Besides Eleganza, there are other great fashion organizations on campus: Identities, Project East, and the Vestis Council. There are a lot of different ways to get involved. Like any personal hobby, fashion requires initiative to pursue. At Harvard, it's a little harder to pursue fashion instead of something more traditional. But, at the same time, there are outlets for it, and they're not too hard to find.
FlyBy: Any parting words? 
 
Su: Come to Eleganza on April 24!
