After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve logged onto Twitter or opened a news site in the past two weeks, you’ve probably heard of Joe Exotic. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Netflix’s “Tiger King” has taken off as the escapist binge-watch of choice, while Joe Allen Maldonado-Passage (he goes by Joe Exotic), the mulleted, trigger-happy zoo owner at the center of the documentary series, has become a figure of public fascination. With much of the country stuck inside, Exotic, his larger-than-life crew of misfit employees, and his charismatic rivals offer exactly what viewers are looking for: an immersive world that, despite being nonfiction, is even more unbelievable than the one we live in.
Right off the bat, Exotic is a captivatingly unpredictable centerpiece to the show, strolling confidently into tiger cages in sequined animal-print outfits, threatening death to his enemies, and unabashedly plugging his country music career. Directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin usher viewers into Exotic’s dramatic, messy universe with intimate footage of his personal breakdowns and hilarious coverage of the zoo’s haphazard operations, animated by a cast of off-kilter staff.
While the show’s subtitle promises “Murder, Mayhem, and Madness,” the first few episodes barely mention murder, instead attempting to make sense of the absurd lifestyles of the “exotic animal people” who share Exotic’s obsession. There’s Mahamayavi Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, a polygamist South Carolina zoo owner whose “extended family” of wives operates like a cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug kingpin who runs a secretive exotic pet ranch in Miami; and, of course, Carole Baskin, a big cat conservationist and Exotic’s sworn enemy.
Baskin, an animal rights activist, is the perfect foil to Exotic; while he brings frenetic chaos to every situation, she never breaks her unnervingly calm facade. For years, Baskin has been drawing Exotic’s ire by accusing him of animal cruelty for breeding animal cubs and charging customers for “cub petting,” his most profitable tourist gimmick. While she calmly organizes fundraisers and attempts to shut down Exotic through legislative advocacy, commercial boycotts, and lawyers, Exotic responds with ad-hominem rage. He takes to his webshow to rail against Baskin and publicly accuse her of killing her husband, Don Lewis, decades before. Over the course of the series, their feud deepens and so does Exotic’s frenzied obsession: As Baskin’s efforts begin to succeed and his business crumbles, he pledges to drag her down with him.
The war between Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin unfolds upon the backdrop of their already bizarre personal lives, which lend even more addictive watchability to the show. From the collapse of Joe Exotic’s polyamorous three-person marriage to his gubernatorial campaign (led by the manager of his local Walmart gun department) to, yes, Carole Baskin’s husband’s disappearance, the show’s greatest asset is its neverending stock of weird background characters. Many story elements, from elaborate government sting operations to staged arson to shady zoo investors, seem so outlandish even a Hollywood writer couldn’t dream them up.
Chaiklin and Goode artfully navigate this goldmine of tales, humanizing their subjects despite the absurdity of their dramas. They push beyond the caricature that Exotic projects, painting a gripping portrait of a man shaped by his financial troubles, neediness, and endless desire for power. Further, they shed light on America’s massive wildlife trafficking and tourism industry, which is facilitating the abuse and confinement of millions of animals at any given time. One of the most poignant elements of the show is its portrayal of animal conditions in different environments, including Carol Baskin’s “sanctuary,” which Exotic alleges is no better than a typical zoo. To a viewer, this allegation rings true; many of the show’s so-called animal rights advocates are potentially engaging in the same exploitation they protest, yet the show never really explores or calls out their hypocrisy — which is surprising, given that it’s one of the main points of contention between Exotic and Baskin.
For Goode, the question of a conservationist’s duty is also personal. A hotelier and filmmaker, he is a devoted turtle and tortoise conservationist, and in 2005 he founded the Behler Chelonian Center, a reserve for endangered turtle and tortoise species in Ojai, California.
While the show doesn’t overtly villainize its subjects, it thoroughly documents the mass mistreatment of animals occurring at their hands. If any viewers had planned to visit an exotic animal zoo anytime soon, the show likely changed their minds. In the midst of its shocking, can’t-look-away entertainment, “Tiger King” subtly telegraphs a key message: America’s wildlife trafficking and breeding industry must be shut down, even if it means Joe Exotic will need a new moniker.

Ezra Miller is a name perhaps most synonymous with cult-classic movie roles and jaw-dropping red carpet fashion appearances — but for the past week their name has circulated on social media for a less than stellar reason.
On April 5, a video was uploaded to Twitter which showed Miller appearing to choke a young woman before pushing her to the ground outside a bar in Reykjavík, Iceland.
On April 1 at 6:00 p.m., witnesses say that Miller was confronted by a group of “pushy” fans at the bar Prikið Kaffihús. The video shows one of the women in the group approaching Miller with her hands waving in the air, to which Miller responded “Do you want to fight?” Miller then proceeded to wrap both their hands around the woman’s neck, push her against a dumpster, and then to the ground. The man filming appears to be initially unfazed, but as the woman hits the ground, he appears to grow concerned, repeating, “Woah bro, bro, bro,” and then immediately stopping his recording.
While it is not clear from the video itself if the nature of this confrontation was intended to be playful — and then perhaps crossed a line — a source at the bar claims the incident was categorically not a joke and that Miller was subsequently escorted off the property by bar staff. However, Reykjavík police were never called to investigate the altercation, and they have confirmed that Miller is not currently under investigation or facing charges.
Miller has many notable roles to their name, but perhaps the most high-profile is the Flash, also known as Barry Allen, in the current DC Extended Universe. They previously played this role in “Justice League,” but their standalone Flash film is set to be released in 2022. Fans of the DCEU immediately took to Twitter not only to ask Warner Brothers to remove Miller from the role, but also specifically to suggest that the role be taken over by Grant Gustin, who plays The Flash in the CW television series. One fan, @drewshabitauls, tweeted “Grant Gustin is talented, a dork, has the biggest heart, is the best Barry Allen and most importantly never attacked anyone.”
Ezra Miller and Warner Brothers have yet to comment on the incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Is it how it’s gonna be?” King Princess asked her audience on April 8, surveying her less-than-regal surroundings — fluffy white rugs slung across chairs, uneven lamplight, and a can of beer — with the stately resignation of a monarch in exile.
The question forms the outro of “Isabel’s Moment," the searching ballad King Princess chose as the opener to her Tiny Desk (Home) Concert, the quarantine-friendly spinoff to NPR’s popular video series.
“It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space,” the NPR website reads. With the help of two pastel blue guitars and a miniature keyboard, King Princess’ performance combined sonic minimalism with emotional extravagance.
As the final note of “Isabel’s Moment” rang out from the keyboard on her lap, she broke the pensive atmosphere with a chuckle at the camera.
“Welcome to the quarantine shed!” she joked before recounting her panicked attempts to pack as many instruments as she could in her carry-on.
The simplicity and slow tempo of “Isabel’s Moment,” which King Princess described as a tribute to “quarantine thirstiness,” made the number an obvious triumph from the start. Other songs, like “Prophet,” seemed less destined for success. When King Princess launched into the intro, she seemed unlikely to successfully recreate the lush, layered instrumentation of the sultry studio version by strumming one guitar and tapping her foot.
Always one to defy expectations, King Princess performed with enough intensity to eclipse any shortcomings caused by the lack of instrumental complexity. After minutes of rising tension, her voice jumped from a shriek to a warble, and she regained her cool self-assurance just in time to conclude the song with a slap of the fretboard.
She paused for a sip from her beer can before explaining her interpretation of “Prophet” in relation to the coronavirus pandemic, discussing challenges in the music industry.
While weighing the oddities of being a performer left indefinitely without a live audience — her upcoming concert engagements, including a European tour with Harry Styles, have been postponed — King Princess described the feeling of a return to her youth.
“We’re all trying to find that creative spark that we had as children,” she said. “It’s so lost on us now, because all we do is, like, schedule time to do our jobs.”
“I’m struggling,” she admitted. “But it’s really fun, too.”
King Princess propped her feet up on her amp and turned back to her guitar to perform the last song in the set: “Homegirl,” which she described as her “secret fave” of her album.
Once again, she interrupted the last note with a laugh. After several failed attempts at a final message for her fans — among them gems like “Mull over your nemeses and just think about your feuds” — she finally settled on one.
“Make some art during this time,” she urged viewers. “Make something that you would show in your middle show talent show… Have a Zoom party and show your talents.”
King Princess is certainly taking her own advice to heart. With her innovative and heartfelt Tiny Desk (Home) Concert, she’s proven that she can make any space her castle.

“I’m in love with Jesus Christ / He’s so nice,” self-proclaimed atheist Matty Healy sings in the opening lines to The 1975’s April 3 release, “Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America” — practically begging fans to do a double take. The track, the sixth single off the band’s upcoming album, “Notes on a Conditional Form,” features indie-rock artist Phoebe Bridgers, who was supposed to tour with the band on their now-postponed summer tour.
“Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America” is a stripped-down ballad, characterized by a light acoustic guitar and a horns section set far in the background. Its melody is refreshing and endlessly sweet, complementing Healy’s lyrics as they grapple with what it means to believe in a higher power while struggling with sexuality. No stranger to irony, Healy uses the song to outwardly claim devotion yet seems unsure of it throughout. “I’m in love, I’ll say it twice,” he sings in a failed attempt at sincerity. “Fortunately I believe, lucky me,” he later adds with Bridgers in the song’s chorus. So forced is his appeal to religion, and so outward his atheism in interviews and other songs, that the lyrics come across like a sad longing to belong. In his video for Genius’ “Verified” series, he shines light on the contradiction that arises from wanting to believe, yet being unable to: “I want salvation just as much as the next person,” he says. “I envy the faithful.”
It is this very contradiction that Healy explores in “Jesus Christ,” as his lyrics attempt to convince both his listeners and himself that he’s comfortable in his religion — or perhaps that he feels welcomed despite his love for another man, which the church and Jesus Christ would presumably find sinful. “I’m in love with a boy I know / But that’s a feeling I can never show,” he sings after describing how “low” he feels because of this love, or rather his inability to express it. Bridgers later echoes this sentiment, singing about her lust and love for “the girl next door” and the need to keep that love private just as Healy does. Their concern with religion and identity even crosses the line into existentialism, as their voices join to contemplate their own place in the world. “Soil just needs water to be, and a seed / So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?” they sing together.
Sonically, the song is gorgeous. The 1975 create a beautiful finger-picking pattern reminiscent of their other acoustic guitar-based tracks such as “Nana” or “She Lays Down” — two songs which are shamefully overlooked within the context of The 1975’s generally sparkling repertoire — with a folk-inspired twang that’s surprising for the band. Over the one lone guitar, Healy and Bridgers’s vocals blend seamlessly into ethereal harmonies, bringing out the best in each of their voices. Right as Bridgers begins to sing alone on the song’s second verse, she is joined by distorted horns and saxophones, edited to sound distant and haunting against the immediacy of Bridgers’s crystalline vocals.
In “Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America,” The 1975 are as sincere as ever, their lyrics characteristically cutting and clever with an added vulnerability that sets the song apart from the poppier numbers that appear to make up the majority of the upcoming album. Healy’s voice has nothing to hide behind — aside from Bridgers’s accompaniment — and at times the honesty of his words sting. At the same time, the lyrics are endlessly romantic, drawing listeners in to the thoughts that seem to plague Healy’s mind and creating the lovely, painful intimacy that The 1975 have made their own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During these next few weeks, about 150 million Americans will receive a check from the federal government as part of the COVID-19 Economic Impact Payments. But a large number of individuals who call the United States their second home will receive no help and will be expected to fend for themselves. Among them are students — international students — who pay their taxes, speak the national language, and, like everyone else, are searching for the “American Dream.” This group is substantial: America is home to over 1,000,000 international students who make up 5.5 percent of the nation’s total higher education population.
When COVID-19 cases were on the rise, many universities across the U.S. gave their students a fixed number of days to evacuate their dormitories. The international students who were able to flee the country before the institution of travel restrictions are now in different time zones, trying to join online classes at unreasonable hours of the day.
But those who were not able to travel to their home country because of financial constraints or travel restrictions already in place are now trapped in the U.S. In many cases, they have nowhere to live, are isolated from the community they bonded with, and lack a steady source of income.
This is the predicament I find myself in.
Put yourself in my shoes: You’re a student at an American university, and you call the dorms your home. Your main source of income involves helping professors set up classroom tech equipment. You’ve made friends who live all across the U.S. and the world.
Overnight, all of this disappears. You can’t go home because you can’t afford to, and you can’t risk exposing your parents, who are already immunocompromised, to the virus. How are your low-income Tanzanian parents, who would be considered severely low-income here in the U.S., going to survive if COVID-19 reaches your hometown?
Back here in your second home, if you fall sick, there is no one here to look out for you. If you suddenly find yourself in a medical emergency, there is no way either of your parents will be able to make it here to see you due to both financial and visa restrictions.
You try to assess your own financial situation and remember you spent $1600 of your savings booking a ticket to go home in July. When you ask the airline for a refund, you are given a travel voucher to be used at a later date instead. Through all of these challenging moments, you are expected to continue to attend your classes and learn the material.
You find yourself feeling helpless, alone, and praying that this will all be over soon.
But the U.S. could be doing more to help alleviate this difficult situation for international students like me by expanding the stimulus package to include us. From three perspectives — fiscal, public health, and moral — such an expansion would be beneficial.
First, given the fiscal value that foreign students add to the U.S. economy, keeping them financially stable in these trying times is a small price to pay. During the 2018-2019 academic year, international students contributed nearly $41 billion to the U.S. economy and supported over 450,000 jobs. Additionally, lawful permanent residents are liable for Social Security and Medicare taxes even though they may never experience the returns on these investments. In addition to acknowledging their contributions to the economy, providing financial support to international students would ensure that they aren’t forced into financial insecurity — a situation that could lead to a downstream economic impact by affecting their education and future plans in the U.S.
Secondly, from the public health perspective, the most efficient way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce contact with individuals. By providing international students with financial support, the U.S. encourages them to stay at home during this pandemic.
Finally, from a moral perspective, financial security is a human right. Socioeconomic status and financial well-being are inextricably intertwined with health. Many international students, who are restricted to working on-campus jobs, have lost their jobs due to university closures. Just like all other Americans, international students deserve to have an income to purchase food and other basic necessities. No one should go to bed hungry, especially during this pandemic.
Aside from international students, there are many other groups, such as asylum-seekers and undocumented immigrants, who have been sidelined from receiving governmental support. The same reasoning applies to them too. Ultimately, helping these marginalized groups reaffirms the commitment of the U.S. as a place that is welcoming for all.
Everyone’s wellbeing, regardless of citizenship status, must be considered as the pandemic continues to grow. There are places, including within the U.S., that have reached this conclusion. For example, in late March, Portugal temporarily gave all migrants and asylum-seekers in the country full citizenship rights — thus granting them access to social security and healthcare — while it deals with the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, California recently announced that it will commit $75 million of taxpayer money to create a disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants. The U.S. as a whole should follow these examples.
Until everyone in the U.S. is granted basic human rights, I will continue to call my parents daily through the shaky internet connection — together hoping for better days. Just like the pandemic transcends borders, compassion and aid must do the same. As humanity finds itself fighting a common threat, it must become more united than ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lately, my hometown has started to feel like a tinderbox.
Maybe this isn’t that surprising. I live in Westchester County, New York, which currently has a higher per capita rate of infection than New York City. Practically, this means that most of us know someone who has died from coronavirus; many have lost multiple people. Based on predictions for the pandemic, there will only be more to come. So, predictably, we’re all a little on edge.
Still, sometimes it feels like we’re on the brink of falling apart. Everyday interactions have become tense; the threat of the virus has stripped away many semblances of civility. Recently, in a twist straight out of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible”, a faction of the town has taken to blaming supermarket workers for coronavirus transmissions in the area. According to them, the carelessness of the cashiers is spreading the virus.
In fact, it’s probably true that food service workers are at higher risk of developing coronavirus than other groups. But that’s because they can’t work from home, not because they’re reckless or irresponsible. In such jobs, social distancing becomes functionally impossible. It’s worth remembering that as long as we have to eat, there will be people, often poor and non-white, who risk their lives to feed us.
This dynamic isn’t new. Plagues tend to hit the poor hardest, because unlike the wealthy, the poor can’t isolate. Today, poor people of color disproportionately do the kind of low-paying labor that is impossible to move online — as a result, people from these groups are dying at disturbingly high rates.
As of late, I’ve seen a number of news articles on the catastrophic impact of coronavirus on low-income communities of color. I wonder, though, if the media narrative is making it clear why these disparities exist. Without sufficient explanation of systemic racism, we might simply be left with a nebulous feeling that black and brown people have a greater risk of getting the virus. It’s a recipe for scapegoating. Instead of challenging the inequality that leads to higher rates of infection in specific communities, entire racial demographics might be blamed for the virus.
Case in point: a few days ago, a former classmate of mine, who is black, was told by a complete stranger to make sure that he wore a mask. The stranger, who was white, thought that because he was black, he was more genetically disposed to catching coronavirus.
There are a lot of reasons why poor people of color have disproportionately high rates of infection, many having to do with historic failures of the medical system. A very immediate cause, though, is that these people are being asked to do the work that nobody else wants to do. When sites of infection are mapped, this becomes particularly stark. In Boston, for example, the workforces of majority-minority neighborhoods are mostly made up of essential workers. These neighborhoods also have the highest rates of infection in the city.
Essential workers and people of color aren’t vectors of disease; they’re just on the losing end of a deeply unequal system. Ironically, the people blaming them for spreading coronavirus benefit from the fact that their “essential” work puts them in close proximity to the virus. Effectively, essential workers have become a kind of human shield.
Compounding this problem, many of these workers have very few protections from the virus. Throughout the country, food workers have been striking over low pay and lack of safety protections. Moreover, the government has paid a startling lack of attention to these workers; the Center for Disease Control recently issued guidelines allowing them to go back to work after potential coronavirus exposure. Failing to take the health of food workers seriously is a disaster waiting to happen for already vulnerable communities — one that we’re already seeing the beginnings of.
If you have enough money, you can bypass workers at the grocery store entirely by ordering online instead. Meanwhile, the people delivering your food might be underpaid, at higher risk of developing the virus, and lacking adequate healthcare. If you’re lucky enough to work inside your home, the least you could do is say thank you to people who can’t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past couple of weeks, both University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay have acknowledged the difficulty of planning for the upcoming fall semester. We don’t envy them. Bacow, in particular, has expressed fear that by the time those decisions will need to be made, there will still be significant uncertainty. And we share those concerns.
It’s at this point a hard-worn and oft-repeated fact that pandemics are defined more by their uncontrollable factors than by any obvious, let alone one-dimensional models. And that makes devising and implementing public health policies difficult. Harvard and other research institutions are already hard at work trying to understand the effectiveness of social distancing measures and developing a vaccine. But even assuming perfect knowledge and infinite institutional capability, the question of whether to reopen campus is still complicated by Harvard’s international student body and dense residential setting, as well as legal restrictions beyond the University’s control and the needs of other contingents of our community.
We cannot ask for a specific response to a crisis whose full extent we will not know until the fall. However, we urge the University to be conscious of two factors.
First, a Harvard College education simply cannot be replaced by classes over Zoom. Without the physical gathering of students and professors, much is lost. Virtual technologies, no matter how smooth and high-resolution, cannot replace dining hall conversations, the exchanges on the way in and out of classrooms, and the richness of body language. What remains, when you take these out, is a subpar educational, not to mention social, experience. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana is fond of reminding pretty much anyone who will listen that learning takes place mostly outside of the classroom. But with online college, there is nowhere outside the classroom.
We encourage the college to weigh that fact heavily in its decision-making process. If the University is considering having an online fall semester without granting students full freedom to take leaves of absence, they should instead postpone the semester. Anything else would unfairly diminish the value of a four-year college experience.
Indeed, the College would seem to have both the means and the logistical capability to postpone a semester. With the world’s largest University endowment, the University should be able to sustain itself for longer than many other institutions can. Moreover, by cutting the already long winter break, moving the spring semester later into May or June, and starting fall classes at an unusual time, it would not be impossible to schedule a postponed semester.
Second, uncertainty about the future is, as of right now, a source of significant stress for most members of our community. Moving forward, the University should provide an outline of the different possible scenarios and their respective contingency plans, as part of a push to raise the bar for effective and frequent communication. We were kicked off campus with only five days notice. We should be afforded more time to process and prepare for the different futures that may lay ahead of us now.
Students, faculty, and staff from all around the world are severely and individually affected by COVID-19. Everyone has their own unique set of challenges to face, their own planning to do, and varying resources with which to do so. For that reason, the University owes us some degree of preemptive transparency, so that we can all act as free and self-governing agents in the months ahead.
We understand the constraints that the University is facing and know we cannot reasonably expect our upcoming semester to look like any typical fall on the Charles River. Some sacrifices will likely be necessary, and we are ready to face them with courage and camaraderie. But we sincerely hope that the quality of our education and our capacity to choose for ourselves what that education might look like is not sacrificed in the process.
We would much rather sacrifice certain luxuries on campus than to cope with another semester on Zoom, and we would prefer an untraditional (perhaps later) semester on campus to than another one at home.
When next semester comes, no matter in what form or at what time, we sincerely hope that everyone will be safe, healthy, and ready to resume the powerful collective project of college life and learning. Until then, we hope the University will make a patient and informed decision on what to do, while doing its best to keep students up-to-date at each stage of the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Medical School Faculty Council passed resolutions in February calling for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies, but faculty who study environmental science say they are split on whether divestment would be effective in combatting climate change.
Several faculty said fossil fuel divestment would be a largely symbolic act.
Michaela J. Thompson, a preceptor in Environmental Science and Public Policy, said the symbolic nature of divestment by Harvard especially would have a far-reaching impact in tackling climate change.
“That symbolic nature is what is important,” Thompson said. “I grew up in Boston; Harvard is a symbol, it’s always been a symbol, and I think at this point in time, given the concerns of climate change, that symbolic pronouncement is something that Harvard should take a very serious understanding of its responsibility. I think that that symbolism is necessary.”
Other professors, however, disagreed. John P. Holdren, a professor of Environmental Policy, wrote in an email that divestment would distract Harvard faculty and students from more effective methods of combating climate change.
“It’s not only not the best form of action, it’s a counterproductive form of action,” he wrote. “It’s counterproductive because it would lead many Harvard faculty and students to imagine they’d struck an effective blow against climate change—and would likely reduce their focus on more productive measures—when it would actually be a misdirected blow. Just advocating for it is distracting people from measures that would actually be effective.”
Holdren suggested the use of a carbon tax and cleaner energy sources to lower the demand for fossil fuels in other industries, noting that divesting from all companies using fossil fuels would require divestment from a multitude of corporations.
“If university divestment of fossil-fuel companies were a good idea, surely divesting from all companies that use fossil fuels would be a much better one,” Holdren wrote. “Of course, that would entail divestment of virtually all companies in the portfolio.”
Stephen A. Marglin, a professor of Economics who voted in favor of divestment at the FAS vote in February, said in a statement at the vote that divestment should focus on corporations that are most directly involved in the depletion of fossil fuels.
“Those of us urging divestment and decarbonization of the endowment are sometimes accused of hypocrisy in consuming the products of companies we would ban from the endowment,” Marglin said. “The truth is different and involves no hypocrisy. We are not proposing divestment because ExxonMobil and its ilk produce fossil fuels, but because these companies plan to produce fossil fuels until the last drop of oil is squeezed from the ground.”
Dustin Tingley, a professor of Government who voted against divestment at the FAS vote, said in a statement at the meeting that he believes investing in other methods to combat climate change would be more effective than divestment.
“Today, I will vote no to divestment, but yes to investment in the research, teaching, and learning around climate change,” Tingley said. “Yes to investment by Harvard in this vital space that has clearly struck a nerve among our students, staff, and faculty.”
Holdren also wrote that “working with fossil-fuel companies” to “accelerate a transition to more sustainable business models” would be constructive towards fighting the effects of climate change.
However, Thompson said she believes arguments for working “within the system” and to “nudge” corporations toward better practices are insufficient to transform many industries’ reliance on fossil fuels.
“I think Divest, in some ways, pushes us further towards that transformation, and we can continue to invest in research and teaching, but I don’t see there being a disconnect between us divesting from our actual portfolio in fossil fuels and continuing to invest money in climate change research,” Thompson said

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After receiving backlash for the nearly $9 million in funding it netted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Harvard will allocate the sum to student financial assistance.
Numerous members of Congress — including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — expressed outrage on Twitter that Harvard would be receiving federal assistance.
All five members of Congress cited the size of the University’s endowment in their tweets.
“This is ridiculous. Taxpayer relief funds should go to those in real need. Harvard University has a $41bn endowment—the largest in the world. Put another way, Harvard’s endowment is $13mm per student, or $171mm per faculty member,” Cruz wrote on Sunday.
Harvard’s endowment — the largest of any University in the world — was last valued in June 2019 at $40.9 billion.
However, top administrators have said its value has declined as a consequence of the pandemic. Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister cited an estimate placing the value of the endowment in the “mid 30-billion range” in an interview with The Crimson last week.
Cruz and Scott both voted for the CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96-0 on March 25. It passed the House by a voice vote and was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on March 27.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Monday that Harvard will not be using any of the funds it is set to receive from the CARES Act to cover institutional costs.
“By federal formula laid out in the CARES Act, Harvard was allocated $8.6 million, with 50% of those funds to be reserved for grants to students,” Newton wrote. “Harvard is actually allocating 100% of the funds to financial assistance for students to meet their urgent needs in the face of this pandemic.”
Newton wrote Harvard will distribute the funds “based on student financial need.”
The Department of Education used a formula laid out in the legislation to allocate the funds among thousands of American institutions of higher education. The formula took two factors into account: the proportion of students who receive federal Pell Grants, which was weighted 75 percent, and total graduate and undergraduate enrollment, which was weighted 25 percent.
According to Newton, 16 percent of Harvard’s 6,500 undergraduates are Pell Grant recipients, and 55 percent of students at the College receive some form of financial aid.
“This financial assistance will be on top of the significant support the University has already provided to students – including assistance with travel, providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need, and supporting students’ transition to online education,” Newton wrote.
Hawley wrote that Universities should have to spend down their endowments before they are given federal aid.
“Universities with billions & billions stashed away in endowments should get no taxpayer money until they have tapped those endowments,” Hawley wrote on Twitter on Monday. Hawley added that it was “obscene” that Harvard will receive a “bailout” from the CARES Act.
Yale University, which received nearly $7 million in aid, boasts a $30.3 billion endowment. Stanford University received around $7.4 million from the stimulus package and maintains a $27.7 billion endowment.
Cruz called on Harvard to give its funding back to the federal government.
“Dear Harvard: Thank you for my law degree and an excellent legal education. You’re very rich; many people are hurting. Now give the money back,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Green and Scott, meanwhile, wrote that the funds should have been allocated to small businesses.
The Small Business Administration announced on Thursday that the $349 billion earmarked in the CARES Act for its Paycheck Protection Program had been depleted. Legislators are working on a deal to allocate more funds to the program.
“Millions have lost their job. Small businesses are suffering & trying to stay alive. Meanwhile, Harvard, with its $40B endowment, just got $9M in taxpayer money,” Scott wrote on Twitter.
“That funding should have gone to small businesses, every cent of it,” Green wrote.
Some large businesses, such as Shake Shack, have returned federal aid money in response to similar criticisms that federal stimulus programs favored major corporations. Shake Shack gained the necessary funding to make up for its coronavirus losses through an equity transaction and returned its $10 million loan, per a statement posted to its website on Sunday.
The funds Harvard received, however, came from a different section of the CARES Act than the funding for small businesses, and were allocated through the Department of Education, not the Small Business Administration.
“Within the $2 trillion CARES Act, Congress set aside $14 billion in the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund to address student needs, as well as impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on colleges and universities,” Newton wrote.
Some criticism of the funding came from within Harvard itself. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote on Twitter that Harvard “doesn’t need” the funds, also citing the size of its endowment.
“This $9 million should goto small businesses and out of work people,” Feigl-Ding wrote. “C’mon @Harvard , do the right thing & donate it to the community. People are suffering!”
On April 7, Harvard announced it donated $250,000 to the City of Cambridge to support a temporary homeless shelter.
Donald J. Trump Jr. — son of President Donald J. Trump and Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions for The Trump Organization — also took to Twitter to criticize the allocation. He cited the January arrest of former Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber on charges that he failed to disclose research funding from the Chinese government.
“So rather than going to a small business that actually needs the money, Harvard, with a $40 billion endowment and professors that keep getting arrested for giving research secrets to the Chinese Government takes $9,000,000 they don’t need so a small business can’t. What a joke!” Trump Jr. wrote.
Massie, a vocal critic of the CARES Act, also cited Lieber in his criticisms of Harvard’s funding allocation, as well as the University’s response to the COVID-19 crisis more broadly.
“Harvard has billions in their endowment, kicked students off campus this semester, harbored a researcher (chair of chemical biology department!) who, according to DOJ, failed to disclose payments from the Chinese govt,” Massie wrote on Twitter. “So why did my colleagues include them in this bailout?”
In a press conference Monday evening, a reporter asked Trump whether it was “fair” that corporations like Ruth’s Chris Steak House and Harvard “got a lot of money” from the CARES Act. The reporter stated that the funding was intended for small businesses, but the funds Harvard received were from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.
“Well I know one thing, I didn’t get any, that’s for sure,” Trump said. “I didn’t get any.”
“Some people will have to return it, if we think it’s inappropriate,” Trump said. “If somebody got something that we think is inappropriate we will get it back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Astronomy department chair Abraham Loeb was nominated to be a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on Monday.
Formed in 2001, PCAST members advise the U.S. President on “public policy relating to the American economy, the American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics” using scientific and technical research, according to the PCAST website. Under former president Barack H. Obama, Harvard Environmental Policy professor John P. Holdren and Broad Institute founder Eric Lander co-chaired the council.
Loeb is the longest-serving chair of Harvard’s Astronomy department and the Founding Director of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative. In 2012, he was chosen as one of TIME Magazine’s “25 Most Influential People in Space” for his work in forecasting the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
He said in an interview Monday that he hopes to use science as a means of protecting the world against crises like the COVID-19 pandemic in his new role.
“In general, I think science is the shield that can help the U.S., and not just the U.S., all humanity against dangers,” he said. “That includes pandemics like COVID-19 and other risks that may loom on the horizon. And there are a number of them that we can think of, including – if I take astronomical examples – an asteroid impact could be very damaging.”
Loeb added that he hopes to make an international impact on policy as a PCAST member.
“Science, in principle, provides the best platform for international collaborations,” he said. “Working together is not just for the political benefit of one nation, but for the prosperity and health of children in all nations worldwide that we should promote science in. So that’s my hope – to try and do that.”
Loeb said he does not actively advocate for any political stance and will use only evidence and data to make his policy suggestions.
“I’m not a political person,” he said. “I do not subscribe to any political activity. I am a scientist, and I recognize that this is one way of providing advice that could matter and therefore it’s a civil duty to do that. That’s where I come from.”
Loeb also said he hopes his new responsibilities “will not interfere” with his other scientific endeavors at Harvard, such as his work “with undergraduate students, with graduate students, and with senior colleagues.”
Loeb said he hopes to focus purely on creating the greatest amount of societal benefit through his work in PCAST, rather than viewing the position purely as a professional accolade.
“My wish is that most of my colleagues will maintain their childhood curiosity and behave more like kids rather than manipulate situations to promote their ego or honors or so forth,” Loeb said. “So for me, this is really not about the honor, it’s an opportunity to contribute and I feel obligated to help society and save lives in the context of COVID-19 or, more generally, to try and promote the prosperity and health of everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi announced in an email last Monday that unforeseen coronavirus-induced economic complications have disrupted the school’s economic model.
They wrote in the email that the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing recession severely impacted many of the Business School’s revenue sources. According to the email, the decision to freeze Executive Education programs, a decrease in alumni donations, falling case sales, and potential endowment distribution decline have all contributed to a major loss of revenue for HBS.
In total, Nohria and Crispi wrote that they expect “a decrease in revenues during FY20 of nearly $115M, changing our initial forecast of a $43M surplus to a projected deficit of $22M.”
Last week, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Harvard would instate several salary cuts affecting top administrators as well as a University-wide hiring and salary freeze.
At the Business School, Nohria and Crispi noted that compensation for faculty and exempt staff will be held flat next year. They wrote that they looked carefully at planned capital projects and cut the school's budget by more than 75 percent.
“We will ask faculty members to find efficiencies in their research budgets,” they wrote. “We will be looking across expense categories at the School to see what might be postponed, reduced, or halted entirely.”
Nohria and Crispi wrote that while the future remains uncertain the Business School’s “longstanding processes of forecasting and planning, plus our playbook from the 2008 recession” provide insight into the what steps they will need to take to ensure both the immediate and long-term well-being of the school.
Per the email, Business School administrators were still awaiting department-level Q3 re-forecasts as of last Monday. However, Nohria and Crispi noted they expect to see savings in utilities as a result of a nearly emptied campus. They also wrote that they will explore “every opportunity to realize breakeven” though it may not be possible this late into the year.
“While deficits for HBS are rare, if we do have one, we are fortunate to have healthy reserves from which we can draw in this time of need,” they wrote. “However, this is not a sustainable strategy.”
Guided by “a handful of core principles,” Nohria and Crispi wrote they will invest in vital programs and activities, ensure employment and benefits for Business School employees for as long as possible, and sustain teaching and research as well as the Business School at large.
To close their note, they provided an email address and wrote that they welcome any suggestions to help the Business School operate more efficiently.
“While these steps are not easy, we know that our community has the ingenuity and creativity to operate effectively—to do more with less—in a constrained environment,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The renovation of Adams House faces another delay after the ongoing coronavirus pandemic caused an indefinite construction suspension, Faculty Dean Sean Palfrey ’67 wrote in a Friday email to The Crimson.
Due to Cambridge’s moratorium on construction projects throughout the city, the renovation of Adams’s Apthorp House and Claverly Hall — part of the first phase of the House’s multi-year renovation project— will largely be suspended. Harvard gained an exemption from the city to continue work on Claverly’s roof to prevent water leakage.
The refurbishment of Adams House is the latest project in the University’s $1 billion dollar house renewal Initiative. The House originally planned for the restoration project to last for four years and span across three distinct phases, with completion set for fall 2023.
Now, that timeline could be in jeopardy.
The Adams House renovation delay follows the postponement of a slew of University events and operations — including the opening of the Allston campus, hiring processes, and faculty searches.
Prior to the pandemic, Adams House had already faced a six-month delay in its renovation of Apthorp House — the 260-year-old faculty dean residence — after contractors discovered flaws in the building’s heating system and foundation. Now, that delay could last even longer.
The current halt in construction comes as a result of a March 18 announcement from the Cambridge City Council placing an indefinite ban on all construction projects in the city, specifying March 26 as the deadline to comply.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is currently looking at how the halt in construction will affect the renewal timeline, but declined to give specifics.
“The FAS is evaluating the impacts of the construction moratorium on Adams House renewal overall and is developing contingency plans based on when construction may be able to restart,” she wrote.
The city’s moratorium, though, provided exemptions for certain projects. The construction firm overseeing the Adams House renewal, Lee Kennedy Company, requested special dispensation to continue work on the roof of Claverly Hall.
In a March 20 letter to the city, the company’s General Superintendent Bill Traill cited possible water damage due to the incomplete roof, and sought permission to allow six to eight employees from the project’s roofing subcontractor to continue working.
“There are Public Health and Safety risks as we do not have a permanent roof and many of the interior finish and mechanical systems are currently in place,” he wrote. “Without the permanent roof installed this building is at risk of water intrusion that could create health concerns due to buildup of mold and mildew on finished surfaces that can pose a threat to worker health and safety and lead to ongoing emergency repairs throughout the shutdown period.”
The Cambridge Inspectional Services Department granted the request, and asked that all work on the roof was completed by March 26. But in subsequent emails to the city, Traill wrote that rainy weather would likely delay the completion of the roofing work.
Dane did not respond to an email Monday about whether that work was completed.

Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 announced in an April 14 email to the Law School that he will reduce his salary for the coming year due to the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Manning’s announcement followed an email from Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’77, and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp addressing the economic impact of the pandemic on University finances. Bacow’s email stated that all senior staff administrators, including graduate school deans, would choose between either reducing their salaries or contributing to a relief fund for employees facing financial hardship.
In his email, Manning acknowledged the “unprecedented” impacts of the virus, which he says is expected to cause a larger financial challenge to the University than the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. He noted that, in addition to its reduced revenue, the school expects to incur significant new costs.
“As Harvard’s leaders have made clear, every revenue source we depend on – including the endowment and tuition, as well as philanthropy, executive and continuing education, and research support – will be under enormous pressure for the foreseeable future,” he wrote.
Manning added that while he anticipates difficult spending decisions in the coming year, the Law School will prioritize access and affordability, academic mission, and employees in its decision-making.
“As was the case with the 2008-2009 financial downturn, we will continue to make financial aid a top priority as we strive to promote broad accessibility of legal education,” his email reads. “We will strive to limit impacts on our workforce, who make it possible for us each and every day to fulfill our mission.”
The email also addressed the individual financial hardships facing University employees. Manning wrote that he regrets the need to enact measures such as salary and hiring freezes after the immense efforts of faculty and staff to overcome challenges brought on by the pandemic.
“I am truly sorry that we will not be able this year to reward the outstanding level of performance that has been a hallmark of our workforce and especially seen this past month,” Manning wrote. “None of this diminishes my gratitude for the important work you have done and continue to do.”
Manning concluded the email by explaining that the Law School anticipates receiving more clear guidance from the University during the next few weeks, and praising students, faculty, and staff.
“Your collective commitment to this School, to our mission of teaching and learning the law, and to one another is an inspiration, and I believe that, thanks to you, Harvard Law School will emerge stronger than ever,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 21, 2020, 3:02 p.m.
Lila A. Fenwick graduated from Harvard Law School against all odds — though she herself didn’t necessarily see it that way.
In 1956, Fenwick became the first black female graduate of the Law School, just three short years after the school first counted women among its graduating classes. But, driven and determined, she told the Harvard Law Bulletin in 2000 she believed with certainty since childhood that she would one day become a lawyer.
“It never occurred to me that there were going to be any obstacles,” Fenwick said at the time.
Fenwick, who suffered from dementia for several years, died on April 4 at 87 years old from coronavirus-related illness.
Fenwick was born on May 24, 1932 in Manhattan after her parents, John and Hilda Fenwick, emigrated from Trinidad to New York, according to the New York Times.
She studied at Barnard College as a member of the Class of 1953 before attending Harvard Law School, and then the London School of Economics. After finishing her education, she worked in the Division of Human Rights at the United Nations, where she specialized in gender, racial, and religious discrimination and the protection of indigenous populations.
Barnard College, Fenwick’s alma mater, wrote in an email that it sends its condolences to her family and friends and applauds her work in advancing human rights around the world.
“Ms. Fenwick's incredible commitment to human rights and historical contributions to higher education embodies all that Barnard strives to achieve in preparing young women to go out and change the world,” the email reads. “We are proud to know she left a mark not only at Barnard but on society as a whole.”
Fenwick retired from her role in the United Nations in order to stay with her family after her division moved to Geneva between 1973 and 1974, according to the Times.
Her cousin and legal guardian David Colby Reed ’05 described Fenwick as hospitable and gracious.
According to Reed, Fenwick lived in segregated housing during her time at the Law School and often told the story that the dean of admissions at the time invited all female students to a dinner in which he asked them to justify taking a place at the school from men.
Still, Reed said Fenwick stayed active in alumni circles after graduating and seemed to enjoy her time at the Law School.
“She met with a lot of resistance while there based on race and gender in particular, but Harvard can also be a challenging place generally,” Reed said. “She was probably challenged in ways that were instructive, and I do think that was a formative part of her identity.”
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 praised Fenwick’s leadership and professional accomplishments in a press release on Wednesday.
“Lila Fenwick was an extraordinary leader who devoted her career at the United Nations to protecting the human rights of all people across the globe,” he wrote. “Her leadership, humanity, and wisdom will be sorely missed."
Fenwick loved gardening, the opera, and spending time at the beach, according to Reed. He also said Fenwick admired the arts, recalling a museum visit the two shared around the time of his freshman year at Harvard.
“We went to the Studio Museum in Harlem, and checked out this exhibit by Kara Walker, who's a pretty avant-garde visual artist,” he said.
Reed said Fenwick asked for her estate to be dedicated to programming and scholarships that celebrate the achievement of black women in higher education.
“She would want to be remembered for that belief in that kind of patronage of and cultivation of a new generation of leaders,” Reed said.
Reed also recognized the team of home health aides and social workers who cared for Fenwick as she suffered from dementia, attributing his cousin’s comfort and continued ability to live in her own home to their assistance.
“It was a challenging situation managing some of those affairs, but it wouldn’t have been possible had it not been for people who just really cared about her personally and would go above and beyond the requirements of your hourly home health aide job in order to look out for Lila,” he said. “On behalf of my family, I want to say a profound thank you to all of those people.”
He added that Fenwick deserves admiration not only for her place in the Law School’s history, but also for her self-confidence and resolution.
“She just knew how she wanted to live and lived the way she wanted to,” he said.
Correction: April 21, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Fenwick attended an exhibit of Alice Walker's work. In fact, it was the artist Kara Walker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some future members of Harvard College’s Class of 2024 say they are floating the possibility of taking time off before matriculating in Fall 2020 as the continued spread of coronavirus casts uncertainty over the upcoming semester.
Other students who were set on taking a gap year before coming to Harvard are now reevaluating their plans due to global travel restrictions.
Adam Pearl, a prospective student living in Barcelona, Spain, said friends and family told him he should consider taking a gap year if the fall semester does not proceed as scheduled.
“I've been very much recommended that if there's any chance that your fall semester is going to start online, that your freshman year is going to start online, then don't take it,” Pearl said. “Harvard is very welcoming for gap year students, so I guess that's the sort of thing that switched me more in favor of the gap year now.”
Meredith B. Zielonka, another prospective student, said she is reconsidering a gap year program that she had been planning since her sophomore year of high school due to ongoing travel restrictions.
“I think gap years are great for people who really want them and have taken a lot of time seriously to think about them and plan them. But a gap year is not something that someone can go into wildly,” Zielonka said. “It requires so much work so much planning to figure out what you're going to do and how you're going to pay for it.”
For many admitted students, their introduction to College life has already begun online through Virtual Visitas, a substitution for the annual admitted students weekend held in April.
Dylan Y. Hu, a prospective student from Lake Zurich, Ill., said he was able to connect with other students through Virtual Visitas, but also said he looks forward to meeting people on campus.
“I have been getting to know some people with similar interests that have also been participating in similar activities,” Hu said of the virtual programming. “But I think again there's something special about having a face-to-face interaction, which you know would have been great,” Hu said.
Matine Khalighi, who plans to attend the College, also said he hopes to move into Harvard Yard in the fall, but is concerned about the possibility of next semester being delayed or taught online.
“It's like you miss that beginning part where you start something, like when you start high school,” Khalighi said. “I feel like you lose that kind of energy. Halfway through the year, I've already taken courses. And if we're lucky enough, for example, to get on campus again mid-year, I feel like it would just be a really odd set up to the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Students for Bernie launched a campaign calling on University administrators to use their financial resources to provide protections for workers and students during the coronavirus crisis.
The campaign, entitled “40 Billion For What” in reference to the University’s endowment, demands that all Harvard workers receive paid sick time through May 28. It says that those who choose to work must receive hazard pay — additional pay for work during the pandemic — in addition to adequate personal protective equipment and work conditions that adhere to social distancing standards.
“Forty billion for what, Harvard?” the campaign statement reads. “What is the point of our University’s hoarded wealth, if not to ensure the well-being and safety of its community during a time of fear, uncertainty, and instability?”
More than 150 people have signed a petition expressing support for the campaign, according to Harvard for Bernie founder Piper W. Winkler ’21. Signatories include Cambridge City Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and State Representative Mike Connolly, according to Winkler.
Harvard has guaranteed regular pay and benefits through May 28 to employees who are available to work but have had their roles displaced due to the global pandemic. But employees in essential roles on campus must continue to work in order to be paid, which has forced some dining hall workers into difficult decisions between salary and safety.
The University plans to review policies regarding its employees as the situation evolves, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
“As we have taken steps to reduce health risks associated with the coronavirus, we have also continued to adapt our human resources and other policies to help ensure our students and employees are able to confront the challenges facing themselves and their families,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard will continue to review these policies going forward.”
The campaign also demands that all Harvard students who were previously unenrolled must be allowed to enroll in the University health insurance plan without paying premiums as an additional form of financial support.
Harvard’s endowment was valued at $40.9 billion in June 2019, but its value has likely declined “substantially” due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus, according to Harvard’s Chief Financial Officer, Thomas J. Hollister. Many of its funds are restricted by donors to specific purposes such as financial aid, research programs, or professorships.
Still, the endowment’s size has made it the frequent target of student activists who believe it is not being used properly.
“We know that the money exists and we’re simply asking Harvard to shore up the political will to stand behind its community,” Winkler said, citing the $289 million surplus the University ran in 2019. “The longer they wait, the longer they’re going to put people at risk.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a letter last week that each generation had “made sacrifices” to ensure that the endowment could support future generations of students, faculty and staff.
“We have a moral responsibility to those who will come after us, and we must act decisively and selflessly to preserve all that makes the University special,” he wrote.
Harvard for Bernie, the organization leading the campaign, was initially formed as a subgroup of the Harvard College Democrats to support Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his run for president. The group will remain independent and may transition into a Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter in the near future, according to Winkler.

What’s worse: your screen time or your lack of motivation? It’s really hard to tell, but maybe if you take a long enough nap, you’ll wake up in time for the end of quarantine. When it was announced that classes would be pass-fail, you turned your brain off faster than Harvard kicked us off campus. You have yet to make it to any of your classes; you would much rather attend Facebook events like “lie on the floor and listen to melodrama”. You move so little that even your Fitbit can’t tell if you’re awake or not.
Mostly Bs: The boomer turned zoomer
From going to the bathroom without turning your sound off to accidentally turning yourself into a potato, you’ve committed every single Zoom faux pas. It doesn’t matter how many reminders you’re given, you can’t remember to mute yourself. With your devices’ microphones amplifying your background noises, you turn every class into an ASMR video. No one can blame you though because at least you’re trying?
Mostly Cs: The try-hard 
The extra freetime in quarantine has fueled you to go full steam ahead. You’ve seen memes about the quarantine struggle, but you can’t relate to any of them. Even being in Pacific Time doesn’t stop you from being the first person to Zoom class. Your friends are disappointed that their summer internships were cancelled, but you planned ahead for this, and two of your three backup internships are remote. Most impressively, you cut yourself bangs — and they look really good.
Mostly Ds: The quaran-schemer
You keep track of your days by counting the number of people you’ve ghosted. Initially you were picky with who you wanted to Netflix and flatten the curve with. But as quarantine drags on, even the section kid who’s trigger-happy for the raise hand function is looking cute. You couldn’t physically go to Rome this spring, but you’ve been making up for it by setting your Tinder location all around the globe. You’re not looking for a soulmate, though — you just realize there will never be another socially acceptable time to hit on someone with “Hey, do you have coronavirus? ‘Cause I can’t stop looking achoo.”
