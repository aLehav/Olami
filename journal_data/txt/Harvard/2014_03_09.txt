After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—The intensity of Saturday night’s matchup between the Harvard and Brown men’s basketball teams belied the fact that there was not much tangible at stake, outside of seeding for the Crimson in the NCAA Tournament. But in a hotly contested shootout, Harvard (26-4, 13-1 Ivy) prevailed over the Bears (15-13, 7-7) in overtime, 98-93, at the Pizzitola Sports Center.
With the win, the Crimson finished conference play with a program-best 13 victories and matched the school record for total wins in a season with 26.
“It’s awesome—we’ve been talking about it all week,” co-captain Laurent Rivard said. “We knew we had to get one win to get to the tournament, but we wanted to go 2-0. No one from Harvard had ever gone 13-1 [in league play] and 7-0 on the road.”
Brown trailed virtually the entire contest until the final moments of regulation, when it looked most poised to pull off the upset. A free throw from guard Tavon Blackmon gave the Bears a 85-84 lead with 1:17 to play, but with the packed Brown student section on its feet, a wing three-pointer from Crimson sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers put Harvard back on top 10 seconds later. On the ensuing possession, a jumper in the lane from Brown freshman forward Leland King sent the game to the extra session.
Harvard held on to a slim two-point lead with less than a minute left in overtime, and, coming out of a timeout, Amaker called a play for Rivard, who was competing in his last game on an Ivy court. Rivard peeled off a screen and got a clean look at the top of the key, burying a three to give his team a 94-89 lead, effectively deciding the game.
With the shot, Rivard moved into second place in the all-time Ivy standings for three-pointers made.
“We’ve had this play set up for a while,” Rivard said. “Coach sent me back in, and we knew we had to take a good shot. [Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi] set a really good screen. I just came back to the ball, got a great pass, and got myself open.”
The Bears honored senior guard Sean McGonagill in a pregame ceremony before his last conference game, and he did all he could to go out with a win. McGonagill hit his fifth three of the night over the outstretched arm of junior wing Wesley Saunders to bring Brown back within two with 16 seconds left in overtime, but a layup by Chambers and a Bears turnover iced it for good for the Crimson. With his 26 points, McGonagill moved into second on Brown’s all-time scoring list.
“McGonagill has always been a tough kid for us to handle and guard,” Amaker said. “He’s just so crafty with the ball, and certainly the shots that he can make are uncanny.”
Bears forward King, who averages 8.6 points per game, had a career-high 27 points and seven rebounds. King’s 23 shots from the field were nearly three times his season average.
In the first half, the teams’ 94 total points nearly equaled their total scoring output in their previous meeting, a 52-45 victory for the Crimson. Brown’s 93 points were the most allowed by Harvard all season, though the home squad shot just 43.1 percent for the game. The Bears made up for it with sharp shooting from beyond the arc, hitting 12 of their 23 three-point attempts.
“We had been playing exceptionally well, especially defensively,” Amaker said. “That wasn’t the case for us completely tonight, but that’s not giving Brown the credit that they deserve for how they played.”
As in the teams’ first meeting, the battles down low were rugged. Brown was without starting center Rafael Maia, but its front line of King and Cedric Kuakumensah totaled eight blocks. Still, Harvard managed 54 points in the paint, 37 of which came from Moundou-Missi and senior forward Kyle Casey, both of whom recorded double-doubles on the night. Saunders chipped in a quiet 19 points, 11 of which came from the free-throw line.
The Crimson will now rest up before waiting to hear its tournament destination next Sunday. Harvard will likely enter the Big Dance as an 11- or 12-seed, looking to build on last season’s March success.
“I’ve always felt it’s not what you do going into the tournament, it’s what you do within the tournament,” Amaker said. “We’ve seen a lot of so-called hot teams get into a tournament and not fare well in the very first round. You need to get momentum within the tournament. The main thing is we’ve been playing well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last Ivy League game of their careers, Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Laurent Rivard and Brown tri-captain Sean McGonagill reminded their squads why they recruited them all those years ago.
With 40 seconds remaining in Saturday night’s overtime contest, Crimson sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers held the ball at midcourt, dribbling out the shot clock. His team had a two-point lead, with NCAA Tournament seeding on the line.
Enter Rivard.
The shot clock hit six as Chambers found a streaking Rivard near the top of the key. The senior wasted no time, hitting a dagger from behind the arc to make it a two-possession game, 94-89. The basket all-but sealed the victory, and only a few possessions later, Harvard (26-4, 13-1 Ivy) walked out of the Pizzitola Sports Center with the 98-93 win over the Bears (15-13, 7-7).
“I thought Laurent’s three…was a big one,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was a designed play for him, and it was awesome to see him step forward and just bury that shot.”
Rivard credited junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi’s off-ball screen as key in getting the defender off his back and enabling him to hit the open shot.
“I thought [my defender] would be trailing me a little more,” Rivard said. “I was focused on just getting it up. I knew he wasn’t right on me, so I knew it would be a good shot.”
The three was Rivard’s fourth on a night in which he shot 53 percent from the field, going 4-of-8 from deep. Perhaps more importantly for Rivard, his final bucket of the game moved him past former Princeton guard Brian Earl for second all-time in the Ancient Eight in made three-pointers with 282.
Rivard’s performance from deep spanned the duration of the game, as an Agent Zero three began the evening’s festivities. Thirty seconds into the contest, Rivard ran a give-and-go with junior wing Wesley Saunders, and the end result was a 3-0 lead for the visiting squad.
McGonagill, however, was not to be outdone.
With 17 seconds to go in the extra period, Brown’s leading scorer drilled a trey of his own, bringing his team back within two.
The basket was McGonagill’s fifth three and 26th point of the night, marking the fifth time this season that he tallied at least five three-pointers in a single game.
MOUN-DONT-MISSI
One day after shooting 75 percent from the field at Yale, Moundou-Missi was at it again. The forward shot 6-of-10 from the floor and 9-of-12 from the line en route to a team-high 21 points on Saturday night.
Just as Rivard’s hot shooting from deep spanned the game, so too did Moundou-Missi dominate inside all night. With just over a minute gone by in the first half, Saunders found his classmate on the low box. Moundou-Missi laid the ball into the hoop and drew contact, earning a three-point play the old fashioned way.
Nearly two hours later, a similar set gave Harvard the lead once more.
Following a missed three from Brown freshman forward Leland King, forward Kyle Casey corralled the rebound and headed up the court. The senior found Moundou-Missi in the middle of the paint, who promptly turned around and hit the baby jumper, giving Harvard a two-point advantage with 3:39 left in overtime.
From that moment on, the Bears did not come within two points, and the Crimson held out for its final league victory of the year.
APPROACHING MADNESS
After Harvard clinched an invitation to the NCAA Tournament with Friday’s win, the only implications for Saturday night’s game centered on seeding and momentum.
Last season, the Crimson entered the Big Dance on a two-game winning streak, defeating Columbia and Cornell at home in the final weekend of regular season play. The rest is familiar—Harvard upset the University of New Mexico in the second round of the Tournament, 68-62, earning its first March Madness win in program history.
This year, however, Harvard will be riding an even greater run heading into the Tourney.
The Crimson is currently on an eight-game winning streak, and completed its best-ever record in Ivy play at 13-1.
“We definitely have a good thing going [in terms of] momentum right now, but we got to get to the Tournament and play that first game like any other game,” Rivard said. “[We] just [have to] prepare for that game like we’ve been doing all season, and hopefully build momentum [from there]."
While Harvard knows that it will be playing postseason ball, who the squad will match up with remains a mystery until Selection Sunday on March 16th.
“We’re fortunate to know we’re going to be in the postseason, [but] you never know what style you’re going to have to go against,” Amaker said. “[But] we’ve shown that we can line them up and play a lot of different ways, and not only play but be successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.— Raphael Girard stepped into the crease with confidence. The last time he had started against the Yale in the ECAC Tournament, he led his team to a come-from-behind series win. On Saturday night, “Raph” was prepared to do it again—or at least extend his collegiate career to one more game.
Through 50 minutes, the Bulldogs barraged Girard with shots but could not break through on even strength while the Crimson clung to a one goal lead. Yet the game would prove to be the senior netminder’s last stand.
The No. 16/15 Yale men’s hockey team skated to a 2-1 win to complete its series sweep of Harvard (10-17-4, 6-12-4 ECAC) in Game Two of first round ECAC Tournament play Saturday night at Ingalls Rink. The Bulldogs (17-9-5, 10-8-4) ended the Crimson’s season with a come-from-behind win on the back of two man-up goals 38 seconds apart off a boarding minor from sophomore forward Brian Hart in the third period.
“I thought Raph was outstanding,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “The penalty was tough, because, quite frankly, he didn’t look like he was going to give up a goal five-on-five.”
After Hart gave the Crimson a one-goal lead with a power play strike late in the first period, officials charged the sophomore forward with a delayed boarding minor midway through the final frame of regulation. On the delay, the Bulldogs pulled freshman goaltender Alex Lyon for an extra attacker, and sophomore center Stu Wilson elevated the puck through a scrum in front of the Harvard net for the tying goal.
On the ensuing power play, senior forward Kenny Agostino pulled the hosts ahead with his 14th goal of the season. Classmate center Jesse Root assisted on the go-ahead goal from the right faceoff circle with an outside wrist shot that clipped Agostino’s shin guard before skimming over Girard’s right leg pad.
Following Friday’s 4-0 loss to the Bulldogs, Donato called on his squad for better execution, and he got it on Saturday.
“The kids played really hard,” Donato said. “I thought the effort was outstanding.”
While the Crimson struggled to transition out of its own zone, Girard received good net support on defense as Harvard skaters kept most of Yale’s opportunities to the outside.
“Obviously, I had to play a good game, but it helps a lot when you see guys diving to block shots and taking hits just to get the puck out of your zone,” Girard said.
Despite the Bulldogs’ dominance on the possession, a power play strike from Hart put the Crimson on the board first at 16:42 in the opening frame. After a close-angle shot from freshman linemate Sean Malone clipped the shoulder of Lyon, Hart tapped in a dribbling rebound on the far side of the crease with Lyon out of position.
The Crimson would get precious few fortunate bounces after that. In the middle frame, Yale limited the Crimson to four shots on goal for the second straight night. In the third, Harvard did not register a shot on goal until the 12-minute mark.  With the win, Yale became the first team to sweep Harvard in the first round of the ECAC Tournament since Brown shut out the Crimson on back-to-back nights in 2009.
While Donato brushed aside concerns about personnel issues on Friday, he acknowledged the team’s limitations on offense on Saturday. Freshman center Alex Kerfoot, who left Game One with a shoulder injury, was the latest addition to the team’s disabled list. In all, Saturday’s Harvard line-up was missing nine players with whom the squad started the season in October.
“[The season] at times was frustrating, a little bit up and down,” Donato said. “We certainly were devastated there with injuries.”
In Kerfoot’s absence, Donato called up junior Mike Seward to fill out the Crimson’s fourth line at center. Seward, who was added to the team’s roster just three weeks ago, played for Harvard last year but made his 2014 debut in the team’s final game of the season.
Friday night was a difficult send-off for Girard, who finished with 37 saves and made a series of acrobatic stops in the third period before Yale broke through. The Quebec native hopes to continue his playing career after graduation.
“It’s been great playing for the Crimson these four years,” Girard said. “It definitely hurts. Maybe tomorrow my leg or my knee is going to hurt, but there’s nothing more that hurts than knowing my career is over here.”
As for the team’s non-graduating players, the Crimson has something to look forward to this offseason. The young team may return up to 22 of its 26 roster spots next season.
“I thought there was a great deal of improvement [this year],” Donato said. “I think we in general laid the foundation for what will be a more positive future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there is anything that one can take away from the Crimson men’s lacrosse victory against Georgetown on Saturday afternoon, it is that stats don’t tell the whole story. Harvard (3-2, 0-0 Ivy) traveled to the nation’s capital to face off against the Hoyas (2-3, 0-0 Big East) on Georgetown’s home turf.
The Crimson returned to Cambridge with the first visiting team victory in the series—now tied up with three wins apiece—between the two competitors. Georgetown, which has averaged 8.5 goals per game this season while allowing just 7.1 points against, was defeated by Harvard, 15-7.
“We are very pleased with the game,” co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “We were disappointed with the way we started against Quinnipiac, and today we came out fired up today from the first blow of the whistle. A big part of our success was our determination. Georgetown just started the game a bit flatter than we did today, and we really capitalized.”
Junior goalie Jake Gambitsky was a critical piece to the puzzle in the opening few minutes of play. Thanks to a quick stick, Gambitsky stonewalled the Hoyas’ attacking efforts seven times in the first period of play alone.
“Gambitsky played outstandingly,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “He made a number of big saves in the first half that really helped slowdown Georgetown’s ball movement…. He was an inspiration to our defense, and his efforts to clear the ball up the field gave our offense the opportunity to get looks on cage.”
The Crimson’s defense, led by Gambitsky in the crease, shut down leading scorer, freshman Peter Conley, who has tallied 13 points so far this season for Georgetown. Conley could only pass for one assist on the night due to the Crimson’s defensive effort.
“Our defensive personnel had a really strong game,” Wojcik said. “Georgetown is a very good team, and they took a number of shots, but I thought we did a really good job locking down their top point producers and playing them really well. It was a very good combination of a good game plan, good execution, and a great goaltending performance.”
Despite the Hoyas scrambling for possession of 17 of the 26 face-off wins, Gambitsky ended the day with a career-high 18 saves, the most seen by a Harvard goalie since March 2011. With the ball in his pocket, he successfully cleared to his teammates 23 times.
“When you have the goalie that can make some of the saves that he made today it takes a lot of pressure off of the defense,” Petrucci said. “And it undoubtedly helped our offence when they have the amount of possessions that they had today, and they sink in their shots, it’s hard to not come away with a win.”
While the Crimson offense only produced 36 shots on the day compared to 57 from Hoyas’ sticks, the movement of the ball in the attacking end and the accuracy of shots allowed the team to find the back of the net 15 times, giving Harvard the largest goal deficit so far this season.
“We came out firing on all cylinders,” Petrucci said. “We had a really big lead at halftime. A lot of this was due to our offence was really moving the ball well today, playing team offence, and distributing. They were just genuinely moving the ball well and taking good shots.”
Co-captain Peter Shwartz matched his career-high with five points, with three goals and two assists, while sophomore attackmen Will Walker and Ian Ardrey each scored a hat trick.
Another member of the class of 2016, Devin Dwyer, passed for five assists in his debut game of the season after recuperating from a crippling injury that benched him for the first four games of the season. The attacking efforts by the Crimson helped to clinch the Harvard’s first-ever victory at Georgetown.
The past three meetings were close between the two competitors, with either the Crimson or Hoyas coming out on top by one or two goals.
“I think all of the upperclassmen on the team remember two years ago when we had a really close, tough, frustrating game [in DC],” Petrucci said. “So it was really great to come down here and beat them on their home turf freehandedly. It is the first time I’ve done that in my career, and it definitely feels good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up 25 with 3:30 left in the first half, the Harvard women’s basketball team appeared to be in control of its final regular season game.
And yet, when Brown forward Sophie Bikofsky’s three clanged off the rim, Crimson senior guard Jasmine Evans dove out of bounds to get the rebound, pushing the ball into co-captain Christine Clark’s waiting hands.
With its postseason destiny out of its control, the Crimson (21-7, 11-3 Ivy) laid it all on the floor in what was potentially the last time that seniors Clark, Evans, guard Melissa Mullins, and forward Elise Gordon would play in a Harvard jersey. Behind a fired-up defense led by the veterans, Harvard ended its season with an 87-67 rout of Brown (10-18, 4-10) on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
“I didn’t know what to think about [playing my last game], so I just didn’t,” Mullins said. “I just tried to play like normal, just enjoy being on the court with the girls…people who I just love so much. Whether or not this was the last game, there’s nowhere else I’d like to be than here with them.”
Wins from the top two teams in the league, Penn and Princeton, on Saturday night means that the Crimson is now vying for an at-large bid to the WNIT.
“I believe we still have more basketball to play,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Hopefully the cards fall well for us. If not, this team lost to the ultimate winner of the WNIT last year, so I think we can do something, and I think it’ll be very exciting to do it with this senior class.”
The Bears appeared to have gained some offensive momentum heading into intermission, putting together an 8-0 run to pull within 19.
But that was the closest the visitors would get until the game was all but decided. The four seniors combined for 55 points, propelling the Crimson’s offensive charge.
Mullins started things off after the break, knocking down her only attempt from downtown of the night. On the Bears’ ensuing possession, Evans knocked the ball away from her Brown counterpart and laid it in on the other end. Clark then knocked down a trey, and Gordon, after a missed layup, grabbed her own rebound and scored the bucket. After a 12-2 Crimson run, the home team had taken a 27-point lead.
With 3:32 left in the contest, the seniors went to the bench to the tune of a standing ovation from the Lavietes crowd. Acrobatic, tough layups by Clark, steals by Evans, blocks by Mullins, and offensive rebounds and put-backs by Gordon showcased a senior class that refused to go out without a bang.
“We always want to play Harvard basketball, we always want to play at our level, so no matter how much we’re up by, we’re still going to play like it’s a tied game,” Mullins said.
Clark, Evans, and Gordon all tallied double digits with 20, 12, and 15 points, respectively, while Mullins, playing on a sprained ankle, chipped in eight. Gordon’s 15 points marked a career-high, finishing off a season that saw the San Jose, Calif. native battle injury.
“They’ve been playing like seniors all year, in my opinion,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think they’ve been terribly inconsistent. I was happy that Elise was able to finally get in a stat line because she’s had a bad run of injuries [and] officials who, because she’s a power player, just call bizarre fouls on her.”
Delaney-Smith opted to replace usual starters junior guard Ali Curtis and classmate Erin McDonnell for Evans and Gordon, who joined Clark, Mullins, and junior forward Temi Fagbenle in the starting lineup.
Brown took an early lead, but six points in three minutes from Fagbenle put the Crimson on top for good. Then, as they did all night, the seniors took control. In a 16-1 run in which the seniors scored 11 points, Harvard jumped out to a 22-7 lead.
The Crimson couldn’t seem to miss in the first half, as 66.7 percent of both field goals and treys fell through the net, while Brown went just 39.3 percent from the floor and 12.5 percent from deep.
“I thought we had really good ball movement, really great execution,” Clark said. “I thought all of those scores came off of fives, great passes, and then just easy buckets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final matches before its annual spring break trip, the Harvard men’s tennis team was in top form, besting Michigan State, 5-2, and downing Bryant, 6-1, on Saturday at the Murr Center.
The No. 33 Crimson (8-4) has now won four of its last five matches, all at home. It was a rare easy weekend for the squad after having played tightly contested matches against ranked competition for much of the spring season.
“Getting two wins feels pretty good overall,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “It was nice to get a doubles point for the first time in a few matches, but there are still lots of things we can work on. We didn’t feel everyone played his best, but overall [we] are happy to get those wins going into spring break.”
HARVARD 6, BRYANT 1
In the night match, Harvard rested most of its starters but still handily defeated the Bulldogs (9-7).
“Playing two matches in a day is tough because it’s hard to come back with enough energy,” Steinroeder said. “But it helps that we have so many guys to put in the lineup, and everyone played quite well.”
The Crimson reversed its recent struggles in capturing the doubles point on Saturday. Against Bryant, the usual No. 1 tandem of co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen did not play, but junior Christo Schultz and freshman Sebastian Beltrame ably took over the top slot, posting an 8-1 victory.
Sophomore Kelvin Lam and Steinroeder then delivered Harvard the doubles point with an 8-3 win at No. 3.
From there, the Crimson cruised in singles, with four of its five wins coming in two sets. Junior Shaun Chaudhuri took over Nguyen’s top spot for the night and nabbed a 6-2, 6-1 victory. Sophomore Nicky Hu was even better on the second court, nearly blanking his opponent and posting a 6-0, 6-1 mark.
Classmate Conor Haughey officially clinched the match for Harvard with a 6-0, 6-2 victory on the sixth court. MacMaster, who normally does not play singles, won in straight sets on court five, and junior Henry Steer won in three at No. 4.
“We’re learning in every match,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “The freshmen are coming along great, and the upperclassmen know their energy. As [junior Denis Nguyen] said, we need to bring the same energy to every match, and not get up for one opponent and underestimate another. Playing matches like this are a mental exercise.”
HARVARD 5, MICHIGAN STATE 2
In the early match, the Crimson denied Michigan State (5-7) its first road victory of the year.
The doubles teams were on point against the Spartans, as each pair came through in tight matchups. Nguyen and MacMaster took an 8-6 win, Hu and freshman Brian Yeung matched their score. Schultz and Beltrame then came through, 8-7, to finish off the sweep.
“It’s very encouraging for us to actually win three doubles matches,” Fish said. “We have played some really good doubles, but hadn’t quite clicked. We were able to take all three on Saturday.”
Freshman Andrew Ball struck first in singles, 6-3, 6-1, to extend the Harvard lead to 2-0. From there, the top of the lineup led the way. Beltrame defeated the Spartans’ Aaron Pfister, 6-4, 6-4, and Nguyen took the clincher with a straight-set win on the top court.
Chaudhuri claimed the Crimson’s final win in a third set tiebreaker, while Steinroeder and Yeung came up short.
With only the spring break tournament and one home match against St. John’s separating the team from Ivy League play, the team still has room for improvement, according to Fish.
“To beat really good teams, we have to play less cautious than we did [on Saturday],” Fish said. “We won’t take the Ivy title until each guy is really letting out.”
But the team is beginning to round into form and hopes to use its recent wins as a springboard to Ancient Eight success, according to Fish.
“It’s a little bit like some of these teams in basketball, that aren’t quite firing on all six cylinders during the season,” Fish said. “But once they string together a few wins, they build up some momentum. I’m hopeful that our team will be like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As senior Becca Nadler waited at the starting line of Wednesday’s Grand Slalom event at the NCAA Skiing Championships, the captain knew she had a lot to live up to.
Nadler became the first Harvard skier to win a national championship in 2012, and while injuries prevented a full performance in last year’s competition, she had nothing to hold back this time around.
“I was hoping to cross the finish line with nothing left, knowing that I gave it my all, and I think I did that,” said Nadler, who placed sixth in this year’s race. “It’s always fun competing at NCAA’s, just being surrounded by such talented athletes. People are always impressed and surprised to see a Harvard athlete, especially on the ski team, competing at that level. It’s fun to raise some eyebrows, and it’s fun to represent Harvard.”
While the senior left it all on the course in her final race representing Harvard, Nadler’s future plans involve moving to Vermont to continue racing at Burke Mountain Academy.
“I’m going to keep racing next year, so at least the dream isn’t over. or I’d be a total mess,” Nadler said. “This last race was pretty fun. I definitely had the butterflies, but I love the feeling of that nervous energy I have before a run…. I didn’t feel any negative pressure being out here. I just do what I’m capable of and hope that when it counts, I ski the way I know that I can.”
The Alpine skier competed in Park City, Utah along with Nordic skier seniors Jen Rolfes and Chris Stock as well as junior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci, whose combined races helped the Crimson secure 14th place out of 23 teams overall.
Rolfes raced in Thursday’s 5k classic and Saturday’s 15k freestyle, placing 17th and 23rd, respectively.
Although Rolfes worried about the challenges posed with skiing at higher altitude, the Crimson skiers offered one another support and advice.
“Once I thought through the strategies [Akeo suggested], it became a little easier to think about goals,” Rolfes explained. “Normally when we race out east, we’ll go pretty hard on the uphills, hoping to recover on the downhills. What happens at altitude is you don’t recover on the downhill, so you have to pace yourself or you won’t be able to ski fast at the end.”
Rolfes’ teammates also mentioned the support the captain has reciprocated since her freshman year.
“She led the team this fall in dedication to training, in focus on getting the workouts in,” Stock said. “Her success this winter has been remarkable. She’s been really inspiring this year for me and for the rest of the team, as far as setting a standard for excellence and an example of how to be a skier.”
Stock and Maifeld-Carucci raced in Thursday’s 10k classic and Saturday’s 20k freestyle, faring well on the men’s side.
Stock placed 31st and 38th, respectively, in the two races.
“I didn’t have specific goals here—for me, the main goal of the season was qualifying for NCAA’s,” Stock said. “I qualified in the last spot. I knew that a lot of the skiers that we meet up against here come from the Western Conference. They come from very established programs. I was really excited to have the opportunity to be skiing just in the same race as them.”
Although only one junior among the four Crimson skiers qualified, Stock recognized the progress that the Harvard teams have made in recent years, and looks to the underclassmen to maintain the improvement.
“Akeo had a breakout season this year,” Stock said. “We’ve actually been able to put together some really strong team results, which is the first time we’ve been able to do that. [Placing] third in the relay race at the Williams Carnival [on Feb. 14-15] was huge because there are some other colleges [competing there] that have established programs. We were just able to put it together and show them that there’s nothing stopping the Harvard team from doing just as well.”
Along with Stock, Nadler won’t be leading the Crimson next year. But she hopes to teach her teammates the possibilities that exixt despite skiing on the East coast.
“Even if the odds are against you, and even if it’s unconventional to be on a ski team in Boston, if the passion is there, if the work ethic and desire are there, then anything is possible,” Nadler said. “I never would have thought that I could achieve the results that I did, but if the skiers on the Harvard ski team are working just as hard as on any other team, they can do pretty well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its stiffest competition yet, the Harvard women’s rugby team just couldn’t quite keep up.
The No. 11 Crimson (6-3) took on No. 4 American International College in a Saturday afternoon contest at Cumnock Field. A quick try in the opening minutes of the game put Harvard up, 7-0, but a powerful Yellow Jackets offense proved too much for the injury-hampered Crimson squad in the 56-19 loss.
“The game showed that we have tremendous amounts of improvement to make in our ability to compete at the point of contact against an athletic, strong, determined team,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “It shows we have tremendous progress to make in our skill and also our mental toughness.”
Right after the Crimson went up, AIC came storming back with a try of its own to cut the deficit to 7-5. On the next play, a breakaway run by Anna Mbengham past the Crimson wings added another score to give the Yellow Jackets a 10-7 lead.
AIC tacked on to claim a 10-point advantage over Harvard with 12:30 to go in the first half. The Crimson finally got back on the board seven minutes later with a try by co-captain Ali Haber to cut the deficit, but the Yellow Jackets added another score to take a 22-12 lead into halftime.
“I thought we had it together in the first half,” Haber said. “We were starting [to] put things together like we had practiced. It wasn’t perfect, and we weren’t 100 percent, but it was there.”
But in the final 40 minutes of play, the game slipped away from the Crimson. AIC increased the margin to 44-12 before co-captain Xanni Brown registered a try for Harvard with just 11 minutes left in the game.
The Yellow Jackets responded with two more scores of their own—including one on the final play of the game—to give AIC the 37-point victory.
“It was difficult to continue on with your game plan and your intensity when you know that it’s a really scrappy game,” Haber said. “I guess we weren’t mentally prepared for that.”
The Crimson suffered from the loss of several key starters throughout the game. Sophomore Audrey Carson left the contest in the first half with an ankle injury, and senior Cayla Calderwood also was taken out later in the contest.
“We have to work on bringing up the morale when we have very big challenges like starters out,” Haber said. “We have a deep bench, we had lots of people come in and play their hearts out. But you have to know how to play through that mentality of [knowing] you’re missing people.”
“I think this is a tough lump,” Parker added. “I think we all thought we would measure up better today. For a lot of us, it’s back to the drawing board as to why today unfolded the way it did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight weekend, the Harvard baseball team traveled to play four games in a warmer climate. Unlike last time out, the Crimson came back to Cambridge with a win under its belt.
Harvard (1-7) earned its first W of the season over Lamar (11-6) in Beaumont, Texas, with a clean 4-0 victory Friday night. But the team’s struggles in close games continued, as the Crimson dropped a pair of one-run contests on Saturday and fell, 10-3, in the final game of the series on Sunday.
LAMAR 10, HARVARD 3
Despite jumping out to an early lead, the Crimson could not hang on in the late innings and settled for a loss to end the four-game set.
Things fell apart for Harvard in the seventh inning, when the Big Red strung together six singles and posted five runs to seize the lead. Lamar put the game firmly out of reach with a three-run homer from Jacoby Middleton in the eighth.
In his second pitching appearance of the weekend, junior Tanner Anderson took the loss for the Crimson. The Harvard pitching staff struggled against the middle of the Lamar lineup, as the third through sixth hitters went a combined 10-for-14.
For the Crimson, the highlight of the day came in the first inning when junior Mike Martin led off the game with a solo shot to left field. Harvard managed ten hits of its own—three players, Martin included, finished with two knocks—but the Lamar staff ensured that the hits were scattered.
LAMAR 3, HARVARD 2
Down one run in the top of the ninth, the Crimson found itself in a familiar spot. This time, Harvard successfully broke through to tie the game, as sophomore Mike Klug reached on a leadoff walk and scored on an RBI groundout from senior Carlton Bailey to send the game into extras.
But the first two Big Red hitters reached base in the bottom of the tenth, and a single two batters later allowed Lamar to walk off with another win in the rubber match of Saturday’s doubleheader.
The game was marked by effective pitching on both sides. Senior Sam Dodge made it into the seventh inning, giving up zero earned runs and just four hits. Dodge escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second and retired seven straight in one stretch.
“We really threw in the zone and weren’t walking too many guys,” Anderson said. “We were making them hit. We were really just trying to throw strikes and letting our defense do the work behind us.”
Harvard could never get things going at the plate, as a trio of Big Red pitchers held the team to just four hits in ten innings. Junior Brandon Kregel registered the Crimson’s only extra-base hit, a double that plated the first run of the game in the sixth.
LAMAR 4, HARVARD 3
After falling behind by four runs, the Crimson nearly clawed all the way back in the first game of the doubleheader. A four-hit sixth inning plated two runs, and Kregel tacked on an RBI groundout to bring Harvard within one.
But the Crimson would come up just short. After loading the bases with two outs in the eighth, Martin fouled out to end the threat. And despite putting a pair of runners in scoring position with one down in the top of the ninth, two consecutive outs resulted in Harvard dropping another tight decision.
“We really have to finish games off,” Anderson said. “We struggled a little on the mound and they put a few runs on us, but that’s something we have to come back from.”
The Crimson dug itself into an early hole by surrendering three runs in the first two innings. In his second collegiate start, freshman Nick Gruener walked the first two batters of the game and gave up a two-out double that scored both.
After a two-out rally resulted in another run Big Red run in the second, freshman Nick Gruener would settle down and complete six innings having allowed four earned runs.
The top six hitters in the Crimson’s lineup all registered knocks in the game, but the Harvard could not overcome the 14 men it left on base.
HARVARD 4, LAMAR 0
After dropping four tight contests last weekend, the Crimson finally got itself in the win column Friday night. Harvard rode strong pitching, timely hitting, and error-free defense to a 4-0 victory in the first game of the series.
Sophomore Sean Poppen blew through the Big Red lineup in six dominant innings, scattering just four hits while striking out eight. Poppen left the game after retiring seven consecutive batters, and Anderson would enter in the eighth to record a five-out save.
Harvard put two runs on the board in the second frame with back-to-back RBI singles from Bailey and Klug. That would prove to be enough for the Crimson pitching staff, but the team tacked on another run in the fifth inning and successfully executed a squeeze in the eighth.
Both Anderson and Kregel – who combined for just one hit in four games against Oral Roberts – saw their bats come alive, as each registered three knocks in the contest.
“Most of the games were pretty close,” Anderson said. “The first one was pretty good; the shutout is always nice. After that I thought we played pretty well, but it didn’t really fall our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clinging to a one-point lead versus rival Yale (12-15, 6-7 Ivy) with just under a minute left, the Harvard women’s basketball team (20-7, 10-3) needed a basket to end a two minute scoring drought and attain a historic win for head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
Junior forward Temi Fagbenle did just that, knocking down a jumper to put the Crimson up, 68-65, with 35 seconds left. These two points, paired with strong defense on the other end, clinched win number 515 for Delaney-Smith, making her the all-time winningest coach in Ivy League history, passing former Princeton men’s basketball head coach Pete Carril.
“Pete was such an icon, such a great [coach],” Delaney-Smith said. “[The fact that] I’m in the same sentence [as him is something] I should be very proud of.”
The Crimson was never able to separate itself from the Bulldogs until the end of the second stanza, and neither team could establish a lead larger than seven points throughout the game.
Fagbenle recorded her second straight double-double, her 11th of the season. The junior led Harvard with 23 points and 12 rebounds while senior guard Jasmine Evans chipped in 11 points on four-of-eight shooting. Evans also had four assists, providing a spurt of energy off the bench with key drives throughout the game.
“The drives [were working], whether it’d be driving for the layup or the drive and the kick,” Evans said. “We did a really good job of drawing their defense [in] and finding the open player…. It was working for us the whole night."
The first half saw the Crimson go back and forth with Yale, as the lead changed hands six times throughout the period before Harvard went on a 12-3 run to take a 35-28 lead. Sophomore guard Kit Metoyer helped lead the run with a slick crossover to shake her defender before hitting a step-back jumper from beyond the arc, the first of her back-to-back three pointers during this stretch.
Yale would answer with five straight points in the last 28 seconds of the game, including a buzzer-beating triple by guard Lena Munzer, to shrink the gap to two heading into the locker room.
The second half would see each team struggle to assert its dominance over the other, with both teams relinquishing six-point leads before being deadlocked at in a 60-all tie with just under five minutes left. The Crimson took a 62-60 lead as senior guard Christine Clark sank a pair of free throws, and a steal by senior Melissa Mullins would lead to one of two back-to-back layups for Fagbenle to push the lead to six.
Yale would not go away quietly as the Bulldogs responded with a 5-0 run, punctuated by a layup off of a steal by Munzer. Yale failed to convert on the offensive end following Fagbenle’s jumper, sealing the win for the Crimson on an emotional night.
“I love this team,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t know how the cards are going to fall, but I thought what happened tonight was just blood, guts, effort and work ethic. They were unbelievable.”
Despite the win, Delaney-Smith believes that there are still some adjustments that could be made in light of Harvard’s struggles on the night.
“Our rebounding was not good in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “They got 13 offensive rebounds and that’s far too many for a game, let alone a half. [Another] thing this team can get better at is execution. I don’t know that we set our screens or used our screens as well as I would like us to.”
The coach wasn’t the only one to notice the need for improvements, with the players echoing similar sentiments.
“We started a little slow on rebounds but we made the adjustment, which is a key for this team,” Evans said. “Being able to make the adjustment and stopping what has been working for them [is key].”
Even the mistakes made by the Crimson could not take away from the excitement of the win.
“I’m so happy for Kathy,” Fagbenle said. “It’s an honor [to play for Delaney-Smith]. It’s more than basketball, this program; win or lose, we stick together and she has just made that clear to us. The team is so important, and I love her for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team entered Ingalls Rink on Saturday night with one mission in mind – extending its season to a tiebreaking game on Sunday. With less than ten minutes to go in the third period, it looked as if Harvard might be able to hold on to a one-goal lead.
But less than a minute later, the Crimson found itself behind and quickly in desperation mode in a hostile environment.
Yale mustered two third period goals – both of which came on the man advantage - en route to downing Harvard for the fourth and final time of the season.
“I think we could have done some things better,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But the effort was outstanding.”
As senior goaltender Raphael Girard was pulled with less than a minute remaining for the extra attacker in an effort to capture an equalizer, it would prove to be the last time he would ever don the Harvard sweater on college ice.
“It’s been great playing for Harvard,” Girard said. “It’s been a great honor.”
A FAILED FINAL PENALTY KILL
Boasting one of the conference’s better penalty kills over the course of the season, the Crimson was ultimately done in by one final power play.
A boarding call on sophomore forward Brian Hart in the middle of the third period allowed for the Bulldogs to pull their goalie, as the team retained possession and tested the ECAC’s third-best penalty kill.
Harvard managed to kill off the first two Yale power plays on the night. But the third proved to be the breakthrough, as freshman forward Stu Wilson drove home a rebound to knot the game at one goal apiece.
“There were a lot of sticks out front,” Girard said. “One guy made a good shot top left.”
The Bulldogs then officially went on a power play as Hart went to the penalty box. After Yale won a faceoff in its zone, sophomore forward Kenny Agostino sent a puck off Girard’s shin guard and into the back of the net as the Crimson watched its lead evaporate.
“When you put traffic out front, that’s what happens,” Girard said.” [It was a] good bounce for them, but it was unlucky for us. It’s a part of the game…. It’s tough to beat the defending national champions.”
RAPH’S FINAL STAND
By all appearances, Girard seemed determined not to let Saturday night be his final collegiate appearance. The senior had turned away 35 shots entering the middle of the third period in order to preserve Harvard’s tenuous lead before two snuck by on Yale’s man advantage.
“Girard was outstanding,” Donato said. “He gave us a chance to have a lead with ten minutes to go.”
Girard was not the only one who wanted to play on Sunday.
The entire squad gave all that it could so that the puck never saw the back of the Crimson net. Defensemen and forwards alike were dropping to the ice, interfering with the puck’s path to the crease. That determination helped Harvard keep its lead for much of the game.
But it wasn’t long enough.
“With all of the guys being juggled around, we probably didn’t have the ability to sustain enough offensive zone time,” Donato said. “Because of that, you certainly get a little more tired playing defense.”
“They put a lot of shots on net,” he added. “But I thought in general our guys really battled and did a lot of good things. I though the effort and energy were excellent. But it was a frustrating result.”
Girard finished the year third in the conference in save percentage, turning away 92.4 percent of the shots he saw on net. Despite maintaining that high performance during Saturday’s game, turning away nearly 95 percent of the Yale shots on net, the Crimson was unable to capitalize.
“For them to get two goals with extra guys on the ice, it’s a tough pill to swallow,” Donato said.
Such quality performance has been the norm over Girard’s career. After taking on a bigger role sophomore year, he stood atop of the ECAC in save percentage with a rate of .947, putting him at fifth in the nation.
Although Girard’s collegiate career came to a close on Saturday, his hockey career has not.
“[That was] definitely not [my last game],” Girard said. “Right now, I don’t know where it’s going to be. I’m opening to play anywhere else to keep my career going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (9-5, 7-2 EIVA) went on the road this weekend to take on conference foes George Mason (8-8, 4-4) and Princeton (7-7, 6-2). The Patriots and Tigers have provided tests for the Crimson in years past, and this weekend was no different.
George Mason dominated the visiting Harvard men in a straight-sets victory on Friday night before the Crimson ended a six-match win streak for Princeton, overcoming its Ivy rivals in a five-set thriller in New Jersey.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
Harvard and Princeton are the only Ivy schools with varsity men’s volleyball teams. Over the last few years, especially as both teams have established themselves as EIVA contenders, a real rivalry has developed between the two squads.
Crimson coach Brian Baise was himself a Tiger undergrad once upon a time. And when Harvard visited Dillon Gym on Saturday, the home crowd was out in full force for the occasion.
“I think there’s been a rivalry for the last couple of years,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “They’re the only other Ivy school in our league. It’s definitely going to be a really tough match every time we play them, and they brought a lot of fans today. We love the rivalry; it brings the energy up. It’s easy to play on the road when there’s a lot of people bringing the energy of the gym up.”
Both teams are near the top of the EIVA standings, and the game could very well have previewed a future playoff matchup. On Saturday, both sides played their hearts out.
The two squads traded sets—Princeton won the first and third and Harvard took the second and fourth—to set up the decisive fifth game. Even then there was nothing to separate the two combatants as neither team ever led by more than one until the score was 12-12, with both sides just three points from victory.
“It was pretty awesome,” co-captain Chris Gibbons said. “The four years that I have been here, we always go at it with Princeton. Almost all of the matches we’ve played against them have gone to five, and we usually have ended up on top and we did it again on Saturday. So we’re pretty excited to get that win.”
At 12-12 in the fifth, it was the Crimson’s mettle which prevailed. With nothing separating the two teams all day, Harvard pulled away with a 3-0 run to win the match, ending with a service ace from freshman Nick Bendell.
“I think that both teams were playing really well, and we sort of exchanged games throughout the match,” Gibbons said. “What it came down to in the very end, we made a few less mistakes than Princeton did and we were able to take advantage of the mistakes they made and find a way to win at the end of the match.”
There were a number of excellent individual performance on each side, with the Tigers’ Cody Kessel and Pat Schwagler pacing both squads with 16 kills on the night.
But the Crimson captains especially stood out. Gibbons had a team-high 15 digs, and Madden posted his sixth career double-double with 10 kills and 11 digs.
“[It was a] pretty good fight on our part, particularly after last night [against George Mason],” Madden said. “We started to get some blocks and some defensive plays, and that was really the key to winning that one. We served decently well and we just played a good style, making some scrappy tough plays towards the end there.”
GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 0
When these two squads met earlier in the season, Harvard ran out as the victors in straight sets. But on Friday night, the Patriots completely reversed that result and dispatched its visitors in three games.
“I think Friday night, not much was going well for us,” Gibbons said. “I’m not sure if we weren’t fully ready to play or what exactly it was, but George Mason played a good match and it was mainly just a lot of errors on our side and a failure to execute.”
Madden pointed to the squad’s defense as the missing component against the Patriots. In a statistical rarity, the Crimson was unable to post a single block as the George Mason offense simply ran the show.
“We didn’t have a single block which reflects that our defense could have been a lot sharper,” Madden said. “We were serving decently well, but our defense wasn’t great. I think George Mason played really well. All around, though, just not a great game for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only one player from the Harvard women’s lacrosse team found the back of the net throughout the entire 60 minutes of play on Saturday.
The Crimson (2-2, 1-1 Ivy) fell to No. 15/17 Penn (3-1, 1-0) by a 9-4 margin at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, as the loss drops Harvard to .500 on the season. The team has been unable to tally a victory against the Quakers in its last 15 matchups, dating back to 2001.
“We were a little disappointed with the outcome,” freshman attacker Marisa Romeo said. “It wasn’t really turnovers or anything like that; it was just one of those days when shots weren’t falling. The score doesn’t really represent what happened. It was really a close game the whole time.”
Romeo led the team with all four of its goals, bringing her season total up to a team-high 13. Her four tallies Saturday tied a season-high that she had previously scored against St. Mary’s on Feb. 23.
“Marisa is a great dodger,” freshman Maeve McMahon said. “She was double teamed and still was able to get shots on goal. She gets to know a team, and she did and was able to score. We were playing off the ball, so credit to her for getting those goals.”
There were no lead changes throughout the match, as Penn scored in the first five minutes of the game and did not look back.
The Crimson managed to get within one goal multiple times, coming closest when the contest was 4-3 and 5-4, but could not muster the offensive push to pull ahead. The largest Penn lead of the game was five, reflected in the final score.
After the 15 minute mark in the second half, the Harvard sticks went silent. The Quakers held the Crimson to no scoring for the rest of the game, while adding four goals of their own in the meantime.
“We talked a lot about off ball [during halftime],” McMahon said. “We wanted to make sure that people that didn’t have the ball are still doing their job. Playing our game and playing our system is really important to us. Doing that is the only way we are going to win.”
Romeo’s first two goals were free-position shots that snuck past Penn goalie Lucy Ferguson.  The second strike came off a pass that the defender was called for a shooting fake on, allowing Romeo to have a shot at a free-position goal.
“That was really something that we worked on in practice all week; getting defense out of position in order to draw a whistle,” Romeo said. “That fact that we were able to execute that in a game and even get a goal off of it was good.”
Her next two goals both went in the net unassisted, giving Romeo most of Harvard’s offensive stats on the day.
Sophomore defender Tory Waldstein had four ground balls in the match, contributing to the Crimson final tally of 18. The Quakers one-upped Harvard and had 19 on the day.
“We are going to keep building on what’s been happening; working on our offense, defense and transitioning,” McMahon said. “Making sure the whole team has our system down and executes during games is what is going to help us going further in the season.”
Penn also outshot Harvard, 19-18, throughout the game and had the advantage in draw controls, winning 12 out of the 15.
“It was a little bit of both [a slow start and shots not falling],” Romeo said. “We got a lot more shots off on this team than we did last week, but we definitely weren’t as sure of ourselves in the first half of the game as we were against Cornell [last Saturday].”
Harvard managed to win the turnover battle, as the team forced Penn to cough it up 13 times to 12 of its own. Saturday marked just Harvard’s second conference game of the season.
“We’re definitely going to work on our offense more because our defense played outstanding,” Romeo said. “The offense just wasn’t able to execute. I think we are going to really emphasize that going forward in practices and in games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hosting some of the best teams in the nation, the Harvard women’s water polo team had some trouble against top-ranked opponents this weekend at the Harvard Invite. The Crimson went 1-3 on the weekend against the stiff competition.
SANTA CLARA 9, HARVARD 7
In a game that honored the Crimson’s two seniors as their final home contest of the season, Harvard (8-6, 0-1 Ivy) put up a fight against the No. 18 Broncos (7-9).
“The support was so awesome,” co-captain Shayna Price said. “[The way] the teammates, parents, and fans treat you at the end of your years is awesome. I’m definitely going to miss it, but I know there’s half a season left.”
By halftime the score was tied at four, with the lead having changed three times in the first two frames of play. Goals by freshman Melissa Balding and junior Kalina Grabb brought the Crimson to the tie.
“Santa Clara is a very good team, and they battled very well,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I’m very proud of the way my girls played. They played four quarters of great water polo in this game.”
In the second half of the game, the Bronco’s offense came out firing, with two quick goals in the first three minutes of the third quarter.
Sophomore Yoshi Andersen brought the match to a tie at six with a goal from five meters out that skipped past the Broncos’ goalie and floated past the goal line for a score.
Another Andersen goal off a spin move was Harvard’s last score of the game, as Santa Clara scored two more in the final eight minutes that proved to be the final and deciding tallies of the game.
HARVARD 9, MARIST 8
In its only win of the weekend, the Crimson came out strong on Sunday morning to rally and beat the Red Foxes (4-12).
After opening the game with one goal apiece, Harvard was able to score three goals in a row to lead, 4-2, at the end of the first quarter.
The Crimson did not give up its lead for the rest of the game, and Harvard found itself up, 6-3, halfway into the second quarter. Marist came close to seizing the lead midway through the second half when the Red Foxes tied the game at seven. Price and Balding kept the Crimson’s lead by notching two goals late in the fourth quarter to seal the win.
“The girls always come with lots of effort,” Minnis said. “We want to be one of the top teams in the country and to do that we have to play against the top teams in the country.”
SAN DIEGO STATE 12, HARVARD 8
The Crimson came out strong in the first frame of play against the No. 16 Aztecs, going ahead, 5-3, in the beginning eight minutes of play after goals from freshman Michelle Martinelli and sophomore Charlotte Hendrix.
The scoring fleet was quieted in the following three quarters, with Harvard tallying only three goals for the rest of the game while the Atzecs (10-6) mustered nine more nets.
Price and Andersen each had two goals for the Crimson, followed by Balding, Martinelli, and classmate Jillian Dukes, who all contributed a goal in the effort.
Price also led Harvard in assists with three, followed by junior Victoria Frager, who had two.
MICHIGAN 16, HARVARD 10
Matching up against the No. 20 Wolverines (10-10) proved to be too much for the Crimson to handle in its opening game of the weekend.
The Michigan offense had a strong day in the pool, with three players registering hat tricks against Harvard goalie Ariel Dukes.
The Crimson was able to hold its own in the first quarter, with a combined nine goals scored in the first eight minutes of play. The Wolverines came away with the lead at the end of the opening quarter, 5-4, and did not look back from there.
Michigan came out in the second quarter on an offensive roll, scoring four goals before the half. Harvard answered with two but could not close the gap.
“It’s a 1-3 weekend, so from the outside looking in you’re thinking ‘Wow, that wasn’t a great weekend,’ but we lost to three top-20 teams, and we lost in close games,” Minnis said. “We learned a lot in those games. We were in the games and didn’t have huge mistakes that cost us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After last week's success at Ivy League Championships, the Harvard track and fields teams headed to BU this weekend to compete in the ECAC and ICAAAA Championships.
The Crimson sent 27 athletes and one relay team across the river to compete. As a team, the Harvard men placed 9th out of 41 teams in the ICAAAA Championships with 35 points and the women placed 31st of 46 teams in the ECAC Championships with a 10 point total. Ancient Eight foe Cornell took the top spot for the men while Connecticut claimed the top of the podium in the women’s division.
“For us, the focal point of the season from a team standpoint is the Ivy Championships,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “This is a really great chance to get another championship atmosphere opportunity, and I thought we were very productive and got a lot out of it.”
Senior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu had a solid performance for the Crimson, coming off a stellar performance in the weight throw last weekend at the Ivy League Championships, Though it wasn’t as far as her championship toss last weekend, the senior finished in first place at ECACs with a weight throw of 19.51 meters on her last of six tosses. Second place finisher Jocelyn Williams of Liberty University was nearly a full meter behind Ekechukwu.
Fellow senior James Leakos had a strong performance for the men’s squad, winning the 3000-meter run. With a time of 7:57.88, Leakos beat last year’s IC4A winning time by five seconds. The mark puts him third in Harvard history in the 3K, which he also won last weekend at the Ivy League Championships. Sophomore Thomas Purnell finished sixth in the race with a time of 8:03.39.
“I was really pleased with both of those seniors and for them to be able to finish out their indoor careers with wins,” Saretsky said. “It was great to see.”
Though Ekechukwu was the only point winner for the Harvard women, senior Emily Reese and freshman Stephanie Deccy also placed in the meet. Both ran the 3K, with Reese coming in 31st and Deccy just behind her in 35th.
Adding to the Crimson senior dominance, sprinter Andrew Ezekoye finished fourth in the 60-meter dash, cutting his time in each of the three heats. In the final heat, Ezekoye finished with a time of 6.94 seconds.
“Coach is watching every aspect of my 60 run, and you know there’s little things that you can tweak with every heat,” Ezekoye said. “But on race day you try not to get overly technical, which was why I was really happy the races were spread out over two days. Coach let me know a couple things wrong with my start, and we tried to fix that going into the next day.”
Fellow sprinter Jarvis Harris claimed fifth in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.08 seconds.
In the field for the men, senior Dustin Brode and junior Ben Glauser had strong showings, and both earned points for Harvard. Brode competed in the shot put and finished fourth with a  throw of 17.88 meters, while Glauser took the second spot in the weight throw with a distance of 19.46.
Freshman Andrew Roney took 15th in the pole vault, launching 4.80 meters.
Though their performances were strong, multiple competitors failed to match their times and distances from Ivy Championships.
“Once you get into post-conference championships races, everyone is coming off their conference championships,” Ezekoye said. “We try to peak for Heps, and its always tough to come back and do it again right after your conference championships. It’s where the juices are flowing the highest, and you’re really hyped to run.”
But for Ezekoye, the chance to represent Harvard and the Ivy League was the best part of the meet.
“It’s more of an accomplishment to qualify for these post season races,” Ezekoye said. “There’s a lot of energy knowing I made it here, and you know that that you’re definitely qualified to represent your school.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the last guaranteed chance to wrestle for Harvard this season as the Crimson squad headed to Philadelphia for the EIWA Championships, hoping to vie for bids to the NCAA Tournament.  After a hard fought weekend, the team notched one confirmed bid to NCAA’s and a 12th place finish overall.
“This was where we wanted to wrestle our best,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We had five guys place higher than their seeds, three of whom went in unseeded. We had an individual champion, and an outstanding wrestler. If you look at it that way, there were a lot of positives.”
The weekend of competition had its ups and downs from beginning to end. While Harvard finished with its first individual EIWA Champion since 2010, the Crimson also suffered tough losses early on in the lineup.
“I think that we definitely could have wrestled better,” sophomore Devon Gobbo said. “There were a bunch of guys who wish that they had placed just a little bit higher to get that trip to NCAA’s.”
One of the hardest losses of the tournament came from two-time NCAA tournament qualifier and dual season standout James Fox. The junior co-captain had seen a highly successful regular season, carrying a personal record of 14-7 into the match. Fox took down his first opponent, Bucknell’s Tyler Lyster, but soon saw his ten-match winning streak come to an end, as he dropped his first match in overtime, losing by fall to Binghamton’s Cody Reed. The junior then dropped his match by fall to Navy’s Paul Rands.
“He did not wrestle his best, and he had a couple tough breaks,” Weiss said. “I thought he could’ve been in the finals. He’s just that good. I know it hurts him, but we are keeping our fingers crossed that he’ll get another shot, and win that wildcard bid to nationals.”
Following the first day of competition, five Harvard wrestlers remained in contention for an EIWA title.
Of these five, Todd Preston was the only one to take his run all the way. In a nail-biter championship matchup, Preston managed to win in overtime to take first place in the 141 lbs. weight class, garnering Most Outstanding Wrestler honors along with the title.
“We knew how good he is going into this, and he wrestled extremely well this weekend,” Weiss said. “He’s been wrestling really well coming down the stretch. In his finals match, there were a lot of really tough calls, and but he managed to keep his composure the whole time.”
“Seeing him go out there and accomplish his personal goal was really exciting for everyone on the team,” Gobbo added.
Several Crimson wrestlers also snagged a spot on the podium. Jeffrey Ott, co-captain Cameron Croy and Gobbo each notched sixth place, while heavyweight David Ng picked up a seventh place finish.
“We had a lot of guys go out there and do great things, in spite of the fact that they didn’t win overall,” Weiss said. “Nick Stager had a tough year and came out and won, David Ng had a huge performance this weekend, and Jeffrey Ott also really showed up.”
For Croy, his hard-fought sixth place finish was bittersweet. The senior managed to post two big upsets over Army’s fourth-seeded Ryan Tompkins and Princeton’s fifth-seeded Brett Harner before falling in the semis to Cornell’s top-ranked Gabriel Dean.
“It’s always tough for me as a coach to see my athletes finish their career,” Weiss said.  “But I’m happy for him. He went out and wrestled well, and I’m glad that he can say he placed in his last tournament. It’s obviously bittersweet but he did a nice job, and I’m very proud of him.”
In spite of his podium finish, Gobbo also ended his season on a tough note, missing a nationals bid by one place as he fell to Boston University’s Mitchell Wightman in the fifth place match.
“I didn’t perform the way I wanted to,” Gobbo said. “And it was really hard to lose that last match and know I wasn’t going to nationals, but I was also really happy to be able to wrestle after being out with an injury for the past eight weeks.”
The end may have been less than ideal, but Harvard still has Nationals to prepare for.
“I don’t think we wrestled our best, but as a team we wrestled well,” Weiss said. “We still have room to grow. But I’m pleased, and I’m even more excited for the next step. Now we get out to Nationals, and I think we have the potential to really do well out there.”

It was very early and there were only two law students in the gym. The undergraduates preferred to come later in the day. The law students came early. They had the gym to themselves.
The two men worked out four times per week together. One had been a football player at Duke. The other played every intramural as an undergraduate without much success. He came in third place in a ping pong tournament sophomore year. He was happy he won third place and not second because he won his last match. It was better to end on a win, he thought.
They were wearing the same shirt. One wore red, one wore blue. They had different colors for different years. It said: “Harvard Law School Flag Football.” They liked that it said “Harvard Law School” and “football” on one shirt.
“Where are you working next year?” one said while the other did a set.
“Jones Day. You?”
“Davis Polk.”
Davis Polk was ranked as more prestigious. They both knew it.
“How much do you want to bench press?”
“205. You?” He knew the other man could not lift 205 pounds.
“Just 180 for me.”
After they finished they showered and dressed for class. They wore gingham shirts and sweaters. They would see each other in two days for leg day. It was a routine.

The evolution of virtual communication has been short but significant. Initially, text messages were just that, text. Then, emoticons were integrated (:D). These days, we can communicate with photos, videos, voice memos, and emojis—you never have to actually type again! Now, thanks to Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor David Edwards, a completely necessary new way to communicate is available, the smext.Smexting, not to be confused with sexting, (the “o” stands for olfactive, not that other sensory experience—we don’t think anyone’s working on sending that virtually yet), is the ability to send smells via a new device developed by Edwards. According to the device’s website, a scent message is a “moving gesture of friendship”...like when your friend crop-dusts you?The device is an attachment for your phone and contains a chip that can create hundreds of odors. You can’t yet “capture” a scent and send it to your friends, so no texting the scent of a Veritaffle to wake up your roommates or the odor of the person in front of you in lecture to make sure your friends feel (smell) your pain. But maybe that’s a good thing?With help from Harvard students, who now work full-time on this venture, Edwards has been spreading smells all around the world. He is opening a lab in Cambridge this year where the device will be for sale sometime this summer.

Would you take a Harvard Law professor to court? Better yet, would you take on a legal expert who specializes in copyright law for violating copyright? Yeah, doesn’t seem like a good idea.Well, Liberation Music—a music label that oversees the French band Phoenix among others—did. And guess what? They lost.If you haven’t heard of Law professor Lawrence Lessig, he is kind of a big deal, especially when it comes to Copyright Law. Before coming to the Law School, Lessig founded the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and also serves as a founding board member of Creative Commons, a non-profit that seeks to build the range of creative works people can legally share.After Lessig used Phoenix’s song, “Liztomania,” as the backing track to a video that he posted on YouTube for a lecture, Liberation Music asked YouTube to remove the content. The video was taken down, but Lessig responded with a counter-notice that demanded the video be reposted, citing the video as a clear example of “fair use,” which is legal jargon for “I know more than you about copyright law.”But get this: Liberation Music responded with, “nah.”And in the least surprising move of the century, Lessig and the Electronic Frontier Foundation sued.Suddenly, Liberation Music backtracked, or maybe they just discovered their understanding of law was lacking. The label settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. It’s unclear if these type of rivalries make it onto Las Vegas’ betting boards, but did Liberation Music really believe they even had a chance? This had to be a publicity stunt, right?
