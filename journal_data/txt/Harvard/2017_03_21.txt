After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cities have always been fertile ground for artists and inquiring minds, and no phenomenon has captured this notion more than that of the flâneur. The flâneur is typically described as a man who wanders urban streets and byways, often looking for inspiration. These men seek to thoroughly know a city, and discreetly observe its comings and goings. But is flânerie, this art of idling, even possible for women? Can a woman walk through city streets, unobserved but always observing? Is there such a thing as a flâneuse? The male gaze, restrictions on female movements in public, and street harassment have long cast doubt on this possibility.
However, these are the questions Lauren Elkin seeks to answer in her book “Flâneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London.” Part memoir, part cultural criticism, Elkin’s book wanders with her as she explores the cities she has come to know. Elkin came to understand the practice and the concept of flânerie during her rovings as a student in Paris. She describes these walks with intimacy, throwing place names at her reader almost too quickly to follow. These mentions are almost always accompanied by a tidbit of history that give the reader a fleeting feeling of familiarity. In this way, Elkin succeed in recreating the experience of flânerie with her book—any of her chapters, especially those in Paris and New York,is a good substitute for a brief stroll through the cities described.
While narrating her own wanderings, Elkin describes those of other women who deserve to be called flâneuse. These include Virginia Woolf, Agnès Varda, Sophie Calle, and Jean Rhys women who not only practiced flânerie, but depicted the flâneuse in their novels, films, and art. Elkin’s historical predecessors are more than simply evidence of the existence of the flâneuse for her—they are artists with whom she has connected, by way of their work. They have guided Elkin in her journeys through the world, and the places that they called home.
With these women at her back, Elkin easily answers the question of whether the flâneuse exists. She concedes that women in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries faced more risks in flânerie than did their male counterparts. However, she insists that “to suggest that there couldn’t be a female version of the flâneur is to limit the ways women have interacted with the city to the ways men have interacted with the city.” Elkin sets out to discover the distinctly feminine forms of flânerie.
For the most part, Elkin succeeds; however, just as in any walk, not every moment feels worthwhile. She lingers on Paris—it is clearly her favorite—just slightly too long, mentioning churches and cafés that are meaningless to those not in the know. Tokyo, by comparison, gets short shrift. She writes extensively about her dislike for the city, although she admits that much of that feeling is due to her romantic problems at the time. She professes to not understanding the city; despite her attempts at flânerie, she cannot get a foothold. Unlike in every other chapter, Elkin doesn’t refer to any inspirational woman in the Tokyo section. The only views of the city that she does mention are Western ones, primarily literary theorist Roland Barthes and Sofia Coppola’s film “Lost in Translation.” Surprisingly, she is unable to find a local flâneuse—if she had, perhaps she might have enjoyed her time their more.
Though the issue with her time in Tokyo is small, it points to a larger critique of Elkin’s book. Much of the content of the book is truly accessible only to those who know New York and Paris, and have read all the relevant books by the writers who live there. Of course, this is true of most memoirs and depictions of places, but insofar as she wants “Flâneuse” to be a work of cultural criticism as well, it is decidedly narrow. As a memoir, it never quite gives the reader a complete picture of Elkin’s life, but merely presents images glimpsed in passing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week in New York, I went to see “Dear Evan Hansen,” the new original Broadway musical with music by Pasek and Paul and book by Steve Levenson. The show tells the story of Evan Hansen, a socially ostracized high school senior who writes letters addressed to himself as part of a therapy exercise. When Connor Murphy, a classmate bully, steals one of Evan’s letters, Evan panics—only to discover the next day that Connor has committed suicide, and the letter circumstantially appears to be his suicide note. On the spur of the moment, Evan fabricates a friendship with the classmate, and ultimately forges close relationships with the classmate’s surviving family: his parents and his sister, Zoe, on whom Evan has a crush. Evan must confront the consequences of his lie, and navigate the complications of his relationships, new and old.
For Evan, the self-addressed letters that his therapist prescribes serve as a means of self-expression, even when he lacks the vocabulary and the courage to articulate his feelings to others—namely, to his concerned mother. The letters, which begin “Dear Evan Hansen, today is going to be a good day, and here’s why:” are a sacred space, a venue for the expression of the unpleasant, the humiliating, the intensely personal, and everything between.
And Evan has plenty of material to draw upon. Because although nobody actively antagonizes Evan, no one really likes him, either. Even his mother, a working single parent, doesn’t seem to have time for him. By all definitions, he feels invisible. “On the outside always looking in, / will I ever be more than I’ve always been?” he sings in “Waving Through a Window,” his solo. “‘Cause I’m tap, tap, tapping on the glass / I’m waving through a window / I try to speak but nobody can hear / So I wait around for an answer to appear.” What Evan does by lying to the Murphy family is unethical, the show suggests, but it’s his only chance to be seen, to feel wanted. Can we really blame him?
In the show, the conceit of letter-writing dovetails with the integration of social media into plot and theme. This concept manifests in stage design: surrounding the physical stage settings are screens of varying size. As Evan gains fame through the Connor Project, his commemorative Internet campaign against bullying, screens flash images of his social media accounts. Follower counts rise. His online presence expands. If invisibility was a problem for Evan before, he encounters the opposite problem: hyperbolic publicity, and with it, scrutiny.
It should come as no surprise that “Dear Evan Hansen” pairs the epistolary form and the newfound, intense connectivity of the Internet. It might be easy for older, critical voices to tear down the fundamental notion of social media: to scorn the idea of pouring so much spirit and energy and self into an empty and infinite void.
But there's something beautiful about that connectivity, that limitless reaching out and touching. Social media is a kind of letter: a letter to the unknown, to a vast cyberspace, to the people waiting on the other side of the screen. “If you only look around, from across the silence, your voice is found,” the company sings in “You Will Be Found,” the closing number of the first act. “Someone will come running, to take you home.”

At a whopping 12 minutes, Drake’s music video “Child’s Play” is too long for a child to play with. Tyra Banks stars as his girlfriend, who will not take any of his cheating. When she finds suspicious texts on his phone, she doesn’t hesitate to make a scene at the restaurant.
Not just any restaurant, either, but the classy and romantic Cheesecake Factory. As Drake makes his way out of the bathroom after realizing his fatal mistake of leaving his phone on the table, the cinematography reveals a buildup of suspense. Small details are accentuated as the frame zooms in on his feet and other tables in the restaurant, in slow motion, and the extraterrestrial sounding music gets louder and louder. Before it all goes down the drain, Drake makes a nervous comment, “This is like the nicest [Cheesecake factory] that I’ve seen!”
Tyra Banks will not stand such behavior, however. Drake tries to calm her down, with little success. This girl is on top of the world. Clapping in his face, she screams “I AM TIRED OF YOU AUBREY,” enunciating each word with each clap like a cheerleader gone mad. As the couple’s argument reaches a boiling point, and Drake throws a “Tell me—What do you want to do?” at Tyra. Answering the question, she shoves the cheesecake in his face. Oh, fresh Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. To put the cherry on top, she pours the remaining wine down his face. Though a disgusted couple in the restaurant had left earlier, now you hear people cheering in the background for Tyra. Obviously, her choice to stick up for herself is admirable.
Drake begins to sing now, with the cheesecake still smothered all over his face, and the wine still dripping down his shirt. Even he knows that this is all just some child’s play—but wait, he’s calling Tyra a child? Do I sense some hypocrisy?
The plot thickens at the strip club that Drake’s friend invites him to go to that night. All the ladies are rounded up by a “sheriff” who has dubbed himself none other than “The Texas Hammer Junior.” The girl’s names are a variety of mixed marbles, from Coco to Honey and then of course, a notorious Infectious. After a round-up of the strip girls (quite literally) with a disgraceful prayer that bends a reasonable understanding of a prayer, “way down yonder/in the chattahoochee/shit it gets hotter than a hoochie coochie,” Drake goes full out in the strip club. Twenties fly everywhere, trippy lights flash through the air, and Drake laments his break-up.

The Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art in Harvard Square is currently showing the works of Juan Roberto Diago, an Afro-Cuban artist who aims to write a revisionist history for his nation. The exhibition, on view until May 5, features twenty-five mixed-media and installation works that meditate on the history of slavery, racism, and reconciliation in Cuba. The Harvard Crimson spoke with curator Alejandro de la Fuente, who is a professor and historian of Latin America and Caribbean history at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: How were the works chosen for the exhibit? Is it reflective of different periods in Diago’s output?
Alejandro de la Fuente: This is a retrospective exhibition, so I was interested in selecting works that would showcase how Diago’s artistic creation has evolved over the last 20 years or so, both in terms of visual elements and in terms of the use of materials, which are very important to his work. I was particularly interested in selecting works that speak to what I see as a central thread in his work, which is his preoccupation with history and the need to articulate new histories of the Cuban nation from the point of view of the experiences of a person of African descent.
THC: Could you tell me more about this narrative that he’s responding to?
AF: The official narrative links the creation of the Cuban nation with the efforts and the contributions to a limited number of white patriots. People of African descent play a minor and subordinate role … and experiences such as dynamic growth and creation of the nation are looked through very Western eyes. But what people like Diago try to do is try to recenter that history by noting that the history of the Cuban nation is also a history of rape, a history of violence, a history of slave trade of hundreds of thousands of Africans, a history of racism, a history of exclusion. … So it’s a very different narrative from what Cuba is about, and a very different narrative of how Cuba came to be as a nation.
THC: And do you know how Diago came to be interested in revising his country’s history? Any personal experiences growing up, intellectual encounters in school?
AF: So he grew up in a very modest neighborhood in Havana. He grew up in a family that was deeply connected to Cuban popular culture and that had a deep respect for Afro-Cuban popular culture. One of his grandfathers was a very well-known Afro-Cuban painter, and one of his great-uncles was a very noted ethnomusicologist who basically devoted all his life to the study of Afro-Cuban popular music. … I think the fact that he came of age as an artist in the 1990s is very important, because this was when Cuba was in the midst of a major economic social crisis, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. So in a situation like that, social and racial tensions increased significantly, and it is precisely in that context that Diago comes to age and he begins to work. And that context was a context in which he became acutely aware of issues of racial justice and issues concerning discrimination and the persistence of racism in Cuban society.
THC: I noticed that he used a lot of industrial materials in his works. Could you tell me a bit about that?
AF: To him those materials are a way to connect with some of the social realities the people of African descent confront. Poor people make their houses with pieces of wood and metal scraps that they find, industrial residue, things like that.
THC: Did he just get them off the streets?
AF: Yeah, those materials—like the wood on the walls when you’re going up the ramp in the front— are woods that he collected over about two years in poor neighborhoods in Havana.
THC: I also wanted to ask about the one piece made of rope that goes up the second ramp. Does rope have any significance?
AF: Yeah, that piece represents a scar, which is something that you also find in many of his works. But if you look closely at the piece itself, the technique is of dreadlocks that people of African descent use for their hair.
THC: And the thing that stood out to me most in the exhibit was the recurring motif of the ghostly face.

Last fall, Harvard began offering its Master in Design Engineering degree, a new program jointly hosted by Graduate School of Design (GSD) and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Santiago A. Mota, an architect from Mexico City with training in economics, was one of the first students to enroll in this program. Mota, who co-founded the CASA Research and Design Group and won international awards for his design of social housing prototypes, sat down with The Crimson to talk about his projects and his experiences at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell us about your background?
SAM: I studied economics as an undergrad, and after spending four years on economics I decided to take a semester off. That semester ended up being two years, as I traveled around Europe and South America. When I came back to Mexico City, I thought I would work in economics. But once I arrived at the airport, I saw the city and knew I couldn’t do the same again. So I ended up enrolling again as an undergrad in architecture. That completely changed my life. Since 2008, I [have established] my own office with other friends. I’ve been dealing with the built environment for eleven or twelve years now, always shuffling professional work with academia, which I find fascinating. I think architectural schools are great places to experiment, but it’s also easy to isolate yourself from reality. But as an architect or urban designer, you cannot be removed from the city a hundred percent of the time. That’s something I try to balance in my work.
THC: What about the GSD’s Master of Design Engineering degree attracted you?
SAM: That’s hard to say because it’s the first year of the program, so there are a lot of areas of opportunities. My faculty is composed of faculty from the SEAS and also GSD. We have students from computer science, public policy, mechanical and electrical engineering. We have three architects, but they all have different tracks. We have people from India, Spain, Holland, China, Taiwan, and people from the U.S. We are all very different, and I think the diversity is very valuable for the program.
THC: What is the project you are working on?
SAM: The idea for the program is that every year there will be a year-long project addressing a domain. The first domain we had is the food system, which is an incredibly ubiquitous and complex system, working 24 hours, 365 days. In the first semester we conduct research to narrow down what the scope of our projects. We have a lot of speakers, key stakeholders from public policy, agribusiness, farmers, people who have dealt with franchises like McDonald's. … We split up in teams, gravitating towards each other, and each team comes up with its own project.
THC: How do you think your study here will influence your practice as an architect?
SAM: I actually decided to come to Harvard because I worked with a lot of people that graduated from the GSD, back in Mexico. A lot of my work was aligned with design and technology and how we leverage technology to solve real problems that architecture and urban design have. That allowed me to meet very talented people, and they showed me the projects they had done in the GSD and Harvard. … I ended up finding out even though I could design within a fairly reasonable price and with great benefits to users, the limitations were bigger than the design itself and the technology itself. There were broader aspects to learn to make ideas happen, to bring changes to reality. I ended up struggling a lot with bureaucracy and government agencies, and even though I had a team that could support the endeavor we were doing, we had a very limited impact. That’s what made me realize I need to come back to study, to engage in a broader academic agenda.

“I’ve got a premonition,” singer-songwriter Emma Harvey purrs as bandmate Kel Taylor’s crisp guitar thrums punctuate her words. The romance that Harvey and Taylor hint at in their new single, “Easy Now,” may be on the fritz, but the song itself is just the opposite: airy, nuanced, and utterly aflame.
Together, Harvey and Taylor are two halves of an up-and-coming, irresistible whole, the Nashville, Tennessee-based band Sawyer, who call their poppy-slash-folksy genre of music “indie sparkle pop.” The duo started out as individual performers, both undergraduates at Belmont University in Nashville, where Harvey often accompanied Taylor with guitar, voice, and other instruments. Teaming up officially in March 2015, Sawyer has released one full album, “Nightfall,” as well as three singles—“Letting Go,” “The Last Thing,” and “Ten Feet Tall”—each of which features sparse, smart lyrics and highlights the duo’s silken and lively vocal harmonies. “Easy Now,” their latest single, puts a strong foot forward for Sawyer’s future.
Like the band’s previous work, “Easy Now” features a relaxed, optimistic melody with an undercurrent of deep longing, thanks to astute, knowing lyrics. A few words say it all here, and each one is plucked carefully in an Emily Dickinson-like fashion. Returning to the song’s opening lines, ushered in by sweeping, breathy synth beats, Harvey sings: “I’ve got a premonition / It’s a loaded gun / I think, and it becomes.” The melody exudes a carefree grace, an infectiously genuine happiness that Harvey and Taylor radiate when performing together, and still the complexity of these lyrics lingers. The song tackles a relatable, albeit painful, reality—the inevitable end of a nonstarter relationship—and, in doing so, Sawyer manages to exude a fresh, thought-provoking spirit that is both youthfully feel-good and mature.
The catchy chorus, too, seems to encapsulate the effortless listening experience that Sawyer provides. In total control of their breezy sound, the pair sing: “Easy now / I let it go / But I don’t know where to put it down.” At the same time youthful and soulful, each note contains multitudes of sound, texture, and feeling. Harvey and Taylor’s harmonies blend seamlessly with light percussion and the ever-present guitar to create a manicured yet breathless aura. Like the lyrics suggest, so much is at stake for the song’s nebulous “I” protagonist, but Sawyer is an all-knowing guide to help her along her way. That Harvey and Taylor hold back some of their power, right until the song’s final bridge, only adds to the strong impression “Easy Now” makes. If Sawyer’s previous work (as well as this smooth single) are an indication of their musicianship and overall outlook, their future promises to be very “easy” indeed.

If “Kong: Skull Island” is indebted little to its cinematic predecessors in the Kong mythology, it is likely because the film is hardly indebted to cinema at all. A video game without the controller, it takes the viewer through characters and locations, switching between first-person shooter and third-person story mode. It’s a closed world with geography referenced often enough to warrant its own minimap, and the final bosses, including disconcertingly-sized arachnids, have a nasty habit of appearing from where one least expects them. Button mashing will not help here.
Shock-and-awe is the tactic of choice for this latest expedition to Kong’s domain, but beyond that the screenplay is a flimsy affair at best.  A team of scientists led by an underwhelming John Goodman flies with a military escort fresh from Vietnam, led by an underwhelming Samuel L. Jackson, to go monster hunting in the last uncharted isle of the South Pacific. Between Goodman reading a script that only delivers a tenth of his usual dynamism and Jackson’s composed take on a supposedly unhinged character, the energy is left a few rungs below repartee.
And if the dialogue requires a blind eye be turned, then the plot requires genuine leaps of faith. Tapping into the tradition of military video games, which often have an imperialist flair, helicopters drop bombs as “scientific instruments” to map the subterranean zones of the island, and of course, trying to empirically explain the existence of gorillas and lizard monsters the size of buildings is always going to weigh on any viewer’s credulity.
But no one goes to “Kong: Skull Island” in IMAX 3D for the plot. They come to see what kind of CGI a $190 million budget can buy. While many 3D films often forget they have the third dimension until it comes time for the slasher’s knife to lunge out of the screen, depth in the film is delivered with such consistent immersion that the IMAX ticket is actually worth the extra bucks. With probably every shot digitally remastered in some way, the visual effects supervisors deserve more credit here than the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, an indie filmmaker with only one other feature under his belt. “Kong” is a beast of a film and clearly the work of a large tribe of technical, stunt, art direction and VFX personnel who contribute the bulk of what makes the film worth watching.
The direction itself seems to have come down with a bad case of “influence-za.”  Jackson parrots his classic line “hold onto your butts” from “Jurassic Park,” and the music is a hyperactive playlist of all the songs from every Vietnam movie.  Vogt-Roberts and his writing team are clearly enamored with themselves as the inheritors of the Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” (even the poster is a remake!), but somehow that narrative of ’70s psychedelic nihilism just doesn’t have the same bite when giant animals are duking it out in broad daylight. Ironically, it is the not the classic cinema that the “Kong” borrows from well, but the technical wizardry of a trove of fantasy, sci-fi, first person shooter, and horror video games.
That being said, the historical-fantasy elements which have fueled such popular games as the Bioshock and Wolfenstein series result in some of the film’s worst moments.  When the expedition’s photographer (Academy Award winner Brie Larson), who spent the last several years covering the war, comes upon the grave of Kong’s parents, she remarks that she has photographed enough mass graves to know them by sight. It’s a line in poor enough taste to stop the film in its tracks. Did they actually just compare the mass graves of Vietnam, a likely reference to the My Lai Massacre, to the deaths of giant fictional monkeys at the claws of subterranean lizards? It’s only a moment, but someone—an editor, a producer, the director—should have known to cut it.
Beyond that poison pill, the entirety of the film’s charm rests firmly on the shoulders of John C. Reilly’s WWII pilot who crash landed on Skull Island while he was fighting in the Pacific theater. A legendary supporting actor, Reilly’s stir-crazy performance gives the film the hint of comic insanity it desperately needed. Between cracking jokes about Wrigley Field and nobly handling a katana, Reilly’s presence is enough to propel the plot until the next big fight. It may be a two-star film with five-star VFX, but a little levity goes a long way to helping the viewer overlook the former. Even better, let’s just wait for the video game.

Once an animal has tasted human flesh, there is no way to guarantee that it will not start craving it: The only possible solution is to put the animal down. At least that is what Justine’s father tells the 16-year-old girl in the French-Belgian horror film “Raw,” directed by Julia Ducournau. A tale of unstoppable desire, “Raw” compares female sexual awakening to the protagonist’s gruesome discovery of  cannibalistic instinct. Be warned: It is not suited for those with a weak stomach.
Justine (Garance Marillier), a stellar student, belongs to a family of vegetarian veterinarians. She has only just started her freshman year at a prestigious veterinary school when she is subjected to a hazing ritual and forced to eat raw rabbit kidney. Her older sister, an upperclassman with whom Justine has a complicated relationship, does not protect her. This experience awakens her hunger for meat—she goes from burger patties to raw chicken to, ultimately, human flesh.
Justine’s transformation from an innocent girl to a bloodthirsty woman is accompanied by a change in her body or, more precisely, by bodily decay: She gets a rash and sheds her skin, she starts to nervously chew on and swallow her own hair, and she suffers from several bite wounds. The film cleverly uses cannibalism as a metaphor for Justine’s sexual awakening: In her mind, lust and bloodlust become irrevocably conflated. It is no surprise, then, when she starts biting her first lovers.
In an impressive feat of subtlety, Ducournau manages to relate sex and cannibalism not only for her protagonist, but also for the viewer. In one scene, the camera takes on Justine’s perspective and lingers continuously on the upper body of her male roommate, who is playing soccer shirtless. Seeing that she is already caught in her downwards spiral towards cannibalism, it seems to the viewer that she is yearning to devour his body—but in which way? After all, the roommate’s athletic physique might produce feelings of sexual desire as much as cannibalistic instinct.
“Raw” presents both disturbing and everyday images in crisp, colorful shots: Blood is dark red, trees are lush green, and even the grey of the university’s concrete walls is visually intriguing. In fact, the overly saturated colors resemble the kind of photos young people post on social media, which fit a coming-of-age film in the 21st century and could be an intentional visual reference to the peer pressure Justine experiences at university. At the same time, the film also manages to beautifully capture the soft, natural lighting produced by grey and overcast skies—along with their depressing atmosphere.
The film’s soundtrack is less notable, but it also has its moments. For instance, the scene where Justine really gets hooked on human flesh is accompanied by a jarring non-diegetic sound effect. Without being told explicitly, the viewer notices immediately that Justine has just undergone a transformation. Of course, Marillier’s extremely convincing portrayal of the adolescent, insecure character plays a part in this, too.
It must also be noted, however, that “Raw” sometimes is shocking only for shock’s sake, as when Justine’s older sister teaches her to urinate while standing up. These scenes seem rather shallow once the viewer has overcome his or her disgust, because they do not add substantially to the plot.
All in all, however, Ducournau has succeeded in creating one of the most twisted coming-of-age stories that has ever been put to screen. Her horror is gross, disturbing, and nausea-inducing—it is guaranteed to make the viewer squirm in the seat and exhale anticipatory, incredulous “urghs” and “arghs.” “Raw” resembles a train wreck, in the best way possible: The viewer often knows what is about to happen, yet cannot take his or her eyes off the screen.

With the Allston campus slated to open in 2020, Northwest Labs will no longer be the epitome of “far.” In order to accommodate the new trek across the river, Harvard must modernize its scheduling practices. After all, they date back to 1891, making them anachronistic even by Harvard's standards.
On March 7, faculty debated a motion that would realign start times for classes on the Allston and Cambridge campuses, staggering them to give students adequate time for the longer commute. While we commend the faculty for updating old scheduling practices to fit the new difficulties students may face in reaching class, we hope they will take into consideration how the expanded class day and cookie-cutter class lengths will impact the student body.
Currently, most classes cluster between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.―a time slot that is convenient for both student athletes, whose practices generally begin at 2:30 p.m., and professors, who often have to commute through morning traffic. In order to spread out class times, the new schedule would expand the class day to 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. Though this shift will hopefully decrease the number of scheduling conflicts students will face, it may also make the commute for professors more difficult and interfere with the schedule of student athletes.
Student athletes must juggle two demanding schedules, often resulting either in giving up first-choice classes or missing out on practice to fulfill concentration requirements. Under the current system, student athletes are already pressed to find ways to take the classes they want or need, especially seminars, tutorials, and labs, which all run over the one and a half hour limit that is placed on classes beginning before 1 p.m. on Monday through Thursday. The new scheduling practice would exacerbate the problem by expanding the rigid class day. We hope that the University will work closely with the Athletic Department to clear away as many schedule conflicts as possible and ensure that student athletes are not disadvantaged academically by the proposed schedule.
Another solution that we hope the University will consider is to create separate schedules for Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Tuesday, Thursday patterns. Since many classes do need to run beyond the allotted 75 minutes, it would be more practical to build longer classes into the system by setting Tuesday and Thursday on longer time slots. This would allow more classes to be offered within the standardized class day, giving all students, especially student athletes, the chance to do more outside of class.
In creating new scheduling practices, the University must take into account the needs of all members of the student body. This measure is a chance for Harvard to correct many of the inconveniences of its outdated scheduling system while also embracing the new Allston campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask anyone who the most important philosopher of the past 500 years is, and nine times out of 10 they’ll respond with Immanuel Kant, the 18th-century German philosopher credited as the father of modern metaphysics and ethics. He dabbled in anthropology too. In one of his lesser-known papers, he concludes matter-of-factly that “humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race of the whites. The yellow Indians do have a meagre talent. The Negroes are far below them”. Multiple courses in and outside of the Harvard philosophy department engage directly with Kant’s writings. Few mention that he was a racist.
I recently took a course of classical and medieval political thought. One of the authors we studied was St. Thomas Aquinas, a giant of the Catholic Church. While reading through his masterpiece “On Law, Morality, and Politics”, we touched on a passage that explained how homosexuality was abhorrent to God’s eternal law. After examining how the passage revealed the importance of nature to medieval political thought, we moved on. The foundation of centuries of violent homophobia was no more than an interesting case study.
The past couple of years have brought a steady spurt of change on Harvard’s campus. “House master” became “faculty dean”, a pretty plaque was placed on Wadsworth House to commemorate four slaves, there were administrative shake-ups to increase support for marginalized student populations. But everyone is loathe to touch that which most roots us to our exclusionary past: the curriculum.
We’re still teaching misogynists, white supremacists, homophobes, and Nazi sympathisers without a word of protest. We sit students down and feed them “the greats” without telling them that “the greats” believed in radical antiblackness or wrote little black notebooks that blamed the corruption of the world on the Jews. This isn’t American elementary school. We don’t need to be force-fed pastoral portraits of the founding fathers that ignore the slaves whose backs they sit on. We need to know the truth. This isn’t a call for censorship—I’m the first to admit that Martin Heidegger was a revolutionary genius. But, like any genius, he’s flawed. And we deserve to receive the whole story, so that we ourselves can make a truly mature judgement on his worth.
This is important not just because we as an institution are inadvertently promoting oppressive traditions of academia and damaging our reputation to boot. It’s important because we’re forcing students like me, black students and queer students and women and non-Western students, to participate in these traditions without telling them the truth.
Eventually, it seems useless to complain. Every time I challenge a text, there’ll just be another white supremacist writer I’ll be ordered to analyze for rhetorical strategies. It’s so ingrained in Harvard’s culture: the princely halls of Widener hold centuries of hate and intellectualized oppression, and we’re sent in every day to pick out our bibliography.
This shouldn’t be surprising. Controversial conversations are controversial for a reason—everyone has an opinion, and different people's opinions usually radically different. If you’re reading a Western writer, for example, you can bet that they had an opinion on race. But you won’t hear it in the classroom. For example, while studying Samuel Beckett—the lauded 20th-century Irish avant-gardist—in your playwriting course, you probably won’t hear how he almost shut down JoAnne Akalaitis’ production of "Endgame" after she cast a black actor. This institution has stunning selective blindness, and it chooses to ignore the things that challenge its core—its tradition.
Harvard likes to tout its origin as a place of education for “native boys”. But let’s remember the chilling implications of this claim. Let’s remember the black and brown bodies ripped from their homes to be absorbed into a dominant colonial culture. Let’s remember the extinction of Native cultures and tongues. Let’s remember the belief that by binding them to an exclusionary power by means of selective education, these powers sought to retain control of the land and peoples.
And this circles us back to the main point: what it means for marginalized students to be hoodwinked into blindly accepting a perverse curriculum. We are those native boys, chained to a cultural power built to exclude us. I do not want to be lied to. I do not want to build idols that secretly plot my dehumanization. I do not want to be ignorant. I want to know what I’m really learning.
Again, this isn’t a plea to end all contact with the past. I want to continue learning from these people. They’re respected for a reason. But I want to know who and what they really are. I want to move beyond a naive, one-dimensional understanding of the academic tradition, and of the culture it represents. Tell us who these people really were, what they really did, what they really believed. I don’t want to be hoodwinked anymore. We—the students who come from traditions, communities, and cultures that have been scorned and attacked by too many of these great masters—deserve better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Kremlin on the Charles” was Richard Nixon’s famous epithet for Harvard. It will start to apply with discomfiting accuracy if Dean Khurana does not reconsider his sanctions on single-gender social organizations.
I am not talking about the inscrutable bureaucratic morass that has sprung up since the sanctions were first announced. I am not even talking about the cross-purposed surprise committees that have perplexed even the bureaucrats themselves. I refer instead to the intensely totalitarian consequences that will result from the implementation of the sanctions.
Let’s look at the final clubs, the primary targets. The sanctions would bar any member of a single-gender final club from receiving endorsement  for several important fellowships, athletic team captaincies, and leadership positions in all student groups recognized by the University. (This is not including the even stricter revisions proposed by somebody who, among other things, obviously could not be bothered to notice that The Crimson is entirely separate from the University and can choose whatever leadership it wants.) They are very tidy on paper, but how would they be enforced? Only by means of Soviet-style spy rings.
The policy could be brought to bear quite easily if only members of final clubs were all tattooed on their foreheads, but in reality, clubs do not publish membership lists. The University therefore does not have a roster of people whom it can confidently disbar from leadership positions. This presents a rather large problem, for Dean Khurana cannot disenfranchise these people if he doesn’t know who they are, and if the clubs won’t tell him, he’ll have to find out for himself.
Now, he could disguise himself, enroll at the College, infiltrate the clubs and expose the members in a thrilling undercover operation, and then perhaps he could interview El Chapo. This is the less ridiculous of two options. The more ridiculous is for him to rely on hearsay, gossip and anonymous phone tips to persecute the final club members. Roommates will be informing on roommates: “I saw Harry go out wearing a tie last Saturday—he must be in a final club!” It is impossible that Rakesh “Community” Khurana will be able to stomach looking like Stalin terrorizing Ukrainian farmers. The sanctions will then have to go. There is no other way.
How could a university so obstreperously devoted to justice and inclusion be willing to enact such an opaque and unjust policy? At the moment, the administration’s strategy is simply to hope that the clubs cave before it actually has to make good on its threats, but they won’t all cave, and the sanctions will be exposed as illiberal nonsense.
On the other hand, we must remember that final club members are hardly choir boys. As a conservative, I immediately leap to the defense of anyone who draws the ire of the left, but it is important that I check exactly what it is I am defending. While I strongly oppose the sanctions, I also oppose the alcohol-filled parties that abound in many of the clubs. These organizations are supposed to be places for members to play cards, sip cocktails, and chat―not places for members to throw dangerous bacchanals. As it is now, final clubs have both liquor and somewhere to drink it, and that is what gives them their public influence.
Many students have bemoaned the lack of social spaces that gives the final clubs their inordinate power; these people would spend their time better lobbying the state of Massachusetts to lower the drinking age to 18, which would substantially undermine the clubs’ hold on the social scene and return them to what they once were.
The drinking age is the root of this problem, and lowering it is the surest way to forestall further harm from predatory final club parties. In the meantime, the University ought to stop its grandstanding and acknowledge that the path it has chosen leads straight to the Star Chamber.

A team of researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital—a Harvard teaching hospital—and the Harvard School of Public Health found lower rates of depression among undocumented immigrants eligible for the federal administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.
Since the introduction of the policy in 2012, over 850,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children have received renewable, temporary work permits under DACA. Last November, President Drew G. Faust signed a letter urging for the expansion of DACA, stating that undocumented students “represent what is best about America” and “are essential to the future.”
Examining the annual U.S. National Health Interview Survey data from more than 14,000 non-citizen Hispanic adults from 2008 to 2015, researchers identified DACA-eligible individuals and compared changes in self-reported depression symptoms before and after the 2012 implementation of DACA. The study showed that DACA-eligible persons were 50 percent less likely to report symptoms of major depression than those who were ineligible for DACA. The study did not find any significant association between self-reported health and DACA eligibility.
While an executive order has been drafted to repeal DACA, President Trump has yet to sign the order and said that DACA was a “very difficult subject” in February.
Senior author and Mass General psychiatrist Alexander C. Tsai ’98 described the current status of DACA as an “open question” and said that President Trump could do something “erratic” or “unexpected.”
Tsai said that most of the current arguments against repealing DACA has focused on an economic or human rights framework. The group’s study takes a different tack, focusing on a medical framework, which Tsai referred to as “one more reason not to get rid of [DACA].”
“Our study provides for the first time medical evidence to support an argument made from the perspective of health and well-being,” Tsai said. “We found large declines in people meeting criteria from moderate to severe depression.”
Tsai said that if the data from this study were extrapolated, researchers would expect DACA to have prevented about 60,000 cases of moderate to severe depression.
“It stands to reason that if you eliminate DACA, you can see a very large mental health crisis in the US,” said Tsai.
Jin Park ’18, a student currently protected by DACA, said that the study was “long overdue” and that he’d expect similar findings in the future. In 2016, Park wrote an opinion editorial published in The Crimson about his experiencing growing up undocumented.
“I hope that studies like these will continue to be published, that investigators continue to ask these types of questions,” said Park. “What are the public health implications of policy on immigrants and their communities?”
Park said that his undocumented immigrant parents are currently unprotected by DACA or other policies and that the federal government’s policies have generated “a lot of fear and uncertainty.” Park said his family avoids seeking medical treatment for the fear of deportation.
“In my opinion, health shouldn’t be political," Park said. “I hope that this conversation about health isn’t politicized, because immigrant communities would suffer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A University spokesperson harshly condemned President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget—which guts federal funding for the arts, humanities, and sciences—as “devastating” and “unprecedented” Monday.
Released last Thursday, Trump’s proposed budget eliminates all funding to the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, and cuts budgets of the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency by roughly 20 percent and 31 percent respectively. Many professors and researchers rely on the NEA, NEH, EPA and NIH for research and sabbatical funding.

“The overall picture painted by the budget represents a significant retreat from the longstanding partnership between the federal government and research universities that has enhanced the U.S. economy, improved public health, and helped alleviate suffering,” University spokesperson David J. Cameron wrote in an emailed statement.
Since Trump’s election in November, administrators and academics alike have expressed fear that funding for federal programs critical to University research agendas will decrease. According to data from the Office for Sponsored Programs, the NIH is the single largest source of government research grants for Harvard, providing $415 million—or 69.9 percent of Harvard’s total public funding—in fiscal year 2016.
“The magnitude of the proposed cuts, which include unprecedented reductions to the National Institutes of Health of 18%, threaten progress in science, research and education,” Cameron wrote.
Arts and humanities professors, many of whom depend on the NEH and NEA for funding, say they are particularly worried the future should Trump’s budget pass.
“There already aren’t enough funding bodies to fund everybody. It’s incredibly competitive,” Music Department Chair Suzannah Clark said. “If you shut down the public fund, it’s like taking your jugular out. You can’t survive.”
English Department chair James Simpson said English professors will be meeting on Tuesday to discuss the proposed budget.
“Because [NEA and NEH] funding is such a tiny fraction of the overall U.S. budget, it is hard not to see this action as a deliberate attempt to silence and eradicate key academic and artistic voices from American civic life, undermining the primacy of the arts, culture, and education within our democracy,” History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies Professor Suzanne P. Blier wrote in an emailed statement.
With the University’s research agenda under threat, top Harvard administrators haven’t been standing by. Since Trump’s election, University President Drew G. Faust has been ramping up her efforts in the political arena, meeting with members of Congress to rally support for University priorities including federal research funding.
At the February and March Faculty meetings, Faust told attendees that she had travelled to Washington D.C. to speak with top Congressional leaders including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“We are heartened by the bipartisan expressions of support from Capitol Hill for many of the programs that are slated for cuts or elimination by the Administration’s plan, and we look forward to working with members of both parties as the budget process unfolds,” Cameron wrote.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith—who is also a professor in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—said in an interview earlier this month that the University was inviting lawmakers to tour Harvard’s campus in an effort to bolster support for federal funding.
“The funding that comes in for sciences is not on the edge of making a difference here, it is foundational to the leadership of this country in the area of science and technology and we want to make sure that those who are working on budgetary issues at the national and even local levels understand that,” Smith said.
Faust, a historian by trade, penned an op-ed in the New York Times outlining her case for continuing to fund the NEH, which she wrote “nurtures our national soul.”
Even if Trump’s proposed budget does not come to fruition, Clark said, the mere consideration of eliminating the NEA and NEH is cause for concern.
“It’s already damaging to be considering cutting it,” Clark said. “It signals to America and to the world that you don’t really care about things that are intellectual.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


After months of uncertainty, Harvard Square's landmark newsstand Crimson Corner will remain in the Square.
Chris Kotelly, the store's owner, will move his newsstand on April 10 to 35 Brattle St. at Brattle Plaza, just down the block from his current spot at the intersection of Brattle St., JFK St., and Massachusetts Ave. Kotelly signed a new four-year lease with the same property owner as his current location.
Kotelly said he plans to close his current location on April 9 and open at Brattle Plaza on April 10.
In December, Kotelly’s property owner notified him that his lease would not be renewed, and the Washington, D.C. pizza chain &pizza has been planning to move in. The 54-year-old family business—of which Kotelly is the third-generation owner—originally faced bleak prospects.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she repeatedly encouraged Kotelly, a longtime member of the Association, to find a new spot in the Square.
“I’m sure we were one of many people urging him to try to negotiate something with his property owner because we knew...that there were other spaces that they owned and some of them were vacant,” Jillson said. “The community really has an affinity for [Kotelly] in the way that he manages Crimson Corner.”
Kotelly said his lawyer had been negotiating with the building managers in an effort to keep the same spot. After that initial hope was unsuccessful, they negotiated to move to a property down the street.
Both Jillson and Kotelly said that though the move will prove a disruption, they remain hopeful about the store’s prospects.
“I assume that there is somewhat less visibility and foot traffic down there but I think there’s still enough opportunity to be successful there,” Kotelly said. “So, I think it’s going to be kind of challenging, but exciting at the same time.”
“It’s not an ideal location, but the fact that he can stay in the Square—and I think it’s a good location—is important,” Jillson said.
Kotelly said Crimson Corner is looking to publicize the move in order to attract new customers and also keep the regulars.
“We’re going to print up some flyers so we can hand out to people and try to do a little advertising, you know, put up some signs,” Kotelly said. “I think, hopefully, this opens up a new opportunity to new customers too, so we’re excited.”
Jillson said she thinks Cambridge residents will be glad that Crimson Corner will remain in Harvard Square.
“We’re really pleased that he’s staying, and we hope that people will go and buy newspapers, particularly those who were lamenting the loss,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A National Labor Relations Board hearing that could determine the fate of Harvard’s student unionization election ended Friday, though the body may not make a final decision on the case until next month.
While the weeks-long hearing has ended, both the University and unionization effort have until April 3 to submit post-hearing briefs to the NLRB. The NLRB will issue a decision on the issues at play in the hearing—including objections filed by both parties and whether or not to count 313 challenged ballots—sometime after it has received the briefs.  The body could ultimately call for a re-vote.
The end of the hearings marks the close of the latest chapter in a unionization effort at Harvard that came to a head in November 2016, when both graduate and undergraduate academic workers voted on whether to collectively bargain in contract negotiations.  The results of that election remain inconclusive after an initial vote count  in December showed that more students had voted against unionization than for it, though the margin of victory remains smaller than the number of challenged ballots.
During the hearings, Harvard officials contended that the NLRB should not include the challenged ballots in the official tally, while attorneys for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers have argued that the challenged ballots should be counted.
Beyond deciding which of those challenged ballots to count, the NLRB is also weighing objections both parties have filed to the the conduct of election.  In its objection, the unionization effort argues that the University failed to provide an accurate list of eligible voters and has called for a a re-vote. For its part, the University asserted that an NLRB official incorrectly invalidated a ballot against unionization.
Union organizer and English graduate student Andrew Donnelly wrote in an email that HGSU-UAW hopes that the NLRB will agree with the union’s objections.
“We are eager for an official ruling from the Hearing Officer and anticipate that he will set this election aside and call for a new one,” Donnelly wrote. “We expect a complete and accurate list from Harvard so we can continue talking to our colleagues about the demonstrated benefits of having a union for us as student workers.”
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an email that the University anticipates a favorable decision.
“Throughout the hearing, the University worked to demonstrate the good faith effort we have made in this process to ensure all eligible students voted and those votes were counted,” Hall wrote, “A majority of the votes counted were against unionization and we believe this hearing should confirm that outcome.”
The initial December 2016 tally, which does not include the 313 challenged ballots, showed that 1,456 of the tallied ballots opposed unionization, while 1,272 supported it.

For the second time in just over a year, Currier House Faculty Deans will have a new title.
Following a gift from former Currier House resident X. D. Yang ’87 and his wife Nancy Yang, the position—currently held by Latanya Sweeney and Sylvia Barrett—will now be known as the X. D. and Nancy Yang Faculty Deanship of Currier House.
In 2016, each of Harvard’s 24 Faculty Deans, including both from Currier House, voted unanimously to change their title from “House master” to “Faculty Dean” amid concerns from students that the term “master” evoked slavery.
Following the announcement of the new title, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that the name change gave donors “a fantastic opportunity” to endow the position. At the time, he said that selling the naming rights for Faculty Deanships could provide much-needed funding for House renewal.
In an email to Faculty Deans announcing the donation on Feb. 22, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote that the gift will go to “three essential areas of residential life at Harvard College: House Renewal; student programming in all Houses; and faculty dean leadership at Currier House.”
“The Yangs were inspired to make this gift by X. D.’s fond memory of his time as an undergraduate in Currier, which he has described as an indispensable part of his education,” Smith wrote.
Announcing the news to Currier residents over the House email list, Sweeney and Barrett asked students to “submit many more proposals for social activities through HoCo.”
The Yangs “want their gift to create memorable moments for you, the current students of Currier, and for the generations that follow you,” they wrote.
Harvard’s practice of granting naming rights in return for donations is relatively new.
In September 2014, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences deanship was renamed following a donation from Paul B. Edgerley and Sandra M. Edgerley ’84, marking the first time Harvard named a deanship. This came just two weeks after another first for Harvard: changing the name of one of its schools because of a donation. The University officially renamed the School of Public Health, retitling it the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health after real estate mogul Gerald L. Chan gave $350 million to the school.
Months later, in May 2015, the naming rights for the Harvard College deanship were sold to alumni Ami K. Danoff ’84 and William A. Danoff ’82 for an undisclosed sum.
In June 2015, a record $400 million donation from hedge fund tycoon John A. Paulson permanently endowed Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and renamed it the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Cantabrigians came out to protest a short-term rental zoning petition and called for the City Council to take steps to continue to increase the availability of housing in Cambridge at the body's weekly meeting Monday.
The zoning petition would allow for residential buildings in which the owner does not live to be used for short-term rentals 180 days a year. Previously, the Council had discussed prohibiting this type of rental, only allowing partially occupied properties to be rented out.
Some city residents criticized the petition for what they called its counterproductive impact on Cambridge’s tight housing market as a result of properties lying unoccupied while they aren’t being rented.
The Council also voted to allow the installation of illuminated bus shelters with advertisements in residential areas despite criticisms from Cantabrigians. The issue came to light following a proposal to install one of the new shelters on Aberdeen Ave. in the Strawberry Hill neighborhood, an area which is almost entirely residential.
Bus shelter company JCDecaux and the City Council have agreed to install the Strawberry Hill bus shelter under the condition that the company complete necessary regular maintenance.
However, some councillors were skeptical of the agreement, citing improper maintenance on other bus stations operated by JCDecaux.
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale defended the company and spoke about their willingness to compromise.
“They have been willing to work with us” DePasquale said. “We did not want to change the format that we believe is working.”
The Council also discussed updates to smoking restriction in workplaces around the city as a response to the 10-alarm fire last December, which authorities said was likely caused smoking at a construction site. The new health and safety code would expand the definition of “workplaces.”
Councillors also discussed better publicizing the language immersion programs in schools and new youth baseball facilities.

A lawsuit that challenges Harvard’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX will proceed after a federal court ruled Friday to deny the University’s efforts to dismiss the suit.
The Mass. district court decision is the latest development in a suit Alyssa R. Leader ’15 filed in February 2016 arguing that Harvard responded with “deliberate indifference” to her sexual assault complaint. Harvard challenged Leader’s case in a series of filings this summer, and the court has now struck down three of Harvard’s four primary arguments.
The suit centers on a sexual assault complaint that Leader filed while a student at the College. According to court documents, Leader initially filed a sexual harassment complaint in 2015, alleging that a male undergraduate, “John Doe 1,” sexually abused her during and after a dating relationship. In her lawsuit, she argues that the University did not properly respond to the complaint and violated Title IX.
In its legal filings, Harvard responded by arguing that the University did not respond to the allegations with “deliberate indifference” as Leader’s suit claimed, and in fact took the requisite steps to investigate her complaint. The University moved to throw out Leader’s arguments.
But the court denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the Title IX claim after considering the months of continued harassment Leader allegedly endured when she first reported Doe’s sexual harassment to Harvard officials.
While the court grants that Harvard may have “met its initial Title IX obligation to respond to Leader’s complaints of sexual harassment,” the ruling concludes that “Leader has sufficiently alleged that Harvard’s subsequent actions failed to stop the post-reporting harassment.”
The court also struck down Harvard’s motion to dismiss a negligence claim, arguing that Leader demonstrated that she suffered injury from Doe’s continued presence in Cabot House, where they both lived. Still, the court did not rule on whether or not Harvard was negligent in the process.
“Whether Harvard’s response was negligent is not for the Court to decide at this stage, but for a factfinder to decide upon a fully developed record,” the ruling stated.
Harvard filed over the summer for several paragraphs from the suit to be struck from the record. But the court ruled that these segments, which point to a 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter and a 2014 Frequently Asked Questions document published by the federal government, provide relevant context.
But the ruling did uphold one of Harvard’s legal arguments. The court ruled in favor of dismissing Leader’s claim against the University for premises liability, which would mean that unsafe conditions on Harvard’s grounds led to harm, or increase the probability of harm.
Harvard’s compliance with Title IX has been under scrutiny before. In 2014, the United States Department of Education found the Law School in violation of Title IX, and the College’s compliance with Title IX is currently under investigation by the federal government.

Entering spring break, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team found itself riding a four-game win streak to begin the season. On consecutive Saturdays, the Crimson suffered setbacks against one of the nation’s top teams in Penn State and an Ivy League foe in Brown. Harvard dropped its league opener for the third consecutive season.
BROWN 13, HARVARD 8
Despite a second-half surge, the Crimson fell to Brown (2-3, 1-0 Ivy League) in Providence on Saturday afternoon. The loss marks Harvard’s second in a row after starting the season 4-0.
After the Crimson junior Peter Blynn drew first blood 2:34 into play, the Bears pounced, scoring three unanswered en route to a dominating first period of play. Harvard found itself in a 6-2 hole after the first quarter, and trailed 10-4 at the half.
“We came out flat and did not execute,” senior tri-captain Ryan Norton said. “Every game is a learning experience, and our past two games are no different.”
Harvard’s defense, led by Norton, responded well in the second half, holding Brown scoreless in the third quarter, ultimately allowing only three goals after the break.
Plagued by a season-high 26 turnovers, the Crimson’s offense struggled to find its rhythm all afternoon. Coming into Saturday, Harvard hadn’t tallied more than 16 turnovers in five previous games this season. The Crimson managed five goals after halftime, but its 15 second-half turnovers, including a dismal 10 in the third quarter, stymied any hopes of surmounting a comeback.
“We have a lot to work on going forward,” Norton said, “And we are eager to compete against another strong opponent [Boston University] on Tuesday.”
PENN STATE 15, HARVARD, 12
Penn State (8-0) handed Harvard (4-2, 0-1 Ivy) its first loss of the season, winning a hard-fought battle in the bubble by a score of 15-12. The Nittany Lions thwarted the Crimson’s bid for its first 5-0 start since 2000.
Another arctic day in Cambridge moved the game indoors for the second time this season.
“I thought our team gave a great effort,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said. “I thought we fought all game, and I was happy with the way we responded when we went down in the second half. So, in terms of our intangibles, I was proud.”
Harvard looked to regain the same second half mojo that helped the Crimson rally to beat Vermont a week prior, but it wasn’t meant to be. After junior attackman J.T. Palladino scored the opening goal of the half, an upset was brewing in the bubble. The return of Palladino from injury provided a critical added dose of offensive production. Penn State responded with four unanswered goals in the final 7:25 of the quarter, dashing Harvard’s hopes to stay unbeaten.
“It was good to get J.T. back in his first game of the season,” Wojcik said. “He really helped complement Morgan [Cheek], who has led our offense—scoring a hat trick and a couple of assists. We need more of that from other players, as well, but it’s good to have him back. I thought he helped us finish some plays.”
Harvard controlled just 8 of 31 faceoffs (25.8%) on Saturday afternoon, the lowest single game percentage in its last 11 games, dating back to last year’s April contest against Cornell. Through the Nittany Lions’ first eight games, their freshman faceoff specialist Gerard Arceri has won 68% at the X. Harvard has won 41.8% thus far. Last year, only four teams made the NCAA Tournament with a faceoff percentage below 50% (Towson at 48.1%, Yale at 49.2%, Notre Dame at 49.3%, and Albany at 49.5%).
Penn State’s ability to limit junior attackman Morgan Cheek proved to be a difference maker. The Nittany Lions held Cheek to just three points, atypical considering his season average of nearly six points per contest.
“We’ve just got to keep getting better,” Wojcik said. “Yesterday was a benchmark of where we are against what people consider a top-five team—we had our chances to win the game…We need to continue to get better in all areas. I don’t think we played great in any particular area, so we’re going to keep trying to get better at facing off, and our team offense and defense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sweeping its two midweek games against Bucknell and Massachusetts, the Harvard baseball team saw the southern hospitality wear off during its four-game weekend series against South Florida in Tampa. The Crimson dropped all four contests and was outscored 34-11 in the process. For the 10-game, 10-day roadtrip in three different Florida cities, Harvard finished 3-7.
USF third baseman David Villar gave Crimson pitching fits all weekend, going 7-for-11 over the three days with three home runs and 12 runs batted in. The four wins over Harvard (7-7) pushed South Florida’s winning streak to 18 and improved its overall record to 19-1.
“Capping off the spring break trip, we kind of knew South Florida was going to be the toughest test we’ve faced this year,” said senior first baseman/pitcher Matt Hink. “...These guys proved on Friday that if [you] put the ball in the wrong spot, they’d take advantage of it.”
SOUTH FLORIDA, 14, HARVARD, 2
A six-run third inning from the Bulls dashed Harvard’s hopes of ending its weekend in Tampa with a win. Sophomore Crimson starter Kevin Stone did not make it out of the third as USF exploded for the six runs on five hits. T
“Though we’re a bit shorthanded, I think that everyone is getting some really great experience from these trips,” Miller said. “Our bullpen is getting better and better as they get more experience and our rotation is also improving every weekend. It’s hard to say when each person is going to pitch, but I’m sure that everyone’s going to pitch very well for us down the stretch.”
hird baseman David Villar hit a grand slam to triple the lead for the hosts. Harvard got on the board in the fourth but was only able to salvage a single run from the threat. Freshman right-hander Hunter Bigge was knocked around in his two and a third innings of work, surrendering four runs and allowing the Bulls’ lead to grow to double digits.
Sophomore centerfielder Ben Skinner was one of the few bright spots for a Crimson offense that managed only five hits. The Moraga, Calif. native reached base three times, doubling twice and driving in a run.
SOUTH FLORIDA, 8, HARVARD, 6
The closest game of the weekend came in the second half of Saturday’s twinbill. Harvard took its first lead of the series in the game’s first inning as a single by the red-hot junior Matt Rothenberg scored classmate John Fallon. The knock was Rothenberg’s 13th hit of the season and his .433 average leads Crimson regulars.
The early advantage did not last long as the potent USF offense jumped all over Harvard starter Noah Zavolas. The junior lasted six innings but surrendered six runs.
“It was definitely a good challenge for us to go down South and play a team that’s been really hot, but at the same time, I think we did a pretty good job against them,” junior right-hander Ian Miller said. “We played them tightly, especially in the games on Saturday.”
The Crimson found itself trailing 3-1 after the first inning and down 4-3 a frame later. After Zavolas’ departure, the Bulls got two more runs off of freshman Grant Stone in the seventh.
Trailing 8-3, Harvard picked up two runs in the eighth and another in the ninth but it proved to be not enough. Junior outfielder Austin Black drove in two runs on his first career long ball, which came in the eighth. Senior shortstop Drew Reid collected two hits while freshman second baseman Quinn Hoffman collected his third and fourth RBIs of his college career.
SOUTH FLORIDA, 4, HARVARD, 1
Miller and USF redshirt freshman Shane McClanahan went toe-to-toe in the weekend’s only real pitching duel. Both arms went the distance in the seven inning showdown and conceded just six hits apiece.
“I think that was definitely the highlight pitching performance of the weekend, both statistically and just how [Ian] looked,” Hink said. “He looked in rhythm and he threw well for us. We would like the offense to put more run support on him but then, at the same time, they had a lefty who was throwing 91-94 consistently.”
A three-run home run by Villar in the sixth proved to be the difference in a game that sat at 1-0 in favor of the Bulls from the second inning on. Miller had four strikeouts while McClanahan registered 11, including three of freshman left fielder Jake Suddleson.
“It’s great for our pitchers to get that experience, especially for Ian to get to face a lineup like they have, which some would argue might be one of the best in the country right now,” Hink said. “For him to be able to do what he did is a big confidence booster for him and it shows good things for the Ivy League down the road.”
Fallon was the extent of the Crimson offense. The Houston native had three of Harvard’s six hits, including both of its extra-base knocks, and its only run scored.
SOUTH FLORIDA, 8. HARVARD, 2
USF jumped on Harvard sophomore starter Simon Rosenblum-Larson for five runs, with three coming in the the second and two more an inning later. Villar and designated hitter Luke Borders both hit two-run home runs to put the hosts up for good.
“That Friday night game we kind of shot ourself in the foot just as far as some mistakes in the field, we didn’t pitch as well as some other games we’ve played,” Hink said. “They were a team where they would hit pitching mistakes unlike maybe some of the other teams we had played this year where maybe you could get away with missing a pitch here or there.”
The Crimson got on the board in the fourth as sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl singled home classmate Patrick Robinson. Rosenblum-Larson settled down for the second half of his six innings pitched. He allowed just two hits and no runs in his final three innings of work, but his offense did not answer the bell. McColl drove in his second run of the game and his ninth of the season as his single in the eighth plated Skinner.
Right-hander Garrett Rupp was knocked around by the Bulls in the junior’s one and a third innings of work. Rupp retired four of the nine batters that he faced and conceded three runs, three hits, and two walks. The exclamation point came on a Chris Chatfield two-run bomb, the last of three on the afternoon.

Lecture classes are painful enough without the added struggle of dealing with annoying classmates who haven't quite learned the etiquette of taking a lecture class. That’s why we all prefer to watch recorded lectures from the safety of our beds (wait, did we mean Netflix?). For those of us who don’t get the luxury of online lectures, please keep your rudeness to a minimum. Here are some of the rudest things you can do in lecture:
Asking a “Question” By Making a Statement
We see you, section kid. We know you’re frustrated that you can’t be as loud and obnoxious in lecture, but please, please, don’t waste our time by speaking your mind and pretending that you have a “question.” Raising the tone of your voice at the end of your sentence does not make it a question. Suck up to the professor in office hours.
Asking a Question That the Prof Just Answered
If you’re not going to listen, we can’t stop you. But we can stop you from holding up the class by asking the professor to repeat what they just said. You will get a knowing groan from your classmates if your question was answered on the previous slide.
Bringing a Feast to Lecture 
We understand that it can be hard to make it to the dhall before 9 a.m. Ec1010b. But that doesn’t give you permission to eat a full course breakfast—we’re talking baked beans, bacon, and burnt toast all in one—while some of us are trying to listen. Best-case scenario, your food smells great and we are jealous and hungry. Worst-case scenario, you never quite learned how to chew quietly as a kid and you make the rest of your classmates want to reach across the table and smack the food out of your mouth.
Blocking the Rows By Sitting On the Aisle
We’ve all been in those lecture halls with rows narrower than long-haul airline economy seating. It’s awkward and impossible to climb over the kid on the end of the row just to get a seat. We end up sitting on the staircase, and that makes us sad. Be courteous, don’t just sit on the aisle, and if you do, stand up to let us pass without too much unwanted bodily contact.
Life is hard, lecture is harder, 9 a.m. lecture is hardest. We’re not in the mood in these moments of struggle, so if you do any of these things, expect us to tell you: Dude, that’s rude.
