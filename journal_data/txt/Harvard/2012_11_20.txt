After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two characters leave home and are forced to get along—the only snag is that one of them is an adult male Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. In “Life of Pi,” Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) is the unlucky son of an Indian zookeeper who decides to move his family from India to Canada, along with all of their animals. After a disaster at sea, Pi finds himself adrift in a tiny lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and the aforementioned tiger. Though the narrative for the director Ang Lee’s adaptation of Yann Martel’s novel “Life of Pi” is at times ponderous and overly sentimental, the journey of the lifeboat unfolds in a magical, minimalistic duet of sky and sea and is interspersed with enough gripping sequences of action to keep the film interesting.
“Life of Pi” is a romanticized interpretation of Martel’s novel with Lee adding long introspective sequences, dreamy interludes, and even a superfluous love interest. This “Pi” is less concerned with the concrete reality of being stranded at sea than the novel. The tangible details of the character’s narrative voice are largely abandoned, along with the majority of the accounts of Pi’s day-to-day struggle on the lifeboat. Lee focuses instead on Pi’s spiritual journey, dwelling on his thoughts—explored through extensive voice-over and monologue—rather than the work of his hands or the various strategies for survival essential to the novel’s appeal. Indeed, religion also plays a large part in Lee’s interpretation of Pi’s journey, though it is approached with lightheartedness, such as when Pi says, “Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.” Martel (Rafe Spall) is given a more significant role in the film; he changes from a passive recorder of events in the novel to an obvious on-screen character. Spall offers a peaceful and calm portrayal of the character that does not overshadow Pi’s story.
Sharma’s first major role gives us a Pi of genuine innocence and desolation—a wise piece of casting on Lee’s part, as Sharma’s lack of exposure lends another layer of believability to the performance. Sharma captures Pi’s developmental arc from callow mommy’s boy to seasoned mariner through all the attendant highs, lows, and flashes of humor. However, Sharma’s skill is most clearly seen in his interactions with Richard Parker. Grounded as the story is in this journey from hell, it is easy to see Pi’s growing attachment to the tiger, though it is only really through him that the viewer develops a sense of its personality.
Richard Parker is a shining example of CGI. The 3D effects used throughout are rarely extraneous or unnecessary; indeed, they have an elegant simplicity unusual in films that use them. The landscapes, seas, and storms are at their most stunning with a washed-out palette, although Lee is tempted at times into the exaggerated psychedelic gorgeousness reminiscent of  “Avatar,” with which the film has been compared on its posters. The animal life, however, is a different story. There is a bizarre mix of beautifully lifelike creatures and jarringly obviously computer-generated ones, including an eerily smooth elephant and weirdly stoned-looking orangutan. The tiger, strangely, becomes more and more realistically rendered as the story progresses, until there are times when it reaches photographic quality; the illusion of its personality is matched only by that of its apparent reality. It is difficult to tell whether this phenomenon is intentional or not given some other crudely-created CGI characters. In any case, the creature is so expressive—whether gazing serenely at the ocean or hurling itself, roaring, across the boat—that it matches Sharma in keeping interest.
Despite the aforementioned inconsistencies present in the CGI, “Life of Pi” generally succeeds as a canvas for glorious visual effects and sweeping adventure. However, its strongest aspect is its touching story enlivened by a lead performance that may herald the beginning of a promising career for Sharma. If not, it at least solidifies Lee’s already established filmography.

With her heart thumping and mind racing, Dellarobia Turnbow embarks on an ankle-bending climb to infidelity. She is trekking up a steep Tennessee mountain road for Jimmy, the young and attractive telephone man who makes her contemplate, though not actually follow through with, an affair. He could provide a “little flint of thrill,” Dellarobia reasons, one that might even “outweigh the pillowy, suffocating aftermath of a long disgrace.” Just as she is on the verge of leaving her shotgun marriage and two young children, a supposedly divine intervention halts her sexual rendezvous: as she crests the top of the road, she observes millions of orange monarch butterflies that appear to have set the many trees ablaze. Dellarobia interprets it as a message from God and scurries back down the mountain to her family, keeping her “lake of fire” as an intimate secret in head—though not for long.
In Barbara Kingsolver’s eighth novel “Flight Behavior,” the author returns to her Appalachian comfort zone with ease, honing in on the impoverished Turnbow family of farmers and the miraculous appearance of monarch butterflies in the steep hills of fictional Feathertown. As she does in so many of her other novels, Kingsolver masterfully commands her prose in an exploration of both specific personal relationships and large societal issues. Her description of Dellarobia’s quest to redefine herself in the face of a smoking addiction and apathetic husband rings personal and touching, while a larger discussion concerning climate change, rural poverty, and the everyday struggle between ignorance and awareness subtly increases understanding about pressing issues while still allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions.
The 27-year-old Dellarobia and her husband Cub frequently struggle to make payments on time with their meager income from the profits of Cub’s family farm. When Cub and his parents, Bear and Hester, discover the same glowing trees during a logging survey, the entire family becomes the center of attention in the town, region, and country. A group of scientists arrive to conduct research on the property and tourists flock to Feathertown for a quick glimpse of the miraculous sight. It soon becomes apparent that the arrival of the butterflies signifies a shrinking habitat due to climate change, and the Turnbow family must make a difficult decision: whether to cut down the trees in order to avoid late payment on equipment loans or to not disturb the shrinking habitat.
The concerned scientists begin a conversation about rising global temperatures and altered weather patterns, which threaten the migration patterns and population of the butterflies. In a tense discussion of the logging operation, Cub insists that “there’s always someplace else to go” for the butterflies, stressing that “worries like this are not for people like us.” Kingsolver beautifully illustrates their concerns—they must put food on the table, not save the environment. But when Dellarobia poignantly responds, “What if there isn’t?” Kingsolver’s mastery of dialogue shows that the situation is dire and the consequences reverberate further than a missed loan payment for a struggling farm. Every individual must be conscious of climate change, Kingsolver frequently says, because altered weather patterns and higher temperatures do not discriminate according to socioeconomic status or any other arbitrary marker. Throughout the course of the novel, the struggles and realizations of the characters effectively emphasizes Kingsolver’s assertion that there are no legitimate excuses to ignore climate change.
As the family struggles with the decision, Dellarobia battles her low self-confidence and timidity around others. She gains some self-confidence after the research team moves into her backyard and eventually evolves from believing “her every possession was either unbreakable, or broken” to throwing an impromptu holiday party in her house. Suddenly she doesn’t care “if someone ended up with the SpongeBob glass.” As she learns to hold her own, she also becomes more aware of the dangerous implications of the butterflies’ spontaneous arrival on her property. Dellarobia’s personal change spurs important questions about the ability of Feathertown’s residents—and by extension, the rest of the country—to change. Will people become less wary of the theory of global warming, and  more importantly, will they be spurred to action and change the way they interact with the land?
Though the discussion of global warming is certainly a meaningful aspect of the novel, Kingsolver’s strengths lie mostly in her narrations of everyday life, which range from intimate details of sheep shearing to serious talks about paying the mortgage. In one particular scene, Cub and Dellarobia attempt to shop for the children’s Christmas gifts amidst palpable tension. The two stroll through the aisles with $50 to spend, picking up potential items only to return them to the shelf after seeing the price tags. As they exchange passive-aggressive comments over name-brand versus generic coffee, the conversation quickly escalates into deeper jabs about personal intelligence and value systems. Kingsolver’s realistic prose allows the reader to become absorbed into the daily intricacies, patterns of speech, and deepest desires of the characters. While at times the characters’ manner of speaking can be clunky and forced, especially in the beginning of the novel, the dialogue ultimately becomes more natural and quickly immerses the reader into the rural poverty of Appalachia.
From “The Poisonwood Bible” to “The Lacuna,” Barbara Kingsolver has continually set the bar high with her work, and she does not disappoint with “Flight Behavior.” She has never failed to address larger issues alongside brilliant character development in her novels, which seamlessly connects the reader to her broader topics. Kingsolver’s exploration of the intimate and personal details of a character’s life provides an important pathway for the reader to walk away from the novel with a solid grasp of her wider message. In broaching a topic that many fiction writers have shied away from, Kingsolver does a wonderful job raising greater awareness for an important issue without overtly preaching or pushing her ideas onto her audience.

According to the Twilight Saga Wiki, “The only known way to kill a vampire is to dismember his or her body and burn the remains before it can reconstruct itself.” This was apparently ruled too complicated a procedure to pull off repeatedly on the silver screen, and so the death process has been simplified to mere decapitation in “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2.” Indeed, taking the easy way out seems to be the modus operandi of the final installment. Bloodless performances, a weak script, and a shady obsession with eternal relationships makes the film one that is at its best when it’s at its worst.
“Breaking Dawn — Part 1” concluded with the birth of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward’s (Robert Pattinson) half-human, half-vampire daughter Renesmée (Mackenzie Foy) and Bella’s transformation into a vampire. The sequel picks up precisely where its predecessor left off. In the film’s opening sequence, Bella awakens to a supercharged reality, her newly perceptive eyes flickering from individual grains of wood to shimmering droplets of water before settling on a strangely pore-free Edward.
The first half-hour is oddly devoid of conflict. Bella settles into life as an immortal and a parent. However, a threat soon emerges in the form of the Volturi—the ancient coven of vampires that enforces the laws of the blood-sucking community. These aren’t your typical bureaucrats as when the Volturi mete out justice, it is invariably in the form of a beheading. Believing Renesmée to be a forbidden “immortal child,” they plot to snuff out the entire Cullen coven.
It’s a sparse premise, but the saga’s first four films have never challenged its audience with a narrative that resists delineation in five sentences or less. Rather, as a 116-minute-long pat on the back, “Breaking Dawn — Part 2” doesn’t develop characters so much as work to assure the viewer that these are the humans, vampires, and werewolves they know and love. Scenes contain dialogue, of course, but serve primarily to trigger fans’ pleasure centers via familiar tableaus. Feast your eyes as Edward and Bella embrace, as Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and Bella come to blows, as various Cullen siblings pull off supernatural feats, and as red-eyed villains glower beneath hooded cloaks.
Solid acting can overcome a sub-par script in an adolescent-targeted movie—Antony Hopkins in “Thor,” for example. Sadly, “can” is the operative word in this film. Lautner, it seems, is truly an actor for whom actions will always speak louder than words—the only time he appears natural on screen is when engaged in the act of undressing. The dramatic abilities of Stewart and Pattinson are generally less panned due to well-received performances in “Into the Wild” and “Water for Elephants.” However, when Stewart derides Jacob with the potentially fiery line, “I’ve held [Renesmée] all of one time and already you think you have some moronic wolfy claim to her?”, she characteristically exhibits all of the enthusiasm of a McDonald’s employee working the Thanksgiving shift.
Thankfully, there is a faint silver lining: combine mechanical delivery with Melissa Rosenberg’s anemic screenplay, and the result is a veritable treasure trove of unintentionally hilarious moments. Of particular note are the sequences that bookend the requisite Bella/Edward sex scene. A tour of the bizarrely idyllic cottage the Cullens have built Bella and Edward as a wedding present concludes with the master bedroom. Bella: “Vampires don’t sleep.” Edward: “It’s not intended for sleep.” Two minutes later, the pair is seen cuddling before a roaring fireplace. “You really were holding back,” breathes Bella. The absolute seriousness these scenes attempt to convey is rendered farcical by Pattison’s and Stewart’s jarringly blasé attitudes.
Even still, the dialogue is occasionally funny on purpose. In order to prevent Bella and Edward from expatriating themselves, Jacob desperately reveals that he is a werewolf to Bella’s father Charlie (Billy Burke). Tossing aside his shirt, he declares, “You don’t live in the world you think you do.” This is a case where the audience laughs with instead of at Rosenberg, but scenes in this deliberately absurdist vein are too few and far between.
Infinitely more disturbing than a weak plot or sub-par acting is the central theme of “Breaking Dawn — Part 2.” Those at the helm of the Twilight Saga have apparently decided that the main attraction it has for its fans is its promise of “forever.” This is what is stressed in Edward and Bella’s relationship—not the depth of their passion, not their shared antipathy toward outward displays of emotion, but the soulless fact that they will be together until the end of time. For proof of this, look no further than the anthem of the film, “A Thousand Years” by Christina Perri. “I have loved you for a thousand years. I’ll love you for a thousand more,” Perri croons as Bella and Edward embrace in a field of eerily bright flowers. While other adolescent movies’ weak plots can be salvaged by a story of heroic triumph or upstanding morality, the emphasis on a pointless forever assures that the film remains shallow to its core.
Because of this disturbing trope, “Breaking Dawn — Part 2” cannot pass even as harmless amusement. While the eponymous book does not dwell solely on the concept of an eternal relationship, the movie’s fixation on this particular idea leeches the film of the romance that could have lent pre-pubescent slumber party appeal. Frankly, the only comfort to be gleaned from this film is that the Twilight Saga is something that will not indeed last forever.

“I believe in the Eagles, and I believe in my son,” proclaims Robert De Niro’s character, patriarch of the football-obsessed Solitano family. This working-class Philadelphia family may have a benevolent portrait of Jesus on the wall, but their religion is football and their god is their team. Yet for all the green jerseys, ritual game-day snacks and touchdown superstitions, “Silver Linings Playbook” is ultimately about sports in the way that “Titanic” was about a shipwreck. Football, running, and dancing are all vehicles to expose the discontent broiling behind endless rows of cookie-cutter houses. In David O. Russel’s “Playbook,” a blend of uniquely personal filmmaking and emotionally astute acting effectively lays bare all the hidden pains of an unassuming suburban landscape.
“Playbook” is a movie about people struggling to connect across vast divides. “I’m remaking myself,” the disheveled and frenzied Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) announces, his eyes gleaming with determined fervor. Pat is going to be the kind of man any woman would cherish: sensitive, athletic, intellectual, and ambitious. Granted, his wife cheated on him, he just got released from eight months in a psych lock-up, and he is moving back in with his parents. Yet Pat plows on resolutely.
While Pat may be the most obviously disturbed character, Russell spares no one from an inevitable struggle against his or her past or present life. There are Pat’s parents (De Niro and Jacki Weaver), equally bewildered by their son’s mental illness and walking on tenterhooks around their own financial woes; Pat’s successful best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz), submissive partner seething with resentment; and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a magnetic young widow and recovering sex addict, who under Lawrence’s unwavering intensity becomes the one person who can get Pat back on track.
Little unfolds as neatly as it might in a fluffy romantic comedy. Russell has shown in gritty triumphs like his 2010 “The Fighter” that no path to redemption is a straight one. As much as Pat wants to take control of his emotions, his bipolar disorder forces him to contend with everyday demons as well as those hidden deeper in his consciousness. He flips out at the pessimism in his wife’s high school English syllabus: “Can’t somebody say, ‘Let’s be positive, let’s have a good ending to the story?’” he implores maniacally, stalking around their house in the middle of the night after finishing “A Farewell to Arms.” In instances like these, his fresh-faced optimism and inevitable disappointment are played, appropriately, for laughs, yet his violent tantrum upon discovering his parents have hidden his wedding video is more frightening than humorous. Cooper shifts surprisingly well between these intense highs and quieter, repentant moments. As an actor best known for less cerebral action-comedy roles, Cooper shows an emotional breakthrough and can be seen as a different kind of rising star.
Luckily, Lawrence matches this intensity as few other actresses could. Tiffany becomes Pat’s rock, a sounding board for his inexplicable rages and blinding resentment. Yet she is a rock in the midst of an avalanche, and Lawrence perfectly conveys Tiffany’s emotional state of disdain, volatility, and self-awareness with winsome eye rolls and straight-shouldered stoicism. “I’m just the crazy slut with the dead husband,” she repeats in various iterations. “I’m Tommy’s crazy whore widow.” Tiffany is as temperamental as Pat, and it takes an astute director like Russell to emphasize the compatibility of their instability, shown through how they rescue each other from their own mistakes and dramatic public scenes.
In adapting Matthew Quick’s 2008 novel, Russell perfectly captures Pat’s agitated narrative and projects it onto his environment. The camera spins and circles around heated conversations as sentences tumble over each other, overlap, and merge. This technique lends an important representative quality; for a movie about characters that struggle to connect with others, the audience can understand them quite well. Russell tightens up and changes several aspects of Quick’s plot, and while these differences may be glaring to the book’s readers, they do not dampen the original spirit of the book.
“You’re afraid of life,” Tiffany angrily accuses Pat at one point. “You’re a hypocrite!” The same cannot be said of Russell or his actors. In this honest and soulful representation of mental illness and love in America, “Silver Linings Playbook” serves as a manual for a different kind of romantic comedy.

There’s a heartbreaking ache in Jerry’s voice when he says, “I don’t need to think of you anymore,” to his longtime lover, Emma, signifying the official end of their seven-year affair. However, this is one of the only believable moments in “Betrayal”—a show running at the Boston University Theatre through December 9. The production is plagued with bland, uneven performances, had it not been for the excellent direction by  Maria Aitken, the Huntington Theatre Company’s 80-minute revival of “Betrayal” would have been completely forgettable and boring.
Told in reverse chronology, “Betrayal” depicts a love affair between Jerry (Alan Cox) and Emma (Gretchen Egolf)—who is married to Jerry’s best friend Robert (Mark H. Dold). The play begins at the end of their relationship and travels back all the way to their first romantic encounter while slowly revealing important segments of the infidelity in nine scenes.
Although Nobel Prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter won an Olivier Award for “Betrayal,” an honest reflection on his own seven-year extramarital affair with Joan Bakewell, the narrative in this production is weighed down by scenes where the characters gossip like middle schoolers. However, the he-said-she-said games that are supposed to serve as comic relief ultimately come off as annoying because these scenes lack the necessary energy to bring them to life.
The play’s themes of deception and guilt are also never communicated fully to the audience due to the actors’ inability to fully explore their characters emotional states, . For example, in the scene where Jerry first professes his love for Emma, he begins to compliment her with drunken, slurred speech, delivered in a flat monotone that makes his words seem insincere. This scene demands raw human emotion, but Cox seems merely to recite his lines from memory rather than conveying his character’s lustful and alcohol-driven desire for his best friend’s wife. Cox finally delivers a successful line when he reacts to Emma’s confession with an incredulous “Sorry?” that combines all of his underlying impatience and frustration. In another scene, Egolf’s stiff performance stands out in negative  contrast to the way Dold quivers when speaking his lines. This uneven performance falls short of what the scene requires emotionally.
Some of the more redeeming characteristics of the production include the lighting design by Philip S. Rosenberg and the scenic design  by Allen Moyer.  The combination of a simple set with the complex human emotions on stage is a well-executed juxtaposition; the minimalist set pieces are necessary for the audience to understand the confusing reverse chronology of the play. At the beginning of each scene the blackboards open, and then they close at the end like a camera shutter taking a snapshot of each important moment of Jerry and Emma’s adulterous relationship. Additionally, a number—either a year or a phrase such as “one year earlier”—is projected on the boards before they open, elegantly giving each vignette a specific temporal context.
The lighting hues also add symbolism to the play: a comfortable orange shade accompanies the scenes between Jerry and Emma and a harsh white color accompanies the scenes that include Robert, the almost blinding light forcing the characters to step out of their blissful daze and confront their reality. As the spotlights travel away from the actors, only the outlines of their dark figures are left behind as the boards close at the end of every scene. This effect offers a poignant reflection on the deteriorating relationships of the play.
Overall, “Betrayal” only manages to succeed in certain moments when the actors honestly express their characters’ inner feelings. This show makes it clear that when a play dealing with human emotions and passions is carried by technical elements rather than the acting, the production needs to do some serious reevaluation.

“Do you remember summer ‘09?” reminisces One Direction’s unofficial frontman Harry Styles at the beginning of the song “Rock Me.” Three years may not seem like enough time to warrant nostalgia, but for both the young band and its massive international fanbase--which predominantly consists of 15 to 16 year old fangirls—it represents a pivotal and transformative time period of adolescence and maturity. On “Take Me Home,” One Direction effortlessly returns to the formula that made them incredibly successful on their smash hit debut record “Up All Night.” However, they also demonstrate their growth as a band through new lyrical themes and a heavier arena sound perfect for their sold-out world tour next summer. A continuation of “Up All Night,” which details the innocuous feelings of falling in love at first sight, “Take Me Home” is the not-so-subtle description of what happens after.
No longer woefully singing about holding hands and tween puppy love, the boys move past the innocence of “Up All Night” and instead get straight to the point. “If you don’t wanna take it slow / And you just wanna take me home / Baby say yeah, yeah, yeah / And let me kiss you,” they sing during the group chorus of “Kiss You,” the catchiest song on the album thanks to its infectious guitar hook. While parents may raise eyebrows at the boys crooning to millions of underage girls about wanting to “get some” in their lead single “Live While We’re Young,” lyrics like this give the album an edge and help to create the unifying theme of carpe diem. The naivety of “Take Me Home” has been blatantly disposed: in addition to the lusty lyrics, the voices are grittier and the guitars are heavier.
The boys also attempt to get more personal and sentimental, but are unable to quite pull it off. Co-written by all five members, “Back For You” expresses the heartache of a troubled relationship. However, the group has far more trouble with weightier themes, as seen in lackluster lyrics like “I’ve never been so into somebody before / And every time we touch I only want more / So tell me nothing’s going to change yeah / And you won’t ever walk away yeah.” The group also calls upon British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, known for his introspective lyrics, to write two songs on the album. However, both compositions are sappy rather than poignant, and the members mimic Sheeran’s vocal inflections instead of making the songs their own.
Although their ventures into creating mushy, alternative ballads weigh down “Take Me Home” as a whole, One Direction sticks to what it does best: making catchy pop singles. While singing about more mature topics to court older fans, the boy band maintains their signature bouncy pop-rock beats for their younger followers in their up-tempo songs. “Heart Attack” features a prominent, high-pitched “Ow!” that serves as the centerpiece of the addictive chorus. Its catchy harmonized melody, jangling guitar, and obvious cheesiness will likely appeal to the group’s young fanbase.
Although One Direction’s sophomore album won’t convert new listeners into “Directioners,” “Take Me Home” is just enough to satisfy all of the fainting, Tumblr-obsessed, and emotional teenage girls across the globe and thus achieve towering sales for the boy band once again. In the end, they’re just having fun and focusing on their fans, which is something that most artists often forget to do.

Blake Shelton recently won the Country Music Association’s Entertainer of the Year Award for 2012. Shelton is a judge on NBC’s “The Voice” and released a hit album in 2011 entitled “Red River Blue”. Shelton is praised for his take on traditional country music, but is his style original enough to merit an award?
Point by Kia C. Turner
Blake Shelton is the man. Shelton is everything you could ever want in a country singer, from the lovable cowboy on “The Voice” to the bad-boy in his classic rugged country song “Good Ol’ Boys.”  Shelton’s rural background, which is prevalent in all of his songs, is what gives him such a great fan base and why he was named Entertainer of the Year 2012.
Shelton brings country to a new level in songs like “Hillbilly Bone,” in which he gets that classic country guitar riff going  in a way that can inspire his listeners to put their cowboy boots on and take their trucks down to Alabama. The way he highlights being from a small town may help a lot of people feel proud of where they come from, even if it is considered “hillbilly.”
Shelton is probably most popular for his sweet and tender ballads like “God Gave Me You,”  “Over,” and “Who Are You When I’m Not Looking.”  These are the emotional songs that can really pull on the heartstrings of his fans. We fall into his trap when he uses his distinct Southern twang to serenade his country sweetheart. His lyrics are heart-melting and the perfect thing to sit down, kick back, and relax to.
Another reason that Shelton is a lovable artist is because his persona is not complete without his woman—Miranda.  The perfect country duo boosts Shelton’s image, and fans go crazy when they perform together.  With her, Shelton’s words come to life and make fans only want more of his distinctly country, distinctly American music.
Rebuttal by Camila Victoriano
Shelton hasn’t managed to bring country to a “new level,” especially with his ballads. Specifically, “Who Are You When I’m Not Looking” leaves a lot to be desired, with lyrics like “But I’ve not tasted all your cooking / Who are you when I’m not looking?” What  does her cooking have to do with her mysterious and attractive being? Also, the fact that Miranda plays such a big factor in who he is as an artist and how valuable he is to country music isn’t a good thing. An artist should stand alone, and Shelton—because of his reliance on his wife and overdone country techniques—most definitely does not
Counterpoint by Camila Victoriano
Blake Shelton is most definitely not the man. Following the typical country pattern of twang, hillbilly pride, and daddy’s girls, his songs fall into the generic, ’murica-loving music that we hear from most other country artists. In the song “Austin,” he sings, “If it’s Friday night I’m at the ballgame /And first thing Saturday, if it don’t rain / I’m headed out to the lake.” These lyrics have no meaning. All they are telling the audience is what he did on some weekend. The next thing he’ll say is “Yesterday was Thursday.” Shelton’s music follows such basic country music convention that in one of his songs he actually yells out “Yee-haw!” However, it is not too much of a mystery as to why Shelton managed to grab Entertainer of the Year. Shelton, compared to the other judges in the hit series “The Voice,” is obviously the most amiable character. Adam Levine is the bad boy, Cee-Lo Green plays the wild card and Christina Aguilera is the female powerhouse, leaving Shelton with the easy task of playing your generic country sweetheart. He is aided by the cuteness factor that his blonde, bombshell wife Miranda adds to the mix. As a country couple, they’re the equivalent of a white picket fence: the typical American ideal. It would be nearly impossible to find a man that exemplifies stereotypical country values more than Shelton does.
Shelton’s award is not due to how musically talented he is—voices and lyrics like his have been heard for decades already—but rather to how he has suddenly become America’s “poster-boy.” With his cowboy boots, acoustic guitar, twangy voice, and TV show, he’s got all that national audiences want. They only needed the award to make it official.
Rebuttal by Kia C. Turner
“Hillbilly” pride and daddy’s girls are uniquely American, and so is Shelton. Though his lyrics may seem petty to some, they really do show day-to-day life.  Most people’s lives aren’t filled with the glitz and the glam that rappers talk about, nor are they filled with the over-hyped angst that rockers sing about. Most people are going to ballgames and thinking about going to the lake if it doesn’t rain. It is this simplicity that makes Shelton so brilliant. Between his words, his marriage, and his commitment to country, Shelton can’t be beat.

As I set foot into The Burren at Davis Square, I realize that this hearty Irish pub atmosphere is exactly what I need to beat the Boston chill. During the day, soft-spoken elderly clients and Irish men and women gather at the bar, which proclaims on its website to possess a “rich old world feel.” Boston singer-songwriter Christian McNeill has chosen to meet me here, and when I mention his name to the bartender, he gives a smile of recognition. It’s clear that McNeill is a local fixture.
When I meet McNeill outside the pub and head with him to Q Division Studios near Davis Square, it is easy to see why. He is charismatic in person and passionate when talking music. “My first memories as a 2-year-old are of singing myself to sleep and just making up tunes in my head,” he says. McNeill grew up in Derry, Ireland and his father was a professional musician, so McNeill was immersed in music all the time. He was greatly influenced by fellow Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, whom he saw in concert as a 10-year-old. “I love older music,” McNeill says. “Nowadays there’s a culture of beards and plaid shirts and little haircuts, and they’re playing nice little songs, but there’s no real passion.”
McNeill’s band, Christian McNeill & Sea Monsters, is trying to combat this trend. The band had an acclaimed three year residency at the Somerville bar Precinct, and won a Boston Music Award in 2010 for “Best Live Ongoing Residency.” “I was sort of sick of myself. I didn’t want it just to be me singing, so I invited these guests; the band started off as a vehicle for me to collaborate with people,” McNeill says. Now, the group is a full outfit of McNeill and large rhythm and horn sections. He enjoys an organic interplay with his band, saying, “they’re amazing musicians. I never tell people what to play, as a rule; you have to trust their talent. I just want to inspire people to get off their asses and do something.”
The band’s new record, “Everything’s Up For Grabs,” is driven by an optimistic, bold sound. “There’s a lot of hope behind this record, so maybe it’s about rebirth,” McNeill says. “Zero”, the first track on the album, features a punchy, energetic peal of trumpets that brings an upbeat turn to the depressing line: “I was a zero / I was falling through the cracks of infinity and the void.” McNeill’s robust voice lends a real rock ’n’ roll strongman quality to the track.
However, McNeill is not one to shy away from the more melancholic side of music. “Southern Cross,” the last track, features ominous keyboard chords, grungy guitar textures and fierce, biting vocals with lyrics such as “It’s death to the singer / Death to the song.” The song was written by McNeill right after the death of one of his heroes, Johnny Cash, and reflects McNeill’s anguish.
The album’s two emotional sides show McNeil’s diverse life experiences. When talking about his Northern Irish upbringing at the time of political turmoil, McNeill becomes more somber. “It was terrible,” he says. “I saw what human beings were capable of doing to one another. I channeled that anger into music.” McNeill also talks about the shortcomings of the music business, citing in particular how websites like Spotify are ruining the lives of indie musicians struggling to eke out an existence. However, McNeill believes he’s now in a more positive place in his life. He seems to live and breathe in his music: “First thing in the morning, when I wake up, that’s when I write songs,” he says with a smile.
The musical textures of McNeill’s band reflects his contradictions and transformations. Bright, brassy sounds are balanced with gritty old school rock; this infectious, gutsy mix mirrors McNeill’s own life experiences. “I didn’t come here to become famous, but to be a better songwriter,” he says. “This is a country of great music with a history of great black music – [I wanted to] to embrace that history of jazz and soul.” This history, as well McNeill’s own, has indeed found its way into the new record and the band’s musical identity. In our conversation, I liken McNeill’s sound to a meaty blend of rock and soul, like an Irish stew that you could enjoy at The Burren. “I think that’s a really good way to describe it,” he says. “I struggled for years to describe my music until this record, but it’s so obviously rock, it’s so obviously soul.”

Irish writer Lucy Costigan’s new book, “Glenveagh Mystery: The Life, Work, & Disappearance of Arthur Kingsley Porter,” has all the elements of a gothic mystery novel: a multimillionaire Harvard professor, a castle on a desolate island, and a salacious family drama. But the book, released Saturday, is in fact a historical account researched for over 10 years by Costigan and the Arthur Kingsley Porter Project team, a group dedicated to unearthing the truth behind his disappearance.
Porter was an art history professor with considerable academic renown. In 1929, he moved with his wife to Glenveagh Castle on a secluded island in Donegal, Ireland. Four years later, Porter disappeared without a trace while walking around his property. Was it murder? Was it an accident? Did he commit suicide? Or did Porter obtain a secret passage to Europe, where he lived under an assumed name?
These questions intrigued Costigan and her friend Thomas Williams, now project manager, after they visited Glenveagh Castle with Costigan’s nephew Michael Cullen, now project photographer. Williams persuaded Costigan, who had recently published the non-fiction book “Strangest Genius: The Stained Glass of Harry Clarke” about an Irish stained-glass artist, to write a book about the Porter mystery. The research team travelled to Stanford, Yale,  Harvard, and Woodland Cemetery in Connecticut to research the story.
“There was a lot of intrigue that we discovered using [digitized historical] newspaper articles,” said project researcher Theresa Cullen regarding Porter’s early life. After Porter’s mother died when he was eight years old, his father began corresponding with at least a dozen young women including his son’s governess, which prompted his older sons to attempt to have him declared insane. Porter left his turbulent family when he matriculated at Yale, where a semi-spiritual experience in the Cathedral of Coutances in 1904 led him to cast aside his earlier ambitions of attending law school and instead devote himself to art history. He joined the Harvard faculty in 1920.
Porter had a presence at Harvard that has recently been scrutinized in light of changing norms. A 2002 Crimson article clued the team in to the University-organized “Secret Court” of 1920, which investigated students suspected of homosexual activity. “It was a time when absolutely everyone was being checked out, all the students and all the professors. Harvard wasn’t a great place to be in the 1920s,” Costigan said. “From the diaries, it seems that [then-President of Harvard Abbott Lawrence] Lowell took a certain interest in the lifestyle of Kingsley Porter and perhaps even went so far as to harass him by calling him to Lowell House all the time and questioning him,” she noted.  “He certainly felt that it was time to leave.”
Porter’s academic record was also controversial; he was involved in transporting a sarcophagus lid from Spain to Harvard’s Fogg Museum. Immediately afterward, Porter began experiencing symptoms of depression. The move instigated serious debate between Harvard and the Spanish government, and the lid was finally returned on the day that Porter was last seen. “If someone wanted a supernatural explanation, it is there as well,” Costigan said.
Costigan has not made up her mind about what happened to Porter, but the investigation did uncover a new finding in the official police inquest, stored in the National Archives office in Dublin. “People have gone over the inquest before, but it’s all handwritten and hard to decipher,” Costigan said. “It had been assumed that no boat left the island…but in fact there was a [ferryman] that rode across on the day that Kingsley Porter was last seen…. If he had wanted anything, with his money and influence there’s no doubt he could have gotten it, including a passage from the island.”
Porter’s legacy is still visible at Harvard today in the various professorships that are named after him, including at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and the Philosophy Department. “Porter is admired today as a pioneer, someone who went out and did heroic field work,” said History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger. Porter was noteworthy, according to Hamburger, for investigating artifacts from multiple nations of origin at a time when the study of art history was nationally segregated, with Spanish scholars studying Spanish architecture and French scholars concentrating on France. “When Porter [lived], to cover the monuments as assiduously as he did was really a heroic undertaking,” Hamburger said. “Today we can conjure up images ad infinitum on the internet, and it’s very easy to take that kind of documentary work for granted.”
Harvard currently possesses 35,000 of Porter’s photographs, taken throughout the professor’s travels, as well as the diaries of Porter’s wife, both of which are now housed in the Pusey Library. “There was actually a great love story in the relationship and the letters they wrote to each other, almost like soulmates for much of their marriage,” Costigan said. Lucy Porter was very involved in the research for her husband’s books, and after his disappearance she continued his work and even traveled to Europe on an archeological expedition.
The story of Porter is also being turned into a documentary and a feature film, produced by Donegal-based Lugh Films and expected to begin filming in 2013. The Arthur Kingsley Porter Project has bolstered the economy of Donegal, according to Williams: it has inspired increased tourism, a play about Porter’s life, portraits of the Porter family, a local art competition, original jewelry, music composed for harp, and a commemorative pen series designed by two Irish brothers, aged 13 and 14.
For Williams, the conclusion of his involvement with Porter’s story is a fulfilling moment. “It’s like Kingsley Porter has been directing me this whole time. He’s been on my case, and I’m ready for him to let me go after 10 years,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lana del Rey is strange. The self proclaimed “Lolita lost in the hood” has packed her music videos with everything from live lions to a gangster version of J.F.K. Her love of the bizarre is further confirmed in her new 10-minute music video “Ride,” which is filled with creepy old men and indian headdresses. However, these musical and stylistic abnormalities do not dominate or define her work, but instead enhance it. In “Ride,” scenes of bizarre sexual relationships in seedy locations are captured through beautiful cinematography and poignant spoken word segments in order to convey a moving narrative.
The video starts simply, with Lana swinging on a tire in silence. The quiet is broken when Lana begins a subdued voiceover about her realization that the life of stardom is not all it is hyped up to be. She says instead that memories of being with men on the road were “the only things that sustained me and my only real happy times.” Here, the video shows the stunningly gorgeous Lana laughing and kissing a group of middle-aged bikers, most of whom have pretty substantial beer guts. While the stark contrast between Lana and the creepy-looking guys she is with is almost comical at first, the narration gives the scenes meaning: Lana was plagued by alcohol dependence as a young teenager and ended up in many sticky situations as a result. So while the old guys aren’t the sexiest choice for a music video, they hold symbolic power about Lana’s troubled past.
After a montage of clips of Lana and various men at gas stations, motels, and corner liquor stores, the video ends with another voiceover. “Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?” Lana asks. She then answers herself with a resounding finish: “I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free.” It is this craziness that powers her songs and music videos and makes her a unique force in pop music.

Despite last summer’s neon fashion trend, it seems nobody really likes to remember the 1980s—the decade of legwarmers, bad hairstyles, and monstrous shoulder pads. However, a new exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art—the first major museum exhibition with its focus in the United States—is dedicated to examining the cultural value and influence of the 1980s.
Featuring over 100 works from roughly 90 artists, “This Will Have Been: Art, Love & Politics in the 1980s” traces the decade through four major themes, titled “Gender Trouble,” “The End is Near,” “Democracy,” and “Desire & Longing.” The exhibit, which actually covers art from the years 1979 to 1992, brings together the works of a wave of artists from this time who sought to make statements about a dynamic era pulled in different directions by powerful forces.
Helen Molesworth, the Barbara Lee Chief Curator at the ICA, said she began thinking about the 1980s when she considered the decade’s relevance to the 2000s. “A lot of folks were realizing that it was the 20-year anniversary of the deaths of people they had lost during the AIDS crisis.… Twenty years is a moment where you can really pause and reflect. It’s a whole lifetime,” she said. Molesworth said that artists in the 1980s, many of whom belonged to the BLGTQ community, were grappling not only with the losses of their loved ones but also struggling to come to terms with their places in an era in which mass media was being increasingly harnessed for artistic expression.
The “Gender Trouble” section of the exhibit calls into question the consequences of the 1970s feminist movement. “[The 1970s] sort of established the basic parameters of [male and female] equality, but other kinds of questions emerged,” Molesworth said. “Are men the [only] kind of standard? Or were we interested in different kinds of relationships—different relationships to power, different relationships to sexuality?” she said. The centerpiece of this section is Canadian photographer Jeff Wall’s iconic photograph “Picture for Women,” which depicts a woman standing with her back to another camera, staring at the viewer. The image deconstructs the history of women as objects by presenting the female subject as both the viewer and the viewed, underscoring the decade’s changing social currents.
No discussion of women’s power, however, would be complete without a challenge to the traditional concepts of masculinity. “One of the things that feminism suggests is that if women are equal to men, the fabric of our social and intimate lives will shift, and that will create a shift for men as well as for women,” Molesworth said. German artist Albert Oehlen’s “Self-Portrait with Shitty Underpants and Blue Mauritius” reflects the artist’s frustration with the whims of the 1980s art market and his inability to control even his most basic functions.
The category “The End is Near” homes in on personal crises, from the loss of the individual to the growing marketplace. While some pieces question the true essence of a person—whether one is defined by one’s preferences or something deeper—other pieces express a growing horror at the rapidly spreading AIDS epidemic. One piece, stylized similarly to Robert Indiana’s “LOVE” sculpture, which features a recognizable arrangement of the word, turns the word “AIDS” in similar typography into a wallpaper. “AIDS was simply a constant backdrop against which everything happened,” Molesworth said. In an era of change, the AIDS epidemic was yet another source of uncertainty.
Taking a political turn, the “Democracy” section delves deeper into the artist’s interaction with the government. Hans Haacke’s “Oelgemaelde, Hommage à Marcel Broodthaers” situates the viewers between a painting of Ronald Reagan and a photograph of a protest, thereby forcing them to choose a side. Yet, Molesworth said, not all choices are that simple. “As much power as I think I might have when I walk in the street to protest power, my images, my gestures will always be reframed,” Molesworth said. “There is no pure democracy that happens in the streets. There is now the media,” she said.
The “Desire & Longing” section broaches the topic of sexuality via pieces such as Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s “Untitled (Perfect Lovers),” which consists of two sychronized clocks, and Jeff Koons’s “Rabbit,” an inflatable rabbit cast in metal. But this portion of the exhibit is no self-gratifying exploration of sex; instead, the desires follow a more existential path. “Desire for equality, desire for fame, desire to make an image that is as powerful as a Hollywood image… all of this desire to do something, to make some kind of an impact,” Molesworth said.
According to Molesworth, this exploration of the turbulent 1980s is ultimately one of historical explanation and exploration. “How do we tell historical stories that traditionally in Western civilization have been told in one authoritative voice?” Molesworth said. “How do we now let lots of voices permeate the historical field?” The art of “This Will Have Been” shows a grittier side to the bubble-gum-flavored, neon pop distillation that commonly is called 1980s culture. Instead, the exhibit shows that the decade deserves serious examination.

Choreographer John R. Jasperse has had a career spanning nearly three decades, during which time he has choreographed more than a dozen major works. In 1990, he founded the John Jasperse Company, of which the innovative style expands the relevance of contemporary dance to broader audiences. Jasperse is a Fall 2012 artist-in-residence for the Office for the Arts at Harvard, where he has been working with student dancers who will perform a full-length work at the Harvard Dance Center from November 29 through December 1.
The Harvard Crimson: You have described yourself as having an ambivalent attitude toward dance. How has this informed your work?
John R. Jasperse: It’s not that I’m indifferent [towards dance], it’s that I have both a very strong connection to the form and a lot of simultaneous doubt about the form. That tension is imbedded in all of my work. There are ways in which I keep trying to invest in what I would say are the essential powers of dance in terms of the resonance of physical experience…. [But there is a tension] between intellectual intelligence and experiential intelligence, [which is] very much a different kind of system of intelligence from the one that is valued in academia.
THC: Recently you gave a talk entitled “The Gendered Body in Movement” at the Harvard College Women’s Center. Why do you think dance is a suitable medium for challenging notions of gender and sexuality?
JRJ: I think that any kind of performance form that deals with human beings deals with these [issues] because there is no such thing as neutrality. Gender in some ways is a stylistic construction of sexual identity that every human being has. One of the things that’s particular about dance is it’s centered on the physical aspects of experience, so the prominence of these issues is probably stronger in dance then it is in other art forms.... In Western classical ballet you see an extremely strong manifestation of that [gender construction]. So there’s an opportunity inside of dance to work with its own history of the gendered body.
THC: How did you become involved with dance?
JRJ: Dancing was really powerful as a physical experience in my teens…. I didn’t really play sports, and I was kind of your typical gay man growing up [who] felt very related to a particular idea of what a gay boy would be. When dancing came along, I suddenly had this very empowered experience of my body. The contrast with all the other experiences with my body that I’d had up to this point was so strong that I think it excited a really strong interest in me. I also was very taken with the social aspect of dance. I think there was something in working with others to make something that was very interesting to me and continues to be exciting even in moments that I find it really challenging.
THC: What inspired you to make a career as a choreographer?
JRJ: I started making work pretty much immediately upon starting dancing. Making dance is not an easy thing to do…. You spend your life making experiences that are not generally mainstream cultural experiences. They disappear as soon as you stop doing them. There’s a kind of ideology there that’s diametrically opposed to everything about a consumerist society that values ownership. In dance there’s really nothing to own. It’s a very curious and interesting thing.... And I think that people who do it do it because of some mental, primordial need.
THC: Your most recent work, “Fort Blossom revisited (2000/12),” features two naked male dancers. What was the thinking behind this?
JRJ: Once upon a time in making work I really felt like I could control things [and] be objective and not open to interpretation. But the body isn’t like that. I wanted to make people aware of the shifts in their own vision. For me, “Fort Blossom” is all about the slide…. You see something one way, and now something very slight has changed, and suddenly you’re seeing it in a completely different way. The piece is also about duality: clothing/naked, black/red, fabric/flesh, men/women…. In Fort Blossom, what you think is really clear becomes very unclear, and it opens up the possibility for really understanding differences in a different kind of way.
THC: Where do your ideas come from?
JRJ: Circumstances. I’m used to working in these very extended processes where I keep working everyday and keep exploring....  [But] here at Harvard, nobody really has that much time. In order to respond to that, I decided I’m going to make [the piece I’m choreographing at Harvard] these six dances that collide in one experience.

These past few weeks have caused the Harvard community to reevaluate the ways in which it understands and embraces diversity. After a series of articles and debates, campus discussions have increasingly focused on topics such as affirmative action and the implications of living in a pluralistic world. In a strange manifestation of the old adage “speak of the devil and he doth appear,” circumstances throughout campus have tested Harvard’s priorities, and in an overwhelming display of solidarity, the community has established that policies encouraging diversity are vital to the success of our university.
In my two and a half years here, I have learned far more from my peers than from my classes. At its very core, Harvard recognizes the value of “building a class,” creating a body of students that exemplify diversity, passion, diligence, thoughtfulness, and the capacity to express one’s ideals. In addition, Harvard recognizes the value of “civilian diplomacy,” the ability to dispel stereotypes through open, interpersonal interactions. In many ways, policies such as affirmative action are about creating a community that embodies a range of opinions and values. In accordance with these values, the Harvard Admissions Office firmly holds that there is no such thing as an admissions mistake. Yet, from time to time, this campus that treasures its diversity has faced policies that threaten its core ideals.
Take for example the recent circumstances surrounding the Hillel Dining Hall, in which a campus-wide outcry against proposed dining hall restrictions prompted Harvard University Dining Services, Hillel, and the Harvard Administration to take measures to protect the openness of a small yet significant dining hall. When HUDS faced financial pressure to restrict access to the Hillel Dining Hall, members of the Harvard community, including its Jewish community, took offense to the implications of these restrictions and the possibility that such actions have the capacity to perpetuate the stereotypical concept of Jewish exclusivity. With laudable insight, the students of this university recognized the tremendous benefits of the Hillel Dining Hall as a welcoming space for the broader Harvard community.
Among Jewish communities worldwide, Harvard Hillel is extraordinarily unique. As the center for Jewish life on campus, it truly embodies a diversity that defies description. Hillel houses Jews from different backgrounds with incredibly varied approaches to identity, politics, religion, culture, academics, and campus life. As a community, Harvard’s Jews do not often see eye-to-eye, but these very disagreements weave the living tapestry that continues to frame the future of the Jewish people. Hillel is amazing in its ability to occupy seemingly contradicting roles. Where else can a community be both religious and secular, both political and apolitical? Its diversity is a gift, a model that must be shared. What kind of community is better suited to exemplifying the enigmas and complexities of cultural identity than Harvard Hillel? More importantly, what better audience could such a community have than the future leaders of the world, the students of Harvard University?
In the simple act of restricting access to a dining hall, Harvard risked closing doors to the kind of spontaneous cross-cultural connections that incrementally change the world. Through the casual, unstructured interactions typical of any campus dining hall, the Hillel Dining Hall creates civilian diplomacy. Hillel and Harvard have always rejected the notion that formal programming dispels stereotypes more effectively than people do. Yet because many religiously observant students depend on this dining hall for so many meals, HUDS’s proposed restrictions could have had a chilling outcome in denying both the Jewish and non-Jewish student community the greater opportunity to gain mutual knowledge.
As we face future challenges, we should remain steadfast to protect our inclusiveness as Harvard students. We should protect our opportunities for mutual understanding created by open dialogue. If, as with the Hillel Dining Hall, finances need to be considered, I am sure there are ways to address these matters without sacrificing Harvard’s core concept of plurality. I am proud that our Harvard community has taken initiative in addressing these concerns with regards to HUDS and Hillel. In the spirit of our ideals, let us always stand together in defense of diversity.
David F. Sackstein ’14 is a comparative study of religion concentrator in Adams House. He previously served as Vice President for Community Relations on Harvard Hillel’s Steering Committee.

On Election Day, America evaded an explosion. The escalation of the unlimited, secret campaign contributions arms race, totaling an astonishing $1 billion, seemed unable to buoy sinking candidates propped up by much-feared super PACs.
American Crossroads, Karl Rove’s Super PAC, had a one percent success rate after spending $103 million, and Sheldon G. Adelson has little to show after spending $53 million of his own wealth. But the system allowing the corrupting influence of unlimited, anonymous contributions remains intact.
“Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored,” as writer Aldous Huxley once said.
Republicans are in existential crisis, poignantly and pettily illustrated by Bill O’Reilly’s lamenting that “the white establishment is now the minority” and reeling from the realization that American people are not nearly as bribable as their politicians. A platform doling outdated social bromides, preaching belligerence and braggadocio as foreign policy, and peddling thinly veiled kickbacks to major donors as economic policy was self-defeating and suicidal, no matter how much money was poured into resuscitating it.
That Republicans managed to lose seats in both the House and the Senate, despite outspending Democrats $102 million to $70 million on House races and $135 million to $89 million on Senate races, is more a symptom of the ideological radicalization of the Republican Party than of the public’s distaste for the broken campaign finance system. Money buys advertisements and access, but winning elections requires a coherent, relevant vision and a voice of reason that Republicans sorely missed.
The deluge of money that strongly benefited Republicans in this election season is the result of the Supreme Court’s two recent decisions in the Citizens United and SpeechNOW.org cases, which allowed unlimited independent expenditures by corporations, unions, and people. These rulings have been seized upon to form Super PACs and dark money groups. How advocates of the expansion of the Citizens United ruling could, in good conscience, claim that unlimited, anonymous donations secretly fueling political campaigns is in any way beneficial or even reconcilable with the core principles of our republic is beyond me.
That Karl Rove can disingenuously claim that his organization Crossroads GPS is a non-political “social welfare” group, even protected as a non-profit, is so farcical that it calls into question the integrity of our current flimsy campaign finance regulation. Rove’s groups squandered nearly $300 million trying unsuccessfully to convince Americans to stomach a terrible presidential candidate.
Yet it’s not as if President Obama, beneficiary of a near billion-dollar campaign, remained above the fray. Rather than simply carpet-bombing swing states with ads, the Obama campaign was aided by a brilliant ring of behavioral scientists and a robust grassroots apparatus that leveraged modern technologies—advantages that Republicans will surely not ignore in the next election cycle. The current campaign finance system is awash with an unregulated deluge of money that draws both Republican and Democratic candidates into an ever-escalating arms race: The $2.1 billion-dollar presidential campaigns represent a near quadrupling from the 2000 election, pushing our politicians to prefer contributions to constituents.
Incumbents are increasingly forced to devote more time pursuing donors in order to avoid being overwhelmed by their opponents in the ever-looming next election. “Thirty to 70 percent of the average member of Congress’s time is spent on fundraising…which is incredible if you think about it,” remarked Representative John P. S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) at a lecture given at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. It’s not as if cold-calling contributors fixes an increasingly volatile Middle East, the looming fiscal cliff, or climate change.
Our politicians are beholden to their donors, a loyalty that drives a wedge between legislators and their constituents, diluting trust in our most respected institutions. This fractured trust is highlighted by duplicitous Republicans, who are staunch supply-siders when advocating for huge tax cuts for their ultra-wealthy donors but wide-eyed Keynesians when disparaging the $500 billion in cuts to the Department of Defense, which will hurt generously donating defense contractors.
America has a regrettably long legacy of corrupt campaign finance, from George Washington buying $8,000 worth of alcohol for voters to Richard Nixon’s secret stash that funded Watergate. Politicians should fear that the burgeoning dependence on special interests and wealthy donors is a recurrence of this sad history. But as Aldous Huxley discerned, “That we do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history.”

This year’s Undergraduate Council election was a marked departure from elections of years past, which were often characterized by much student cynicism. With over 3,600 ballots cast compared to last year’s 2,730, Harvard undergraduates not only chose their new UC leaders, but also made bold statements by passing three referenda on important campus issues. We congratulate Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 for their victory in this year’s election, and we hope that they follow up on the student body’s wishes expressed by the successful referenda.
Raghuveer and Zhu won their election by a landslide, receiving 533 more votes than Michael C. George ’14 and Nicole E. Granath ’15, who finished in second place and were endorsed by The Crimson. This wide margin demonstrates the large amount of faith placed by students in their new president and vice president to represent them and the issues they deem important. The successful running mates should also be credited for successfully using social media and a large campaign staff to draw over 10 percent more students out to vote, a welcome change from the disappointing turnout of the previous election.
Raghuveer and Zhu were not the only Harvard students who scored a major victory in this election. We applaud the efforts of Harvard students who coordinated their efforts in organizing the placement of the referenda featured on the ballot, as well as their subsequent campaigns to have them passed. The student body has demonstrated that issues concerning responsible investment, fossil fuel divestment, and Harvard’s sexual assault policy are important to them: All three measures received over 70 percent of the student body’s support, and the referendum on Harvard’s sexual assault policy passed with a staggering 85 percent of students voting affirmatively. We hope that Raghuveer and Zhu will incorporate these issues into their agenda and prioritize them as the new leaders of the UC and representatives of Harvard undergraduates.
Although Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds has stated that our school’s sexual assault policy is unlikely to change in the near future, this should not deter Raghuveer and Zhu from taking up the banner of reforming our school’s policy. Indeed, the Harvard administration’s reluctance to take action on an issue which is clearly important to students is an instance in which student leadership is particularly important.
Raghuveer and Zhu ran a successful campaign demanding that the UC become more relevant in the lives of the students. Their election promises include making the UC more welcoming to women, pushing for the creation of a women, gender, and sexuality department, and the implementation of online student feedback systems and discussion forums. These proposals have merit, although some may be difficult to implement. Nevertheless, we sincerely hope, in light of the significance and highly contested nature of this election, that the new elects are able to translate their campaign promises from paper to action.
We have in the past expressed our disappointment and dissatisfaction with the UC. Although we remain skeptical of the role and potential of the UC, we hope that Raghuveer and Zhu will prove us and other skeptics wrong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 20, 2012, at 11:55 a.m.
Two Harvard researchers charged that a website which catalogs mug shots and criminal records engages in racial profiling in its advertising—just before the founder of a different criminal records website made his first public appearance.
Director of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard Latanya Sweeney and Harvard Department of Government Fellow Adam Tanner have researched these websites while writing an upcoming book on online criminal records.
“What has changed is scope of sharing,” Sweeney said. “Years ago...limits of technology posed natural barriers to sharing and dissemination.”
Today, however, this information is rapidly spread online.
In their talk—subtitled “a tale of crime, betrayal, lust, race, and the internet”—Sweeney and Tanner alleged based on their research that Google searches for typically African-American names lead to negative ads posted by one of these criminal records sites, InstantCheckmate.com, while typically Caucasian names draw neutral ads.
For example, when Sweeney searched her own name, she saw an ad saying, “Latanya Sweeney: Arrested?” In contrast, a search for “Tanya Smith” produced an ad saying, “Located: Tanya Smith.”
Sweeney and Tanner’s research led them across the country in attempt to uncover the people behind these criminal records websites. Tanner traveled to Las Vegas to try to speak to an employee of InstantCheckmate.com.
“I told them what I knew about the racial profiling, and they said, ‘We can’t talk to you, you have to come back.’” Tanner said.
When Tanner finally met with the company’s call center manager, he said he was told, “I don’t care if you’re the Pope of Rome; you’re not welcome here.”
But at the event on Monday at which Tanner and Sweeney spoke in CGIS, Kyle Prall, the founder of similar site BustedMugshots.com, agreed to answer audience questions and accusations about his business.
Sweeney suggested that sites like BustedMugshots.com could qualify as using extortion tactics, since they demand payment to remove images. Prall affirmed that these public records are available to the public based on the First Amendment, justifying the practices of his website.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 28
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that InstantCheckmate.com charges a fee for the removal of mugshots from its online database. In fact, the website does not ask for payment to remove mugshots. The article also said that Harvard Department of Government Fellow Adam Tanner sought to speak to the founder of InstantCheckmate.com and reported a quotation which the founder said to him. In fact, Tanner sought out the company's call center manager, who said the quotation about the Pope.

Harvard and MIT’s joint online learning venture edX announced Tuesday morning that it would combine virtual and in-person learning as it expands to two local community colleges.
Beginning in spring, Bunker Hill Community College in Charlestown and MassBay Community College’s greater Boston campuses will offer a modified version of edX’s “Introduction to Computer Science and Programming,” an online class based on MIT’s introductory computer science course. In-class instruction and mentoring at MassBay and Bunker Hill will supplement the online course taught by three MIT professors.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting the collaboration with a million-dollar grant.
EdX, financed by $30 million investments from Harvard and MIT, was first announced last May as an online platform that would allow anyone in the world to enroll virtually in a select set of the universities’ courses for free. The organization has since announced expansions to include the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Texas system. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world have enrolled in the nine current courses, including 120,000 in Harvard’s Computer Science 50x: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” an online version of the popular on-campus offering CS50.
MIT and San Jose State University already offer a combination of online and campus learning, edX President Anant Agarwal pointed out. In both cases, Agarwal said, “we’ve had a fair bit of success.”
He said that edX’s partnership with community colleges will help resolve the flaws of entirely virtual education while preserving its benefits.
“At the end of the day, the purely online experience doesn’t capture the in-person interaction that we all care about,” said Agarwal, an MIT professor. “We really, really have to understand the blended model of learning.”
He said that edX would look to further expand its online offerings while also promoting blended courses, particularly at community colleges.
“We haven’t had a big innovation in education for hundreds of years,” Agarwal said, adding that he believes the blended model is “that next big step.”
The courses at MassBay and Bunker Hill will be taught by the community colleges’ professors using materials developed by edX.
“The current plan is to blend their experience with ours and have a hybrid class,” said MassBay spokesperson Jeremy E. Solomon. “We believe it is a formula that will work well into the future.”
Beginning in January, both Bunker Hill and MassBay will grant normal credit and charge standard tuition to the 20 students in each of their pilot courses, according to a statement from edX spokesperson Dan O’Connell.
“EdX has proven to be a global leader in online education,” said Solomon. “We are blending their online expertise with our faculty, who experience teaching community college students.”

The Undergraduate Council dramatically increased funding allocated to student groups for Wintersession programming, doling out $20,000 for workshops, trips, and creative projects.
The success of last year’s Wintersession programming led to an increase in applications for funding along with general interest in the not-for-credit programming, UC Finance Committee Chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14 said.
The Office of Student Life worked with the UC to create a user-friendly online application platform for students seeking funding. Under the new system, the OSL first reviews applications before passing the information to the Council to conduct interviews and allocate funds.
“Because of the popularity of Wintersession in years past and, I believe, because of this streamlining with the OSL, we increased the number of applicants to over 60,” Marotta said.
Those applications totaled more than $87,000 in requests, according to Marotta. Though the Council had $20,000 to allocate, he said it only denied five to ten of the requests outright. The UC encouraged applicants who were denied funding to collaborate with similar programs that did receive grants.
Marotta said that the UC is considering a proposal to provide training to student program leaders. Receiving UC grants would not be contingent upon participation in training, he said.
“In general, if an individual applies for an idea, it’s something that they are pretty passionate about and something that they know they have some experience with,” he said,
Group leaders who received funding last year said that UC grants helped them bring their ideas to fruition in a way that might not have happened otherwise.
Mary C. Hallowell ’14, who led a Wintersession sketch comedy workshop for Respectably French!, wrote in an email to The Crimson that Wintersession is “a really great way to allow a group of students to work together on a creative project without the stresses of the academic term.”
Looking to the future of Wintersession, Marotta said the UC would need to increase funding to meet student demand.
“There are so many ideas that are out there, and we are under a real squeeze here,” he said. “Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to get more funding so we don’t have to make $67,000 worth of cuts like we did this year.
”Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15, who produced a film on immigration in Boston last January, wrote that UC funding helped him explore a delicate topic that might not have received funding otherwise.
For Marotta, increased funding is essential to making Wintersession fufill its potential.
“The excitement is there. The demand is there. We just need the money to make all of these events happen,” he said.

BOSTON—Matt Leduc is a registered Independent. Sitting on his front stoop while awaiting a ride to the Patriots tailgate, Leduc, like many in South Boston, said he leans Democratic but votes both ways. In the hotly contested U.S. Senate race between Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown, that meant supporting Brown.
“I’m pretty much in the middle,” Leduc said. “I think Warren is a little bit out there. Scott Brown is a very moderate guy.”
The heart of Boston’s blue-collar backbone, Southie has become a political bellwether for statewide races. While the rest of the city is generally a Democratic stronghold, the neighborhood is home to conservative Democrats who are comfortable backing Republicans, a key swing demographic for Republicans hoping to win in left-leaning Massachusetts.
Brown won South Boston with 56 percent of the vote in 2010 and eked out victory here two weeks ago with 51 percent of the vote, but it was Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School, who ultimately took the seat.
On a recent Sunday morning, a few tired campaign posters in shop windows along East Broadway and bumper stickers askew on the backs of cars still pointed to the political split that divides the neighborhood. Voters, weary from a long election season, repeated the same sentiments over and over again.
“I like Scott Brown a lot because I think he would vote both sides. He’s very independent,” said Mary Kelly Burke.
The politically independent neighborhood became something of a touchstone for Brown’s time in Washington and his subsequent campaign. He made South Boston home to his campaign headquarters for his re-election bid and often canvassed the streets here, dressed in a Bruins jersey and jeans.
Warren, a high-powered academic with working-class roots, tried to make inroads in South Boston as well. As she began her campaign at the nearby Broadway MBTA station on a September morning more than a year ago, political pundits said Warren would need to win back swing populations like South Boston who had backed Brown in 2010 if she wanted to win.
Identifying herself as a Democrat, Burke said the days when House leader Tip O’Neill could help foster compromise are over and Washington needs to reinvent itself in a new bi-partisan fashion.
“If it was any other race, I probably would have voted for her,” Burke said of Warren, but as things stand, she said Brown would have been the best man for the job.
John Gregori agreed that Washington needs to be more flexible, but so must voters. He voted for Warren this time around, but said it’s not as simple as voting a party ticket any more.
“She seems like she’s more for the people,” Gregori said. “I come from a low-income area and it just seems like Scott Brown is for all the big money.”
Brown’s fate in South Boston points to the problems that dogged his campaign statewide and ultimately led to his defeat, said David Luberoff, a senior project advisor for the Radcliffe Institute’s Boston Area Research Initiative.
Though he was able to hold onto his Republican and Independent base, Brown failed to expand support among other groups in an election that saw much higher turnout and a stronger opponent than he faced in 2010.
“Basically they held Brown to a narrow victory in South Boston and rolled him over him in other parts of the city. And that’s a winning strategy,” Luberoff said. “He kind of held onto a base, but he wasn’t able to grow it in a significant way. This is the story of the Brown campaign.”
The morning after her election night victory party, Warren affirmed South Boston’s status as a key swing demographic, stopping by the Broadway MBTA station nearby to thank supporters living in the one Boston neighborhood she did not take.
But though ballots have been cast, South Boston’s endorsement has yet to be settled.
From his porch on East 5th Street, many blocks away from Broadway station, William surveyed the street below. William, who declined to give his last name, said he voted for Warren, but isn’t sure who the right candidate is.
“I’m still undecided,” William said, “and I voted.”

Cambridge Common is likely to soon see its first permanent public restroom.
Following a Monday night vote by the City Council, the City Manager’s office will consider constructing the proposed restroom facility as part of an extensive renovation of the park. The larger renovation project, which is slated to begin this spring at the earliest, will involve replacing all pathways, benches, and trashcans, as well as installing additional lighting in the Common.
Currently, the park houses a temporary restroom facility, the authorization for which is set to expire at the end of the month. To give the city more time to plan a permanent solution, the Council also passed a resolution requesting that the City Manager look into extending the temporary bathroom into the winter.
Advocates for the homeless gathered at City Hall Monday night to lobby in support of the two resolutions.
Reverend Joseph O. Robinson of Christ Church Cambridge spoke in favor of extending the temporary restroom facility. He noted that although the Church opens its restrooms to anyone in the community, security concerns have made it increasingly difficult for them to continue this policy.
“It seems to be right and fair that public bathrooms be available to people of all walks of life in all parts of the city,” Robinson said.
Echoing Robinson’s concerns, Councilor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom emphasized the need for a public restroom to ensure that the homeless population—as well as children, sports teams, and other visitors to the Common—are not forced to use private restrooms in Harvard Square.
“At some point when you ask private entities to have their facilities open to the public, it doesn’t work anymore,” vanBeuzekom said.
Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 agreed that such a facility benefits a much wider community than just the homeless.
He pointed to the “long distance” separating public restrooms in Harvard Square and Porter Square as good reason to move forward with the plans for a permanent facility.
Deputy City Manager Richard C. Rossi said that the biggest challenges in proceeding with that proposal would be designing the facility to reflect the historical aesthetic of the park while simultaneously upholding standards of cleanliness and security.
Rossi cited the public restroom in Bryant Park in New York City as a model of what he would like to see the Common’s permanent restroom become. But his mention of Bryant Park, which is privately owned, raised questions among the other councilors about how to secure funding to construct and maintain the proposed facility.
In response, Rossi said he would look into forming a coalition of local businesses to help defray costs for the proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When he graduates from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Guy P. Smoot hopes to become a professor.
A student in the comparative literature department, Smoot said he has found working with students rewarding as a teaching fellow at the College, particularly getting them excited about the material he teaches.
“I like to have an impact on the way people view the world,” Smoot said.
Smoot’s career aspiration is a common one among graduates of GSAS.
According to Garth O. McCavana, GSAS dean for Student Affairs, about 70 percent of the school’s 4,000 students go into academia each year, either by jumping directly into the professorial job market or by pursuing postdoctoral studies.
The goal for many graduate students is to eventually earn tenure, the guarantee of lifelong employment awarded by universities to their most valuable faculty members.
Most students spend anywhere from four to seven years pursuing their doctoral degrees and many wonder whether there are teaching jobs open for them once they graduate.
“The job market is not great at the moment,” McCavana said. “Our students are doing well, but it doesn’t mean everyone is landing their dream job.”
Of the 100 GSAS students interviewed by The Crimson, 48 said they hoped to pursue jobs in academia upon graduation.
For doctoral candidates in the humanities graduating from Harvard, the path to professorship is especially long, rocky, and uncertain—qualities that have only been worsened by the current economic climate.
INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS
The path to a tenure-track position is similar across most fields of academia.
A candidate’s published academic writings are key to the application process, as they serves as indicators of how the student will fare as a full-time scholar.
“Your publication record shows that you can finish things and get research done,” assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology Emily P. Balskus said. “It’s more the quality than the quantity, and [if] you really made a contribution to the research.”
Most departments require their graduate students to serve as teaching fellows even as they work on their dissertations.
“There’s a dilemma among many graduate students who are done with their course work,” said Smoot. “You pass your general exams, and then you have to teach while you work on your dissertation.”
For graduate students, the daunting process of hunting for jobs usually begins in the fall of their final year at Harvard.
Most academic disciplines utilize centralized fora that list all of the openings in that field from departments and universities across the globe.
Applicants for each position are whittled down and a small minority of candidates receive invitations to interview with faculty. Eventually three or four candidates are brought to campus for on-site visits, during which they go through what McCavana described as an “intensive interview process.”
“People are literally on from 8 a.m. to when dinner is over—it’s all part of the interview,” McCavana said. “They want to see how you get along with the colleagues.”
Balskus, who interviews candidates applying to Harvard’s chemistry department, said the process is “very fair.”
“From my perspective, what you are asked to do is in many ways very reflective of the things you’ll do as an assistant professor,” Balskus said. “You’ll have to talk and explain your work, and you’ll have to interact.”
HARD TIMES FOR HUMANITIES
The number of job openings in humanities departments has declined as cash-strapped universities divert resources to the sciences.
“Universities are putting more money into sciences than humanities,” said English professor Amanda Claybaugh. “[Universities are] hiring in the sciences rather than the humanities.”
Furthermore, she said, universities are “under incredible financial constraints.” As a result, the hiring of tenure-track professors has slowed as schools appoint more and more adjunct professors—lower-paid professors not on the tenure track, whose primary duty is to teach students.
As a result, graduate students face even greater uncertainty while wrapping up their dissertations and beginning their hunt for a job.
And with fewer non-academic jobs available overall, those who graduate with Ph.Ds in the humanities face unsure employment prospects.
“Everyone feels concerned about whether they can get a job they want, and second, whether they can get a job at all,” said L. Julie Jiang, a postdoctoral fellow in the linguistics department.
Claybaugh said that she often cautions College students against attending graduate school.
“It’s a very risky thing to do a Ph.D these days,” said Claybaugh.
THE HUMANITIES POSTDOC
The realities of the job market have made postdoctoral research an often appealing option for unemployed graduate students.
Smoot, who is in his fifth year of graduate studies, said he will apply for a job as a professor, but if he does not succeed his backup plan is to remain in academia as a “postdoc.”
Smoot’s story is one echoed by many graduate students looking to grow their credentials before applying to jobs.
“[Postdoctoral research] allows them to build up their credentials to go on to the academic job market, because it’s become more and more difficult,” said McCavana. McCavana said he has noticed a recent rise in the number of humanities postdocs.
László Sándor, a Ph.D candidate in the economics department, said he thinks the option of pursuing a postdoc became more attractive to graduate students in the humanities following the fallout from the economic crisis.
He described the postdoc market as one that emerged for students who wanted “to wait” and spend more time at a university before entering the job market.
But despite the fact that it is often long and uncertain, the path towards academia is one that Harvard graduate students continue to pursue.
“Our department does really well,” Claybaugh said of Harvard graduate students in the English department applying to be professors. “Our students are cautiously optimistic and they have good reason to be.”
For Jiang, the discussion about the difficult job market overlooks an important factor, one that continues to motivate graduate students to apply year after year.
“You really have to have the passion and enthusiasm and love for the thing you do,” Jiang said. “Without these things, I don’t think people will be able to stand the difficulties they face on the path to academia.”

Tuesday night will pit fresh faces against experience when the Harvard men’s basketball team travels to take on Saint Joseph’s at Hagan Arena in Philadelphia, Penn.
The Crimson (2-1) is the epitome of a team in transition after losing co-captains Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey before the start of the season, while the Hawks (2-1) have depended on a veteran squad, returning every major contributor from last year.
When the two teams last went head-to-head a season ago, Saint Joseph’s jumped out to an early lead and held it for most of the game. But with two minutes on the clock, Harvard powered ahead, overcoming a 14-point deficit to take the game, 74-69.
When the Crimson takes the court on Tuesday, it will be with a decidedly different team than last December’s. Harvard lost its top four scorers from last season, but the team has seen production from a variety of players who have stepped into new roles this season.
According to Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers has been crucial in helping the Harvard offense cope with the variety of defensive philosophies it has seen so far this season. In last Friday’s 79-45 blowout against Manhattan, Chambers notched 14 points and seven assists, controlling the play down the court and creating offensive opportunities in 35 minutes of play.
“[Chambers] brings a presence to the floor and commands the team, and I love that,” Amaker said. “That’s what the position is about…and he understands it at a very high level for a very young guy.”
After dropping a close contest to UMass last Tuesday, the team is looking to build on its win against Manhattan. Essential in the victory was junior co-captain and wing Laurent Rivard, who scored a game-high 17 points against the Jaspers. After Rivard shot for only six points against the Minutemen earlier in the week, Amaker credits the team with getting him the ball on Friday.
“It’s the responsibility of our players to find him and put the ball in his hands,” Amaker said. “His shooting touch and his range ability is outstanding.”
Saint Joseph’s is also coming off a big weekend after placing second at the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. The Hawks—picked to finish first in the Atlantic 10—upset No. 20 Notre Dame in a 79-70 overtime victory before losing to Florida State on Sunday.
In the victory against Notre Dame, the Hawks relied on a career performance by junior forward Ronald Roberts, who had 21 points and 16 assists as one of five players who scored in the double digits. It was his second double-double of the young season, in which he is averaging 15.3 points per game, an improvement over last year’s 10.9.
Also returning for Saint Joseph’s is junior guard Langston Galloway, a 2011 All-Conference Second Team player and two-time Hawks MVP, who scored 22 points against the Crimson last year and is averaging 13.7 points per game this year.
Senior Carl Jones will join Galloway in the backcourt. The guard, who averaged 17 points per game a season ago, will make his second appearance of the year after missing Saint Joseph’s first three contests.
With the strong-shooting Hawks team—five players are averaging double figures and a sixth is scoring 9.7 points per game—Harvard will look to its defense keep the ball out of its opponent’s hands.
The Crimson has had difficulty maintaining possession in its first few games, and last Tuesday, UMass made Harvard pay. The Crimson coughed up the ball 19 times against the Minutemen, including two costly turnovers with less than 90 seconds to play that helped UMass come back from a five-point deficit to take the win.
Harvard gave up 17 turnovers against Manhattan but improved across the board offensively, shooting over 50 percent—including 8-of-16 from behind the arc—for the first time this season. The team also notched a season-high 19 assists and 12 steals.
“We were pleased to be able to turn around and have a 40-minute performance defensively,” Amaker said. “It was outstanding coming off of the really tough loss we had at UMass.”
Adding to the young Harvard team is freshman guard Agunwa Okolie, who racked up 11 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 18 minutes of play off the bench against Manhattan. In the previous two games, Okolie had only seen three minutes of combined playing time.
“We feel like we can go to him more, and that’s really impressive for me right now because our bench isn’t very deep or long,” Amaker said.
With the all-time series tied, 1-1, the Crimson is looking to gain the edge on Tuesday and continue moving forward following its loss to UMass.
“It started right after Tuesday’s game in the locker room,” Rivard said following Harvard’s victory over Manhattan. “We knew we didn’t finish right, so we turned the page.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it’s time to finally hang up the cleats, every athlete who steps onto a playing field dreams about going out on top.
On Saturday afternoon, that’s exactly what Harvard running back Treavor Scales did.
The senior capped his collegiate career with his best-ever performance, rushing for a career-high 177 yards in the 129th edition of The Game against archrival Yale.
And Scales’ last-ever carry was one he will never forget.
With just over a minute to go and Harvard clinging to a one-score lead, the Crimson faced a third-and-13 that it needed to convert in order to avoid punting the ball back to its opponent. Harvard turned to Scales, who found a hole between center and right guard and exploded down the right sideline for a 63-yard score that gave Harvard its sixth-straight victory over the Bulldogs.
At the end of the run, Scales triumphantly raised both arms high in the air and let it all sink in during the split-second before he was mobbed by his teammates.
“All of those sentiments, all of those ‘thank yous’ you can’t express on a daily basis, that’s what was going through my head,” Scales said. “I just had so many things to be thankful for and it all just [hit me], right there.”
The run marked the culmination of a senior season in which the halfback reached the 1,000 yards plateau for the first time, averaged 6.0 yards per carry, and led the Ancient Eight in rushing yards and touchdowns 13.
“It’s been a heck of a ride,” Scales said. “Everything [fell] into place for me. This season, the stats weren’t a result of individual effort. It was clearly something that involved everybody on that offense and the coaching staff as well.”
The impressive season capped a decorated career for Scales and cemented his name in the Harvard record book. The senior’s 1,002 yards this year was the tenth-highest total in program history, and his career total of 2,823 places him fourth on the Crimson’s all-time rushing list. Meanwhile, Scales’ 13 rushing touchdowns were the third-most in a Harvard single season and his 29 career rushing scores are tied for the second-most in team history.
“[Scales] is an inspirational player,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s just a first-class kid who’s had a tremendous career.”
The rise to the top has been a steady one for the running back who was the Ancient Eight Rookie of the Year in 2009 and was named second-team All-Ivy League in each of his first three seasons despite playing the first two of those years behind star Gino Gordon.
And as he shined on the field, Scales also continued to lead off his teammates off of it.
“He’s a guy that so many players on our team look up to,” Murphy said. “He’s an emotional guy, he’s a fiery guy, and he’ll back it up. He’s such a fierce competitor and he has the respect of everyone.”
That much was on clear display during a senior season Scales bookended with his two best performances, beginning with a 19-carry, 173-yard, two-touchdown game against San Diego. He followed that up with 136 yards and a career-high four scores in a 45-31 win over Brown and hit the century mark in the squad’s next two Ivy contests—against Cornell and Princeton—as well.
“I think he’s gotten a little bit better every year he’s been here,” Murphy said. “He walked in here a very good player out of high school...[and] he’s worked extremely hard at [the game]. What you get is a very accomplished all-around running back.”
Of all those accomplishments, Scales saved his best for last. After accumulating just 33 yards on the ground in the first half on Saturday, the senior dominated in the second. His 16-yard carry helped set up a touchdown run by Chapple that put the Crimson ahead, 13-3, and he later collected 25 yards on three consecutive rushes before an Andrew Berg touchdown reception gave Harvard a 20-17 advantage.
Finally, on Harvard’s final drive, the senior gained 24 yards on three carries and then broke free for the 63-yard score that put the game—and his Crimson career—away with a dramatic flourish.
“It was just pure elation,” Chapple said. “I’ve never seen Treavor run that fast—I guarantee you. He was just moving down the sideline, and at that moment I knew that all of our hard work had come to fruition.”
Whether or not Scales’ football career has come to fruition as well, it is clear that playing in Cambridge has been an experience the Stone Mountain, Ga. native has treasured.
“It’s hard to really fathom that [The Game is] my last as a Harvard football player and quite possibly as a football player [in general],” Scales says. “There’s just so many things that you reflect upon when you hit that field for the last time. It’s a very emotional day.”
“I’m having trouble finding the words for it,” he added. “It’s so tough to describe everything that it means to me.”
In return, it is clear Treavor Scales has meant an enormous amount to the Harvard football program as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophie Pettengill flailed her arms through the water as she crawled her way across Blodgett Pool. She began to slow, and her teammates yelled out encouragements from the deck. In response, she lifted her head out of the water, nodded, and began to thrash through the water with renewed resolve.
When all was said and done, Sophie had completed her first collegiate race at an age before which most girls learn how to swim. But the 25-yard sprint at Harvard’s intrasquad swimming and diving meet two weeks ago was a relatively minor task for a five-year-old who has defeated cancer.
Sophie, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in April 2010, became the youngest member of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team this year through Team IMPACT—a New England-based non-profit that matches collegiate athletic programs with children battling life-threatening illnesses. Now hoping to achieve long-term remission after her doctors declared her cancer-free in June, the toddler from Concord, Mass., will follow the Crimson throughout its season.
THE WILL TO SWIM
Since her diagnosis, Sophie has had 25 serious medical procedures under sedation, including intrathecal chemotherapy and bone marrow aspirations. Through the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she followed an aggressive, 25-month chemotherapy and steroid regimen that concluded this summer.
Yet in the midst of intense treatment, Sophie possessed a stubborn determination to learn how to swim.
“Sophie’s extremely competitive. She has been since the moment she was born,” said Sophie’s mother Julia Pettengill, who swam competitively through high school as a German native growing up in Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. “She’s very driven, very physical…. Shumba [which is Shona for lion cub] has been her nickname through treatment because she was so resilient, courageous, feisty, and strong.”
During the summer of 2011, the three-year-old Sophie, still bald and swollen from her medication, set her sights on making the swim team for which her older sister Ava swam. Pettengill considered swimming an important skill for her children to learn, but she worried at first that Sophie would over-exert herself. She and her husband Mark emphasized to Sophie that she did not need to learn how to swim so soon. Their little Shumba, however, kept jumping in the pool.
In June 2012, a bone marrow test revealed that Sophie was free of any trace of leukemia. The happy news in many respects signaled a return to normalcy for the Pettengills. That same summer, Sophie tried out for her sister’s swim team.
Still very young for a competitive swimmer, Sophie could not quite swim the required two lengths of the pool to make the team.
But the same day that Sophie learned that she would not be on her sister’s team, the Pettengills received a call from Team IMPACT. Harvard swimming was ready to offer Sophie a spot.
A TEAM FOR SOPHIE
Founded in May 2011, Team IMPACT has created a network of hundreds of college athletic programs across the Northeast. Men’s soccer was the first Harvard team to “draft” a child, and the Crimson’s baseball, softball and men’s hockey teams are involved in a similar non-profit, Friends of Jaclyn, which finds collegiate teams for children battling brain tumors.
With the help of junior men’s soccer midfielder Kevin Harrington, junior swimmer Deirdre Clute communicated with the Pettengills and Team IMPACT over the summer. In September, Clute organized a leadership committee of three swimmers from each class to host a draft day for Sophie to welcome her onto the team.
During the draft day, Clute became worried at first as the wide-eyed little girl remained reticent as the swimmers talked to her about the team. Then, Sophie suddenly came out of her shell.
“She starts telling us about her Halloween costume and what her sister got for her birthday, and just really opened up,” Clute said. “She’s a very outgoing girl, probably because all she’s gone through.”
Weeks later, Sophie attended the Crimson’s preseason intrasquad meet. She raced her 25 yards during a heat of the 50-yard freestyle. After nervously grasping the hand of Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski '92 as she stood on the starting blocks, Sophie plopped into the pool feet-first and churned through the water.
“I was not expecting it,” Clute said of Sophie’s swim. “She came up to me when she walked in [to the pool], and she goes, ‘I’ve been practicing all week for this. I’m so excited to swim with the team.’ And then she killed it. I thought [my teammates and I] were going to have to jump in and help her, but she got to the other end of the pool all by herself.”
Sophie and her fellow swimmers celebrated a successful day at the races with a well-earned team dinner at the Eliot D-hall.
INSPIRATION AT THE DUAL MEET
On Saturday, Sophie returned to Blodgett once more as the Crimson hosted Columbia in its dual meet home opener.  She skipped across the white tiles as she arrived on deck during warm-ups, proudly sporting her black Harvard Swimming jacket. Clute and sophomore Courtney Otto hopped out of the pool to say hello, and Sophie showed them a paper turkey that she had made at preschool.
“[Sophie] just adores [Clute] and [Otto],” Pettengill said. “She says she wants to be just like them when she grows up.”
When Sophie arrived at the team locker room, she found a “Happy Birthday” banner strung across her locker as she received a cupcake, a card, and a special happy birthday song from her Harvard teammates.
“Today, today, today, today, today is somebody’s birthday. Not the pickle, not the pear. Not the elephant, not the bear. Today, today, today, today, today is Sophie’s birthday.”
Sophie had turned five years old two days before the meet. Just two and a half years ago, such a milestone may have seemed out of reach.
As Harvard marched out of the locker room with Sophie for the beginning of the competition, Sophie became overwhelmed by the loud cheering and excitement surrounding her first college dual meet. She quickly buried herself in her mother’s arms during the pre-meet introductions.
By the end of the meet, however, Sophie had acquiesced to the strange NCAA meet environment. During the last event, the 4x100 freestyle relay, Sophie energetically bounced up and down behind lane one, cheering on her teammates as she absorbed the splashes of their flip turns. At one point, she swung her arms as if to imitate a relay start. She was the Crimson D relay’s fifth woman.
“She feels so much a part of this team,” Pettengill said. “I knew that it would be very positive for her to have this kind of mentorship with these amazing young and inspiring women and be part of something bigger than herself as a member of this team, but it’s exceeded every expectation that I’ve had.”
And the college swimmers have perhaps learned just as much from Sophie.
“It’s very inspiring for me and the rest of my teammates as well to see somebody like Sophie,” Otto said. “Before having a bad day, we realize that Sophie’s days have been a hundred times worse with everything that she’s had to go through, but she still has a smile on her face and is able to live life to the fullest.”
Sophie glowed as she high-fived Harvard teammates and Columbia competitors after the 187-113 Crimson victory. Maybe, years from now, she will be in a similar handshake line after swimming a longer college race—perhaps a 400-yard I.M. or a 1000-yard freestyle.  Maybe she will become a highly-touted Class of 2030 recruit, or maybe she will develop some entirely different passion altogether.
But no matter what Sophie’s future may entail, the toughest lap lies behind her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s basketball team visits Holy Cross on Tuesday night, the Crimson will look to reverse the two-game losing streak it currently holds against the Crusaders.
Fresh off two victories over North Dakota and Brigham Young, the Harvard squad (2-1) hopes to capitalize on its current momentum to defeat Holy Cross (1-2)—a team that was picked to finish third in the Patriot League.
“We’re pretty excited,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “We’re happy with our turnout in North Dakota, coming off a loss and [being] able to come out and play so well.”
The Crusaders opened its season with an 87-71 win over Yale. Holy Cross went 3-1 in non-conference play against Ivy League foes last year, besting Harvard, Brown and the Bulldogs, but falling to Dartmouth.
Last year, the Crimson fell to the Crusaders, 73-68, after holding a 13-point lead with 13:39 left in the second half. Holy Cross’ comeback was spearheaded by guard Alex Smith, who posted a double-double with 22 points and 11 assists. The then-sophomore led the team in assists last year, with 187.
“[According to Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith], Holy Cross...[is] our biggest archrival,” Golen said. “She was really disappointed with our loss last year. It shouldn’t have happened, so we have a different mindset going into this game. We’re making it a bigger deal than we have in the past.”
This year, the Crusaders will square off against the Crimson after dropping their last two games. Holy Cross was blown out by Boston College on Nov. 13, 71-52, and on Saturday, the team fell to New Hampshire on a Wildcats’ three in the final seconds of the matchup, 68-65.
Harvard will arrive at the Hart Center after a comeback win, 71-65, against BYU on Friday and a resounding defeat over UND on the road, 65-52.
This was the fourth-straight year that the Crimson has prevailed in its home opener.
“We love playing at home for our fans,” Golen said. “There’s nothing like playing [at Lavietes] so we had a lot of energy and a lot of excitement. It was a close game and we were able to play consistently the whole 40 minutes.”
The last minute of play between Harvard, and the Cougars saw two teams locked up at 63 apiece, only to be separated by a late trey.
With a minute remaining in regulation, Crimson forward Victoria Lippert broke the tie by drilling a three-pointer. After two free throws from BYU guard Lexi Eaton, Golen hit her second three of the night and ninth of the year to bring Harvard’s lead to four. She has missed just one three-point attempt so far this season.
After Golen forced a turnover from guard Ashley Garfield, Lippert sealed the win with two foul shots. The senior recorded her first double-double of the season and fourth of her career, with 10 rebounds and 15 points.
Junior guard Christine Clark led the Crimson in scoring with 18 points, going 8-for-16 in the paint and two-for-two in free throws. Sophomore Temi Fagbenle added 13 points in her first collegiate start at home.
All this action came after a sluggish first half. The Cougars took an early advantage, 8-4, in the first three-and-a-half minutes.
Harvard rallied over the rest of the half, trading off leads with its opponents. The teams headed back to the locker room with BYU up, 34-29.
Eaton and fellow Cougars’ guard Kim Beeston led their team’s offense in the first period, scoring a combined 22 points. Eaton was six-for-eight from the foul line.
“I like where we are, and I thought there were a lot of really good things at the end of the BYU game, but of course, it was disappointing to start the way we started,” Delaney-Smith said. “I didn’t expect this team to start slow, so I think that’s the work in progress we have going right now. Hopefully we start strong and finish strong and put the whole game together because we’re capable.”
Both the Crusaders and the Crimson seem ready for the obstacles that face the respective teams when they square off.
“They’re definitely the best team that we’re playing thus far,” said Holy Cross coach Bill Gibbons. “In my opinion, they have a very talented team, a very well coached team. This will be a big test for our girls, an early season test.”
According to Golen, Harvard will look to approach the game with the same competitive mindset that it brings to each matchup.
“We are definitely going in hungry, especially the seniors,” Golen said. “We lost to [the Crusaders] two years in a row...and we definitely don’t want to lose to them a third time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend you might not have recognized Harvard.
Thanks to the bitter rivalry, endless tailgates, disoriented alumni, overwhelming amounts of school pride, and thousands of people actually interested in football, Harvard seemed more like Blue Mountain State than the world’s most renowned University.
If you left after a boring first half filled with as much excitement as four years at Yale, shame on you. Here’s what you missed: an epic comeback, terrible cheerleader pushups, the loudest cheers emitted from Harvard students since they received their respective admittance letters, and a storming of the field reminiscent of Bunker Hill.
As if things couldn’t get any better, Twitter blew up with Harvard pride on Saturday following the victory. Here is what some of Harvard’s athletes had to say about the 129th meeting of The Game.
1) Ryan Delisle, a sophomore tight end, wanted to pass this along to his opponents:
“Go ahead. Take our coaches you will still lose. ‪#Crim12”
Indeed, looks like Coach Tony “Benedict Arnold” Reno and his band of defectors couldn’t get it done. Maybe next year Coach Murphy should offer a starting player or two just to keep things interesting.
2) Members of Yale’s coaching staff aren’t the only ones who fell short on Saturday. Apparently, Junior forward Alex Fallstrom also struggled in the aftermath of The Game.
“Can somebody call my wallet? ‪#cantfindit”
Tough. Have you tried leaving a voicemail for whoever picked it up?
3) Fallstrom’s teammate, sophomore forward Colin Blackwell, felt inspired by the packed stadium:
“After seeing the surplus of students attending ‪#TheGame it truly shows how big of a crowd we should get at every sporting event ‪#figureitout”
Seeing as the typical academic schedule allows for only one weekend that students can act like ESPN’s Game-Day Crew is on campus, this might be more difficult than any problem set for Math 55. Sounds like a potential thesis.
4) Sophomore offensive lineman Anthony Fabiano knew exactly how he wanted to celebrate his team’s big win:
“If I don't hear Die Young about 25 times tonight I'm gonna punch someone in the face”
Anthony and his teammates certainly deserved to make the most of the night like they were going to die young.
5) Finally, a tweet from shooting guard Laurent Rivard that basically sums up the entire weekend:
“Harvard > Yale ‪#nuffsaid”
Cue Ten Thousand Men of Harvard. Happy Thankgiving!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior linebacker Joshua Boyd has been named the 140th captain of Harvard football, the team announced at its annual awards banquet Monday night.
Boyd, who will return to the team next year as a fifth-year senior, becomes the third consecutive linebacker to hold the Crimson captainship. Alex Gedeon ’12 served as captain in 2011, while senior Bobby Schneider led the team this season.
“Following Bobby Schneider is no easy task, but it’s one I’m up for, and I can’t wait to get started,” Boyd said at the banquet.
Boyd, a Hyde Park, Mass. native, captained his high school football team as a senior and will now have the chance to undertake the same role in college.
“I am truly honored and humbled right now,” Boyd said. “I really want to thank each and every one of my teammates and coaches in the room right now. I love you all, and I thoroughly appreciate your belief in me. I promise I’m going to work my tail off, and I won’t let you down.”
Boyd led Harvard and was eighth in the Ivy League with 67 tackles this year, and he also forced two fumbles. The Crimson finished 8-2 and honored its seniors at its banquet two days after defeating Yale, 34-24, in the 129th edition of The Game.
“Like Bobby, [Josh] has a tremendous work ethic, he’s selfless, and he’s respected by everybody in the Harvard football program,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said at the banquet.
As a junior, Boyd only started five games after replacing injured linebacker Blaise Deal '12, but he nonetheless finished second on the team with 64 tackles and was named All-Ivy honorable mention.
Football captains are elected by members of the roster. An offensive player has not been chosen to hold the honor since Ryan Fitzpatrick '05 during the 2004 season.

Thanksgiving is a mere two days away. Swayed by the holiday spirit, Flyby has compiled a list of options for making it to the airport in one piece, so you can get home for family, turkey, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, etc.
 
The T: Cheap, reliable, and simple to navigate for the general populace. The T may be crowded, but it's functional, and a $2 fare will get you to the airport. According to the MBTA website, it's a 35 minute trip from Harvard to Logan. Just take the Red line from Harvard Square to South Station and catch the Silver Line to Logan. Not Bad. 
 
The UC Shuttle: This Thanksgiving the UC is debuting a new program, a shuttle service from Harvard to Logan for the express purpose of getting you home to the turkey! Tickets are available on the UC's website for $6 each. Rides should take 30 to 45 minutes, and leave from Lowell House every other hour from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m on Tuesday, Nov. 20.
 
TAXI!: They're here, they're there, they're everywhere. Call a cab or walk over to the taxi stand in front of the Cambridge Savings Bank. It might be a bit pricy (roughly $40), but you'll make it to the airport without having to worry about all those suitcases.
 
Walking: For the more adventurous among us, a hike to the holidays may be in order. According to Google Maps, it's only a 7.1 mile walk from Harvard to Logan Airport, and getting there should take a mere 2 hours and 21 minutes. Google Maps, however, provides a disclaimer along with it's directions: "Use caution—This route may be missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths." This might not be the best route for heavy packers or those afraid of sketchy streets, but hey, what a story to share around the Thanksgiving table.
 
Other ideas to play around with: friend with a car, horse drawn carriage, roller skates—the possibilities are endless. Whichever way you get to Logan, enjoy the break from dining hall food, seeing your high school friends, and some family time!

Although the screaming crowd, weeping Yalies, and mountains of booze might make you think otherwise, The Game wasn't the only thing that happened this weekend. Harvard teams came away with victories on other fronts as well.
 
Friday: Both Harvard's men's and women's basketball teams triumphed. The men swept Manhattan College, 79-45, and the women won a close game over Brigham Young University, 71-65.
 
The squash teams also performed well, crushing Boston College in dual 9-0 wins.
The men's and women's swimming and diving teams followed suit with strong wins over Columbia (192-108, 187-113).
The men's ice hockey team pulled off a surprising win against Cornell in their first road game, 4-1. Too bad the next day they lost to Colgate, 1-0.  At least it wasn't Yale...
 
Saturday: Aside from the all-important Game this Saturday, men's heavyweight crew also displayed some Harvard dominance. Harvard won both the freshman eight and varsity four races at the Foot of the Charles.
 
Sunday: Finally, despite losing two tough games to Bucknell and Brown in this year's Eastern Championships, men's water polo defeated MIT for a seventh-place finish. Though the Beavers tried, their dam couldn't hold back the Crimson tide.
Harvard students seem to only think about one game a year, and these teams could use some well-earned affection. So, good job! Now we can go back to not caring at all.
