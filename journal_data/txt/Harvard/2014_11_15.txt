“All Fall Down”
This psychosexual 1962 trip stars the young and beautiful Warren Beatty as a womanizing delinquent who captures the hearts of repressed suburban Key West women of all ages. Idolized by his brother Clinton and in a very weird place with his parents (screen legends Karl Malden and Angela Lansbury), Beatty decides to seduce his bro’s crush to tragic results. An early work by John Frankenheimer, who later went on to make equally uncomfortable family dramas like “The Manchurian Candidate” and “Seconds,” the piece bubbles with the youthful sexuality that would explode later in the decade. Line up early, as the incomparable Lansbury will be at the screening to talk to the crowd about her six-decade career! Also notable: Beatty and the female protagonist of Kanye West’s similarly-titled “All Falls Down” have a staggering amount of personality overlap.

“KEYCHANGE” 
KeyChange, Harvard’s self-titled “blackapella” group, presents its fall concert, a collection of hits spanning the diverse history of the African diaspora from Ray Charles to hip hop (props for taking on wildly disparate musical stylings, soloist Aaron L. Gravely ’13). The intimate Lowell Lecture Hall is a fitting locale for the group’s tight neo-soul-tinged harmonies. The Arts Blog’s in-depth investigative team has determined that the group may be singing some songs from Béyonce’s self-titled fifth album (i.e., every promotional material for the event is in the same shade of violet-pink that colors Queen Bey’s name on the album cover).

“Concert II”
This minimalistically-titled event by the Bach Society Orchestra, one of Harvard’s most prolific chamber ensembles, features (no Bach, ironically) the overture to Mozart’s “Let It Be” (“La Clemenza di Tito,” which he started before his “Abbey Road,” the far more iconic “The Magic Flute”) and Grieg’s pastoral “Peer Gynt” suite. For more modern kicks, the group is offering “4 Encores for Stan,” a recently-premiered tribute to the Minnesota Orchestra’s music director emeritus Stanislaw Skrowaczewski composed by local Macarthur genius, Pulitzer Prize winner, and groovy dude John H. Harbison ’60.
Paine Hall, 8 p.m.
“November Resonance Poetry Night” 
The Advo presents a night with world-famous Harvard-centric poets Christina Davis, Briggs Copeland lecturer Josh Bell, Peter Gizzi, and Chris Hosea. Davis, who also serves as the curator of Lamont’s least fascist and most comfortable study space, the Woodberry Poetry Room, recently published “An Ethic,” a collection of minimalist meditations on loss—will she read from this somber collection or her more referential work from earlier in the decade? And what will Gizzi read from the recently published retrospective of his work from 1987-2011? Early work? Recent work? Work that isn’t even in the retrospective? What is advertised as a “cozy” night of poetry has an awful lot of unknowns.

“Sweeping Horizons”
The Newton Choral Society rolls through Sanders to offer a performance of Ralph Vaughan William’s prodigious 1910 “Sea Symphony,” a star-making work that brought the young composer to the fore of modernist symphonic music through its liberal use of voice and narrative. “A Passage to India,” the E.M. Forster-inspired climactic movement, is a whirlwind soundtrack through the colonial proclivities of Edwardian England. If you’re more nostalgic for summer days at Revere Beach (take the Blue Line to Wonderland) than institutionalized oppression, check out the second movement, “Alone on the Beach at Night,” which includes the shattering refrain “A vast similitude interlocks all / All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets.”
Sanders Theatre, 3 p.m.
“Players” 
Alice Abracen ’15 is already a theater mainstay in the Harvard arts community—last year, her direction of Julius Caesar received high marks from Crimson Arts czar Jude D. Russo ’17. She has now written a war polemic set in an unnamed conflict-ridden city. Amidst the chaos, a director tries to get his old friends back together for a production of “A Midsummer’s Night Dream.” The play, which also features the directorial efforts of veteran auteur Lelaina E. Vogel ’15, is an intriguing cross between an Orwellian sociological hellscape and an Apatowian midlife crisis farce.
Adams Pool Theatre, 8 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after recording a season-high six goals against No. 8 Boston College, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team showed no signs of letting up Friday night, cruising to a 6-2 victory over Brown at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Behind two goals from both sophomore forward Tyler Moy and junior forward Brian Hart, the Crimson (3-0-2, 2-0-2 ECAC) moves into a tie for second in the conference, extending its unbeaten streak to five games—its longest such run since the 2011-2012 season.
“We came out with so much energy and skated so hard,” junior co-captain Max Everson said. “Guys were ready from the drop of the puck, and with our team’s speed, we get after teams like [Brown]. I think we can surprise people, and I think that’s what we did.”
The Harvard offense was firing on all cylinders, doing the majority of its damage against the Bears (1-3-0, 0-3-0) on special teams. The Crimson notched three power play goals in the contest, raising its success rate on the man advantage this season to 33.3 percent—the best mark in the ECAC.
Hart and junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo recorded the first two power play goals, but the third came courtesy of an unfamiliar source. Entering Friday with 68 games at Harvard under his belt but no goals to show for it, Everson put an end to that drought, lighting the lamp for the first time as a member of the Crimson.
Midway through the third period with Harvard leading 4-1, Everson received a pass from sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson at the top of the left circle. With four skaters crowding Brown goaltender Tyler Steel, the co-captain fired a wrist shot into the traffic, and the puck squirted its way into the back of the net.
“It’s a big monkey off the back,” Everson said. “It feels like it’s been a long time coming, but it feels great. [It] wasn’t the prettiest goal, but hey, I’ll take it.”
In addition to capitalizing on the power play, the Crimson also created its share of chances on the kill. Not only did Harvard hold Brown scoreless on its four power play opportunities, but it also created several odd-man rushes of its own—one resulting in a goal from Moy.
At the 14:21 mark of the first period, sophomore center Alexander Kerfoot began the attack, working his way out of his own end along the left wing. The sophomore then dropped off a pass for junior defenseman Patrick McNally.
With two Bears’ defensemen fast approaching, McNally elected to send one more pass to the right—this one to a wide-open Moy. The sophomore capitalized, burying a shot into the right side of the goal to put the Crimson up, 2-0.
The goal for Moy was his second of the contest, as the forward opened the scoring less than two minutes into the game. After receiving a pass from freshman forward Jake Horton in the attacking zone, the sophomore from San Diego, Calif. squeezed a shot through the pads of Steel to provide his side with an early lead.
“We’re playing faster, we’re moving the puck up the ice quicker, and we’re doing a better job in the offensive zone of getting everybody involved,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “We’re getting scoring by committee…so I think we’re spreading the offense out pretty [well].”
Brown got on the board 3:42 into the final frame, when senior forward Matt Harlow punched in a shot from inside the crease to cut the deficit to 4-1. But that would be as close as the Bears would get, as junior netminder Steve Michalek recorded 33 saves en route to his third victory of the season.
“Ultimately, your best penalty killer has to be your goalie, and I think it was tonight,” Donato said. “I think Steve made some important saves at key times in the game.”
Last season, Brown won both of its meetings with the Crimson, holding Harvard to just one goal over 120 minutes. With the team’s most recent victory, Everson acknowledged that the team is happy to turn the page.
“It’s great to get two points in our conference, and with [this] being an Ivy League [matchup], there was a little extra rivalry,” Everson said. “We always like to win those.”

Going In To Get It Out
Despite not having much of a height advantage inside, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s squad looked to pound the ball inside in the first half of its season opener against MIT. On seven of its first nine possessions, the Crimson went immediately into the paint, even as MIT stayed even with the No. 25 team in the country.
The Crimson rotated a plethora of weapons in the frontcourt, as five different forwards saw minutes and scored. Nonetheless, field goal percentage was certainly a struggle for captain Steve Moundou-Missi, who was a mere 3-for-8 from inside the paint.
For a long time, it wasn’t pretty. In fact, it remained a one-possession game with under 10 minutes in the first half. Nonetheless, Harvard’s arduous effort to go inside eventually paid dividends.
“That’s the way our offense is set up,” junior captain Siyani Chambers said. “Whoever has the open shot is going to take the open shot, but it really helps when our bigs get the ball inside because it opens up a lot on the perimeter.”
After continuously throwing the ball inside, the Engineers switched to a 2-3 zone to provide some help defense on the interior. As a result, senior Wesley Saunders began to penetrate the lane, finding Chambers twice in the first half for two of his four three pointers.
“Our interior is going to determine how well we shoot from the perimeter,” Amaker said. “If we can become what we should become, we will be a little tougher, stronger, and more efficient around the rim and will open things on the perimeter which will hopefully give us some open shots.”
Chambers of Secrets
It’s really not a secret anymore. Two years ago, few people, if any, knew the name Siyani Chambers. Following the loss of captain and point guard Brandyn Curry, Chambers was thrust into the spotlight as Harvard’s starting point guard.
But the Minnesota native had no trouble taking center stage. Chambers went on to become the Ivy League Rookie of the Year, winning the Ancient Eight and upsetting No. 3 seed New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Fast-forward two years. Chambers has been rated the 34th best player in the country by ESPN and has been nominated to the Bob Cousy Award Watch List for the third straight year for best point guard in the Nation.
Friday night, Chambers reminded fans of why he has quickly become a household name in college basketball. The captain was simply electric.
After missing his first jumper of the night, Chambers was perfect the rest of the first half. His first points of the night encapsulated everything that he has become for Amaker’s squad. The junior extended his defense to half court, stealing the ball and speeding up the court for the And-1, to give Harvard its first lead of the night.
“Siyani set the tone for us defensively,” Amaker said. “When other defenders see how hard he is working out there on the ball, it picks us up and brings more energy to our team.
Despite not hitting a single three pointer against MIT last season, Chambers was a perfect 4-for-4 from beyond the arc on Friday, pulling the trigger with no hesitation and daring the Engineers to extend their zone defense.
“I put a lot of work in during the offseason and during practice,” Chambers said of his success from downtown. “Give a lot of credit to Wes and the other guys, though, who were finding me when I was open.”
Don’t Wake A Sleeping Giant
While Harvard poured in 42 points in the first half, only five of those points could be attributed to senior Wesley Saunders. Saunders, who has led the Crimson in scoring the past two seasons, looked as if he could finish the game with no points and still be content.
A team-first mentality was evident in the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, who grabbed eight rebounds in the first half and dropped six dimes on the night, including a beautiful interior pass to senior Jonah Travis for a monster two-handed jam.
Despite a 15-point lead at the half, the game still felt close. The Engineers came out of the break firing and energetic, hoping to make a run and practically begging Saunders to take over the game. He did just that.
In a blur, Saunders poured in 10 points beating his man off the dribble with ease. The senior had no trouble getting to the exact spots on the floor that he wanted and, from there, was able to either hit his trademarked fade away off the spin or draw the foul.

After weeks of twiddling their thumbs and amusing themselves with passing and petty political happenings like the national midterm elections, Harvard students finally have the chance to engage something that matters: the Undergraduate Council presidential race.
When it comes to real change on campus, students look in awe to the omnipotent Council, which spent the past year heroically extorting a quarter million dollars in club funding from the University and sending out lots of emails with GIFs in them. (One of these things happened.)
Okay, so maybe the UC doesn’t always deliver. But what it lacks in substance it makes up for in scandal. We imagine Olivia Pope has too busy a schedule to help out these Cantabrigian clients, so we took it upon ourselves to break the drama down for you.
FBpot Dome
The race began with a bang—but also with what was a false start. Candidates Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16  and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 and Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16 jumped the gun when they rushed to Facebook to upload photos in the hopes their good jokes and better looks would charm voters into signing their candidacy petitions. Turns out they weren’t allowed to share their faces with the online world until a later date, when campaigning had officially commenced. After learning of their own mistake, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal blew the whistle on Yang and Jackson for the same offense.
Maybe this display of governmental transparency stomped out the political fire before it spread—the UC Election Commission banned the candidates from campaigning for three days, but it doesn’t look like an trial of any sort is in the cards. Or maybe premature “likes” just don’t pack the same punch in the judiciary’s eyes as large cash gifts.
The Landrywinsky Affair
After this bang, one ticket exited the race with a whimper. Following a conversation with Goyal, candidates Michael J. Landry ’16 and Connor M. Harris ’16 abandoned their ambitions for office. Landry cited “Dhruv talking to us and not wanting us to screw up the vote” as a reason for dropping out, though Goyal has called the meeting “purely informational” and Landry and Harris have noted they consider Goyal a friend and do not see themselves as having been “forced out” of the election.
But just because a decision is consensual doesn’t mean it’s right. Is there an improper relationship here? We all know the right answer.
Watermarkgate
Much like Harvard basketball, UC election drama never stops. And so another day brought with it another scandal. Early Tuesday morning, sophomore ticket Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 replaced bulletins in every House dining hall except Leverett and Kirkland with watermarked copies. Their dastardly plot beganSaturday when they snatched the original bulletins to scan and doctor. Heine and Turban will face a whopping $15 in fines. We know of no plans for their resignation.
Watch out, Harvard, because according to Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18, these boys are “out of control.” And watch out again, because who knows what else besides watermarked advertisements of masters’ open houses Heine and Turban installed in our sacred meal spaces? Someone is always watching.
