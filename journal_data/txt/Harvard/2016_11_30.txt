After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The election was exhausting. Toxic. Acrimonious. Soul-crushing. So laughing with Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart and laughing at Kate McKinnon and Alec Baldwin playing absurd versions of Clinton and Trump on Saturday Night Live may have seemed like the best medicine. But might it actually have contributed to the toxicity, dividing the country still further?
Political satire goes as far back as Aristophanes in the fifth century BC, and it’s unlikely he invented it. Making fun of politicians doesn’t seem to have brought political life to a halt, in ancient Greece or in the modern era. But in the last decade, political satire has increasingly taken on two particularly dangerous characteristics. First, it has become increasingly partisan—a matter of attacking whole groups (Republicans, Democrats, liberals, Tea Partiers, and so on) rather than individuals (Tricky Dick, “I didn’t inhale”). Even worse—thanks to the 24-hour news cycle—it never, ever lets up.
Of course, the best political humor has a lot of truth to it. But a steady—or, unbalanced—diet of satire and caricature can foster illusion and distortion rather than insight and understanding. A caricature only imparts truth in comparison to the real thing. If we absorb nothing but the caricature, it no longer adds to our understanding of reality—it replaces it. Stereotypes in comedy can be used to undermine the validity of stereotypes in real life. But if we see nothing but ugly stereotypes battling each other on the screen, they can gain validity rather than losing it. If we only ever see the other side’s leaders as stupid and self-serving, we can only see their supporters as stupid and self-serving. Given that most modern American elections are pretty close, that’s a lot of people to write off.
We need to beware, too, of a culture of nonstop and unbounded insult. It may be our right as Americans to pile on the president and not give a damn if we hurt his—or in the future, her—feelings. But when we pile on all the people who voted for that president, that’s hurting tens of millions of people’s feelings. And they aren’t thick-skinned politicians, they’re regular people who don’t like being made fun of. When you keep hitting them, eventually they want to hit back. In an atmosphere like that, it will become increasingly impossible to get two sides even to agree what color a stop sign should be.
And in the long run, constantly laughing—or sneering—at the other side distracts us from the real task at hand. In a country with so many differences—and this will always be a country with many differences—we need to find ways to better understand and work with fellow citizens who have profoundly different views.
One reason we are at a stalemate in our political othering is that we have few tools for positively engaging others. We focus on offense, prejudice, and hate—but we don’t even have an ordinary word in our language for the feeling that some other group is indeed “other” but also that, at the same time, you’re glad they’re here sharing your town, your school, your company, or your country (the scholarly word is “allophilia”). Look at the university life around you. Look at the calls for funding from foundations and national research agencies. Look at your textbooks in psychology, sociology, and political science. You’ll see plenty of text about hate and anti-hate, but hardly a penny or a paragraph devoted to the study of joyful coexistence or affection in othering. Studies by myself and others typically find that over 30 percent of people have positive attitudes—not just tolerance—with curiosity, interest and respect for others. Yet it’s the haters and the hated who receive almost all the attention from social science and from policymakers.
Try an imaginative exercise. Overnight, everyone who voted for Trump disappears. No “Duck Dynasty.” No Sarah Palin. No Confederate flags. But it doesn’t stop there. I’m thinking of an acquaintance who’s been eager for years to be rid of Obama and, although he was bothered by Trump’s creepier qualities, couldn’t bear the thought of Hillary Clinton’s liberal presidency. Would this be a better country without him? Not when he and his wife are delivering Meals on Wheels. Not when he’s teaching neighborhood children aikido, a martial art that can only be used to defend yourself, never to attack anyone. And certainly not when he’s taking his wife three times a week to stroke rehab and befriending and supporting everyone in the very diverse group there. I don’t believe we’d all be better off without him and I don’t think we’d be better off when someone mocks him in public.
By definition, successful politicians are people who can work out a deal even with those who have mocked and opposed them publicly. And I’m not being sarcastic; that’s a real talent that most of us don’t have. The rest of us may need to laugh a bit less and treat each other a little more tenderly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Facebook was invented at Harvard, applicants to the University have long worried that it could keep them out.
In response to this fear, some students have hired businesses like Social Assurity to evaluate their social media presences for $125. Other students, however, have opted for the more expensive profile curation service, which can cost as much as $1,750.
Despite these extravagant expenditures, however, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 recently told The Crimson that admissions officers rarely consider applicants’ social media profiles. Further, when admissions officers look at these profiles, it is almost exclusively to applicants’ advantage, though Fitzsimmons declined to elaborate on the circumstances in which such an advantage would occur.
In light of the recently stated position of the Admissions Office, we hope that prospective applicants do not fall into the trap of unnecessary expenditures on services such as social media curation, which no 18 year-old should reasonably need. The hiring of social media consultants in the college admission process is a sure sign that it has become more competitive and life-consuming than ever, with applicants grasping for any potential edge.
Students applying to Harvard should not feel the need to make every part of their lives about admission to the college of their choice. The admission process is already disconcertingly stressful, and the fabrication of further needs such as social media curation will only heighten applicants’ anxiety. Students should continue to focus on presenting themselves to colleges as honestly as possible in their entire applications, rather than diverting their attention to their social media profiles.
Nevertheless, Fitzsimmons’ statement on the role of social media does not mean applicants should not exercise prudence in what they post online. The fact that admission officers do not typically look at social media profiles should reduce applicants’ stress levels, but not the judgement they use online. Fitzsimmons phrased his statement carefully in order to reserve admission officers’ right to peruse social media profiles, and though he emphasized cases in which social media might help applicants, his caution is noteworthy.
Ultimately, this articulation of policy is a credit Harvard's efforts to make admissions more transparent. In recent years, Fitzsimmons and the Admission Office have made important strides toward making admission to Harvard more accessible to people from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. Policy clarifications such as this one are important steps toward demystifying the admission process and leveling the playing field for all applicants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, the Harvard community received an email from President Drew Faust in which she communicated “clear and unequivocal support” for undocumented students on campus. Therein, she sought to “share information about related University resources and evolving plans.” The email, according to President Faust’s chief of staff Lars Madsen, was a direct outcome of a private meeting between President Faust and Harvard University students held on November 21 to discuss the University’s role in protecting undocumented students at Harvard in the aftermath of Donald J. Trump’s campaign victory.
As student organizers involved in drafting the student and faculty petition titled “Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard,” and as participants in meetings with Dean Rakesh Khurana and President Faust, we believe that the email does not adequately address the concerns expressed by members of the Harvard community. Specifically, President Faust and Dean Khurana have yet to issue a statement on Harvard’s status as a sanctuary campus or on the creation of a centralized office for undocumented students. While President Faust’s email signals towards the centralization of resources in some form, the University has yet to state how this would take shape, and we continue to advocate for a physical office where undocumented students and students from mixed-status families can go for support.
Declaring Harvard University as a sanctuary campus is more than a symbolic gesture, as it is a necessary step in reaffirming the University’s commitment to undocumented students and students from mixed-status families. Further, the administration full heartedly partook in the symbolic gesture of changing the title of “House Master” to “Faculty Dean” earlier this year, a change that was met with little other action to meet the needs of students of color on campus. President Faust herself has defended this decision, stating that “we need to be aware of language, actions that threaten, that undermine, that demean.” We agree with this sentiment and believe that the declaration of Harvard as a sanctuary campus is consistent with this goal, and as a result the University’s current apprehension with the use of the words “sanctuary campus” feels incongruous.
Declaring Harvard as a sanctuary campus would also stand as a denouncement of a heightened culture of xenophobia and bias that renders certain communities vulnerable, particularly undocumented students, students of color, LGBTQ students, and Muslim students. In addition to reaffirming the University's commitment against voluntary cooperation with federal immigration authorities including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol, Harvard's status as a sanctuary campus would also involve the University’s refusal to cooperate with any registration system that seeks to surveil and identify Muslim community members. We reject the notion that the desired label carries no substantive value and uphold our belief in the power of words to influence our community’s culture and collective identity.
While President Faust's "clear and unequivocal support" for undocumented students may inherently welcome a positive and comforting response at first glance, this support, if not mobilized into declaring Harvard a sanctuary campus and accompanied by the establishment of a centralized office, will remain but an empty gesture. Now, more than ever before, it is crucial to have the University provide concrete resources to its community members. We hereby call for a shift from private and last-minute meetings between students and the Harvard administration to open meetings where all stakeholders can voice their concerns.
Denying stakeholders decision-making power will only further dilute the administration's ability to be accountable to the nuanced worries felt by individuals in our community. For example, crucial topics relating to mental health and expanding Harvard's protection of undocumented students beyond DACA-mented students have been left unrecognized by the administration. President Faust’s currently ignores that not all undocumented students at Harvard are beneficiaries of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and that this population of students is particularly vulnerable to the imminent immigration policy changes already signaled by President-elect Trump. The Supreme Court’s January ruling on Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which upheld the Texas court’s ruling, was a blow to the undocumented community who looked forward to millions of parents gaining a small, yet meaningful protection. With the ruling upheld as a result of a deadlock, the prospect of President-elect Donald Trump nominating at least one Supreme Court Justice during his presidency is a terrifying prospect.
Given the growing hostile environment throughout the nation and even within the campus, the call made by undocumented students to increase mental health resources and counseling, as well as cultural competency trainings for all faculty, administrators, staff, and peer counselors who interact with undocumented students on a regular basis, is more important than ever and would proactively generate the “tolerant and inclusive” environment President Faust has expressed a desire to create.
Harvard University students were among the first to create a petition calling for clear and concrete protections for undocumented students after Trump became President-elect. While 28 other universities, including Columbia and Wesleyan University, have already declared themselves sanctuary campuses, Harvard University’s administration remains unwilling to take the first step necessary towards creating a more welcoming and protective space for undocumented students. Moving forward, we call upon the University to proceed with a greater measure of transparency and to respond to our petition, endorsed by over 4,000 Harvard affiliates, including faculty, students and alumni, no later than December 6, as initially requested at the November 17 meeting between College administrators and student representatives.
We believe future actions by the University must involve more than comforting words and conversations that end with promises of more conversation. With regards to an office space, we write with an awareness that Harvard was the last Ivy to establish a BGLTQ office when it opened in 2011, and was years behind peer institutions in establishing a Women’s Center, which opened in 2006. This is not to mention the continued absence of a multicultural center or even an ethnic studies department that would go a long way toward creating physical and intellectual spaces in which students can develop and experience a better understanding of the increasingly heterogeneous world around them. Despite our disappointment with our administration’s unwillingness to recognize the importance of the points outlined in our petition, we recognize the unique opportunity we have at hand to become a leader in establishing an office for undocumented students. By leading instead of following, we can do things differently this time around. Many of our futures depend on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We love making fun of the basic bitch. She is so easy to ridicule—after all, she wears leggings and Uggs, listens to Taylor Swift, drinks pumpkin spice lattes, enjoys shopping at Sephora, and has Pinterest boards filled with fitness routines and bedroom decorating ideas. She seeks contentment in pumpkin patches, colorful stationery, home decor, and inspirational quotes about inner beauty and tranquility juxtaposed against images of beaches and sunsets. Can you imagine? She probably even scrapbooks.
And the basic bitch is always a woman. It is not a coincidence that there is no male equivalent to the basic bitch. The term “f**kboy,” a commonly used pejorative term for men, refers to sexually coercive men who treat women as objects for their pleasure. The female equivalent for a f**kboy, therefore, isn’t a basic bitch but rather a slut or a whore. The f**kboy is ridiculed for his misogynistic treatment of women; the basic bitch is ridiculed for her love of holiday drinks and yoga pants.
There is no vapid and air-headed male stereotype who is unoriginal in his embrace of all things masculine. Society does not derive the same level of pleasure from ridiculing men for lifting weights at the gym, posing with freshly-caught fish, and waxing eloquent about their cars—even though a quick glance at Tinder shows me that these kinds of men are in no short supply. Somehow, it’s much more enjoyable to make fun of the women who go to SoulCycle, drink green juice, and experiment with makeup.
Why? Because fishing, hunting, lifting weights, and tricking out your car are all seen as hobbies of importance. They require real technical skill and expertise. They are valid interests. Practicing yoga, decorating your home, and applying makeup, on the other hand, all seem like frivolous and vapid ways to spend your time. Women who are interested in these activities, and even women who become so good at them that they are able to build careers from their talent and hard work, are nevertheless dismissed as shallow and stupid. After all, common logic goes, how hard can it be to create a winged eyeliner look or hold your body in contorted poses for long periods of time?
Furthermore, when women perform traditionally masculine activities like fishing and hunting, they often appear sexier to the heterosexual male gaze. A quick Google search of “girls who fish” reveals many images of scantily-clad women posing with hunting and fishing paraphernalia in sexually provocative ways. However, men who derive enjoyment from traditionally feminine hobbies, such as Pilates or makeup, are derided as effeminate or “gay.” A search of “guys wearing makeup” does not yield images of shirtless men posing with eye shadow palettes in ways that are intended to titillate women—instead, it yields debates about whether or not wearing makeup as a man is embarrassing or makes them “drag queens or carnival clowns.”
This pattern is replicated throughout all facets of society: for example, traditionally masculine names like Riley, Blake, and Drew are seen as popular and edgy choices for baby girls, and women with those names are often perceived as sexier; however, there has not been a single instance of a traditionally feminine name, like Brittany or Clara, that has been deemed appropriate, much less sexually attractive, for a man. We see this with clothing, too: Sweatshirts and dark solid prints are simultaneously gendered masculine and gender-neutral; when women wear their boyfriend’s clothing, it is perceived as not only appropriate but even alluring. However, sundresses, off-the-shoulder tops, bright floral patterns are strictly gendered feminine, and men who wear these styles are often subject to ridicule and homophobic violence, such as the male teenager who was "chopped and stabbed" to death for wearing female clothing.
The systematic devaluation of femininity in our society is not only deeply patronizing but also actively upholds gender inequality. For example, professions dominated by women or even perceived as “women’s work” are routinely paid less—and when women start to take over a male-dominated field, the pay drops simply because female labor is not valued as highly. And some female-dominated occupations, such as teaching kindergarten, are not even considered part of the work force, according to people like Donald Trump Jr. Most of the unpaid and “invisible labor” in the world, such as childcare and household management, is performed by women. Female writers are often belittled as “mommy bloggers” or producers of “chick lit,” and female scientists are considered mere “distractions” in the laboratory.
And even I have been dismissed by peers and other readers for “writing a sex column,” essentially telling me that these articles about feminism and sexual violence which I take care to write well and research thoroughly, are nothing more than the vapid prattling of a young woman giving tips about proper blowjob technique. I have even been patronized for my secondary in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, my male peers dismissing my dense gender theory readings as “brain candy” and “fluff.”
The problem, therefore, is not only that activities are arbitrarily ascribed “masculine” or “feminine,” but also that activities ascribed as “feminine” are necessarily seen as inferior, weak, and frivolous. When we make fun of the “basic bitch” for drinking lattes and wearing leggings, we are looking down on femininity and expressions thereof. And when women’s interests and activities are dismissed as frivolous, women themselves are dismissed as frivolous. Gender equality and women’s empowerment will require more than a breakdown of traditional gender roles—it will demand a fundamental cultural shift in the way we view and value femininity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 29, 2016, at 11:53 p.m.
Top Donald Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon will no longer attend an Institute of Politics event about the 2016 presidential campaign this week, according to a Kennedy School spokesperson.
Bannon, a 1985 Business School graduate, was listed among other journalists and election strategists from the Hillary Clinton and Trump campaigns slated to appear at the IOP’s post-election event “Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 2016.” The event kicks off Wednesday and runs through Thursday evening.
Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, wrote in an email Tuesday that he “heard this afternoon from his office that [Bannon’s] schedule has changed.” Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel said he did not know the reason why Bannon was no longer scheduled to attend.
Bannon was the former executive chair of Breitbart News, a media outlet that has been associated with white nationalist, anti-feminist, and anti-immigrant beliefs.
In anticipation of his appearance, about 1,000 people indicated in a Facebook event they would attend a protest of Bannon’s attendance on Wednesday.
“Trump brought racist ideologues into the mainstream,” the Facebook event description of the protest reads. “By treating this situation as normal, Harvard is normalizing what Bannon stands for. We do not accept hate and bigotry as normal or legitimate.”

In prepared remarks Kennedy School Dean Doug W. Elmendorf had planned to deliver at the event’s opening on Wednesday, Elmendorf wrote that Harvard’s decision to invite guests does not constitute an endorsement of their views.
“Some guests who were invited to this event have already spurred strong reactions from members of our community,” Elmendorf wrote in his remarks. “We invite people who have significantly influenced events in the world even if their actions or words are abhorrent to some members of our community or are in conflict with the values of the Kennedy School itself.”
Protests will proceed despite Bannon’s absence at the event, according to Zachary Lown, an activist with the Boston-based group Attorneys for Racial Justice who was one of the initial organizers of the protest. Lown said the rally he is helping to organize will take place outside of the Kennedy School tomorrow at 5 p.m.
“These policies and this message that Trump ran on and that was formulated by his key advisers, including many of the people who are still slated to come to the event, is going to continue,” Lown said. “And our goal from the outset was to say that we don’t accept this process of normalization.”
Several other Trump advisers are slated to attend the event, including senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and transition spokesperson Hope Hicks.
Lown said the coalition behind the protest—which includes activist groups from across the Boston area such as the Boston NAACP, Massachusetts Peace Action, and Boston Feminists—hopes to use the protest to launch a broader political movement against Trump’s administration.
A group of students from across Harvard’s graduate schools are planning to protest Bannon’s appointment, although the group did not object to Harvard inviting Bannon to speak on campus, Kennedy School student Shanoor Seervai, a protest organizer, said. The group will join the protest organized by Boston-area activist groups tomorrow.
Isaac R. Blumfield, an organizer for IfNotNow Boston—the local branch of a national group advocating for “American Jewish institutions to end their support for the occupation” of Palestine—said the group intended to continue with a separate protest they planned as part of a national day of action.
“As you might have seen, we've had a bunch of actions already about Bannon's appointment, and we want to continue to send the message to institutions like Harvard that they can't continue to normalize white supremacy and anti-semitism by continuing to invite him and accept him,” Blumfield wrote in a statement.
Before the protests planned this week, more than 1,000 female Business School alumni signed a letter published in the New York Times last week denouncing Bannon. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Lizabeth Cohen also joined several presidents of women’s colleges in penning an open letter condemning Bannon’s appointment to a top role in Trump's White House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 30, 2016, at 11:26 a.m.
Some Harvard professors have questioned Law School professor Lawrence Lessig’s call for the Electoral College to cast their ballots for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton instead of President-elect Donald Trump.
Although Trump, the Republican candidate, won the election by 74 Electoral College votes, Lessig argued in a Nov. 24 op-ed for the Washington Post that the Electoral College should vote for Clinton because of her roughly 2 million vote lead in the popular vote. The Electoral College will formally vote in mid-December. 
Lessig said the Electoral College—acting as a “safety valve on the people’s choice”—should upend “conventional wisdom” and more than two centuries of tradition to cast their votes for the former secretary of state.
He further argued the Electoral College has a responsibility to enact the “will of the people,” which he defined as electing the winner of the popular vote based on “one of the most important principles governing our democracy—one person, one vote.”
The only exception, according to Lessig, is if the people have gone “crazy” and chosen a candidate outside “the bounds of reasonable judgement.”
“In this election, the people did not go crazy,” he wrote. “The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation.”
Lessig concluded that electors should not “veto the people’s choice,” and are obliged to elect Clinton as the next president, calling it “an insult to our framers” to suggest that the Constitution requires electors this year to vote for a candidate who did not win the popular vote.
His ideas have stirred debate in academic circles about the responsibilities and purpose of the Electoral College. Some professors on campus have criticized his proposal.
“It is a massively stupid idea,” Government professor Theda R. Skocpol wrote in an email.
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman also wrote in an email that he does not support Lessig’s argument. Although he said he believes electing Clinton would be constitutional, doing so would be a violation of an “unwritten understanding that has prevailed for two centuries.”
“Democracy requires that both sides play by a common set of rules, many of which are unwritten,” Klarman wrote. “And one of those rules in our society is that we have a popular vote, within each state, which determines how that state’s electoral votes are cast. Democrats shouldn’t abandon that rule just because they lost.”
Law School professor and constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe '62 wrote in an email that he agreed, to some extent, with Lessig, but wrote that "eliminating the electoral college would remove that important safeguard against electing someone who would endanger the constitution."
Lessig, who did not respond to an email request for comment, declared his own bid for the Democratic nomination for president in September 2015—running on a platform of campaign finance reform. He dropped out from the race nearly two months later after failing to qualify for the early primary debates.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: November 30, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe '62 disagreed with Lessig. While Tribe said the electoral college is important for safeguarding against someone who could endanger the constitution, he did agree that "electors are free to vote their conscience."

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith has released five years of undergraduate survey results to every voting member of the Faculty “to further inform” an upcoming debate on a College policy that penalizes members of final clubs and Greek organizations.
The results, compiled in a 158-page PDF document, were comprised of “all responses from the freshman, senior, and House life surveys that include the words final club, fraternity, and/or sorority from academic year 2010 to the present,” according to a Nov. 21 email from Smith obtained by The Crimson. The anonymized student responses are largely critical of Harvard’s social atmosphere and final clubs in particular, though a number of responses praise the clubs, fraternities, and sororities.

The release of the survey results comes before an expected December vote on a piece of faculty legislation opposing the policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021 will bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups, team captaincies, and College endorsement for top fellowships like the Rhodes and Marshall. The motion, first filed in May, states that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
The motion’s supporters say an affirmative Faculty vote would strike down the College policy. Administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have not directly indicated the impact of a successful motion. Faust has said, however, that the sanctions could be subject to change after consultation with faculty members.
“As the voting members of the Faculty are now asking to fully engage on this set of issues, they too need access to this data to have an informed discussion,” Smith wrote in his Nov. 21 email. Smith, through FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, declined to comment beyond his email to Faculty.
While survey responses varied considerably, many were sharply critical of final clubs and urged administrators to curb their influence on campus.
“The presence of Final clubs on campus is socially cancerous,” reads one response attributed to a senior male. “It bifurcates the social scene in a most undesirable way and provides a haven for sexual assault on campus.”
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, an opponent of the College’s policy, said he could not recall the release of similar survey results ahead of other FAS votes. Thomas said he found the documents “fairly raw, and quite frankly I didn’t have time to read 150 PDFs, so I didn’t get that far through.”
“Again, it’s a bunch of anecdotes, there’s some ambiguity,” said Thomas, who added that despite opposing the policy he would “be perfectly happy for the final clubs to die out.”
History professor Andrew D. Gordon, who has expressed dissatisfaction with both the policy and the motion opposing it, wrote in an email that he “cannot recall a time when this sort of information has been shared.”
“I only skimmed the reports, it was a massive amount of information,” Gordon wrote. “Those I read certainly confirmed my view that the final clubs create a very problematic atmosphere on campus.”
While supporters of the policy have lauded it as a step toward creating a more welcoming social environment on campus, detractors, like former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, have argued the policy could create “a College culture of fear and anxiety about nonconformity.” Lewis, one of the original signatories to the motion that Faculty could vote on at their next meeting on Dec. 6, has also raised concerns that administrators did not properly consult the Faculty before crafting the policy.
The Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body, will set the agenda for the Dec. 6 meeting at their meeting Wednesday.

Chao, a Taiwanese immigrant who received her MBA from the Business School in 1979, served as the Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush. She was the first Asian American woman and the first Taiwanese American in U.S. history to occupy a cabinet position.
As Transportation Secretary, Chao would likely play a key role in implementing Trump’s infrastructure development plans, which the President-elect has called a priority for his first 100 days in office. She served on Trump’s Asian Pacific Advisory Committee during the final weeks of the presidential campaign.
She also serves as chair of the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Foundation, named for her mother. In 2012, James S.C. Chao—Elaine Chao’s father—and the family foundation donated $40 million to the Business School, most of which supported the construction of the Ruth Mulan Chao Center, which houses the Business School's executive education program, meeting places, dining areas, and offices.
Elaine Chao attended and spoke at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the building in June, accompanied by her husband and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and younger sister Angela Chao. Other notable public figures attending included Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, along with University President Drew G. Faust. The Chao Center is the first building at the Business School named after a woman and person of Asian American descent.
Three of Elaine Chao’s five sisters also attended the Business School. According to an HBS press release, the Chaos are the only family in history to have four daughters attend the Business School.
Chao was a White House fellow under Ronald Reagan and the director of the Peace Corps under President George H.W. Bush, who also selected her as Deputy Transportation Secretary.
“We are pleased to learn of Elaine Chao’s appointment as Secretary of Transportation,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in an emailed statement. “Having devoted so much of her personal life to public service, she exemplifies the School’s mission of educating leaders who make a difference in the world. We wish her great success in this new role.”
Pending her acceptance of the nomination, Chao would join fellow Business School alumnus Stephen K. Bannon in Trump’s administration. Bannon's appointment as Trump's chief strategist has drawn criticism from Harvard affiliates, including Business School alumni and the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

The vote count for Harvard’s historic student union election will stretch into December, as University officials and union organizers worked through challenged ballots on Tuesday and will reconvene on Friday to continue sorting through the challenges.
As a result, ballot boxes with student votes have remained sealed for nearly two weeks since the mid-November voting period, which is standard protocol until all of the questions surrounding challenges are resolved. The election is being supervised by the National Labor Relations Board.
Votes are challenged at the time of the election and set aside if there are questions about voter eligibility, whether the voter submitted their ballot at an unassigned location, or whether the ballot matches the name on the list of eligible voters for a given location. Approximately 3,500 graduate and undergraduate students were eligible to vote in the election, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall.
While hundreds of the estimated 1,000 challenges have been resolved, more challenges remain to work through, according to the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers’ Facebook page.
“We’re making progress, but it’s slow,” NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord said. “We’re hopeful that we might be able to do something later in the week, but not before Friday at the earliest.”
The same post on the HGSU-UAW’s Facebook page confirmed that organizers will return to the NLRB’s Boston office on Friday to resume the work.
The count could extend into next week, as graduate and undergraduate student teaching and research assistants at Columbia head to voting booths for their Dec. 7 and 8 union union election. Like Harvard's union effort, Columbia’s graduate student union effort is affiliated with the United Auto Workers.
In an email sent Nov. 23 to eligible voters, Director of Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote, “Because this is the first such election, the number of challenge ballots is not surprising.”
“The University respects the votes cast by students in this consequential election and, along with many others across our community, we are committed to ensuring that the ballots of all eligible voters are counted,” Curran wrote.
Harvard is the first university to hold an election after the NLRB ruled in August that teaching and research assistants are employees under labor law, and entitled to collective bargaining rights.

Neurobiologists at Harvard Medical School have discovered the first link between a bone growth gene and cognitive functioning in humans and nonhuman primates.
The findings, from a study released earlier in November, are linked to understanding human evolution, the development of the human brain, and cognitive diseases, according to co-first authors on the study Bulent Ataman and Gabriella L. Boulting, who are research fellows in neurobiology at the Medical School.
Ataman started the study in 2011, building off research that had been done for many years with senior investigator Michael E. Greenberg, a professor of neurobiology and the current chair of the Medical School’s neurobiology department. The study indicates that osteocrin is the first gene to undergo genetic repurposing in the human brain. The role that osteocrin plays in human brain development distinguishes the human brain from that of what is typically studied in mice, according to the researchers.
“It’s important because it gives us insight into how the brain has evolved over time,” Greenberg said. “This provides good evidence that it involves mutations within regulatory reasons called enhancers. It has this capacity in a very basic way to start a new research area that allows us to understand the special features of human brain development that occur in response to sensory input or experience. Basically, if you want to understand human brain function, you can’t study it just in the mouse.”
Furthermore, the gene osteocrin has been linked to an intellectual disability, which leads the team to believe that it may be key in understanding cognitive dysfunction in humans, according to Greenberg.
Their research did not start with examining osteocrin directly, but rather understanding gene transcription and the response of human neurons to sensory experience, said the researchers, because the genomes of rodents and other animals cannot always accurately model cognitive brain disorders affecting humans.
Boulting said the original hypothesis was that there may be "fundamental differences between the way human neurons work and develop and integrate with each other" as compared to neurons used to model diseases in different organisms.
“We wanted to understand if those were readily detectable just by simply stimulating the human neurons and looking at which genes were being used in reaction to that stimulation and then comparing those genes with the same treatment of mouse neurons and rat neurons,” Boulting said.
The team intends to use their findings to examine how osteocrin affects the nervous system from “beginning to end,” according to Ataman.
“We have reason to think that there are others and one goal for the future is to identify other genes that maybe function like osteocrin but in a somewhat different way, selectively in a primate or maybe specifically human brain and figure out what they do,” Greenberg said.

UPDATED: December 2, 2016, at 1:45 p.m.
Four professors debated the First Amendment implications of the College’s plan to penalize members of single-gender social organizations on Tuesday, reframing a controversial campus issue in constitutional terms.
The debate, co-hosted by the Harvard Federalist Society and the American Constitution Society, drew notable professors like Randall L. Kennedy, graduate board members of all-male final clubs such as the Porcellian and Fly clubs, and scores of undergraduates and Law students.
The issue in question—a College policy first announced in May, which starting with the Class of 2021, would bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups and College endorsement for prized fellowships—was cast in constitutional terms by moderator and President of the National Constitution Center Jeffrey M. Rosen ’86, who framed the debate “in terms of core First Amendment values instead of legal First Amendments rights” because private universities, unlike public universities, are not formally bound by the First Amendment.
David L. Howell, a professor of Japanese history, and Diane L. Rosenfeld, a lecturer at the Law School and founding director of the Gender Violence Program, argued in favor of the constitutionality of the policy at the debate, while computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and visiting Harvard Law professor Sanford V. Levinson argued the sanctions violated First Amendment values.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who led efforts to craft the policy, declined to participate due to scheduling conflicts, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
To determine the debate’s winner, Rosen anonymously polled the crowd both before and after the debate. At the outset, 69 percent of the audience voted that they thought the sanctions violated First Amendment values. After the debate that majority grew to 82 percent in favor of Lewis and Levinson’s argument.
“The spirit of the First Amendment is that sometimes individuals get together for reasons that the governing authority does not like,” Lewis, a vocal opponent of the policy, said in his opening statement. “The First Amendment expresses confidence that in the long run, we’re all better off letting people exercise that freedom of association, like their freedoms of speech and religion.”
In his opener, Howell argued that because unrecognized single-gender social organizations are “for all practical purposes” College student organizations and incapable of existing apart from the College, “withholding certain privileges” from members does not violate core First Amendment values.
“[Unrecognized organizations] should be subject to the same rules that govern those that are recognized by the College,” Howell said. “At the core of those rules is the principle of inclusion.”
He added that all applicants to the College apply with an understanding of the College's policies.
“Choosing to attend Harvard therefore requires acquiescing to the core values that govern community life at the College,” he said.
Levinson took issue with what he referred to as the “tremendously overbroad” breadth of the policy, arguing that including female clubs and sororities in the sanctions would not meaningfully decrease instances of “male violence against females” that the sanctions were meant to target.
Rosenfeld agreed, calling the inclusion of women’s groups in the policy “problematic.” Nevertheless, she said the policy was both necessary and justified.
“It might have found a finer brush with which to paint this picture, but if you’re trying to get at sexual assault at final clubs and get at the hostile environments that often are perpetuated within an exclusive all-male environment… I believe that [the sanctions] are a fair regulation,” she said.
After the debate, Rosen said that though he has “no personal thoughts on the issue whatsoever,” he enjoyed hearing both sides of the topic.
“We were looking for pressure points of free speech and debate on campuses across America and we saw the debate about the Harvard policy and thought that this would be a great place to launch the series,” Rosen said.
Rosenfeld said she thought that issues brought up during the debate would help advance dialogue on campus.
“I thought it was an interesting opportunity to talk about the issues,” Rosenfeld said.
In discussing her side’s loss, Rosenfeld drew attention to what she described as the “kind of surprising” demographic make-up of the crowd, especially the "older, white men that were not part of the Law School or campus community.”
Since its announcement, the College’s policy has faced vocal opposition from national Greek organizations, national media organizations, and certain members of Harvard’s faculty, despite receiving support from coaches, administrators, and other Harvard affiliates.
A recent Crimson survey of undergraduates found that 53 percent of surveyed undergraduates hold an unfavorable view of the policy. A similar poll in this year’s Undergraduate Council elections found 60 percent of students opposed the sanctions.

UPDATED: December 6, 2016, at 9:56 a.m.
Tyler V. Jenkins ’19 found himself in a peculiar position during the presidential election cycle. Although he did not support President-elect Donald Trump’s bid for the White House, the Martinsburg, W. Va., native said he found himself frequently defending supporters of the business mogul to peers at Harvard.
“The way that Trump supporters were seen on this campus, I think, was not constructive at all... We never asked why,” he said. “I’ve defended quite a bit of Trump supporters even though I completely disagree with them.”
Many students who hail from states that voted for the Republican candidate echoed Jenkins’s sentiments. When Trump became the President-elect, some Harvard students reported disbelief at his victory. But students from Trump-supporting areas said they feel torn between a dejected campus and a vastly different reality at home, where many of their friends and family members celebrated Trump’s win.
Regardless of their political views, students from these areas stressed the importance of open dialogue about the election. Supporters of both candidates said they are disheartened that friends from home and school have ignored or been unwilling to listen to different perspectives. For these students, dealing with a politically polarized country in the aftermath of the election has come with new challenges.
UNDERSTANDING THE TRUMP VOTE
Some students from states that voted for Trump said they were able to understand why people in their home regions voted for the candidate, even if they disagreed with the decision.
Several students attributed Trump’s victory to dire economic situations in many regions of the United States.
Jenkins said most of his friends back home supported the New York tycoon because they believed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s economic and environmental policies would hurt the local coal industry. Jenkins said the election comes at a time when West Virginia’s economy is struggling.
“We lose a major coal company almost every month to bankruptcy,” he said. “Every time they go bankrupt, people lose their jobs… People who are retired lose their pensions. And that was basically a lot of these people’s only source of income to pay medical bills, to pay for their food… to these people, it’s literally life or death.”
Jenkins said Trump’s promises of economic revival attracted many West Virginians. The Republican nominee ended up winning the state by a 42-point margin.
“When Donald Trump comes in and he says… ‘we’re going to make coal great again,’ these people have nothing and they’re looking and they see hope with a man like Donald Trump,” he said.
Trevor A. Mullin ’17, originally from Caro, Mich., said he personally understood the economic concerns of Trump supporters. Mullin said his area was greatly affected by the 2008 economic recession and has struggled to recover since. Trump won Michigan by a 0.3 percent margin, but now former Green Party Presidential candidate Jill E. Stein ’72-73 has spearheaded a recount initiative in the state.
“Looking at the past eight years, people in my area have kind of felt neglected by the system. 2008 really hit a lot of rural areas pretty hard,” he said. “Both my parents owned a business and basically that all dried up, and for a lot of small communities there wasn’t a lot of opportunity there.”
Nevertheless, Mullin said he does not believe that Trump’s rhetoric or policies will help solve economic issues in the region.
“Coming where I come from, yes, my family was very much affected by the recession in 2008, are we where we were prior to that anymore? No. But do I think that open hatred, closed borders are going to solve those issues? No, not at all,” he said.
Others said Trump attracted voters in their areas with a new set of political priorities.
William F. Morris '17-'18 said he was a “proud” Bernie Sanders supporter in his home state of Georgia but could also see how Trump appealed to local concerns. Trump won the state by a 5.7 percent margin.
“He appeals to nationalism and populism in a way we haven’t seen since World War II,” he said. “I always call him anti-Obama in the sense that he promises change but in a very different way than Obama did.”
Sophia M. Kaufman ’18, from Charleston, W. Va., said Trump represented an option for political change for many people in her home state.
“A lot of the rhetoric that has come out of West Virginia that is very pro-Trump has been really hurtful and racist and ignorant, but at the same time a lot of those people that are voting for Trump are really in need,” she said. “I just feel like they needed a new option that was pretty anti-establishment.”
Alina G. Muñoz ’18, who hails from Staten Island, N.Y., voted for Trump. She said she voted for the Republican candidate along with many of her family members because she believes his campaign emphasized a strong work ethic. Although Clinton won New York State, Trump won Staten Island by a 16.8 percent margin.  National media outlets, including the New York Times and Politico, reported that traditionally blue-collar Republican voters on the island embraced the Queens native as a hometown hero.
“I voted for Trump and my family all did,” she said. “Pretty much how my family decided who we want to vote for was who really advocates hard work.”
BEWILDERED ON CAMPUS AND AT HOME
Despite their understanding of Trump supporters, many students also reported feeling detached from either their campus or home environments after the election.
Sara A. Atske ’17, a student from South Dakota, said she felt devastated by the election, in which her home state voted for Trump by nearly a 30 percent margin. Coming from a  Muslim American family, she said she found it upsetting that people she knew as friends could support a candidate who has called for a ban on Muslims from entering the United States.
“I had grown up in a place where I thought that I was respected and my family was respected, and I woke up that morning to realize that wasn’t the case,” said Atske, an inactive Crimson editor.
Atske said her attempts to reach out to Trump supporters after the election proved difficult.
“In the heat of the moment, I reached out to a few very vocal conservative friends from high school to try and see where they were coming from,” she said. “Having read Facebook posts, I know they thought that my elite liberal arts education had turned me into a ‘baby.'”
Yet, Atske said she did not think all Trump voters had malicious intentions when voting for the candidate. Rather, she lamented the way these voters made their priorities during the election.
“There’s a huge cohort of people that are generally nice people who unfortunately, I think, prioritized the slim chance of an economic gain under a Trump presidency over the safety and well-being of fellow Americans,” she said.
Other students said they believe Harvard’s campus has also become politically insulated from the rest of the country. The Crimson’s recent election survey indicated that the College’s student body is significantly more liberal than the national population. While 87.3 percent of surveyed undergraduates expressed support for Hillary Clinton, the national popular vote was much tighter, with tallies as of Tuesday showing Clinton winning by a less than 2 percent margin.
“I think that Harvard can become a very, very liberal microcosm of what represents our country,” said Kaufman, a Democrat. “It can be very removed from the flyover states and rural areas like where I’m from.”
Contending with Harvard students’ criticisms of Trump voters has also proven a challenge for some.
Morris said he feels that Harvard students’ criticisms of Trump supporters, though often valid, can be sanctimonious. While he said some Trump voters held racist views, Morris said he believes Harvard students are also complicit in perpetuating structural discrimination.
“Some [Trump supporters] are racist and probably all of them are structurally racist, institutionally racist, meaning that they don’t actively combat a system that’s based upon inequality. But who does?” Morris said. “Everyone at… Harvard goes into finance, that’s inequality for the entire world. You’re literally making money for rich people, and Harvard kids are going to condemn these people for voting for Trump.”
Muñoz said she voted for Trump partially because of her stance on illegal immigration. She said many students at Harvard do not understand her position and are surprised by it because of her Hispanic heritage.
“It’s like ‘oh my God, you’re Hispanic,’” she said, referring to the way students question her stance on illegal immigration. “But my grandmother came here and said 'yes,' she’ll fill out the paperwork and she waited six months and then they got to leave [Cuba] under [former president Fidel] Castro. But then the same people that lived two blocks away from her in Havana could just get here, be undocumented, and work for below minimum wage.”
Muñoz said she believes undocumented immigrants “took up some spots” for citizenship allocation that could otherwise be awarded to those who seek legal immigration into the United States.
Mullin, who voted for Hillary Clinton, said there are gaps between the concerns of Harvard students and people from the Midwest, especially regarding social issues.
“You can see on liberal campuses that [college students] don’t understand how Midwestern families don’t see the struggles that they do,” he said. “But in Midwestern families, you’re very much more concerned about being able to put dinner on the table than whether or not people you don’t necessarily interact with are seeing more injustice.”
A PATH FORWARD
Despite their differing views on the business mogul, many students said they believe engaging with a variety of political perspectives is important in the face of polarization.
Mullin said he disagreed with some Harvard students’ decisions to block Trump supporters on social media.
“You’ll see on Facebook a lot of posts that were like, ‘If you voted for Donald Trump delete me now’ and that’s just very narrow minded and selfish in my opinion because those are the people you need to engage with,” he said.
Jenkins echoed Mullin’s statement.
“Engagement is the way you fight ignorance,” he said. “I’m basically seeing two sides of the same coin and it’s very frustrating to me, sometimes… The essence of the division is that people don’t understand each other and they don’t hear the opposite sides of the coin.”
Atske said she feels understanding Trump supporters’ perspectives is politically important, especially for liberal students looking to future election cycles.

Harvard College’s Title IX coordinators received 121 disclosures of incidents of potential sexual harassment last academic year, a nearly four-fold increase since the 2013-2014 school year, according to the University Title IX Office’s annual report.
Only five undergraduates who disclosed potential sexual harassment to Title IX coordinators filed a formal complaint last academic year with the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution. The “vast majority” of students across the University who made disclosures instead opted to pursue interim measures, which range from extensions on course work to leaves of absence. More students from the College disclosed potential sexual harassment to their Title IX coordinators than students from Harvard’s other schools.
Sixty-two percent of investigations into student cases between 2014 and 2016 did not find that a violation of the University’s sexual assault and harassment policy had occurred. In total, ODR has received 53 formal sexual harassment complaints since the office opened in September 2014.
“You look at what’s happening with the disclosures to the Title IX coordinators—that’s the larger universe. What we see in terms of formal complaints is really more like the tip of the iceberg,” Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s Title IX Officer, said in an interview Tuesday.
The Title IX Office released these statistics, among others, in its first-ever annual report Tuesday. The report, sent to a variety of administrators and student leaders in an email Tuesday evening, provides data about sexual harassment reporting on campus dating back to 2013-2014, when Karvonides became Harvard’s first central Title IX Officer. The report aims to educate Harvard affiliates about the University’s Title IX policies. Seventy-one percent of respondents to a 2015 University-wide survey said they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct.
“I see this as the first of many many annual reports,” Karvonides said. “As our case numbers continue to grow I see opportunity to bring out more and more data while protecting the privacy of those people.”
In the 2015-2016 academic  year, the office received 26 complaints, compared to 15 in the 2014-2015 school year—“an almost 60 percent increase.” By the end of last academic year, ODR had received 41 complaints, per the report.
Of the 41 complaints ODR had received at the end of last academic year, “approximately half of the complaints were resolved before progressing to a full investigation” because some complaints were settled through informal resolutions and and others ended after “administrative closure.”
Karvonides said that an ODR investigator will review a complaint before beginning an investigation. If the investigator decides that the complaint’s allegations, even if they were true, would not constitute a violation of Harvard’s Title IX policy, they will close the case after the initial review.
“Ultimately if it’s determined that the information as presented would not be a violation, then it’s administratively closed, which I think is the appropriate thing to do for all involved,” Karvonides said.
Only three of the cases that progressed to a full investigation between the 2013-2014 academic year and the 2015-2016 academic year did not feature parties who had “engaged in a dating/romantic relationship or friendship prior to the incident.”
Sixty-nine percent of ODR cases featured a female complainant and a male respondent. Eight percent featured a male complainant and a male respondent, and 8 percent featured a female complainant and a female respondent.
Karvonides said the increased number of disclosures is a key sign of progress.
“At the end of the day with sexual assault, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, the fact that it is historically underreported—this has got to be our priority is to look for indicators that people are feeling more comfortable coming forward and availing themselves with support,” Karvonides said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s mantras is to focus on the first and last four minutes of each half. By winning those four four-minute segments of the game, the team can gain and carry momentum. On Tuesday night against George Washington, however, one particular four-minute segment put the Crimson in a hole it could not climb out of.
Harvard went into the locker room at the half down just four to the Colonials. Though the team had led for nearly 15 minutes of the first half and had slipped a bit towards the end, the game was still within striking distance.
The first four minutes of the second half, however, were a different story. Just 13 seconds into the second frame, George Washington’s Tyler Cavanaugh hit a jumper to push the lead to six. A missed jumper by Crimson freshman guard Seth Towns and a flurry of turnovers gave the Colonials the ball back, and guard Jaren Sina added another two to the George Washington total.
After a miss from Harvard senior co-captain Siyani Chambers and a turnover by Towns, Sina responded with another basket, this time for three, to stretch the Colonial lead to double-digits. After more of the same, George Washington (4-3) had suddenly built a 13 point lead.
“We just have to work on finishing halves and starting with the same intensity the second half,” Chambers said. “When it comes down to those first four minutes and those last four minutes, we have to come out with the same energy we had to start the game. We get into trouble where we kind of take a step back, take a little breather, and then all of a sudden we look up at the scoreboard, and we aren’t where we want to be.”
Though the Crimson (1-4) would eventually claw back to within single digits, it wasn’t enough to overcome the deficit, and the team dropped its third game in a row, this time by a 77-74 tally. With the team’s only victory thus far coming against Division II Fisher, Harvard has yet to defeat a Division I team in the early goings.
“We’re still a team that’s trying to find the right rhythm, and we haven’t found that yet,” Amaker said. “You have to look at different pieces and players to see if we can ignite that. I think we have seen flashes of that but not enough that we have had victories that we can feel good about.”
For the second game in a row, Amaker’s team had the chance to come back in the waning minutes of the game. While the comeback fell short on Tuesday night, there were bright spots in Harvard’s ability to fight back from behind. Were it not for 13-of-14 free throw shooting in the final two minutes by the Colonials, the game may have seen a different result. Powered by hot shooting from the frontcourt, Harvard tallied 14 points in the final minute to keep the game close. Despite full court pressure, the Crimson was unable to force a steal, which allowed George Washington to maintain a cushion.
Throughout the game, the Crimson’s youth shone through on multiple occasions. Though rookies Towns and guard Bryce Aiken led the team with 17 points apiece, communication and control issues still plagued the team—which has 13 underclassmen. The duo of Towns and Aiken contributed nine of the team’s 16 turnovers, with several coming on passes that sailed out of bounds as players failed to communicate the direction of passes. Fellow freshmen Henry Welsh and Justin Bassey reminded the crowd of their youth, as they combined for just two points despite both being in the starting lineup. But the team is not content with letting its youth be an excuse for its mishaps.
“That excuse can’t fly anymore,” Aiken said. “We’re all in college basketball now, [and] there’s no excuses, whether you’re young or not. You have a few games under your belt and now it’s time to perform. We are representing something that’s bigger than us...and every time we step on the court, we just have to play together, play as a team, and get the win.”

The Harvard women’s basketball team overcame the challenge of a midweek road trip to extend its season winning streak to five games on Tuesday night. The Crimson (5-1) had four starters in double digits as it won all four quarters on the way to a 68-60 win over Sacred Heart.
“Any time you go on the road and you leave with a win, I think that’s a good thing,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I always get worried about having a lot of games in a few amount of [days], so that’s a challenge for us. We didn’t start strong, which is a concern, but down the stretch we showed a lot of toughness.”
Harvard and the Pioneers (2-4) both started hot from outside the arc, combining for seven three-pointers in the first quarter. The Crimson did not rely too heavily on anyone for production, with three different players connecting on triples and three other players scoring in the period.
Sacred Heart sophomore guard Erin Storck gave the hosts their first and only lead of the second quarter early in the period, but freshman forward Jeannie Boehm and sophomore guard Madeline Raster scored Harvard’s next 10 points to settle things down before sophomore guard Sydney Skinner’s pair of threes pushed the visitors’ lead to seven. Those three were the Crimson’s top scorers on the night, with 11, 17, and 10 points, respectively.
“I think what makes us so good is that we’re so deep and that everyone is so unselfish,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “That really contributes to our play. Everyone is really unselfish, we all love each other, [and] we love playing for each other.”
A 10-0 run early in the second half gave Harvard its biggest lead of the night at 47-34. Raster and Boehm continued to enjoy the space left by the hosts’ active defense and converted easy buckets. Boehm grabbed 10 rebounds to go along with as many points, notching the first double-double of her collegiate career. She also blocked four shots, a new career high.
“[Jeannie] is definitely developing,” Delaney-Smith said. “To be honest, we didn’t give her the ball enough tonight in the second half.”
Senior guard/forward Hannah Kimmel would fuel a Sacred Heart resurgence, however, hitting three of her six three-point attempts on the night to help trim the lead to five late in the third period. The Harpursville, N.Y., native, averaging 16 points per game on the year, led all scorers with 23 points on 8-of-16 shooting, including 6-of-11 from outside the arc.
With the game hanging in the balance heading into the final period, the visitors needed its key players to hit big shots and that’s exactly what happened. Freshman point guard Katie Benzan, already one of the Crimson’s standout performers, hit a three before junior forward Taylor Rooks netted a layup to extend the lead to nine.The Pioneers, however, would refuse to go away quietly. A Storck three made it a four-point game with over two minutes left, but Harvard forced a turnover before a couple of missed shots by Sacred Heart allowed the visitors to see the game out at the free throw line.
The Crimson were active defensively with 10 steals and Boehm’s aforementioned paint patrol but also continued to struggle taking care of the ball. Delaney-Smith’s team turned the ball over 16 times on the night, taking its season average to 16.2 per game
“We do notice that we have a lot of turnovers,” Nunley said. “It’s because we get excited, we try the ‘feel-good pass’, the ‘thread-the-needle pass’, but we have to remember that we’re so good when he hit the extra pass or set up our offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard men’s basketball team is a work in progress.
On Tuesday night against George Washington (4-3), there were certainly positives to take away despite the 77-74 loss. Senior co-captain Siyani Chambers tallied a season-high eight assists. Freshman forward Seth Towns tied a career-high 17 points. Senior forward Zena Edosomwan went 4-for-4 from the free throw line.
But the Crimson (1-4) still has a lot to improve on, and those areas of needed improvement were illuminated against a veteran Colonials team composed of multiple graduate students and redshirt players.
“At the end of the day you can drill it as much as you want but we just have to buckle down as a unit and just say we’re not doing this again,” Chambers said. “[We have to] go into the next game and not make the same mistakes another time.”
NOT IN THE ZONE
For much of the contest, George Washington utilized a zone defense to smother the Harvard offense, forcing the Crimson to rely on individual ball-handling skills rather than its usual inside-out style which creates shots from quick screens and pounding the paint to make separation for the outside shooters.
Instead, the zone made Harvard rely on the dribble to beat its defenders rather than finding open space through screens. While the Crimson have two players who excel in this area in Chambers and Aiken, an offense cannot rely on just two ball handlers. Freshman guard Christian Juzang typically is a third player who would fill the penetration role, but the rookie has missed the past three games with injury.
“[It’s] being crafty and savvy,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We lack some of that right now. Throughout our time we need to have more of those two words, but that’s something that they do have, and it shows up in a lot of different ways.”
In addition to Chambers and Aiken, Towns’ skillset also succeeded in breaking down the zone as he is Harvard’s best midrange shooter. Amaker compared the rookie to Wesley Saunders ’15—a current player with the NBA D-League’s Windy City Bulls—in his ability to score from the foul line extended, which the zone tends to leave open. At the same time, however, Towns coughed up six turnovers in the contest, proving a need for greater consistency in his play.
The Colonials were not the first team to break down the Harvard offense through zone, as Holy Cross stymied the Crimson in a similar fashion in its victory over Amaker’s squad last week. By putting pressure on the frontcourt as the ball crossed half court, the Crusaders were able to pick Harvard’s pocket and create easy baskets on the other end of the floor.
“I’m very surprised that we have been put on our heels by the zone,” Amaker said. “I’m hopeful that we will be a little bit more aggressive and attack it and penetrate and not stand and stare and be tentative, but easier said than done.”
FOULS, FOULS, FOULS
One of the main narratives of Harvard’s 2015-2016 season was its inability to sink shots from the charity stripe. At one point, it was in the bottom 10 of all Division I teams in free throw percentage.
Against George Washington, however, it was the team’s inability to keep the Colonials off the line that was the nail in the coffin to Harvard’s comeback attempt. Particularly in the second half, George Washington lived at the line. In the first seven minutes of the second frame, the Crimson committed six fouls, while the Colonials maintained a clean slate. Ultimately, Harvard would tally 28 fouls, compared to just 17 for the visitors.
The teams shot nearly identical percentages from the line, but the volume from George Washington was too much for Harvard to keep up with. Unable to get a steal late in the contest, the Crimson was forced to resort to intentionally fouling to keep time on the clock. To Harvard’s dismay, the Colonials hit 13-of-14 from the line to close out the game.
“They were in the double bonus for a while,” Amaker said. “Just thinking of us being in a tight game, these guys have battled back both times to put us in a position where we can steal it and we haven’t been able to get over that proverbial hump.”

It looks like CS50 isn't the only thing Yale has decided to steal from us: according to an email sent to the Yale student body earlier today, Yale has 2 suspected cases of the mumps. Our bad, guys.
While Dr. Paul Genecin (New Haven’s counterpart to the infamous Dr. Paul J. Barreira) didn’t specifically blame the outbreak on inter-school hookups from earlier this month, he did throw some shade our way. But hey, at least the Bulldogs won’t have to suffer through quarantine at the Inn—apparently being quarantined on campus from New Haven is punishment enough.
With mumps making its long awaited comeback just days before The Game, it seems that that our very own claim to fame was almost destined to make its way all the way to New Haven. Yalies, don’t let that vaccination history fool you. No one is safe. Depending on how you decided to spend your Harvard-Yale weekend (read: how many red solo cups you decided to share with strangers, and which finals clubs you chose to frequent) your fate may have already been decided.
In his email, Genecin also cited some of the most common modes of transmission for the highly contagious virus. Note that “sloppy makeout at the Harvard-Yale tailgate” did not make the short list. Nor did “taking swigs from a bottle of vodka handed to you by a stranger,” though we’re sure that should fall under “indirect or direct contact with an infected person’s nose or throat droplets.”
While revenge may be a dish best served cold, we couldn’t wait another school year to make up for our devastating loss at this year’s Game. So, it appears that this holiday season, we decided to give Yale the gift that keeps on giving. Best of luck trying to handle the outbreak that’s taken us almost two semesters to control!
The lesson to be learned here is plain and simple: while Yale may have won the game, we gave them the mumps. That’s what you get when you mess with the Crimson.
