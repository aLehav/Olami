After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late last week, Gerald L. Chan made Harvard history by donating a mammoth sum to what was formerly known as the Harvard School of Public Health. The $350 million sum marks the largest single donation in Harvard’s history. In recognition of this generosity, the school will be renamed the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. This will be first time a school at Harvard University has been renamed in recognition of a donation.
As with all groundbreaking events, Chan’s donation is not without controversy. In particular, there has been some concern regarding the explicit way in which the renaming rights were sold.
In reality, renaming in response to financial gifts is quite common within higher education, and is part of a long tradition at Harvard. Buildings such as Pforzheimer House and the Malkin Athletic Center have been named to honor generous donors. Johns Hopkins has the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Clare College, one of the constituents of Cambridge University in the UK, was named after its generous benefactor, Elizabeth de Clare. The renaming of the School of Public Health is no different.
Further, renaming the school seems a reasonable exchange for a historic donation that will benefit both Harvard and the broader community. Given the recent crises in public health, including the massive outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and ongoing concerns about access to health care in America, education in public health is crucial.
The School of Public Health has historically lagged behind the College, Law and Business Schools in alumni donations, and it will be exciting to see whether Chan’s gift will encourage further donations to schools at Harvard with traditionally smaller endowments.
It is also admirable that the leadership of the School of Public Health is dedicated to using the donation to make their programs more accessible. Julio Frenk, dean of the School of Public Health, stated that relieving student debt is his “number one” priority. The generosity of Chan’s gift will hopefully allow many students—especially students of underprivileged backgrounds—to pursue careers and research in public health. Financial aid initiatives have been crucial to making Harvard a meritocratic and diverse institution. We hope that under Frenk’s guidance, Chan’s gift will make an education at the School of Public Health accessible to all.
In the end, research by students and faculty is what makes Harvard great. If alumni are willing to donate such generous amounts, Harvard’s administration is right to take note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During my end-of-August Netflix binge, I re-watched “Jesus Camp.” The documentary follows Becky Fischer, a Pentecostal youth minister, as she organizes a spiritual retreat for evangelical children. It’s a film about the culture wars and all the scrapes—evolution, school prayer, gay marriage, abortion—that defined them. When the movie was released in 2006, American soldiers were caught in the middle of Iraq’s civil war, Massachusetts alone permitted same-sex marriage, and leftists worried that the Christian right would remake the country.
My memories of the mid-aughts are few and brief. Shepard Smith interviewing Bill Frist on Fox News. My father telling me, “Give them everything but don’t call it marriage.” Fleeing New York during the Republican National Convention, where George W. Bush spoke of America’s “calling from beyond the stars.”
Maybe my current sensibilities were latent, even then. My brother and I spent the better part of the weekend in our friend’s attic, where all the cartoons banned in the Solomon household—“South Park,” “Family Guy,” and “The Simpsons”—enraptured us. On Sundays, the networks broadcast their talk shows, with pundits dissecting Osama bin Laden’s latest video threats. On Sundays, Joe and I re-watched the “Austin Powers” movies, laughing at Dr. Evil’s demand for billions of dollars.
Then there was Green Day, who in September 2004 released “American Idiot.” A collection of ready-made anthems for “the kids of war and peace,” the album laments the triumph of “the redneck agenda.” But more than trenchant social criticism, “American Idiot” highlights the failure of conservative value-creation. Songs like “Jesus of Suburbia” contrast the Christian right’s millennial vision with the end of history in the country’s bedroom communities. Nation-building abroad, supposed to inspire us at home, was always limited in its appeal. Against a rising trend of political apathy, the Christian right advanced a set of values, and that act—perhaps as much as the values themselves—made the movement counter-cultural.
How did the left win the culture wars? That answer depends on how much thoughtfulness we impute to the American electorate. Often, when voters sour on the specific policies of Republicans or Democrats, they move away from the party as a whole. Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, for example, turned on economic questions, but he gained his initial following thanks to his timely denunciations of the Iraq war. The polling data suggests as much. Between 2005 and 2008, the decline in President Bush’s approval rating—which fell as the news from Iraq grew grimmer—was correlated with a rise in public support for the social acceptance of homosexuality.
This explanation feels partial, simplistic even—and that’s because it is. The Bush coalition of neoconservatives and “values voters” was held together by its belief in American exceptionalism and its faith in the United States as an evangelizer of democracy. In “Jesus Camp,” that alliance is on full display. After the kids perform a series of military-style dances, Pastor Becky connects her work with the young to the success of U.S. foreign policy.
“Do you know Muslims train their children from the time they’re five years old to fast during the month of Ramadan?” she asks. “This is a sick, old world. Let’s just fix it.”
Today, the Christian right has defected from the war party, which is once again led by neoconservatives in the security establishment. The movement sets narrow goals for itself: the protection of religious minorities in the Middle East, amnesty for Central American refugees. This is partly because it lacks a receptive ear in the Oval Office. But it is also because foreign policy (with the possible exception of Israel-Palestine) no longer promises the next world. After 2005, images of bombed-out mosques in Baghdad left churchgoers in the heartland shell-shocked. Democracy and quiet did not arrive. Instead of taking a dunk in the Euphrates, Iraq’s Sunni and Shiite Muslims submerged themselves in sectarian conflict.
All this shook the Christian right’s confidence, but the way disaster in Iraq changed how we thought about the Middle East did in the movement. Its social vision rested on firm oppositions: religious vs. secular, “salt of the earth” vs. elites, good vs. evil, heartland vs. coasts. The hard choices inherent in any engagement abroad–navigating factional divides, arming former enemies, abandoning commitments once so fundamental–injected nuance back into our politics.
“This moment is a fulfillment of prophecy,” Pastor Becky says. “Now is the time to stand up and take back the land.”
Man plans, God laughs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This August we didn’t time for Shark Week. The Middle East remained a boiling cauldron of ethno-religious hatred; an Ebola outbreak was spreading; and Vladimir Putin decided that Russian roulette is a game best played with surface-to-air missiles. But all of these international convulsions should not obscure another summer trend: labor disturbances in the United States, and the wider conversation about economic justice of which they make a part.
In New England, the employees of the budget supermarket chain Market Basket stopped work over the firing of their beloved CEO, Arthur T. Demoulas, who prioritized the dignity and well-being of workers. Market Basket employees make "well above minimum wage," and get generous bonuses and pension plans from the company’s profit-sharing arrangements. Fearing that new management might mean a change in these practices, workers refused to show up to work until "Artie T" was reinstated.
Less well-off wage earners also made headlines. Following Seattle’s and SeaTac’s passage of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, Massachusetts raised its state minimum wage to $11-an-hour–the highest of any state.
In the pages of The New York Times, a series of recent articles and features to the plight of part-time workers appeared. These employees have started to organize to demand more equitable treatment, and legislators have taken notice.
In Chicago, fast food workers came together  during the last weekend of July to press for an $15-an-hour wage. On July 29, they got a boost from the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, who ruled that McDonald’s should legally be considered a joint-employer along with its franchisees. McDonald’s plans to appeal the case, arguing that it ignores decades of legal precedent.
What this recent uptick in pro-labor activity doesn’t ignore, however, is a long-running American concern with the equitable distribution of wealth. After the Revolution had been won and the Constitution written, Thomas Paine, the famous author of “Common Sense,” wrote another pamphlet titled “Agrarian Justice.” Paine, in 1796, argued that the existence of private property, while necessary and just in order to encourage the “natural improvements” of cultivation, inevitably breeds “the greatest evil,” poverty. To correct for the inequities he observed, Paine suggested that the government guarantee every person an inheritance at the age of 21, and a retirement income at the age of 50.
Today, Paine’s pamphlet reads a bit like a cross between a Marxist tract, Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the 21st Century," and an Elizabeth Warren speech. Its obsession with landed wealth and the origins of its distribution seems antiquated, but echoes a basic version of Piketty's analysis. And Paine rejects the idea of creating a truly “equal” society, acknowledging the role that private gain plays as an incentive for work. Like Senator Warren, he just argues that common resources play a role in every private success, and that no one should be poor simply because they do not own land or, perhaps in modern terms, a company.
The increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of the already wealthy lends new relevance to Paine’s pamphlet. After all, McDonald’s CEO makes $9.5 million a year, while people who have worked at the company for a decade subsist at "about $15,000." The fast food and part time workers of today could certainly have benefited from an infusion of cash at the age of 21, to continue school or at least begin a savings account.
And if this idea seems far-fetched, consider its endurance in the American imagination. None other than Richard Nixon proposed a guaranteed minimum income scheme during his presidency. While Nixon’s proposed income was low, and his plan to cut programs like Medicaid would have been disastrous, in the tradition of Paine he recognized that government should provide a backstop against poverty.
Recently, it seemed that the modern Republican Party was totally uninterested in dealing with the adverse consequences of the market economy, viewing them not as injustices but as the acceptable fruits of a free society. But that political truth may be changing. Though many have rightly decried the inadequacy of Paul Ryan's new plan on poverty, having a leading Republican figure take dead aim at empowering the poor is undoubtedly a positive development.
Bringing conversations about economic justice to the forefront of the national consciousness makes not only political sense for the GOP and Democrats, but also moral and philosophical sense. One of Paine's central points was that a person's ability to live outside of poverty was a right, one that the new, revolutionary governments of his period should guarantee. The United States was borne of that idealism; Paine undoubtedly had it in mind, along with  revolutionary France, when he exhorted his contemporaries to "do honors to revolutions by justice."
More than two-hundred years on, we still have some work to do. So the next time you see  super market employees demanding a say in their conditions of employment, or a fast food worker demanding a living wage, consider that this agitation is not just economic. It is a moral imperative, inherited from the founding of this country, and as revolutionary today as it was in the 18th century.

The committee tasked with reviewing the Program in General Education will host town hall meetings in October to gauge understanding of the program’s pedagogical goals among students, faculty, and administrators.
The meetings will contribute to a report assessing the state of the Gen Ed program. That report, which the committee intends to release at the end of the spring semester, will be the first of its kind since the program's inception in 2007.
Comprised of 10 faculty members from across Harvard’s academic divisions and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the committee convened officially for the first time over the summer to make plans to move forward with the review during the fall semester.
The group will use the town hall meetings to solicit feedback about the Gen Ed program from various stakeholders to create a more comprehensive survey to release to the College, according to committee chair Sean D. Kelly, a Philosophy professor.
“Right now we’re starting to ask the question, ‘What format should the town hall meetings have, what kinds of questions do we think would help us understand most what the students think of the program?’” Kelly said.
Four meetings will be held in October—two in River Houses, one in the Yard, and one in the Quad. While all members of the College will be invited to attend the meetings, teaching fellows will have a separate town meeting to discuss their experiences with the program.
In addition, according to Kelly, the review committee has been working with the Harvard College Institutional Research Office to gather data from a senior survey and the Q Guide to understand student views on the purpose of the program and determine whether or not they enjoy their Gen Ed classes.
“We have lots of anecdotal evidence about what [students] think, but we’re trying to figure out systematically what the views are,” Kelly said.
Members from the Undergraduate Council met with the committee over the summer to discuss ways to engage students in the review on Gen Ed. The UC’s Education Committee plans to raise awareness about the Gen Ed review committee’s work, according to UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16.
“We’re going to send out surveys, use Ghost Protocol, just to kind of use the various mechanisms that the UC has to solicit as much feedback from students with regards to many of the issues related to General Education,” Goyal said.
After the review committee holds its town hall meetings, surveys students and faculty about the program, and completes its report, they will present their findings and recommendations to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith. Eventually, the report will go public and be open to discussion amongthe Faculty, who may vote on changes to the program, help reassess its purpose, and clarify potential ambiguities among students and instructors.
“We’re trying to get to the bottom of that, where the unclarity comes from,” Kelly said.

Blueprints for the ongoing renovation of Dunster House, which began in June, have been adjusted to incorporate community feedback on the recently renovated McKinlock Hall in Leverett House and Stone Hall in Quincy House, a leader of the House Renewal effort said Sunday.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Assistant Dean of Physical Resources Merle Bicknell, student responses from the two test projects have informed changes, including enlarging shower spaces, adding study niches in residential halls, and including a “smart classroom” in Dunster, which is the first complete House to undergo renovation.
“Each project provides the opportunity to confirm the usefulness of specific construction details...and the functionality of sustainable strategies,” Bicknell wrote in an email to The Crimson.
She noted that Dunster will include a rainwater collection and reuse system, more energy-efficient LED light fixtures, and thermal improvements to its buildings following the “success” of those enhancements in McKinlock and Stone Halls.
Other Dunster House renovations that mimic those in Stone and McKinlock Halls include the construction of en-suite kitchens in tutor residences, inclusion of ceiling fans in student bedrooms, improvement of WiFi access in the House, and installation of air conditioning in common areas. Aligning with a commitment to increase accessibility, the renovated House will also be wheelchair-accessible.
Bicknell wrote that the standards for Dunster’s residential spaces will resemble those for the finished projects in Quincy and Leverett, but she added that “the common spaces will vary due to individual House traditions and preferences, as well as the potential and constraints of the existing architecture.”
While Dunster cannot accommodate a theater, like McKinlock’s renovated Library Theater, the pre-existing ceramics studio, grille, and gym will all receive upgrades during renewal, as perviously reported. The addition of seminar rooms will help to address the previous shortage of meeting spaces in the House.
“At Dunster, as at McKinlock, traditional spaces such as the Dining Hall, Library, Master’s House, and Junior Common Room will be restored to their original beauty, with modern systems and technology—all hidden—to ensure their long-term usefulness and importance to Dunster House,” Bicknell wrote.
Renovations on Dunster began on June 2. The House is slated to reopen for the 2015-2016 school year.

Harvard researchers are one step closer to completing a robotic suit designed to help soldiers travel farther, conserve energy, and shoulder heavy loads with less strain.
The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard revealed Thursday that it had received a contract for $2.9 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to continue its work on the “Soft Exosuit,” a wearable robot that facilitates ambulation.
“We’re trying to take an entirely new approach to how we design and fabricate wearable robots,” said Conor J. Walsh, the project lead and assistant professor of mechanical and biomedical engineering.
Predecessors in the wearable robot field have traditionally worked on “exoskeletons,” but Walsh and his team refer to their product as an “exosuit,” a soft garment that can fit under clothing.
Walsh began to assemble the team to develop the soft exosuit two years ago, shortly after DARPA launched its Warrior Web program, the branch that then provided the first round of funding for the Harvard researchers working on the project.
“We began with the question, ‘Can you make a robot soft enough and apply enough support that it has a positive effect on a person’s mobility?’” Walsh said.
While DARPA primarily intended the suit to benefit the military by reducing muscle and tendon injuries among equipment-carrying soldiers, it also anticipates that the product may eventually provide other medical and rehabilitation services, Walsh said. Down the line, the suit’s design could aid firefighters and hikers as well as soldiers, and it could also improve or enable mobility for veterans, stroke victims, and others with impaired ambulatory abilities.
“A surprisingly large number of the U.S. population finds it very hard to walk,” Walsh said. “Those people are restricted to their homes, and their healthcare deteriorates rapidly.”
As a result of this condition, technology that restores mobility could confer enormous benefits on the health of the population at large, he said.
Given the wearable robot’s broad range of applications, assembling a team has provided its own set of challenges. The multidisciplinary nature of the work has brought together experts in the biomechanics of walking, engineers versed in robot design, and even apparel professionals from the Boston branch of New Balance.
The exosuit, which can be put on like a pair of pants, works to facilitate the body’s movement in subtle but precise ways, easing the burden on each muscle.
“We wanted to make sure we were not working against the body, but working with the body,” said Ishan Chatterjee ’16, an electrical engineering concentrator, who assisted with the engineering of motion sensors in the feet and legs of the suit.
“When you think about something you wear, you think of something that keeps you warm or something fashionable,” Walsh said. “But these textiles actually have a key function that’s critical to the robot’s operation.”
The development of a structured, functional textile has posed one of the project’s greatest obstacles, Walsh said. Over the next 15 months, Walsh and his team will continue to optimize the product and increase its efficiency, with prototypes being tested in the military this fall.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro threatened legal action against Kennedy School of Government professor Ricardo Hausmann on Thursday, accusing Hausmann of attempting to destabilize the country’s economy by suggesting it consider defaulting on its debt.
Maduro’s comments came in the wake of the publication, on Sept. 5, of an article co-written by Hausmann that argued the country should contemplate defaulting on its debt and using the money previously reserved to pay creditors to support its struggling domestic economy. Venezuela is facing widespread shortages of basic domestic goods and has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.
The article by Hausmann, a former planning minister for Venezuela, concluded that Maduro’s government is too corrupt to make such a decision and ease those shortages. According to Maduro, Hausmann’s article was responsible for the sharp decline in the country’s bond prices last week.
“The fact that his administration has chosen to default on 30 million Venezuelans, rather than on Wall Street, is not a sign of its moral rectitude,” Hausmann and HKS researcher Miguel Angel Santos wrote of the country’s decision to service foreign debt rather than default on its foreign bonds. “It is a signal of its moral bankruptcy.”
In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Maduro struck back, labeling Hausmann a “financial hitman” and “outlaw” who was attempting to tank Venezuela’s economy. He also assured that the country would pay its debt “down to the last dollar,” which helped bond prices recover in recent days.
"I've ordered the public prosecutor, and I've spoken to the attorney general, to start actions because you're involved in a campaign to damage our fatherland," Maduro said, according to Reuters. "We have the proof in your declarations and articles, up there in your mansions where you live with money stolen from Venezuela."
Maduro has not offered more specifics, and his office could not be reached for comment late Sunday.
Hausmann said in an interview on Sunday that he was surprised to find that Maduro had claimed to initiate unspecified action, but that the move was characteristic of dictatorial or totalitarian regimes.
“I know that this is the government that it is. I’m not surprised at that,” Hausmann said. “My surprise comes from the stupidity of the president’s reaction.”
Despite the president’s threats, Hausmann said he has remained calm and does not see the threats as potentially damaging.
“I have the protection of the U.S.. I have the protection of Harvard. I feel a free man,” Hausmann said.
He added: “I’m going to disregard any of these threats, and I’m going to do what I think I responsibly must do.”
Hausmann worked as Venezuelan planning minister in the 1990s but left the country in 1994.
HKS Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 and University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 released a joint statement Saturday in defense of Hausmann.
“We stand in strong support of Harvard Kennedy School Professor Ricardo Hausmann's freedom to express his views in the public arena, where others are free to question and debate the merits of his arguments,” the statement read.
“Harvard University and HKS strongly defend the right of any faculty member to communicate his or her views. It is in the open exchange of opinions and ideas that people and nations can learn and prosper,” they continued.
Hausmann’s colleague Lant Pritchett, who described himself as a close friend of Hausmann, said that he doubted Maduro’s ability to follow through in taking action against Hausmann, even though he may try.
“If the current Venezuelan government could do damage to Ricardo Hausmann, I don’t put it past them that they would,” Pritchett said, hypothetically.
Pritchett also said that Maduro’s accusations contradict the basic civil liberties of Venezuela’s constitution.
“This does violate every principle of free speech to go after someone using executive and judicial threats in response to something they said that was a perfectly reasonable, perfectly well-articulated, and entertainable point of view about the substance of the economy,” Pritchett said. “That’s just beyond the pale of what decent and respectful governments should do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 15, 2014, at 11:05 p.m.
Harvard has raised at least $4.3 billion in pledges and donations during its University-wide capital campaign so far, including $500 million in the second quarter of 2014 alone.
This progress puts the University on pace to raise a record-breaking $2 billion in just a twelve-month period, beginning last September with the The Harvard Campaign’s public launch.
James F. Rothenberg ’68, a member of the University’s highest governing body, shared the latest comprehensive accounting figures—current as of June 30—with The Crimson on Monday. The June 30 total does not include Gerald L. Chan’s $350 million gift to the School of Public Health, which was finalized in July and announced last week.
Including Chan’s gift, the Harvard Campaign has raised at least $4.65 billion since it launched. That represents 72 percent of the $6.5 billion campaign goal unveiled last September. At that point, the University had taken in $2.8 billion in a two-year “quiet phase.”
Chan’s gift also puts Harvard well in reach of the $2 billion milestone. The deal was completed in late July, meaning that by the end of that month, the University had raised at least $1.85 billion since September 2013. Raising funds at at least the $150 million per quarter rate Harvard averaged before the campaign’s quiet phase launched would round out that figure.
Rothenberg, Harvard’s treasurer from 2004 until earlier this year, said Monday that he and other University officials are now cautiously optimistic that Harvard will meet, and perhaps exceed, the $6.5 billion goal. The campaign is slated to last another four years.
“We’re more optimistic now about reaching the target and potentially going by it then we were a year and a half ago,” Rothenberg said, adding that the University has a long list of potentially major donors yet to be tapped.
“We haven’t exhausted the list of potentially significant donors,” he said. “We’re not at signed, sealed, and delivered yet...but let me put it this way, they haven’t said ‘no.’”
Rothenberg also said that the Corporation has not had serious discussions about raising the goal, which is common when campaigns get off to such a fast start.
“I think there’s two ways to go...one way is to say, ‘if we hit the target, we’re not going to stop,’ and that’s what Stanford did. It set its target at $4.3 billion and raised [$6.2 billion],” Rothenberg said. “I don’t know if we’ll ever raise the target.”
If Harvard meets its campaign goal, it would set a fundraising record for higher education. Stanford’s capital campaign, which concluded in 2011, is the current high-water mark. Just ten months after the public launch, Harvard has shattered Stanford’s one-year fundraising record of $1 billion, set in 2012.

Looking to kick off the season with a successful start, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams traveled to New Haven this weekend to compete against Ivy League rivals Yale and Princeton at the H-Y-P meet.
Though the Crimson turned in a solid performance, it ultimately did not come away victorious, with both its men and women finishing in third.
In the men’s 8K, captain Will Geiken led the pack with an eighth-place finish and a time of 24 minutes, 42 seconds, while junior Chris Allen came in just one spot behind with a time of 24:46.3.
Senior Daniel Milechman crossed the line with a time of 25:14.8 for 16th place, while freshman Louis Colson and junior Tom Purnell rounded out Harvard’s top five with times of 25:15.6 and 25:26.1, respectively—good enough for a team score of 68 points.
Princeton won the race with 31 points, while Yale came in second with 32.
“It was not what we were looking for,” Geiken said. “It was not how we wanted to start the season…. We have the talent to do some good things this season, but given that opening, we need to do serious work over the next two months.”
The women were also unable to claim victory in their 5K race, matching the men with 68 points, while Princeton claimed victory with 21 points.
Freshman Courtney Smith finished with a team-best time of 17:59.5, taking eighth place. Senior Molly Renfer came in 12th with a time of 18:08, with freshman Annika Gompers just three-tenths of a second behind in 13th.
Senior Whitney Thornburg and sophomore Caroline Marshall completed the scoring for Harvard, clocking in at times of 18:20.4 for 18th place and 18:28.1 for 19th place, respectively.
Though the team was unable to achieve victory, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky believes that this meet will provide the teams with the incentive to improve.
“It was not the start we were hoping for,” Saretsky said.  “But at the same time, I’m just as confident in both the men’s and women’s teams. I think it was a good wakeup call…. The good thing is that it’s early in the season.”
One highlight for Harvard was the standout performance of the freshmen.
On the men’s side, two of the top seven runners were freshmen as Colson and Ben Huffman finished fourth and sixth, respectively. For the women, Gompers, Smith, and Eliana Shwayder finished first, third, and seventh, respectively.
The strong performances illustrate the potential for these rookies to make contributions to the team right away, helping the Crimson compete in a competitive Ivy League.
“The freshmen’s performances were really what stood out, especially on the men’s side,” Saretsky said. “They handled the distance well and went out [and] did a good job of sticking with the team and had a really positive first result.”
In the coming practices, the Harvard runners will look to continue to build camaraderie with one another, gaining familiarity with each other in order to race well as a squad in upcoming meets.
“We had about three or four workouts as a unit before this race,” Geiken said. “It’ll be nice to have a couple of more weeks of working out as a group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight game, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-3-0) failed to convert on key scoring chances late in the contest, ultimately falling on the road, 2-1, to St. John’s (1-3-2) on Saturday. The Crimson has lost its first three games by a combined four goals.
“I think the spin we take from the game was how painful it was,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “We haven’t looked at the film yet so I don’t want to make quick judgments, but it was a really painful loss.”
Ashby noted that both teams had long stretches of possession, but the Red Storm was simply better than the Crimson in taking advantage of its chances between the pipes. St. John’s only notched two shots on goal but converted both opportunities, while Harvard had only one goal across seven tries.
“[St. John’s] is a playoff team, and I thought we did very well in the game,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We just have to tighten up little areas…. These guys are in a good place. Obviously the outcomes are not what we desire, but we can fix a couple things and get on a pretty good roll pretty quickly.”
The Crimson created a lot of early chances, including two shots in the first six minutes of the game. Three early offside penalties and two failed corner kicks kept Harvard from striking first. The Red Storm—as would be a theme in the game—punished the Crimson for not taking advantage.
In the 31st minute, just 66 seconds after an offside call on Harvard, St. John’s junior Gabriel Camara corralled a cross in the box and launched a shot on goal. Though blocked, the ball came right back to Camara, who sent a shot over junior goaltender Evan Mendez to give the Red Storm a 1-0 lead. It was the third goal of the defender’s career.
Harvard battled back, generating four shots and four corner kicks in the final three minutes of the half. Junior midfielder Tim Schmoll had two shots blocked and another saved during the spree, where St. John’s redshirt senior Jordan Stagmiller successfully kept the Crimson from scoring the equalizer.
“I think from this year to last year we are creating a lot more chances and having plenty of opportunities on goal, but we are lacking a decisive finishing effort,” Ashby said. “We are looking for guys to step up and bury their chances…. Ninety-five percent of the way we are good, but we have to finish.”
The second half was more of the same. After co-captain Kyle Henderson missed an early shot, the Red Storm came right back down the field in the 53rd minute to make the score 2-0. St. John’s senior Tim Parker provided the assist to redshirt senior Jordan Rouse, who beat Mendez and then kicked the ball into the open net.
“In our first three games, we are averaging two goals against per game, so we need to work on tightening up the defense because that is not the standard,” Ashby said. “It’s unacceptable.”
The Crimson fought back, with Henderson notching his second goal of the season to bring Harvard within one. However, the Red Storm blanketed the Harvard offense for the final third of the game. The Crimson had just two shots the rest of the way, both saved by Stagmiller.
After, Lehrer was quick to praise the team for its fight. The coach noted that the team had more shots on goal than its opponents in two of the three games, and that its current record does not reflect its level of play.
“[This team] has great fight and phenomenal players,” Lehrer said. “We are creating a lot of chances, and it’s a very great group. They have a lot of resolve. You watch them play and you are playing against a playoff team and they are expecting to win those games…. It’s a bit bumpy now with the results, but I think we will get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (4-2) got off to a slow start this weekend down in Athens, Ga., at the Benson’s Hospitality Group Invitational. Despite dropping the first game to NC State (8-1) and the first set of the second game, Harvard was still able to capture some momentum and emerged victorious in its last two fixtures against Georgia (5-4) and UNC Asheville (2-8).
“Going into the weekend, we knew we would be playing three pretty tough teams,” sophomore Corie Bain said. “Our mentality was to kind of be the underdog and prove ourselves and what type of team we were, and I think we did that.”
HARVARD 3, UNC ASHEVILLE 0
In a game that featured two sets that went into extra points, Harvard was able to end the weekend on a strong note, beating the Bulldogs in straight sets in the Ramsey Student Center.
Tied at 24-24 in the third set and up, 2-0, the Crimson benefitted from two attack errors to notch its second win of the tournament.
“We are actually a very strong team when it comes to going down to the wire,” Bain said. “We realized that our first weekend at the Harvard Invitational. We’re a team of fighters.”
The Crimson did not have to rely on opposing attack errors to capture the first set. Knotted at 25 points a piece, Harvard pulled out the win after two straight kills from senior Caroline Walters, who led the team with 12 kills in the match.
HARVARD 3, GEORGIA 1
Despite being up 20-14 in the fourth set, the Crimson let the Bulldogs claw to within two points, 23-21. But after a Harvard timeout, junior Caroline Holte came up with a kill to get the team to match point. Just as she had on the last point, Bain provided the assist—this time to junior Kathleen Wallace—to secure the Crimson’s first win of the invitational. In addition to her 29 assists on the game, Bain also led the team in kills with 14.
“We really rally and come back,” sophomore Grace Weghorst said. “We win games at the last minute. We fight at points 23 and 24 and don’t give up.”
Behind Georgia’s kill leader Lauren Teknipp, the Bulldogs secured the first set, 25-23. The Crimson found itself in a precarious situation in the second set, tied at 23 points apiece after having just lost the previous two points. But a crucial kill from Walters, assisted by junior Hannah Schmidt, tamed the Bulldogs’ momentum. A ball-handling error on the next play brought the Crimson to a 1-1 draw at that point in the weekend.
NC STATE 3, HARVARD 1
After ending last weekend in a loss, the Crimson was not able to reverse its luck in the opener of the Invitational, coming up short to the Wolfpack, 3-1.
“They’re a very good team,” Weghorst said. “But if we had turned some unforced errors into points, I believe we could have won.”
Down two sets to one and tied at 24-24, the Crimson needed to pull out the win to force a fifth decisive set. But an attack error and kill from NC State’s Perry Ramsey ended the Crimson’s hopes of doing just that, with the Wolfpack winning the set and the match.
The Crimson had managed to pull off a similar stunt. Down 26-25 in the second set, Harvard knocked off three straight points with kills from juniors Wallace and Jenn Shults, and an ace from sophomore Sindhu Vegesena capped off a second set win.  However, the Wolfpack responded with an emphatic 25-18 win in the third set to set the tone for the rest of the match.
The sophomore duo of Bain and Weghorst led the team in kills in the losing effort, with 12 and 11 respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the memory of last year’s second place finish still fresh, the Harvard men’s golf team returned to Bethpage State Park Golf Course this past weekend to make another run for the tournament title. The Crimson was unable to repeat last year’s strong finish, placing sixth at the Doc Gimmler tournament.
“This is a venue that we like a lot,” coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We did really well here last year. Going into [this weekend], we knew that when we’re sharp, we have the capability to play really well and have a lot of success on this course.”
Though the team started off strong in Friday’s morning round, the Crimson soon fell out of contention, as Harvard struggled to find its rhythm in the second and third rounds of the tournament.
“In the afternoon, we kind of let the others catch up with us a bit,” Rhoads said. “We were a little less sharp, and I think that was a hangover of being out of practice this summer. We were a little bit less technically sharp and just weren’t quite as on point.”
For junior Rohan Ramnath, it was the exact opposite. Ramnath began slow, carding a triple bogey in the first round. Following the tough start, the junior managed to claw his way back in the second round and fired a 67, a team low for the round. Ramnath held onto that momentum to finish the weekend under par.
“I honestly don’t think he changed anything at all, and I think thats how he came back,” sophomore Kendrick Vinar said. “He did a great job of not allowing the disappointment of a bad start affect his composure in the least. Sometimes the rounds that are challenging like that are a better reflection of your playing ability than the rounds where everything goes well.”
The Crimson fell to sixth place in the tournament, tying with Columbia. Yale notched first place, while Loyola Maryland claimed Harvard’s spot from last year, finishing in second.
“I think we had a really long day that first day, and a lot of us were feeling it,” Vinar said. “All the guys gave it their all, but everyone’s going to struggle at some point on the golf course and we just happened to all see that in the same round.”
The sluggish second and third rounds were a follow-up to a very successful first round for the Crimson, in which the entire squad managed to shoot under par, with each golfer registering a score between 69 and 72. These strong scores allowed the Crimson to clinch a second place position heading into the next round.
“The first round went generally well for us,” Rhoads said. “Shooting in that [69-72] range is a really solid set of scores for us, so I really liked where we were after the first morning.”
Two standouts in the first round were Vinar and captain Akash Mirchandani, with each golfer shooting under par. Vinar managed to hold on to his momentum until the very end of the competition. With this strong showing, Vinar notched a fifth place individual finish after a final-round 65, shooting five under par on the weekend.
“We know that we lost some ground in the afternoon,” Rhoads said. “[It] was a little unfortunate, but I know that we were still giving the best we had on the course. What I care about most is giving the best that we can give with what we have every time we are out there on the course, and I think that’s what we did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the weekend off three straight victories to open its 2014 campaign, the Harvard women’s soccer team (3-2-0) suffered its first defeats of the young season, losing on the road to Boston College (7-1-0) before suffering a narrow defeat at home against Colgate (5-1-1).
In both games, late goals by its opponents doomed the Crimson after competitive first halves.
“90 minutes is a long time and we need to make sure we’re playing and staying focused for the full 90,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “I think that’s something that comes with experience as a team and...learning the mental side of the game.”
COLGATE 1, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was shut out for the second straight game and allowed another late goal in a home loss to the Raiders on Sunday afternoon at Soldiers Field.
Despite combining for only one goal in the contest, both teams produced plenty of scoring opportunities throughout the game, as Colgate barely outshot Harvard, 13 to 11.
Freshman midfielder Eliza Doll netted the decisive goal, the first of her collegiate career, in the 75th minute on a strike from just outside the box. The tally followed two threatening shots on goal from the Raiders in the 73rd and 74th minutes, both of which were saved by senior goaltender Cheta Emba, who finished with six stops.
The Crimson had its best chances at the end of the first half, as Harvard had consecutive corner kicks in the 30th minute and sophomore forward Midge Purce had five shots, including an attempt that just cleared the crossbar in the 26th minute and a shot that hit the outside of the post in the 39th minute.
“We are building,” Purce said. “We will continue to build and we will create something special, but right now we are building.”
BOSTON COLLEGE 2, HARVARD 0
Although the Eagles created more scoring chances early, the Crimson managed to keep the contest scoreless deep into the second half. Two late goals ultimately propelled Boston College to victory as its stout defense gave Harvard very few chances to score on Friday afternoon at Newton Soccer Field.
The Eagles broke through in the 77th minute when sophomore forward Hayley Dowd beat sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack on a free kick from 24 yards out. Just five minutes later, Dowd’s classmate Andrea O’Brien notched the second goal for Boston College, effectively putting the game out of reach.
The Eagles came out firing right from the opening whistle, peppering the Harvard defense with four shots before the Crimson produced its first chance, a header from Margolius in the 19th minute that went wide. Harvard controlled the majority of the possession in the opening 45 minutes but had troubled translating that ball control into opportunities in the offensive third of the field.
Despite outshooting the Crimson seven to one in the first half, the Eagles could not convert on any of its chances as the teams headed to halftime tied at zero. Sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack again proved key for Harvard in net, saving 4 shots in the first frame to help prevent the Crimson from falling behind early.
Harvard appeared revitalized to start the second half, limiting Boston College to just one shot through the first 30 minutes of the period while drawing a host of fouls on the Eagles. However, it was a foul on the Crimson that ultimately changed the game, as Dowd took advantage of her free kick opportunity to put Boston College ahead for good.
The tally broke Durack’s streak of 211 minutes without allowing a goal to start the season. The Sydney, Australia native splits time with Emba, as the duo have shared the goalkeeping responsibilities for Harvard since last season.
The victory for the Eagles continues their recent dominance against the Crimson, as Harvard is 0-7-1 since 2005 against its crosstown rivals.
The loss also snapped the Crimson’s regular season unbeaten streak at 17 games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard mens water polo team traveled to Providence, R.I. this weekend to compete in the Bruno Fall Classic where it would face a mix of competition from around the country.
On the first day of the tournament, the Crimson struggled against two talented teams from California, both of whom have higher rankings than Harvard, and ultimately fell short twice. On the second day, however, Harvard turned it around to win both games and emerge with a split 2-2 record for the tournament.
The Crimson will look to ride the momentum of the second two games as it enters conference competition at home in two weeks.
HARVARD 13, NAVY 9
In Harvard’s (5-2, 1-0 CWPA) final game on Sunday afternoon, the team challenged then-undefeated Navy (8-1, 0-0 CWPA), a perennial east coast powerhouse. This year, the Midshipmen were ranked 16, but the Crimson was lurking just behind them at the 18 spot.
Mirroring how close their rankings are, the game was close throughout. The teams entered the fourth quarter tied, 8-8, but at that point Harvard took control as junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel notched three goals, bringing his tally for the game to five. Sophomore attacker Viktor Wrobel also played well for Harvard, firing for five goals of his own.
Junior goaltender Colin Woolway was a force in net for the Crimson as well, securing 10 saves and letting in only one goal during the final decisive period. Woolway has been a key part of the Harvard success so far this season.
“Woolway played really well for us,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “When you have faith that your goalie is going to be able to make blocks, it changes the way you play defense. We were very confident that he was going to make blocks and that let us push the Navy offense.”
HARVARD 17, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 11
In the Crimson’s first game of Sunday, the team looked to rebound from its two losses the day before against Connecticut College (0-2), a weaker opponent than the teams Harvard faced during the rest of the tournament.
The Camels managed to keep the score close throughout much of the contest in its first game of the season.
But in the end, Connecticut College just did not have enough firepower to match Harvard, as the Crimson managed to seize control early and maintain a lead for the majority of the game. Zepfel led the offensive effort for Harvard, scoring seven goals in the game, followed by junior attacker Blake Lee who tallied five scores.
HARVARD 8, UC IRVINE 20
In its second game on Saturday, the Crimson faced the No. 8 team in the country, UC Irvine, and struggled right from the outset.
The Anteaters were able to jump out to an early, finishing the first half up 13-3 over Harvard. The Crimson managed to get it together during the second half, but was never able to try and close the gap as UC Irvine rolled to a 20-8 victory.
“We were a step behind [UC Irvine] in every stage of the game,” Minnis said. “They scored a majority of their goals in transition, but we managed to learn some lessons and play better in the second half. We are learning to play with top caliber teams.”
Zepfel scored a hat-trick for Harvard in his first of three high-scoring games, and sophomore attacker Joey Colton added four of his own, but it was not enough for Harvard.
HARVARD 11, SANTA CLARA 12
In the Crimson’s first game of the tournament, the team suffered a tough loss against 17th-ranked Santa Clara (3-2, 0-0), after a late spurt pushed the broncos ahead at the end.
Harvard led for a large portion of the game, and enjoyed a three-goal lead going into halftime, but could not manage to finish the game on top.
“We played a great three quarters,” Minnis said. “But we didn’t finish the game off and they ended up on top. When you’re playing against good teams and you have a lead in the fourth quarter, you sometimes play to hold on instead of attacking, and we did that.”
Lee finished with three goals in the game, and freshman utility player Harry Tafur managed to get on the board with two goals of his own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team had luck on its side up north this weekend, earning two wins over the University of Maine and the University of Vermont at the Catamount Classic Tournament. The Crimson’s four-game win streak is the team’s best start to the season since 2005, when the squad also started off 4-0.
Harvard (4-0) snatched close wins from both of its New England counterparts, defeating both teams by a score of 2-1. In both games, the Crimson posted the first tally of the game, but was forced to come back after its respective opponents knotted the score, 1-1.
“Our first Ivy League game is on Saturday against Yale, and our goal for the game during preseason was to go into our first Ivy League match undefeated,” senior Noel Painter said. “This weekend we won both of our games so…it feels great, and we have a lot of momentum going into Ivy League play.”
HARVARD 2, VERMONT 1
After taking down Maine on Saturday, the Crimson needed a little extra time to earn its win over Vermont (1-5) on Sunday, and remained undefeated on the season.
“As long as we just keep the work at the level we’ve been doing I think we’re going to have a great season,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “From the seniors to the freshmen, I think we have a really well-balanced competitive environment, and I think that will keep us on our toes for the next few months.”
One day after collecting both assists to help Harvard grab the victory against the Black Bears, freshman Ellie Cookson came through once again, scoring unassisted nine minutes into sudden-death overtime. Cookson cut through the Catamount defense and fired a shot from three yards out, where it ricocheted off the defense and into the goal.
“[In overtime], we really wanted to focus on playing our game, and staying composed and controlled,” Painter said. “Our goal was just to...keep numbers behind the ball, really just try and only make runs when we had those opportunities, and not running past the ball a lot, and it worked.”
Painter earned her second goal of the season at the 25-minute mark, collecting the rebound from freshman Hannah Wellington’s shot and snaking the ball into the lower right corner of the net to put Harvard up by one.
The Crimson had 12 shots in the second half but was unable to capitalize, allowing Vermont to tie the game in the 58th minute. The game remained scoreless for the remainder of regulation, forcing the overtime period.
HARVARD 2, MAINE 1
In its first game of the tournament, Harvard continued its winning ways, extending its win streak to three games after a victory over Maine (0-6).
Despite being outshot, 18-7, by the Black Bears, the Crimson managed to come out on top in large part due to the strong play of junior goalkeeper Issy Davies. Davies had a career-high nine saves to preserve the win for Harvard.
After a largely back-and-forth first half led to a one-goal advantage for the Crimson, Maine responded just two minutes after the break with a goal of its own. Harvard didn’t take long to strike again, however, and Cookson found sophomore Marissa Balleza on a fast break to assist on what would prove to be the game-winning goal.
Wellington continued her stellar college debut, putting Harvard on the board near the end of the first half after 33 minutes of scoreless play. The rookie sent the ball past the Maine goalkeeper from the top of the arc for her third goal of the season.
“We’re definitely getting better at giving each other lots of options,” Painter said. “If somebody’s on the ball there’s always another player cutting to the left or right or forward, and we’re trying to be open and really stretch the field wide and long…. We made the hard runs and just did a lot more work off ball [this week], and I think that helped us come away with both wins.”

Happy Monday! We’re currently wishing the weekend were one day longer so we could actually do (or maybe start) our homework, because we all know that the Monday morning routine before class is probably one of the worst parts of the week. Here’s a rundown of how your morning will probably go before your 10 a.m. class:
9:15 a.m.: Wake up to the sound of your phone alarm going off, find your phone between that small sliver of space between your mattress and the wall, hurt your hand while trying to retrieve your phone in that space, retrieve your phone and snooze your alarm.
9:18 a.m.: Snooze your alarm.
9:21 a.m.: Snooze your alarm because you know you can take a shower and get ready in 20 minutes.
9:24 a.m.: Finally decide to wake up because you don’t want to annoy your sleeping roommate who doesn’t have morning classes today.
9:30 a.m.: Check your Facebook newsfeed and all the Snapchat stories that have accumulated overnight because you obviously need to keep in touch with all of your friends on social media.
9:35 a.m.: Decide that now is the last possible moment at which you can get in the shower without being late to lecture.
9:38 a.m.: Get to the bathroom and realize you’re too lazy to take a shower—brushing your teeth and washing your face will suffice.
9:45 a.m.: Decide for a solid 10 minutes what you want to wear to class, end up choosing something very similar to your pajamas.
9:55 a.m.: Stare at your bed wistfully as you walk out of your room and part with it for the whole day (so tragic).
9:57 a.m.: Walk to class and wonder how you’re going to do this for 4 more days.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIt’s going to be a nice day with a high of 70 degrees! It’ll be sunny all day, and no one’s complaining because we all know that pretty soon it’s going to be extremely cold without any prior notice (we love you too, Mother Nature).
