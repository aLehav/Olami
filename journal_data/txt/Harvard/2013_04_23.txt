For the most part, zombies elicit one of two reactions. More often than not, we jump, scream, and run; that’s what most movies that depict the creatures, such as last weekend’s remake of “Evil Dead,” expect of us. Other times, we mow them down with whatever weapons we have available, from machine guns to chainsaws to plants; this response has sold millions of copies of video games like Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, and, of course, the inimitable Plants vs. Zombies. But there is a third response, and it’s somewhat less commonly tackled in the media:
 
Through zombies, we reaffirm our humanity.
 
This, in a nutshell, is what happened when my roommate showed me an Australian short film called “Cargo.” Despite—or, perhaps more accurately, because of—the presence of the undead in the film, it reminded me less of George Romero and more of Cormac McCarthy’s novel “The Road” or Alfonso Cuarón’s masterful filming of “Children of Men.” The video is available for free on YouTube, and it’s only seven minutes long; I highly recommend you take the time to watch it sooner rather than later, not only to understand what I’m saying here but because it is a genuinely beautiful and thought-provoking piece of art.
 
“Cargo” reminded me that there is an element of the great iconic monsters of art and myth that transcends mere fright. From Darth Vader to Lord Voldemort, to Hal 9000 and Hannibal Lecter, to Dracula and Frankenstein’s Monster—even as far back as Cronus, one of the original abominations of Greek mythology—the most resonant villains, the ones engrained in our cultural memories, are those who exist not only to scare the pants off of us but also to illuminate something meaningful in human nature. We may fear them because they threaten us, but we remember their names and deeds because, in doing so, they expose our most deeply held convictions about humanity.
 
In their most glaring deficiencies are reflected what we consider mankind’s greatest accomplishments. When the Joker entrusts his detonators to the frightened people of Gotham City in “The Dark Knight,” he is questioning the unshakeable faith we have for our fellow man’s capacity for decency. When haunting serial killer Anton Chigurh of “No Country For Old Men” (or, for that matter, Two-Face in “The Dark Knight”) stakes a life on pure chance in a coin toss, we marvel that we maintain a sense of agency over our own actions that these villains seem to lack. And when Alex of “A Clockwork Orange” commits yet another act of ultraviolence, he highlights through his gross indulgence that we have learned self-control on both an individual and a societal level such that his actions seem horrific and unthinkable.
 
As a mirror in which to observe humanity, zombies are startlingly effective, not just in “Cargo” but in nearly all of their various iterations. They act as a vaguely humanoid blank slate whose insatiable lust for flesh can be interpreted into a wide array of flaws. The shambling dead have over the decades embodied such total opposites as mindless communism and greedy consumerism, complete apathy and brutal aggression, as the societal situation demands new interpretations. In fact, theories abound online about how the undead in general and zombies specifically reflect the current political climate; for instance, much has been written about the media’s alternating fascination with zombies and with vampires (this year’s pretty evidently a zombie year). For the most part, though, these commentators agree on one thing: we fear zombies because they are, at their most basic level, human but not human beings, a physical facsimile without the emotions on which we depend, which allows us to imbue them with the essence of what we fear most at a given time.
Put simply, “Cargo” succeeds because it eschews the urge to read some deeper symbolism into the zombie apocalypse and instead embraces zombies’ meaning on their own as the ultimate negation of what it means to be human. In the face of zombification, we see a man wordlessly struggle to preserve those elements he fears he will lose. Rather than illuminating that which we fear or hate, it becomes a study of perseverance, ingenuity, and, most powerfully, compassion. “Cargo” ultimately uses its unconventional approach towards its antagonists to strike a deeply resonant chord, one that both is timeless and, unfortunately, became once more extremely timely this past week: it is precisely when must face the worst, whatever that may be, that we as a species will always find the best in ourselves.

In the beginning, there was Coleman Hawkins. Coleman Hawkins begat Ben Webster. And Ben Webster begat Lester Young, and Lester Young begat Charlie Parker. And Charlie Parker begat Dexter Gordon, and Dexter Gordon begat Sonny Rollins. And Sonny Rollins begat John Coltrane, and John Coltrane begat Wayne Shorter. And Wayne Shorter begat Joe Henderson, and Joe Henderson begat Michael Brecker. And Michael Brecker begat Chris Potter.
 
Do you see anything problematic about the above jazz saxophone genealogy? 
 
Unlike a hereditary genealogy, artistic genealogies are practically impossible to draw convincingly. Art doesn’t move through time in a straight line; it doesn’t even move forward or backward as we conventionally understand what comes before or after. And pairings and confluences of influence occur all the time that would be temporally impossible in hereditary genealogy, made possible by recording technology: the great-grandson might be partially begat by his great-grandfather, but also by his once-removed great-uncle. Tracing the line of influence for an artist is more often than not tracing the knotted tangents and incestuous, polyamorous ties that contribute to the emergence of an individual voice.
 
I don’t presume to be anything more than a student of the jazz saxophone tradition, but in my few years of study I’ve benefited immensely from drawing my own map of the historical territory. Of course, ignorance and misinformation are par for the course, but it’s been an invaluable exercise to try to orient myself while navigating the unspeakably diverse collection of voices that define the legacy of the jazz saxophone. Please forgive any omissions on my part; some saxophonists I left out intentionally for the sake of space, and many more I’ve left out simply because I haven’t gotten hip enough for them yet.
 
Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker
 
The typical story is that Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young came together as contrasting influences—r and Lester Young as a rhythmic and stylistic innovator—and begat Charlie Parker, the symbol and definitive voice of bebop in the ’40s, alongside Dizzy Gillespie, until Parker’s death in ’55. Hawkins had already been the dominant voice on his instrument, the tenor saxophone, when Lester Young emerged as a leading soloist in Count Basie’s big band in Kansas City (c. 1933).
 
I tend to associate Hawkins with a number of other tenor players of the era who played with an explicitly forceful swing feel and a rather heavy, expansive tone with a generous amount of vibrato in their sounds: Don Byas (also an influence on Parker), Ben Webster, and later Paul Gonsalves come to mind. Young, who had a buoyant sense of time that was just as propulsive as Hawkins’s but less explicitly so—achieved through the rhythmic motifs and syncopations within his lines rather than in the articulation of the notes themselves—is generically described as having a light, airy sound with almost no vibrato, i.e., a “cool” counterpart to Hawkins’s “hot” sound.
 
Dexter Gordon
While Charlie Parker was indisputably the first proponent of bebop on the alto saxophone, Gordon is generally considered the first leading player of bebop on the tenor saxophone. He was also influenced heavily by Lester Young’s sense of melody and time, and he used far less vibrato than either Young or Hawkins; his sound is also harder, more square than round compared to his tenor antecedents, which would be a hallmark of his legacy in the tradition of the tenor saxophone sound.
 
Sonny Rollins
Although John Coltrane was born before either Sonny Rollins or Stan Getz, his emergence as an innovator and leading saxophonist of his generation came relatively late behind Rollins and Getz. In fact, although they were all peers, Rollins and Getz were each initially major figures with whom Coltrane had to contend when developing his own approach and his own sound. Rollins grew up in Harlem in the ’30s and ’40s among both peers and older figures, including Hawkins, and by 21 was recording the next generation of bebop with Miles Davis. His indebtedness to Charlie Parker’s rhythmic and harmonic innovations is undeniable, and he’s generally considered the tenor saxophonist whose approach to rhythm was most similar to Parker’s own.
 
Stan Getz
Stan Getz came up through Woody Herman’s big band in the late ’40s. He had his big break after his solo on the ballad “Early Autumn,” which made him a household name.  A musical descendant of Lester Young with regards to tone and melodic phrasing, Getz and a number of other white saxophonists of the era (Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Jimmy Giuffre, Paul Desmond) are often lumped together, but each diverged towards separate paths as they matured. Coltrane is famously quoted as saying of Getz, “We’d all sound like that if we could.”
 
John Coltrane
There are early recordings of Coltrane playing alto saxophone during his years in the Navy. His playing is a poor imitation of Charlie Parker’s, and there is no sense that this musician would later become, arguably, the most influential jazz musician of the past 50 years. When he replaced Sonny Rollins in Miles Davis’s band in the ’50s, critics almost unanimously registered their dissatisfaction with this largely unknown saxophonist, who they criticized for unsophisticated harmonic choices and general inconsistency of playing. But between ’57, when he recorded “Blue Train,” and ’59, when he recorded “Giant Steps,” Coltrane’s harmonic innovations thrust him to the forefront of saxophonists, where he maintained a monolithic presence until he succumbed to liver cancer only a decade later.
 
Joe Henderson & Wayne Shorter
In the post-Coltrane era, Joe Henderson and Wayne Shorter emerged as major instrumental stylists and composers of the ’60s—Henderson, whose melodic and rhythm approach synthesized Coltrane’s recent innovations but derived fundamentally from the Lester Young lineage, and Wayne Shorter as initially a Coltrane imitator who quickly transcended that label by developing an idiosyncratically mysterious and nonconventional approach to composition that broke traditional expectations for harmony and form.
 
Michael Brecker & Joe Lovano
In the ’50s, a generation of predominantly white saxophonists influenced by Coltrane and Rollins was born. Michael Brecker, who pushed the technical bounds of range and velocity, was one major pole of influence with his bright, laser-focused sound (Bob Mintzer and Bob Berg are two sonically sympathetic peers). Joe Lovano is perhaps the other most visible saxophonist of that generation; his harmonic language is just as sophisticated as Brecker’s, but he presents this information in a way that more explicitly synthesized these technical innovations with an aesthetic recalling the pre-WWII tenorists. Rich Perry, Dave Liebman, Jerry Bergonzi, and George Garzone are peers who each developed highly idiosyncratic styles.
 
’80s-’90s 
In the ’60s, saxophonists who would come of age in the Young Lion era of the ’80s, were born. The Young Lion era was the era of a neo-traditional revival represented by Wynton Marsalis, which was really just a return to the mainstream acoustic aesthetic of the ’50s and early ’60s, prior to innovative projects in the late ’60s and ’70s that incorporated electric instruments, rock and other emerging American music, and non-Western musical influences. In my mind, alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett and tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Potter have been the most influential to saxophonists of my generation and the generation before.
 
’00s-’10s 
A new generation of saxophonists born in the ’70s has begun to displace the otherwise overwhelming mainstream influence of Mark Turner, Chris Potter, and Kenny Garrett. I’d count Miguel Zenon, Ben Wendel, and Walter Smith III as three of the most visible today—again, an altoist and two tenorists—but other innovative saxophonists like Rudresh Mahanthappa, born the same year as Potter, are only lately receiving their due from the mainstream jazz press.
 
This problem of delayed recognition greatly complicates any reasonable approximation of saxophonic influence; for instance, even though Mark Turner is now one of the most widely imitated saxophonists for his dry, stoic sound and harmonic ingenuity, he only became well-known in the late ’90s—long after Garrett, Joshua Redman '91, and others had been important figures on the mainstream jazz scene.

Every year around the time that trees burst into bloom and 17-year-olds across the country weigh admissions offers from Harvard and a school in Connecticut, an ensemble of first-years put on a one-of-a-kind show: the Freshman Musical. Colorful, farcical, and often raunchy, the musical—affectionately dubbed the “Froshical”— has become a Harvard tradition. Founded in 1996 by the Class of 1999 with the show “Shakespeare in the Yard,” the Freshman Musical is different from other productions on campus in that is that it is entirely written, directed, produced, composed, performed, designed, choreographed, orchestrated, and staged by Harvard freshmen. This year’s Froshical, “What the Hell?!” played until Sunday at the Agassiz Theatre. The musical was especially humorous and well put-together, with near professional performances and sophisticated references.
“What the Hell?!” took the tradition to new depths with a show that was witty, flashy, and an enjoyable romp through the fiery but not overly gruesome world of Hades. The journey into the inferno kicks off not when a character kicks the bucket, but when he falls in love—or lust—with glamorous college heartthrob Kylie O’Kelly (Kyra T. Weeks ’16). Lovestruck Zak Smith (AJ Unitas Jr. ’16) makes the turbulent journey to Hell with his bro-mantic partner Rutherford Crutch (Eli K. Rivas ’16) after Kylie tells him she will only date him “when hell freezes over.” Hell is located—where else?—off the New Jersey turnpike, and, determined to win Kylie’s affections at all costs, Zak and Rutherford try to go to hell and back.
Among the high points of the show was the deadpan, sardonic performance of Rivas in the role of a gay best friend who declares that he is “not ‘sassy,’ ‘angry.’ There’s a difference.” Also noteworthy were the jovial, enthusiastic performance of Randa R. Melhem ’16 as evil demon lord the Greedy Pig, and the vocal abilities of Madison M. Dildine ’16 in the role of Hell’s tour guide, Charon, whose peppy performance was part Olivia Newton-John, part Elle Woods.
Some of the show’s humor comes from its self-awareness that it is, in fact, a musical, as seen in the jazzy number “Montage Song,” in which characters zipped swiftly through the nine circles of Hell ahead of an acknowledged imminent intermission. The journey was punctuated by Kylie’s occasional literary criticism—made possible by the fact that this icy vixen is an English major.
In a show with so many moving parts, the chorus can sometimes be neglected, but in “What the Hell?!” its role is well timed, well rehearsed, and funny. Choreography by Olivia M. Munk ’16, a Crimson Magazine editor and the skillful performance of the pit orchestra, in particular the saxophone and cello parts, made the cohesion of the show possible. Writer Mike C. Ross ’16 has crafted a smart and witty play, filled with allusions to Virgil, references to Greek heroes and discussion of literary devices. Despite these arcane references, the show is still very funny.
For a musical about Hell, “What the Hell?!” is strikingly uplifting. It’s a world where Satan (Brad A. Latilla-Campbell ’16) is a socially isolated failure, and where the most gruesome scene is an attack with hockey sticks. Despite using political messages as a source of humor—much was made of Hell’s ill-advised decision to “go corporate,” and the Greedy Pig demon lord kept workers at Walmart non-unionized—the show did not moralize to the audience. It ended on a happy note with the message that true friendship conquers all and that, as Unitas cheerfully belts out, one ought not “think with [one’s] penis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last week, Amy Poehler’s poignant “I Love You Boston” video made its way around the internet. Amidst anxiety and trauma, she answered teenage Millie’s submitted question: how can we positively engage with the constant images of our media-saturated world?
“It's been tough, hasn't it?” she says. “Doesn't it feel like we're just bombarded with stuff now? That everywhere we go there's just some picture that's worse than the one before? I wonder if we could soften our hearts and minds and eyes. I wonder if we could give our eyes a break.”
The clip is the latest installment of Poehler’s advice series, “Ask Amy,” which airs on “Smart Girls at the Party,” her web network geared towards young women. But the honesty of her message last week, as in many of the show’s installments, resonated strongly even with those outside that demographic.
In the soundbite age, it’s rare to encounter such honesty, particularly from our public figures. When politicians misstep, they issue formulaic apologies. When celebrities give interviews, they offer canned, publicist-penned answers. Reality television is immensely popular, but there’s no sign of “reality” within them. Those that feature “real life” contestants, as seen in series like “The Real Housewives,” replace any recognizable world with one of melodramatic expose. So-called “self-improvement” shows like “The Biggest Loser” and “Extreme Makeover” take different contestants and actively try to change their physical appearances to fit a very narrow, normative definition of beauty. Celebrity series like “Celebrity Apprentice” don’t showcase individual thought or talent, but rather throw recognizable faces into prescribed gimmicks.
It's this backdrop that makes Poehler's online work so fresh and vital. Her network was born out of the original anchor series “Smart Girls at the Party,” which ran for a season in 2008 available through ON Networks and then returned to YouTube in July 2012. The show features Poehler interviewing girls and women about their interests and accomplishments. Early episodes showcase a teenage glassblower and a seven-year-old feminist, and more recent episodes feature award-winning web series My Damn Channel’s host Grace Helbig and veteran comedy writer Irma Kalish. Poehler doesn’t take her guests and throw them into some kind of game show scenario. She level-headedly speaks with people whose lives align with the show’s motto: “Change the world by being yourself.”
When Poehler, along with show producer Meredith Walker and musical director Amy Miles, expanded the show into a network, they added a roster of new series, including “Ask Amy”—arguably the most impressive display of reality TV realness. While we’re used to magazines like “Seventeen” featuring problematic celebrity advice columns on how to wear makeup or attract boys, Poehler instead addresses heavier topics like anxiety, letting go, and insecurity. (See her disdain for teen magazine questions in this amazing gem).
The original “Smart Girls” reverses reality TV contestant tropes by allowing guests to just be themselves. “Ask Amy” gives us something we see even less: a celebrity shedding her distance and getting intimate with her viewers. Poehler answers the questions sitting in empty spots in her house—a couch, the floor, sometimes the bathtub. She wears casual clothing, with little or no makeup, and answers questions offhand rather than from a prepared script. In the end of one episode, her toddler runs into the shot.
Viewers respond to this intimacy. In life, we often turn to books or television when we’re lonely or confused. We’re looking not only for the cold hard facts of “what to do,” but also for an emotional connection. When Poehler sits a few inches away from her laptop camera—speaking openly about personal struggles, emotionally invested almost to the point of tears—we don’t only hear her words.  We also feel that comforting presence.
Ratings may prove that viewers enjoy sensationalist programming. But the response to Poehler’s Boston video suggests that there may also be more room for the steady voices we look to in times of need. I look forward to a future filled with series that embrace genuine emotion. In the meantime, I’ll be watching more “Smart Girls.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Feb. 21, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the last name of the show's producer. In fact, it was Meredith Walker.

Given the events that have played out in Boston in the past week, it is a testament to power of the HRDC’s production of Tennessee Williams’s “A Streetcar Named Desire,” which ran through Saturday in the Adams Pool Theatre, that it was so completely able to transport the audience. From the moment Blanche (Ema H. Horvath ’16) stepped onstage and looked around with incredulity at an apartment ironically situated on Elysian Fields Avenue, the production, directed by Sayantan Deb ’14, crackled with energy, anger, and suppressed hysteria, transfixing by the sheer force of the actors’ charisma.
Blanche DuBois arrives in sultry New Orleans at the doorstep of her sister Stella (Olivia L. Ball ’14), looking for a place to stay after “losing” the plantation that had been in their family for centuries, the aptly-named Belle Reve. Her pretensions, however, are entirely intact, and Blanche makes clear from the first that she is hardly pleased with her sister’s cramped apartment. Nor is there much love lost between her and Stanley (Peter K. Bestoso ’14), Stella’s husband, who bristles under Blanche’s judgment and is convinced that she’s hiding something. Crammed together in a stifling apartment for a summer, it’s only a matter of time before anger boils over. The set, designed by Jihyun Ro ’15, a Crimson Arts editor, added to the mounting conflict with its claustrophobic furnishing: the only thing separating the apartment’s two rooms was a flimsy, semi-transparent curtain, destroying any sense of privacy the characters might have.
The irreconcilable differences between Blanche and her brother-in-law are the powder keg at the center of the play, and Horvath and Bestoso effortlessly pulled off this crucial dynamic. Deb decided to have Blanche’s monologues directed not towards the other characters, but towards the audience, a choice that heightened the sense that she is losing her grip on her sanity. Horvath seemed to be trying to convince herself of what she was saying as much as trying to convince others. In contrast to Blanche’s dreamy idealism, Stanley is rooted in reality. The gulf between the two characters was captured even in the way the characters spoke. Horvath, with her languorous drawl and wide-eyed, self-important speeches, conveyed Blanche’s delusions of grandeur and desperate pining to return to her youth. Horvath’s delivery of Blanche’s many sarcastic barbs was excellent as well, distilling years’ worth of bitterness into one or two snide words.
Bestoso’s Stanley, on the other hand, was all quick talk, grinning slyly with amused skepticism at his in-law’s grand schemes—he values frankness above all else, a fact that brings him quickly into conflict with his wife’s less-than-honest sister. In one scene, Blanche swanned around the living room in a ballgown and boa, blithely spinning a tale about an admirer of hers while Stanley, in a sweat-soaked wifebeater, glowered angrily at having to hear more of her lies, the divide between them as stark as the curtain drawn between their two rooms. Here, as elsewhere in the play, the sense of resentment was palpable: Bestoso’s Stanley was a volcano constantly threatening to erupt. Though there were plenty of instances in the play where Stanley’s rage found a violent outlet, Bestoso was able to create an atmosphere of unease and impending brutality even when none was explicitly threatened, capturing Stanley’s animal energy and overwhelming need for control.
Standing between the two of them is Stella, who tries and fails to be a peacemaker. Ball’s Stella was far more calm and subdued than Blanche, constantly looking to shelter her sister and her fragile emotional state. Yet Ball did not portray her character as a saint—her Stella was not Stanley’s victim, but emphatically his lover. Misguided though her affections may be, they were no less believable: the misty look in Ball’s eyes when she described Stanley was enough to convey the reality of Stella’s love. She and Bestoso had powerful chemistry, lending credence to Stella’s repeated assertion that she’s “not in anything she wants to get out of.”
Mitch (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15, a Crimson Arts columnist), Blanche’s admirer, is the opposite of Stanley: where Stanley is the epitome of unbridled masculine energy, Mitch seems like an overgrown child, nervous and tentative. With puppyish eyes and a voice high and full of boyish eagerness to please, Venook’s portrayal of Mitch resonated with Blanche’s past: she was fired from her job as a teacher for having an affair with a student. Her pairing with Mitch heightened the poignancy of Blanche’s decline.
With subtlety, emotional understanding, and raw power, Deb’s production did justice to this icon of American theater, capably teasing out the many conflicts that lie at the center of the play: reality versus fantasy, restraint versus physicality, the unattainable past versus the shock of modernity.

In the lead-up to the release of “Bankrupt!,” it’s become clear that the Phoenix marketing team is probably as good at whipping up rabid anticipation among fans as the group is at writing songs. The most definitive evidence came a little over a week ago. At the end of their Coachella set, the group invited a much-anticipated surprise guest on stage. Everybody thought it would be Daft Punk. Instead, R. Kelly emerged to sing a live mash-up of “1901” and “Ignition (Remix).” Frontman Thomas Mars stood at the back of the stage looking aimless. Record execs likely began popping Cristal in stretch Navigators. And then the internet blew up.
The gesture seems a neat encapsulation of Phoenix’s latest release, “Bankrupt!” The album is a collection of mostly well-produced, hypnotically rhythmic, and catchy songs, but they feel strangely extroverted, trendy, and bombastic. Breakout albums “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” and “It’s Never Been Like That” managed to be simultaneously joyful and bittersweet—beautiful, tightly constructed pop concoctions. “Bankrupt!” verges on being unbearably hip.
This album is less personal than some of the group’s more recent releases. Lyrically, the focus is on status-obsessed characters (mostly unattainable women) of the sort one probably meets a lot in the band’s hometown, Versailles, France. Like all Phoenix albums, though, the lyrics are nearly incomprehensible and always secondary to the music. Yet, the subject matter jars with Phoenix’s signature tone. Throughout the album, Phoenix shie from unleashing the unadulterated joy and bittersweetness they’ve marked as uniquely theirs over the past decade. Instead, they cloister such moments in small choruses or brief climactic releases. The guilelessness of their first two records seems an almost shameful tendency in the context of this more ironic record. It’s still fun, and it still sounds like Phoenix, yet somehow they feel absent.
Aside from such rare moments of release, the album’s strongest points are its swaggering grooves. Gone are the warm, breathy synths of the past two records. In their place, the group substitutes saturated bass sounds and heavy drums, pushing the lighter syncopated guitars to the back of the mix. “Trying to be Cool” rides a slow-burning bass part as Mars sings the impossibly catchy, taunting refrain “Tell me that you want me / Tell me that you want it all.” You can practically hear him sneer through the speakers. In such moments, the group admirably displays its love for American R&B and soul.
“Drakkar Noir” shows the same formula gone awry, though. Its title is taken from an expensive men’s fragrance, and, though the mostly impenetrable, glossolalic lyrics—“In the jangle jungle / Jingle junkie, juggle juggle me”—maintain a critical distance from its title’s frivolity, the song still feels strangely empty. Like most of the album, the soundscape is built on muddy, psychedelic synthesizers reminiscent of Neon Indian. It’s loud, fussy, and largely forgettable. For about thirty seconds at the end, though, the song surges on Thomas Hedlund’s pounding toms to a blissful climax.
The end of “Drakkar Noir” succeeds because Mars and the group open up. The band unleashes the full force of its tight rhythm section in a joyfully frantic build as Mars wistfully crows, “How I wish I knew you from before.” But the release is all too brief and follows a mostly unremarkable, assaulting song. Similarly, “Bourgeois” opens with a glistening synth line that swells into one of the album’s most ecstatic moments just before pulling back to a somber acoustic part where Mars sings of yet another status-obsessed woman. She is also unattainable. When the opening returns as the chorus, it’s accompanied with a melodic hook—Mars singing the song’s title.
The penultimate spot on “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” went to “Girlfriend,” a song only Phoenix could write. The lyrics are actually impossible to understand, and an official set doesn’t exist online. There’s a pretty broad divergence between versions, especially on the second verse. Two dominant interpretations are “Well, you’re far from home / I am with you now. / I am lonely / I’m loneliness, too” and “We are far from home / I am with you now / I am longing you / I am longing us two.” The way the song sounds, it could be either. It contains both a lonely hurt and a loving joy—it could be a break-up song or the celebration of someone beloved. That fullness and emotional expanse combined with unbeatably enjoyable music always made Phoenix’s songs feel as if something is at stake—like the songs really mattered, and that Mars’s lyrics would too if you could just understand them. “Bankrupt!” is still catchy, and it’s good to drive or dance to. But it feels like it matters less.

"Get Lucky"
Daft Punk, "Random Access Memories"
THEY. FINALLY. RELEASED. IT. Daft Punk went ahead and pleased long-waiting fans with their dance-friendly new single, preparing their listeners for endless chill time as they stay “up all night to get lucky.” Though the song is heavily repetitive, “Get Lucky” is catchy enough that fans will be happy to hear the duo’s groove as many times as it plays. Pharrell Williams lends his angelic voice to the single, and his unique talent for keeping laid-back vocals in time maintains the beat throughout, while Nile Rodgers lends his talent. “Get Lucky” is Daft Punk for a new era—they’ve developed a more analog sound without sacrificing any of their ability to bring listeners out to the dance floor.
"Come & Get It"
Selena Gomez
If Selena Gomez is growing up, she’s also branching out. Instead of her usual simplistic bubblegum pop, it seems that Disney’s It-girl has left hip-hop Biebs behind and moved her sound in her own, more varied direction. Rihanna-esque “eh-eh’s” and “na na na na’s” mixed with a standard club bass give the song enough of a chart-topping pop feel to invade summer radio waves, but a mid-song breakdown and the more experimental intro vocals introduce varied and fresh facets to the classic teen diva pop song.
"Girls Love Beyonce"
Drake ft. James Fauntleroy 
Drake needs love, and he takes the legendary “Say My Name” hook to plead with the world to give him someone who will “keep him from going out every night.” In a brilliant twist, he and James Fauntleroy take the classic Destiny’s Child song and make it into a plea for real love. With a slow groove and Drizzy’s trademark sing-talk, Drake seems to have grown up. If this track is any indication, he may be ready to move out of Young Money’s camp and into his own kind of R&B sound.

There is nothing trickier than a cover song. When an artist is so bold as to rework a hit, I am automatically overcome with an unusual combination of doubt and what can only be described as rage as to why someone would think that he could do a more effective job than the original. For most listeners, the idea of cover songs is stained by their reputation of being repetitive and unfulfilling. But then, I remember the wonder I feel when hearing one of those life-changing original  tracks for the first time: a song so good that I replay it until I know it so well that I can pinpoint precisely when the muted horns begin to sound. All of us music-lovers have those tracks and would give anything to relive those moments just one more time. Recalling those instances makes me wonder if it would be possible for an artist to achieve this same kind of wonder in a cover. Thus, I feel compelled to listen just in pursuit of this feeling—a feeling which is really the lifeblood of any music fan.
Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah” did this for me, reinvigorating the body-consuming aur-gasm I felt when hearing Leonard Cohen’s version for the first time. Cohen’s hymnal “Hallelujah” touches on everything, from religion to sex to sorrow. But his ballads are somehow artfully restrained alongside such powerful words, making “Hallelujah” one of those all-encompassing tracks that can be played for many situations. The song was perfect to me, and my mind was blown when Buckley’s angelic falsetto reached heights I had not known before, taking “Hallelujah” to the ethereal place for which its lyrics beckon. The simple guitar, unaccompanied by Cohen’s back-up singers, provides a flawless background for Buckley’s melancholy vibrato, making the song free with his far-reaching vocals and heart-melting, all at the same time.
In contrast to Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” Bob Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love” did not impress me in its original form. It was unlike anything I had heard from Dylan before, and most Dylan fans agree: the song seems to directly express his feelings, a contrast to the exciting puzzle Dylan fans usually experience when trying to dissect meaning from his lyrics. The song feels ordinary. Unusually ordinary. But “ordinary” does not mean entirely bad, as the guitar still manages to flirt beautifully with a classic country style, slowly accompanying Dylan as he sings, “When the rain is blowing in your face / And the whole world is on your case / I Could offer you a warm embrace / To make you feel my love.” This song made an impression on me the first time I heard it not because it was the greatest love song ever played, but because it seemed to be exactly what it presented itself to be: a standard feel-good love song. This same understanding occurred when Billy Joel covered it, and Garth Brooks, and Neil Diamond. It wasn’t Dylan’s best, but it certainly wasn’t his worst. Yet, it certainly was not a favorite of mine.
But then I heard that same, soft melody on the piano. It took me a minute to realize that I was listening to a cover of the same song, as the piano turns this uneventful track into something bold and assertive. And maybe I’m just a sucker for piano ballads, but the power behind this song can’t be argued with once Adele finally chimes in. The piano is the subtle but robust mise-en-scène to Adele’s impassioned performance. Just as the instruments were the background for Dylan, the piano allows Adele’s voice to carry the song, but in an entirely different way.
The simplicity of the chords and Dylan’s delivery is nowhere to be found in Adele’s cover, as she interprets the song with a darker, more complex approach. Adele isn’t singing to her lover in a moment of honeymooning bliss; she is reminiscing. She sings about love lost. Just as I thought I understood a song in its entirety, a few vocal runs and a couple chords later, my understanding had been flipped sideways.
What’s more mind-blowing than the idea of entirely re-making a perfectly good song (especially when the original belongs to a legend), though, is an artist’s ability to rework it so much so that it takes on an entirely different meaning. Perhaps this is even more difficult when the original is a classic hit like White Stripes’s “Seven Nation Army.” The simple bass line that introduces the song immediately sets the stage for the gnarled guitar/drum buildup and subsequent explosion that defines the White Stripes’s classic repertoire. Jack White’s vocals are as emotionally charged as ever, challenging gossip mongers to step back: “I’m gonna fight ’em off / A seven nation army couldn’t hold me back.” The rage with which White delivers these words is so perfect, it’s almost dirty.
Who knew that the fury could escape “Seven Nation Army” without hearing it firsthand from French soul man Ben L’Oncle Soul himself? Why he has yet to explode on the American music scene is beyond me, and skeptics should look no further than this cover for evidence of this modern-day Steve Wonder’s ability to turn any song, even one filled with indignation, into a sexy, retro, soulful hit.
L’Oncle Soul’s cover begins with the faint pop and crackle of vinyl spinning, with the infamous “Seven Nation Army” bass perpetually carrying the song throughout. The bevy of instruments used to achieve this soulful sound is no joke, with the piano, organs, and horns delivering a tone reminiscent of any Temptations track. This ’60s vibe is only enhanced by Soul’s voice, which delivers the White Stripes’s words so casually and with such ease that it begins to sound like a Motown love song, an unfamiliar divergence from White’s outcry of fury. L’Oncle Soul’s cover is so transformed that we begin to forget that it isn’t an original.
Covers can be so many things; they can be new and exciting, at times boring and disappointing, or wonderful and nostalgic. Whatever the combination of feelings may be, we begin to see music differently—or rather, we hear it differently. Whether you dismiss a cover in its entirety for not measuring up to the original or you have a new allegiance to an artist whom you’d never heard of before, covers move us to analyze and appreciate. A challenge to what we already know (or what we think we know) forces us to think critically about our choices and tastes. And that, alone, is worth listening to.

Hot off the heels of an impressive album with the Delfonics’s William Hart, a jazz enthusiast who helped establish hip-hop as a genre, Adrian Younge is back with a new collaborator. This time, it is none other than Ghostface Killah, an esteemed member of the seminal New York hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. Their pairing is certainly a match made in heaven—“Twelve Reasons to Die” integrates Younge’s masterful compositions with Ghostface Killah’s impeccable delivery for an ambitious and impressive concept album.
 
“Twelve Reasons to Die,” in a grotesque style reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino, tells a revenge story of a mafia boss, Tony Starks, who forms his own syndicate after betraying the DeLuca family. Unbeknownst to Starks, the DeLucas exploit their array of disposable men and pretty women to extract their revenge and fashion Starks’s melted body into twelve vinyl records. “But little did they know / He [Starks] would return,” as the Ghostface Killah when the records are played, ready to extract his bloody revenge.
 
Younge’s production plays an integral role in the success of this album. The arrangement constantly alludes to the roots of hip-hop, but is most prominent in two songs–“Enemies All Around Me” and “Revenge is Sweet.” For those familiar with Younge’s work, the composition of “Enemies All Around Me” will sound familiar, as Ghostface Killah raps over “Enemies,” a dark song from Younge’s previous album with the Delfonics. Whereas the murky, threatening track was rather distinct and perhaps out of place in the Delfonics collection, the crazed melodies fit right in with the haunting atmosphere that Younge and Ghostface Killah have created. Hart’s interjected falsetto and chorus complements the anguish in Ghostface Killah’s verses after being betrayed, and this crossover between two hip-hop revolutionaries easily makes this one of the album’s best songs.
 
“Revenge Is Sweet” intertwines classic Delfonic jazz with contemporary hip-hop beats for a successful single. The song begins with a heavy bass line and a soft, choral sequence characteristic of the Delfonics before escalating into a crescendo with interplaying male and female voices. Ghostface Killah kicks in midway through the song, delivering frantic, charged verses. With lyrics such as “Ay yo, revenge is sweet / That’s why I take my time with it,” Ghostface successfully exposes Starks’s elation at his new quest. Younge also arranges the song such that it concludes with the overlaid male and female tracks with which the song began. This symmetrical arrangement places Younge and Killah’s hip-hop in perspective: the album is heavily contemporary at its core, with Ghostface Killah as the narrator, but the classic arrangements and influences—the brainchildren of Younge—add depth to Ghostface Killah’s already sophisticated approach to the genre.
 
That said, what makes this album great may also be what keeps it obscure. As a concept album with a linear story, the emphasis is on the integrity of the narrative as opposed to number of chart topping hits—tracks themselves are not meant to be standalone pieces. Songs from this album wouldn’t find their way into mainstream radio channels; as individual tracks, taken out of context, sound outright confusing—“I heard the DeLucas laughin’ and then shit got hot / They said ‘Die Tony Starks, you gonna melt like a record.’” As a collection, however, the album is extremely successful, and this minor identity crisis can be overlooked. What Younge and Ghostface Killah have created here is a masterpiece, and the sound of eerie, drafty wind overlaid with the ominous, repetitive piano sequence in the concluding track caps off a soon-to-be horror classic.
 
“Twelve Reasons to Die” gives us a glimpse of hip-hop at its best. Working within their genre, which has a rich history of contemporary and classic forms, Adrian Younge and Ghostface Killah  understand the capabilities of hip-hop as a storytelling tool and have created a narrative-driven masterwork. “Twelve Reasons to Die” is an excellent testament to hip-hop’s mutability.

Ever since she was a little girl growing up in Norfolk, England, Georgina B. Parfitt ’13 knew she wanted to be a writer. “I used to write stories at school, and it was kind of the first thing that I got praised for or encouragement in, which was a special thing for me,” Parfitt says. “Fiction has always been part of my life. I knew when I got [to Harvard], I wanted to write and wanted to figure out how to do that here on campus.”
The English concentrator spent her senior year writing a creative thesis, “Edward’s House,” a novella in which 30 people, 10 years estranged, are reunited in a house memorable to all of them. “It was kind of an experiment for me because I’ve never written a long-form piece before. I’ve written short fiction and longer short fiction, so it was a challenge to put a plot in place that would keep someone reading it.” With a piece of work under her belt, Parfitt still has plans for her novella. “[Writing the thesis] was a very pressurized process, but now going back through the novella, I have ideas to make it a more publishable animal,” she says.
Parfitt’s talents extend beyond ink and paper. Since she performed in her first show her freshman year, theater has been part of her life. Last year, Parfitt directed her own play, “The Dragons are Dead,” in the Adams Pool Theater. This year, she will be the puppeteer for the play “Sea Change,” which will be put on at the Loeb Drama Center during Arts First. “What I’m trying to do at the moment is realize how my theater life and my writing life can be put together in my career,” she says. An avid poetry reader and film watcher, Parfitt draws on other areas of art to improve her writer’s sense. “I always felt the craft of writing—the kind of chemistry that happens when you put some word next to another word and something happens. I try to put my experiences with different disciplines into my fiction.”

Kelly K.W. Lam ’13 holds a piano book in her lap. “It’s a collection of Chopin nocturnes,” she says. “They’re always fun to play, especially when you are in a contemplative mood.” Lam admits that her bedroom is littered with piano books—her ability to play was already well developed by the time she reached college. However, Lam’s main musical interest since she began at Harvard has been singing.
“When I came, I just really wanted to try something new,” Lam says. “I wanted to expand my horizons. For me, singing was just so intriguing—it’s a kind of connection between your bodily and spiritual and musical selves. To me, that was mind-blowing. Even today, I think there is something really cool about singing that no other instrument can have.”
Her freshman year, Lam started from scratch. “I got interested because my roommate here was a singer. I joined the choir she was in—the Harvard University Choir—and then started taking lessons. Now I sing pretty much every day. It’s been a great experience.”
Every Sunday, Lam sings with the Choir at the Memorial Church service. This week, for Arts First, the Choir will be performing Bach’s B minor Mass. “It’s a gigantic work with many challenging choruses. It’s very musically challenging and diverse in terms of styles,” Lam says. She will also perform a series of a cappella numbers with the Choir’s subset, Choral Fellows, and will have her own solo performance.
Music seemed to encompass all aspects of Lam’s senior year. A history of art and architecture concentrator, Lam has been able to interweave her extracurricular interests and her academic work. “I wrote my thesis on the role of music in Venetian Renaissance paintings and how paintings can have musical qualities,” Lam says. “I was very interested in how music plays itself out in the realm of art.”

For Benjamin M. Woo ’13, who began playing the piano when he was seven years old, his interest in composing has always followed his study of performance. “I always had an eye for composing because the composers were the ones I really admired when I was playing their music,” Woo says. “I wanted to do that for a long time and tried from a really long time, but was never happy with the outcome.”
Woo’s desire to compose music was further heightened after he took an introductory music composition course his freshman year. “Since then, I’ve kept at it and am just starting to get to a point where I feel like I can write something and present it as a composition,” Woo says. “I normally start by sitting at the piano and improvising for a while. Whenever I come across some musical idea that feels likes it’s going somewhere, like it has some sort of life to it, then I’ll write that down. Every once in a while, something I write down actually develops into something.”
Last semester, he finished a three-minute piece entitled “As in Stone.” Woo describes it as written for four unspecified musical lines. “It’s very slow and simple and kind of mirrored my mood at the time, I guess.”
A pianist, cellist, and music director of the Din & Tonics a cappella group, with whom he will perform during Arts First, Woo identifies as a composer—but even to him, that title sounds a bit strange. “Composer evokes classical European guys, and that’s not exactly the sense in which I think of it,” Woo says. For him, the goal is to write music that is accessible. “A lot of the music I love is really old and sometimes feels distant from culture today. At the same time, I also like a lot of modern music—indie rock, alternative rock, and alternative forms of experimental music. So those two worlds are constantly playing into the music I compose.”

It may not make much sense, but it lives up to its name in terms of aesthetic beauty.
“Upstream Color” comes to us after a nine-year gap from director Shane Carruth’s first film, the award-winning “Primer.” Imbued with the same science-fiction vibe as his debut, “Color” stumbles along plot alleyways and cinematic close-ups, all linked through a seemingly narcotic and ageless insect.
The plot is startlingly and mind-bogglingly confusing. Kris (Amy Seimetz) is drugged with grubs, knocked out, kidnapped, and operated on by a farmer, who seems to be doing experiments on both humans and pigs. Though tiny, these bugs feature prominently in the film, appearing again and again, lending the film a cyclical feel. Kris later meets Jeff, played by the director himself, and the film chronicles their relationship. The plot line jumps around from Kris’s paranoia to the amnesia of both Kris and Jeff, to the farmer—who also happens to be a composer who works with natural sounds—and the ever-present influence of Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” which is quoted directly in the film. All the while, the film is punctuated with beautiful color microbiological images that stream and flow throughout the plotline.
Despite the jumbled and disjointed narrative, the cinematography is so beautifully done that it makes the film a pleasure to watch, if not to understand. The content of each scene varies wildly from shot to shot, switching from a scene of Jeff and Kris getting coffee to a seemingly random panorama of the experimental pig farm with the farmer composing music in the background. However, within each individual frame, the camera’s movements match those of the people it captures, making each brief moment coherent and real within itself. When the maggots grow and multiply under Kris’s skin to the point that they crawl down the veins of her arms, the camera moves synchronously with the curling and uncurling of both the bugs and Kris’s slow convulsions, connecting the viewer with Kris and Kris with the creatures inside of her. The close-ups are artfully used to turn each shot and each scene into a moment, something to be appreciated in and of itself, more than something to be taken into the context of the entire movie.
The music is likewise perfectly timed, as is apt for a movie that features a composer as one of the characters. Every swell and beat of the piano and strings is accompanied by a change in movement or cinematography. Though the voices of the characters are occasionally purposefully out of sync with the on-screen speakers, adding to the general confusion, the music remains constant and is one of the few elements that ties the entire film together.
The colors used in the film play an important role beyond simply serving as visual appeal. The stream of colors, so to speak, is most brilliant and dazzling in the shots of nature, where we see the elemental forces of the world at work. Over time, a vibrant blue begins to emanate from the experimental pigs. When these animals end up in a river, the colors produced inside of them by the ageless bugs imbues the stream with life. This water then enters the white orchids and colors them the same vivid azure. Later, as when Kris dives in the pool for rocks and quotes “Walden,” she sees these same azure orchids as a pale, delicate yellow color spreads through them, mixing the colors. She then quotes Thoreau, “before the leaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand.”
Despite its difficult-to-follow plot, Carruth’s “Upstream Color” is a beautiful integration of cinematographic direction, musical score, and a breathtaking use of color. The movie compels the viewer to watch it again and again, not only for understanding, but for the pure appreciation of its beauty.

The recent writings of Russian poet and one-man social activist Kirill Medvedev, published this year in English translation for the first time, have an unusual extraliterary feature—their copyright has been “denied” by the author: “I have no copyright to my texts and cannot have any such right.” This extreme gesture of renunciation, a show of proud humility that is reflective of the book itself, is followed by an equally misleading title—“It’s No Good.”
But Medvedev, in his fashion, is completely serious even as he performs the seeding of such softly humorous ironies. He excels at telling the truth about the overwhelming “It” that is contemporary literature, Russia’s bleak political reality in the Putin era, and the depravity of his people—“Dostoevsky didn’t need to / make up his plots and his characters.” His bracing and often abrasive poems, which alternate with essays and political manifestos taken from Medvedev’s website, movingly consummate and resurrect a continual desire to find the bottom of things: “the most important thing is for a person to know their worth / …that’s what interests me the most.”
To achieve this holistic “truth” not only in his analysis of others but also in his own person, Medvedev erases the boundary between the poet’s personal and artistic life. It is his own personality speaking as the poems’ first-person narrator, as if each poem were a segment in a prolonged monologue. His continual use of an autobiographical “I” across the poetry and essays is an echo of Walt Whitman, from whose poem “Song of Myself” he quotes before beginning a poem of his own. As with Whitman’s poems, the ones in “It’s No Good” manage to make a powerful impression through the narrative force of his repetitions, striking juxtapositions and paradoxes, exclamations, and progression towards climatic outbursts of feeling.
Individually, the poems are like vignettes offering incisive character sketches of the hungry, lonely people he has encountered. He has no consolation for them, but what he does promise is a faithful description of both their situation and his own. When a male child prostitute approaches him and is turned away, he thinks of something that might have been said:
I want to whisper something in your ear;
no, closer, a little closer; all right:
poor little boy;
I don’t feel sorry for you at all.
I’d feel sorry for you
If you were a girl,
I’d feel sorry for you
If you were some kind of toad,
a little piglet, or a ragged chicken –
but I don’t feel sorry for you because you are a rock
a rock-person
with moss growing on you, lying for a million years
under a pale northern sun, and, in the winter,
under a cold northern wind.
Pitilessly diagnostic in his ability to gauge exactly how little he wants to help this suffering child, Medvedev’s calm voice fades out to a deserted polar landscape which seals the boy in an eternal irredeemability. These words have been unspoken on the street and are now being spoken belatedly, but still yield no pity. In place of a false empathy, Medvedev presents a new heroism in the tough love of reality.
The dark tone of his poetry, often garnished with a humor of the absurd, reflects Medvedev’s political goal of uncompromising truthfulness in creating without corroborating: “Political passivity also participates in history; it too is responsible,” he writes in an essay. In a post-Soviet world, censored and inflated with corruption, art must become political in order to sustain its own independence from politics, or risk becoming propaganda in service of the government that maintains it.
But poetry that consistently maintains a moral responsibility for the world outside must of necessity lose out on perfection in its own internal experience. It is true that Medvedev’s work inspires with its uncompromising candor, but it is also true that by definition one can only be uncompromising to one aim. And, as the aims of pure art and politics are by his own admission fundamentally irreconcilable, in straddling both of these realms his poetry risks not performing fully up to the expectations of either.
This loss is apparent in the limited scope of his work.  He has chosen to use poetry as performance and public “Actions,” rather than as an invitation to voyage into the voluptuousness of words and their implications. Though Medvedev accomplishes the essential poetic task of conveying an experience in some irreducible way, at times his transparency can become offensively exhibitionist. For example, the use of capital LETTERS in poems throughout the middle of the collection is BOMBASTIC AND OVERDONE:
I also have love,
I love the two girls
who walked by,
I love the boy
who said “cunt.”
BUT WHAT SORT OF LOVE IS THIS?
THAT’S AN INTERESTING QUESTION,
BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE
NORMAL HUMAN LOVE –
THE LOVE OF A MAN AND A WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE,
I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND SEXUAL ATTRACTION
AND LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND –
an innocent, self-negating love,
and so I ask someone far away, and also self-negating,
but he doesn’t answer – as if he’s mute or not there…
The repetitions of “love...LOVE...LOVE...love” are heavily monotonous; by the time we have left Capsland, the word “love” is numbed out of its original intensity and the poem seems thinner, as if Medvedev had performed a liposuction on it. One result is that while each poem is very powerful, most cannot be considered standalone masterpieces because the violence of the author has colored them with this political take-it-or-leave-it quality.
Medvedev has brilliantly anticipated, but not truly managed to avoid the traps of literature and politics that he so perceptively outlines in his essays. His present celebrity as the leading poet of his country is yet a fragile one, by very fact of its inimitable novelty. Having escaped the rules of the Russian publishing world to become their lonely exception, Medvedev yet risks turning out to be only a confirmation of their proof.

From a humble pipe and drape tent to a large professional gallery space, the Harvard Student Art Show has grown quickly since its inception. Now in its fifth year, the show will feature over 40 artists with more than 50 pieces in a new location at 65 Mt. Auburn Street.  As part of this weekend’s Arts First celebrations, the show opens on Thursday evening with a reception and runs an open gallery until Sunday afternoon. As in the past, this year’s show intends to provide artists across the Harvard community with a unique gallery space for their work.
According to executive directors Anna H. B. Ondaatje ’13 and C. Gamze Seten ’13, preparations for this year’s show began immediately after last year’s showcase, which was held in a different venue on Mt. Auburn Street, the space that now houses Petali Flowers. Since the show’s humble beginnings as a tent outside of the Science Center, it has occupied a variety of venues in its four years, including places such as Farkas Hall. “Every year we try to get a better space—this year we have an actual hallway gallery that is very nice,” Seten says. The space has two floors with professional track lighting that proved useful in setting up the show, she says.
One of the students in this year’s show is returning artist Kathryn C. Ryan ’13, a Crimson editorial cartoonist and art director of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Ryan has a watercolor piece featured in the show that differs stylistically from the work she typically does with the Crimson and the Lampoon, and she appreciates the opportunity that the gallery provides to showcase her original works. “There’s so many talented artists at Harvard that aren’t necessarily involved in the arts, but this is a way where they can put their pieces out there and not make any huge time commitment because it’s so well put together,” Ryan says.
In addition to watercolors, this year’s show also features prints, etchings, photography, oil paintings, video installations, sculptures, and even blown glass pieces. These pieces come from across the Harvard community, and artists hail from not only the undergraduate community, but also graduate schools and the extension school.
This year’s show also features several business innovations. Similarly to the previous year, the event benefits from corporate sponsorship by PayPal. According to Alisha S. Patel ’14, director of public relations and marketing, this year reflects the showcase’s increased focus on being a promoting the artists’ work beyond simply the gallery itself. “We’ve launched a new catalog that’s going to be a fantastic addition, because it allows both artists and visitors to take away images of the art and information about the artist,” Patel says.
Ondaatje and Seten are very excited about the ever-increasing potential of this event for the Harvard art community, especially with new features and a specialized space for the showcase this year. “One of our goals for the show…is not only creating a professional gallery space for Harvard artists to display their work, but also we want to create a sense of community in the art world at Harvard, much like there already exists for…some of the other big extracurricular categories,” Ondaatje says.

Wearing a backwards Harvard baseball cap and jeans, Zak T. Aossey ’14 sat down to speak with me about his current experience as a “pioneer” of the rap/hip-hop scene at Harvard. Expecting to release an original rap album co-produced with Carlton J. Bailey Jr. ’14 this summer, he also plays for the varsity football team and has started a nonprofit called Athletes Against Assault.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get started with music?
Zak Aossey: When I was a kid, I used to just write stuff, write down my feelings or what was wrong with the world. It was more poetry, and I’d hide it in my closet so my parents wouldn’t find it. But I’ve always loved hip-hop and rap so it just kind of developed—I started off with a lot of poetry, spoken word, and then I got into rap.
THC: What’s that like in the college environment, specifically at Harvard?
ZA: With Harvard, I feel like the fan base isn’t as big here. I feel like I’m limited in who I can market to. A lot of the athletes are very supportive of it, but it’s hard to find a lot of people who enjoy rap and hip-hop.
THC: Because you have to divide your time, do you feel like your music is sacrificed at all?
ZA: It definitely is. Some days I’ll want to just write all day and go record but it’s like, ‘oh, I have this paper due tomorrow.’ I find myself sacrificing a lot of sleep. Especially because we have to get up for football practice at 5:30 A.M., there are some nights when I only get an hour of sleep. It’s tough.
THC: What is your plan going forward?
ZA: Right now we’re focusing on my first mixtape, which will be released this summer. And then we’re going to work on an...EP as well, with the goal being that we’ll develop a lot of momentum and a fan base this summer together.
THC: Tell me about your writing process.
ZA: I’m more of a socially conscious rapper. Think like Lupe Fiasco, Nas, that type of storytelling, and then I pair that with the Slim Shady kind of stuff. I also like to write smooth tracks about relationships, stuff people can relate to.
The writing process is interesting. I’m big on freestyling. I always carry a pad of paper around with me because I never know when I’m going to get that next cool rhyme.
So that’s kind of how it starts, and then if I get a cool idea, a cool rhyme scheme, I just go with it. If I get really disturbed about something… Like with the bombings, it hit me hard, it was very emotional. I’m like, “Okay, I need to lay these feelings down into something.”
THC: What do your parents think of all of this?
ZA: They’re split. My dad was a jazz musician back in the day before taking the family route. Obviously they want some of my material to be a little less explicit. But as long as [my music] doesn’t take away from the important things, they’re supportive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Not many members of the Harvard old guard could forget 1963. Several years earlier, a Harvard capital campaign secured a gift from Alfred St. Vrain Carpenter, Class of 1905—to the tune of $1.5 million—for the construction of a new arts center on campus. Now, they could only sit back and watch as the University spent a fortune on what many regarded as a monstrosity. Modernism had come to Harvard with all the force of a hurricane.
Perhaps the conservative establishment should have seen this coming. The Graduate School of Design had appointed famed Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert as its dean in 1953. He had gone on to design a slew of bare, concrete structures in and around Cambridge, including the Holyoke Center, construction on which began in 1958. Still, the Carpenter Center—designed by famed Swiss architect and Sert’s personal friend Le Corbusier—was something altogether different. It was designed from the ground up to be a place to view and create art. With its wide, cylindrical body intersected by a huge ramp, the Carpenter Center was created to be an open, inclusive space which promoted movement and interaction by both artists and patrons. It was functionalist and utilitarian in a way that no one at Harvard had seen before.
Fifty years later the Carpenter Center still seems like an anomaly. Despite the fact that it’s now part of Harvard’s landscape, it stands in stark contrast to the classic New England red brick buildings which surround it. Still, this sense of inconsistency suits the building and the department of Visual and Environmental Studies which it houses. Unlike the rest of the University, the VES Department is tasked with training artists as well as scholars, and it very much functions like a conservatory contained within a liberal arts institution. The building’s half-centennial birthday has proven to be a perfect opportunity for self-reflection within the concentration. On Saturday, as part of the Arts First festival, the VES department will begin a film series called The Eyes Have It in which it screen works made by Harvard students over the last 50 years. The program includes works of fiction, documentary, animation, experimentation, and everything in between.
As the department reflects on its origins and seeks to define the space it occupies at Harvard, educators and students alike must grapple with the question of whether an arts department as one part of a large university really can provide budding filmmakers with what they need to pursue a career. By teaching a holistic approach to filmmaking while still engaging with Harvard's broader liberal arts curriculum, the VES department has succeeded in creating a program that educates its students both intellectually and aesthetically.
 
CONTROLLED CAMERA
 
The construction of the Carpenter Center was a watershed moment for many reasons, but primarily because it created a space in which the practice of art was elevated above its study. “The building of the Carpenter Center was very important,” says Professor Alfred Guzzetti, an acclaimed filmmaker and Visual Arts professor. “It is now 50 years old, and it is a center that is precisely dedicated to educating through doing things with your hands. Filmmaking as part of the curriculum dates back to then, to 1963.” The filmmaking program—which surprisingly predates instruction of film history and theory—grew out of the vision of a man named Robert Gardner, a well-respected documentarian who made a name for himself making ethnographic films that explored the lived experience of peoples around the world. At the time, he was the director of the Film Study Center at the Peabody Museum. Gardner envisioned a program built on documentary filmmaking and animation—an art form that he thought had a unique ability to access the mind of the artist. This spirit still pervades film instruction on campus today.
“Filmmaking is taught in a way that begins with observation of what real people do in real situations,” Guzzetti says. “So the beginning point of the curriculum for a long time has been nonfiction. That has been very important for pedagogical reasons but also for historical reasons.” The introductory class in the department, VES 50: “Introduction to Nonfiction Filmmaking,” requires students to create a documentary film. After they complete this course, they can go on into other genres, such as fiction or experimental film.
The upshot of this style of education is that there is a real emphasis on the comprehensive range of skills required to make films. “I try to give [the students] control of the medium most of all, so they can actually make the images and sounds that they have in their heads. The development of those skills is terribly important,” Guzzetti says. This also leads to courses that offer students a broad range of skills as opposed to a deep understanding of a certain specialty. This style of education stands in contrast to how the art form is taught in graduate programs and art schools. “We try to teach a type of filmmaking that is centered in one person, so one person can do it all, even in the nonfiction courses,” Guzzetti says. “In a film school the division of labor is very important because it reflects the industry. But we try to have as little division of labor as possible so everybody learns everything.”
 
AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL
 
The question remains how well this sort of educational philosophy serves film students after they leave Harvard. Due to their broad historical scope, the The Eyes Have It film screenings will provide ample opportunity to examine not only the current state of film education on campus, but also how well it has served the department’s alumni, many of whom have gone on to pursue careers in the industry. For example, recent graduate Andrew N. Wesman ’10 concentrated in VES and is currently studying filmmaking at University of California, Los Angeles. At Harvard, he made a short film called “Shelley” that was an official selection of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival and will be screened as part of The Eyes Have It. For him, the practical education he got at Harvard has paid huge dividends. “It forced me to be creative. I was in VES 150, and I had to direct a film. I had to write something, so it forced me to sit down and write a script, and film it, and take risks. It forced me to be on set and get experience working with actors and getting shots, and with film that’s the best type of education you can get,” he says.
Even though he now makes fiction films, the lessons he learned making documentaries in the VES Department have really stuck with him. “The cool thing about Harvard, and which is different from where I am now—which is UCLA—is that there is a tremendous emphasis placed on documentary filmmaking,” Wesman says. “I think that was influential for all of my classmates. When you took VES 50 you had to make a 16mm documentary film, and you had to cut it yourself. I thought that was a really great experience that certainly played a hand in the development of my aesthetics in terms of how to observe performance and knowing how to edit.” The techniques that students could hone in the making of documentary films provided a strong foundation on which they could later build their next projects.
Wesman is not alone in his praise of a holistic film education. Filmmaker and Providence native Laura E. Colella ’91—whose short film “Eyes of a Blue Dog” will be screening at The Eyes Have It—splits her time between making feature-length films and teaching courses at the Rhode Island School of Design. Although some of the techniques that she learned in the VES Department are slipping towards antiquity—including the use of 16 mm film, her favorite medium—she has found that the overall focus on learning by making films has very much influenced both her art and her teaching. “At Harvard I learned how to shoot and edit and make a soundtrack, and to do everything by myself. And even to this day that has been enormously valuable to me,” she says. “I decided to do my third feature film on a micro budget, and I ended up shooting it myself and editing it myself, and my ability to do that was really due to the education I received.”
 
“A DIFFERENT WAY OF SPEAKING”
 
Even though the VES Department is committed to providing a practical film education to students, the fact remains that this mandate will always be defined by the liberal arts framework of the University. While this limits the scale and amount of classes in the curriculum, it does offer unique benefits to a student who is capable of balancing art and school. “When I was at Harvard it was a very small department and there wasn't a huge variety of classes,” Colella says. “That being said, I really appreciated the wide variety of classes I took, and I feel that made me a better filmmaker. I think that a really strong liberal arts education is great and increased what I could make films about.”
 Oliver Luo ’13, an animator and one of the only current students whose work is being shown in The Eyes Have It, agrees. For him, animation is a way of bridging his love of film with his love of physics. His film “A Tale of Two Twins” uses animation to explore the twin paradox, a thought experiment on relativity explored by several physicists, including Albert Einstein. “Being at Harvard in general, the liberal arts education has given me a more global view. There’s more of a cross-dissemination of things. It is nice to have that be present,” he says.
In a liberal arts framework, the VES Department has to cater to students who might not pursue a career in the film industry. Even though the focus of the program is on having students make film, professors and students emphasize that it has to offer more than just practical experience to be a truly worthwhile investment of time. Guzzetti’s classes use film and filmmaking as a way of engaging critically with the students intellectually while still honing their chops. “The program is not aimed to turn out professional filmmakers. It’s aimed to turn out people who know enough about film to have it influence how they think about the world,” he says. For him, this is similar to teaching humanities to undergraduates. “It is similar to philosophy. If you study philosophy as an undergraduate you don’t necessarily become a philosopher,” he says.
This frame of mind was the biggest takeaway for Lisa A. Haber-Thompson ’02, an animator now studying architecture at the GSD. “The way I thought about the program was: you were working on a project and the medium happened to be film, but that wasn’t different from everyone else’s project. It wasn’t writing or research, it was just a different way of speaking to people,” she says. “I completely buy into that and I found that really helpful. I took away the ability to craft an argument, whatever the medium.” For Haber-Thompson—whose short film “Bootfly” will be screened at the Carpenter Center—learning animation was as intellectual as it was artistic. “Studying film makes you see the world in a different way.... I feel that my sense of timing has been really influenced by that in ways that I think are hard to explain, especially with animation, because you have to be attuned to every single second,” she says.
 
BACKWARDS LENS
 
It will no doubt be a poignant moment for professors in the VES Department when The Eyes Have It goes up on April 27. The screenings will be the culmination of a year of introspection, and a time when the department can take a broad sweep of its history.
Furthermore, as part of Arts First, the event will be one voice in an ongoing dialogue on the place of the arts at a large liberal arts university. “We’ve spent the entire year thinking about our history and our future and what we want our future to be,” says Robb Moss, a senior lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies and one of the organizers of the event. “Arts First is the natural place to celebrate the arts at Harvard. That’s what Arts First is about, and the fact that it is coinciding with our 50th anniversary seemed to dovetail nicely with making a curated show of the last 50 years.”
As the department looks to the future, it can be rightly proud of the work it has fostered and the students it has produced. The Harvard Film Archive is full of films and pieces of animation that show the incredible talent of the students who have passed through the department. “It is hard to choose a program out of the work we have. We are leaving out many wonderful pieces. There is way too much work to show,” Moss says.
However, the greatest achievement of the VES Department is not the library of student work that it has amassed. It is the unique blend of practical, technical education and an emphasis on analytic thought that has produced artists who are grateful for the film education they received at Harvard. VES provided these students with the technical skills necessary to make films, but working within a liberal arts framework helps teach students what to say with their films.
The beauty of the Carpenter Center is that its bare walls don’t distract from the art within it. In a building like this, the films shown in The Eyes Have It aren’t framed by red brick. They have the room and space to speak for themselves. When appreciated for what they are, the films in the VES Department’s archive have the depth of analytic focus and academic rigor of the best student theses in Lamont’s basement. “[The program] makes you think about how you’re saying things, as opposed to just what you’re saying,” Haber-Thomson says.

No, they’re not an electronic take on classical music. Instead, Beethoven (\ b t, -v n\), Electropop is an audacious new foray into the electronic genre. The experimental sound project features Charles G. Gertler ’13 on synthesizer, Patrick W. Lauppe ’13 on saxophone, Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13 on guitar, and Adam T. Horn ’13 on vocals. (Lauppe is a Crimson Arts editor, while Naddaff-Hafrey and Horn are former Arts executives.) Fans of Harvard bands will recognize Gertler, Lauppe, and Naddaff-Hafrey as members of the band the Nostalgics and Horn and Naddaff-Hafrey as members of Stonewall, formerly known as Stonewall & the Jacksons. Beethoven (\ b t, -v n\), Electropop will give their debut performance on Saturday afternoon on the Harvard Yard Stage. While the members of the group have experience with folk and Motown music, this is their first group performance of upbeat electronic music. Unlike many synth-heavy performances in this genre, this one will be distinguished by the addition of analog instrumentation. “I think that’s the point of Arts First— just to give things a go,” Gertler says.

Nicolas Maffey ’13 has the unique distinction of being one of the only professionally trained circus artists on campus. Maffey, along with a band consisting of singer Patrick J. Wicker ’13, guitarist Kelly S. Robinson ’13, drummer Corey N. Rosenberg ’13, and violinist Kathy Ran ’13, compose the Ethereals. Maffey will be performing circus hand-balancing routines, while the band will cover Adele’s rendition of the Cure’s song, “Lovesong.” According to Maffey, having a live band makes the performance more collaborative. “You’re not performing by yourself­­­…if I happen to need three extra seconds, they can adjust their music to finish with me. We’re constantly in sync,” Maffey says.

Last year, the Freshman Arts Collaborative Experience Showcase presented a show entitled “Room for Growth” which recreated three different bedrooms in Ticknor Lounge, each one representing the different emotions and phases of freshman year. This year, nine freshmen in FACES, a semester-long interdisciplinary arts program, will present their own project focusing on the theme of natural disasters, inspired by Hurricane Sandy, February’s snowstorm, and a blackout that disrupted campus for several hours in November. According to Aleja Jimenez Jaramillo ‘15, a director of the program, these freshmen spent a semester exploring new art media and reflecting on their unique freshman stories. “Their freshman year has been very much impacted by these random natural occurrences…. [They use] these as backdrops for art pieces that reflect their experiences as freshmen,” Jimenez Jaramillo says.

Farkas Hall will host a series of staged readings of plays written by Harvard students and affiliates. The event will culminate in the fifth annual Harvard Playwrights’ Festival. The event will consist of staged readings of eight plays written in an advanced playwriting workshop class taught by playwright Liz Duffy Adams. “This is a great event because it brings together student playwrights through the advanced class and puts them together with professional directors. You get to see stage readings of plays directed by local professionals—it’s a chance to see new, exciting readings of plays that may go on to be performed outside Harvard,” says Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, who is producing the event. McTaggart, who is also a Crimson arts editor, is a student in the class and will have one of his works performed at the Festival.
Madeleine F. Bersin '14, publicity producer for the event, says the festival is a unique chance to see plays under development in a relaxed environment. “It’s really exciting for students to get to show their works, even if in a less finished form. Plays are meant to be seen.”

On Saturday at 12:15 p.m., the Performance Fair at Arts First will be launched with an unusual pairing: The River Charles Ensemble will play the first movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony conducted by economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw. While the RCE is known for its on-campus performances as a conductorless ensemble, this event will be distinguished by its collaboration with Mankiw and visiting guest John Lithgow ’67, who will assist with the performance. The event will take place on the Science Center plaza.
“We’re really excited. It’s a huge piece, and it should be a lot of fun. We don’t have experience performing with Mankiw,” In Young Cho ’15, who plays violin in the ensemble, says. Cho added that the piece is one which the RCE has never performed as an ensemble, although many of its members have performed it in the past with other groups.

I want to stray a little bit from the general theme of my column and address this piece to my professors, three of whom have recently written me kind emails or spoken to me about my performance in class. Although all have assured me that my comments in seminar are smart, insightful, and productive, they have told me something similar—that if I want to be taken seriously, I should change the way I speak.
I think that they should change the way they listen.
Indeed, it’s a lesson often shared with, usually, young women. We have been trained, or socialized, to speak in a “feminine” way—ending our sentences with question marks instead of periods, inserting “like” or “you know?” every few words, speaking quietly, and qualifying our assertions with phrases like “I’m not really sure if this is relevant, but” and “…sorry that was so incoherent; someone else could probably say that better.” Well-meaning mentors, ranging from teachers, to bosses, to older students, often advise women like me on how to be more respected, gain more credibility, or hold people’s attention and regard more effectively—usually by telling us that we should stop qualifying our remarks, end our statements more decisively, speak up, drop the “like,” and take up more space in conversations. Essentially, this lesson means that if we speak in a feminine way, we will not be respected—and to be respected, we must speak more like men.
What my professors have asked me to do is a form of “leaning in.” Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook executive, made waves last month when she published "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead," a book urging women to gain power in their corporate workplaces by pushing their bosses and coworkers to respect them. By leaning in, Sandberg argues, women can better succeed in traditionally male-dominated spaces.
Feminist authors, bloggers, and speakers responded to Sandberg’s book with an outpouring of critique, arguing that urging individual women to “lean in” not only ignores the structural sexism that keeps women down but also hurts those women without the resources or privilege to “lean.” For example, Deanna Zandt wrote in Forbes that “without simultaneously taking on the structures that keep those norms in place, women are both helping to reproduce those structures over and over… talking about structural discrimination is urgent and necessary now.” Melissa Gira Grant noted in the Washington Post, “There’s simply no way for women to lean in without leaning on the backs of other women.”
These writers follow a long trend of feminists trying to reclaim femininity from a liberal feminist movement that has urged women to push forward and gain power at the expense of femininity.  A couple of years ago, Anna North appealed to women on Jezebel, “The harpy/diva/bitch archetype isn't going to go away because a few women are allowed to sneak around it… teaching those people just to work around their marginalization is a great way to keep them quiet, and to keep anything from ever changing. Let's not fall for it.
I, too, used to be convinced that women have a responsibility to change the way they speak in order to empower themselves. I would tell women that I knew that, as I had been told, they should change the way they spoke and presented themselves in order to garner more respect. I am grateful for my feminist friends, who taught me that this not only ignores the structural issues at play in how women speak but also shames women for being “too feminine.” It is not the obligation of quiet women to speak up. It is the obligation of the rest of the room to slow down and listen, because women’s voices are important.
One thing I am sure of is that it’s never good to shame people for who they are or how they talk. People asked to speak differently can also often be those already disempowered by racism and classism, as well as sexism. Women are disempowered by the way we are socialized to speak (and not speak), but also by the fact that when we do act assertive, we are often stereotyped as “bitches”—we can’t win with femininity, and we can’t win without it. I would like to work towards a world in which women can be just as assertive as they want to be and still be respected for their thoughts and insights.
And so I would like to appeal to my professors, peers, and anyone else who mentors women: please don’t tell us to speak differently. If you truly respect us, let us speak as we like, and just pay attention to the words we say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is one thing to read in a newspaper that the United States has an eight percent unemployment rate and it is another to see what that means firsthand.
Last summer, I had the opportunity to work in the Skid Row district of downtown Los Angeles as a Chrysalis intern. Chrysalis is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1984 to provide resources to the homeless and low-income population of the area.
One thing the numbers don’t tell you is that poverty is a vicious cycle. Many of my clients over the summer were at points in their lives such that they were not sure where their next meal was going to come from; it was not hard for me to understand why many of them resorted to crime. Sadly, getting in trouble with the law only creates more barriers for people in poverty to find a decent job and rise out of it.
This is a nationwide issue that our government cannot continue to ignore. There simply wasn’t enough discussion about poverty or our overcrowded prisons in the last election cycle. Solving both problems begins with putting these issues at the forefront of our political discourse. Sure, it might be easier for lawmakers to lock people up. But as a concerned citizen, wouldn’t you prefer to see your tax dollars go toward turning a life around and making our society better?
Chrysalis tries to do exactly that. At Chrysalis, I worked one-on-one with some unbelievable men and women who were unable to secure permanent employment because job interviewers could not overlook their rough pasts. Many had significant gaps in their work histories because they had been in prison for over 20 years, had had their lives shaken up by substance abuse, or lacked the proper training and education to successfully maintain a job. For these individuals, Chrysalis became the added support that could get them over the mountain of challenges they faced.
Imagine you are an employer and you are looking to hire someone. You interview a person who is hard working, organized, and friendly, but he has never used a computer before in his life. It was my job to help stop that from happening, to work with clients to craft resumes, prepare for job interviews, and practice their English and math skills if they were still pursuing their GEDs.
President Barack Obama said in his victory speech in November that he wants to make America a place where, with enough hard work and commitment, anyone can succeed as long as they try. I believe that this can only happen if we begin with those at the very bottom. We can no longer ignore the unpleasant truth that stares us in the eyes. We can no longer choose to carry on with our lives as if poverty isn’t a real problem in our country.
To me, relying on prison is more like sweeping the mess under the rug rather than actually getting it out of the house. When we send convicts to prison, we let their lives go to waste.  If we instead aimed to rehabilitate criminals who have committed crimes that warrant less than a life sentence, they would be able reenter society, regain the dignity that comes with having a permanent job, and contribute positively to our communities.
The best part of my summer experience was seeing what a bit of hope meant to individuals who had at one point given up. When Chrysalis clients find permanent employment, they ring a bell in the lobby. At that very moment, everyone, from interns to the CEO, stops what they are doing and joins the newly employed in the lobby as he or she talks about his or her journey in what becomes a magical moment. I could see the happiness and confidence restored to the faces of our clients. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said, I knew that they had made it to the mountaintop.
We need to make it to the mountaintop, too—as a society. The mountain of poverty is not getting any smaller. In fact, the opposite is true. There are now 50 million Americans living in poverty, including 20 percent of all children. That is why we must raise ourselves up and meet the challenge head on, so that one day that shining bell of hope can ring over America as a whole.
Each and every one of us has the power to help end the poverty-crime cycle. Homeless people and ex-convicts often find themselves judged based on their appearances or their pasts. But many who have made mistakes are ready and eager to move forward. Once the people of our country come to realize this collectively, we as a nation can work toward removing societal barriers that make it nearly impossible for those who have hit the bottom to recover. We can give our citizens the second chance they deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Newtown, there was tremendous confidence that commonsense gun control legislation would prevail. And for a while everything seemed to be on track. Two pro-gun senators, Republican Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, had teamed up to write a bill, and they had reached a compromise that would have expanded background checks to cover more private firearms sales. Endorsed by the White House and pushed by the Democratic leadership, this modest package died on the Senate floor last Tuesday, succumbing (along with a revived assault weapons ban) to a Republican-led filibuster that attracted crucial Democratic support. In a week already filled with sorrow, Tuesday was a day of shame.
There is plenty of blame to go around and, as we write post-mortems, President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid must share in responsibility for defeat. The president made compelling arguments and intense emotional appeals for firearms-safety legislation, and his erudition won over the American people—90 percent of whom supported the proposal. He slipped up at the inside game, though, and having neglected to twist arms was left to wring hands and wipe tears. Reid equivocated on the assault weapons ban and passed up a recent opportunity for real filibuster reform, something that may have predestined the bill for legislative limbo.
That said, most criticism must be directed at the 45 senators who voted against cloture, especially the four Democratic defectors—Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Max S. Baucus of Montana, and Mark P. Begich of Alaska—who cravenly decided their political capital was more important than human lives. Contrary to appearance, it was not their seats that were at risk. Most of their constituents agree with expanded background checks and the closure of the gun-show loophole, making their vote against cloture more infuriating.
By their cowardice, these Capitol Hill minions of the gun lobby have done nothing to prevent the next Jared Lee Loughner, James Holmes, or Adam Lanza to play out his homicidal passions in the nation’s stores, movie theaters, or classrooms. We thought Congress would have followed the example of legislators in states like Connecticut, who responded to the Newtown tragedy with appropriate reform. We did not expect so many to fall behind the National Rifle Association, a group that personifies the outsize power that special interest groups wield over American lawmaking. We do not understand how they could look into the faces of gun violence victims and their family members and vote the way they did. They will have to answer for their actions. We await the day with dread.
CORRECTION: April 23, 2013
An earlier version of this editorial stated that Senator Mark R. Warner voted against cloture last week. In fact, Senator Warner voted yes on the measure. The fourth Democratic senator to vote no was Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past few months, headlines and op-eds across the country and at Harvard have captured the growing frustration with a persistent apathy and inaction around sexual violence and harassment. “Rape culture” has become a widely used term to describe societal attitudes around sexual violence, which include the slut-shaming and victim-blaming we’ve seen in the wake of several high-profile rape cases. The term’s explanatory power lies in its understanding of sexual violence as systemic and institutional. It locates sexual violence in a system of sexual oppression that is characterized not only by violence against women, but also by the promotion of heteronormativity, attacks on reproductive justice, and unequal pay for women in the workforce. Such a system depends on the dehumanization of women, on the belief that our bodies are not our own, but instead exist for others’ enjoyment. Women are forced to carry the shame of their perpetrator’s sexual crimes. The anger and threats directed towards women who dare to speak out against their perpetrators clearly demonstrate this.
Legislation and policies that affirm and protect the bodily autonomy of women and better meet the needs of survivors are urgently needed. Those alone, however, won’t bring about the massive shift in how we as a society think about and treat women. We need a mass mobilization of people—in the workplace, on campuses, in the streets—comprised of those who refuse to live under the threat of sexual violence and oppression on a daily basis. That type of organization and resistance has the ability to generate enormous political power, not only influencing courts and legislatures, but also pushing forward discussions and shaping attitudes.
Rape is happening on college campuses across America, and it isn’t a recent phenomenon. But what is new is the current drive toward activism, the amazing organizing and advocacy work that students across the country are doing in their communities to fight against something that, in many cases, their college administrations are effectively ignoring, or not doing enough about. To ignore these calls for change is to maintain a campus culture that condones sexual violence.
The organization Harvard Can Do Better has been a part of this nationwide drive toward activism around issues of sexual assault. Last semester the group organized a rape culture speak-out and proposed a referendum on sexual assault that received over 80 percent of student support calling for Harvard to adopt a policy based on affirmative consent. This semester the group has been in conversation with the administration as part of a sexual assault working group to rethink University policies around sexual assault. Other student groups, such as the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective and the Harvard Socialists, have been actively organizing discussions and forums throughout the year on rape culture, intersectionality, women’s oppression, and sexual violence. It is crucial that we engage critically with the sources and nature of oppression and violence so that we are able to most effectively challenge them. This week will mark the end of Take Back the Night month at Harvard, and we hope to see the same sort of desire for change from the student body at these events.
Take Back the Night has a long history of empowering women across the country, of creating spaces for people to come together and reclaim something that should never have been taken away from them in the first place. Survivor stories and speak-outs have been at the core of Take Back the Night since the 1970s. Indeed, speak-outs are crucial to breaking the silence that still exists around sexual violence in this country. The power of creating space for survivors to share their stories, and for all of us really to listen to those stories, can’t be underestimated.
We think that this needs to be coupled, though, with a visible, vocal, unapologetic demand for solidarity and for action. Boston was home to some of the most influential voices and effective organizing of the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and Harvard as a strong history of feminist activism. It is time to re-invigorate that feminist tradition here. To that end, we will be hosting a poster-making session on Tuesday, April 23, from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in the PBHA Shepard Room. Our rally and march will begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 24, in the Science Center Plaza.
Feeling anger about sexual violence is socially acceptable, but when that anger gets loud and public, people get uncomfortable. It is hard to ignore. It distracts us from our daily work of pretending that everything is okay. This is exactly what we want to do.
We believe that it’s time to take back Take Back the Night, that we’ve been quiet for too long, that rape culture should—and does—make us angry, and frustrated, and that this is the perfect opportunity to let that anger out. So this week we will be marching, for the first time in recent memory, through Harvard Square. We will have signs, and we will be loud. Our message will be clear: Sexual violence is unacceptable, period. And we’re not going to pretend that being quiet about it is okay any longer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student criticism of the University’s communication with the Harvard community after last Monday’s bombings at the Boston Marathon and the subsequent manhunt for the bombing suspects has drawn increased attention to the University’s process of alerting students during emergencies.
In times of crisis, universities must make rapid, “case-by-case” decisions regarding communication with students, campus security experts told The Crimson. Effective communication requires a balance between timely notification and reporting accurate information—a challenge magnified by the growth of social media.
“[University officials] want to encourage caution but not paranoia,” said Robin H. Gray, executive editor of Campus Safety Magazine. “They don’t want to cause too much commotion.”
Nonetheless, students last Monday criticized what they considered delayed and insufficient communication from the administration on the bombings at the Marathon and complained that the more than two-hour gap between the first reports of the incident and the first University-wide email acknowledging the bombings was too long.
Late Thursday night and into early Friday morning, students also expressed disappointment in the timing of the University’s communication with undergraduates following a fatal shooting on MIT’s campus, though members of the Undergraduate Council noted improvement on Friday. In total, the University sent out 14 alerts on Thursday and Friday.
Campus security experts cited the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to design an emergency response system and issue timely, accurate, and useful warnings of campus threats, as the primary statute on campus security. Under the Act, campuses are required to publish an Annual Security Report that contains crime statistics and details about the institution’s alert system.
Harvard’s 2012-2013 ASR states that during emergencies, members of the University’s Crisis Management Team will coordinate with HUPD officers and officials from Harvard’s Public Affairs and Communications Office to decide on the content and audience of alerts sent through the University’s MessageMe system as well as through phone, email, web, and Twitter.
This moment, when University officials determine the timing and content of emergency notices, has drawn scrutiny at Harvard.
“What we know from managing critical incidents anywhere is that during the crisis phases, good, accurate information is nearly impossible,” said Gary Margolis, a former police chief at the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College and managing partner at campus security firm Margolis, Healy & Associates. “The challenge is that the expectation for the speed of information is out of sync with the accuracy of the information.”
This tension between speed and accuracy, Margolis said, is exacerbated by social media, which enables rapid exchange of information but lacks checks for accuracy.
Gray said she agreed, calling social media “a mixed blessing.” In a list of best practices for campus security, she called for University officials to use social media—increasingly a favored mode of communication amongst students—as a tool for addressing rumors rather than spreading them.
Gray also advised against bureaucratic chains of command that could slow down the process of issuing an emergency alert and recommended that universities maximize the spread of information by employing many different types of notification. She added that universities are responsible for maintaining strong relationships with local law enforcement officials in order to ensure proper information in times of crisis.
In addition to the challenge of securing up-to-date information, universities must be discreet when determining what to disclose about a fluid emergency situation, wrote Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security on Campus, in an email to The Crimson. According to Kiss, the Clery Act does not specify a timeframe for issuing alerts and gives campuses the right to withhold information that may compromise a criminal investigation.
Neither Gray nor Margolis commented directly on the way that Harvard handled communications about the bombings and lockdown last week, though on Friday afternoon, Gray said that the University seemed to be doing “what they should be doing.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said experiencing an emergency can help institutions like Harvard better navigate the complexities of communication during a crisis.
“We all assess our emergency systems, and testing them in the abstract is somewhat different from real time execution in a real crisis,” Lake said. “Very often these kind of incidents help a lot of schools... to understand where they can look for future improvements in their systems and their decision-making process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Old Quincy reopens its doors in the fall after a year of construction, it will feature flat-screen televisions and furniture in every common room, new ceiling fans in every bedroom, and printers on every floor. But upperclassmen, citing perceptions that common spaces in the renovated dorm will not be conducive to hosting parties, the “senior tradition” of living in New Quincy, and uncertainty about what the new living space will actually be like, are instead choosing to live in New Quincy.
According to Quincy House Administrator Larry J. Peterson, rising juniors and seniors are set to inhabit just 64 of 181 available beds in renovated Old Quincy next school year—meaning that upperclassmen, who are favored in the House lottery, will comprise just 35 percent of the building’s population. Peterson added that because the results of the housing lottery have not yet been finalized, this number may rise slightly.
Harvard administrators have long predicted that state-of-the-art furnishings and a modernized layout would make Old Quincy the envy of Harvard’s residential system. Once renovations are complete, Old Quincy will be evenly split between two types of rooming set-ups: the “cluster community,” a space in which between 10 to 16 students live in single or double bedrooms close by a shared common room, and the traditional Harvard suite with bedrooms branching off of a central private common room.
Steve Needham, a senior director at Harvard Planning and Project Management, said last year that if they so chose, all seniors and half of juniors in the House could live in a single in the newly renovated dorm.
But upperclassmen aren’t biting. Currently, 149 sophomores and 146 juniors are affiliated with Quincy House, meaning that approximately 78 percent of Quincy upperclassmen have opted not to live in the renovated dorm next year.
“You can’t use [the common rooms in Old Quincy] as a party space,” said Taras B. Dreszer ’14, who opted to live in New Quincy for his senior year next year. Dreszer said he was concerned that the absence of doors on some of the shared common rooms would prevent students from hosting truly private parties.
David W. Welch ’14 agreed, saying, “I only know a few seniors who are going to live in the new building.” Welch and his blockmates will move into New Quincy in the fall.
Many Quincy upperclassmen who are spurning Old Quincy consider the tradition of living among fellow seniors in New Quincy as a perk that comes with seniority in the House.
Lydia K. Chung ’14 cited a “senior community” as the reason why she wanted to live in New Quincy.
Former Quincy House Committee co-chair Catherine G. Katz ’13 said that even with the option of Old Quincy rooms that have never been occupied, the tradition of living in New Quincy was deeply ingrained in the House community.
“I think people who have seen juniors and seniors live on the third and the sixth floors respectively have pictured themselves doing the same for several years now and haven’t been able to see themselves living elsewhere,” Katz said.
Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke said that she was glad to see that the renovated portion of the House will include a mix of class years. She added that the suites on the sixth floor in New Quincy have remained popular with seniors, who typically vie for quads with four bedrooms and a large common room.
The uncertainty of what the newly renovated building would have to offer also deterred some upperclassmen from opting to live there next year.
“New Quincy, you know about the rooms firsthand from students. Renovated Old Quincy is a surprise, it’s hard to tell,” said Chung.
The renovation of Old Quincy was chosen as the “test project” intended to serve as a model for Harvard’s ambitious $1 billion plan to eventually renew all 12 upperclassman Houses. Construction on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall will begin in June and span throughout the next academic year, to be followed by a complete renovation of Dunster House during the 2014-2015 school year.

The Cambridge City Council voted on Monday night to bolster the city’s mental health services in the wake of last week’s Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent manhunt. Councillors said that the need for mental health services in the city is great as many Cantabrigians struggle to process the tragedies of last week, as well as the fact that Cambridge residents were behind the atrocities.
“Knowing that it was a member of our community—for many people, it’s very confusing and painful to try and understand this,” said Councillor Marjorie C. Decker.
The City Council voted unanimously to ask that City Manager Robert W. Healy contact the Department of Human Services, the Cambridge Health Alliance, the Community Development Department, and any other appropriate city departments to ensure that the city is providing additional mental health resources in the wake of last week’s events.
Monday also marked the first day that Cambridge students returned to school since the bombings. According to Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis, representatives from the various Cambridge public health agencies visited the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which bombing suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev attended, to inform students and faculty about the mental health services available to them.
“It was very impressive to see how the [school’s] personnel responded to the kids—the professionalism, the thoughtfulness, the caring,” said Davis. “They spent the weekend preparing to make sure that today would be a good day.”
Like officials throughout greater Boston, the members of Cambridge’s City Council expressed both pride and sorrow. They praised the work of Cambridge’s public safety officials and medical personnel as “first-class,” but also expressed sorrow for those killed and injured in last week’s bombings and for the friends and family of the slain MIT officer, Sean A. Collier.
Healy, who testified before the Council on Cambridge’s response to the bombings, described last week as the most trying week of his career.
“You get a call that you always fear, that a policeman has been shot,” he said. “And then a call that a police officer has been pronounced [dead].”
The Council agreed on the need for roundtable discussions, in which various segments of the community—representing different ethnic groups, socioeconomic levels, and zip codes—would come together to discuss last week’s tragedy and ways that Cambridge can move forward as a community.
“Cambridge, as we go forward, is going to be more of a community,” said Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72.

In a room in Sever Hall Monday night, cookies were passed around and tea was served—a low-key setting for the discussion of sex. For two hours, representatives from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and Harvard College Munch—a kinky sex discussion group at the College—discussed the importance of consent and negotiation in relationships.
Although Munch helped facilitate the event, the workshop aimed to create a private low-pressure setting for attendees to discuss all relationships.
The presenters and audience members were granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect their privacy.
A key element of the workshop was the distinction between negotiation and consent. Negotiation differs from consent in that consent asks a partner for a yes or no approval, while negotiation is the establishment of certain limits and safewords. It is also a way to discuss what each partner wants in the sexual relationship.
One workshop leader said that consent is discussed broadly in reference to relationships, but that negotiation often stays within the realm of kink. In an attempt to broaden awareness about negotiation, discussion leaders said that the event’s organizers sought to create a curriculum for the night that incorporated not only consent but also negotiation.
“Negotiation is not just for kink,” said one leader. “It’s a way to open up communication and trust.”
The night’s topics covered the gamut of topics discussed in conventional Harvard workshops on sex. Attendees discussed verbal consent, sexual assault, and the importance of being able to say no. However, the discussion diverged from basic workshops like Sex Signals. Participants used role play to practice answering questions that ranged from “Can I give you a high five?” to “Will you tie my wrists to the headboard?”
Participants also discussed safewords, compromise, exploration, contracts, limits, and triggers. Limits were defined as soft—or adjustable—and hard—non-negotiable.
“Negotiation is non-binding,” one of the leaders reminded the audience. Another leader laughingly responded, “or binding,” while doodling a pair of cartoon handcuffs on a chalkboard to drive the point home.

Scholars face an ethically fraught task in translating a text from one language into another, panelists agreed during a Monday afternoon discussion about translation held in Emerson Hall.
“[Translation] is an activity full of impact, and translators should have fundamentally ethical attitudes towards a text,” said panelist Elvira G. DiFabio, senior preceptor in Romance languages and literatures.
During a presentation that concentrated on what she termed “the ethics of translation,” DiFabio argued that translation is a dangerous activity often at risk of misinterpretation.
Edith Grossman, an acclaimed translator of literary texts who appeared as a panelist at the event, agreed that translators face a steep ethical obligation. Still, she added that the burden on translators should not surpass the onus placed upon authors to conduct their work with professionalism and integrity.
In a similar vein, Daniel Aguirre-Oteiza, a panelist and lecturer in Romance languages and literatures, argued that the translator’s personal background is necessarily significant in the act of translating.
“The personal background of the translator can not be divorced from the translation of the text itself,” Aguirre-Oteiza said. Aguirre-Oteiza used Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges as a case in point, recalling how his sentimental and intellectual education informed his specific choices in lexicon, especially in translations of Homer.
Offering another example of this theme, panelist Nicole D. Legnani, a PhD candidate in Romance languages and literatures, discussed her particular interest in the relationship between translation, conquest, and empire in 15th and 16th century Spanish law texts.
Legnani said that in her senior thesis, she paid special attention to the violence of the word “conquista” and its omission in translations as a means of airbrushing the wrongs committed by the agents of empire.
Also complicating the translator’s task, Aguirre-Oteiza said, is a shortage of fellow translators in the academy. Aguirre-Oteiza lamented the dearth of highly educated translators in higher education, calling this problem “the spectre of translation.”
“There is an obvious delay about setting up classes in translation exercises,’ Aguirre-Oteiza said.
Grossman also spoke to this issue, chiming in about her experience as a full-time translator who had rejected work as an academic.
“I think a burden is being put on translation that would not be put on literature in a single language,” Grossman said.

In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, and with primary day a week away, the two men battling for the Democratic nod to seek the state’s open Senate seat tangled over their voting records on homeland security in a debate Monday night at the WBZ-TV studios in Allston.
Stephen F. Lynch, the South Boston congressman who polls show drawing closer to the once heavily favored U.S. Congressman Edward J. Markey, came out swinging. He opened by attacking Markey for voting against a handful of homeland security measures that Lynch himself supported, including a 2002 federal law that created the national Joint Terrorism Task Force. The national task force supports locally based collections of law enforcement agencies drawn from different levels of government. Currently, a regional Joint Terrorism Task Force that includes the Boston Police Department and the FBI is investigating the marathon bombings.
“I think one of the great parts of what happened [after the marathon bombings]...was the coordination between different agencies—the Joint Terrorism Task Force,” Lynch said, suggesting that Markey’s 2002 “nay” vote was a vote to inhibit that coordination.
Markey defended himself, saying he voted against the bill because he thought it would not have been sufficiently effective.
“If I did vote no [on the creation of the Joint Terrorism Task Force], the reason I voted no is that they were excluding a provision that would have made the bill even stronger,” Markey said.
In another effort to paint himself as a strong supporter of homeland security, Markey pointed to his efforts to promote security around nuclear and natural gas plants.
But Lynch said that Markey’s record did not back that up. While Markey has introduced or supported a number of initiatives to increase homeland security funding since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, he has also voted against appropriating additional funds for port security and the Transportation Security Administration.
The candidates also discussed the controversial questioning of Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, the living suspect believed to be responsible for the marathon bombings. Citing a public safety exception previously used in terrorism cases, federal agents interrogated Tsarnaev before reading him his Miranda rights, which gives suspects an explicit right to counsel and to remain silent.
Markey took no issue with the decision, deferring to President Barack Obama’s judgment. Lynch, however, said he was worried that the decision not to administer Miranda rights for some time might complicate the prosecution.
The candidates broached other issues throughout the evening, including health care and technology. Markey criticized Lynch for opposing the Obama’s landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act, while Lynch criticized Markey for co-authoring the 1996 Telecommunications Act, saying it did not do enough to make the industry competitive. Still, the story of the night was the clash over homeland security.
“Well, I think it was poor judgement, let’s put it that way,” Lynch told reporters after the debate, speaking of Markey’s ‘nay’ vote regarding the national Joint Terrorism Task Force. “If you go down the line of votes that we’ve had on that issue, it’s glaring, the difference between the two of us.”
Markey, also speaking after the debate, said he appreciated the work of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. When asked if he regretted voting against its creation, he said he needed to return to his notes.
“I don’t know what the Bush administration was doing that would have weakened it [at the time], so I’m going to have to take a look at that, but I’ll get back to you in the very near future,” he said.
Voters head to the polls for both parties’ primaries on April 30, to be followed by a special election on June 25. The newest poll, conducted by the Western New England University Polling Institute, shows Markey leading by 10 points, with 21 percent of respondents yet to decide.

Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center will largely discontinue its operations by 2015, the Medical School announced Tuesday. In a statement, administrators attributed the anticipated closure to financial pressures and did not directly mention the accusations of negligent primate care that have plagued the NEPRC in recent years.
“I want to extend my appreciation to the faculty and staff of the NEPRC for their contributions to the lifesaving research that has been conducted at the center over the past half-century, invaluable work that advanced our shared mission to improve human health,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in a statement.
Located 25 miles west of Boston in Southborough, Mass., the NEPRC is one of only eight Regional Primate Research Centers in the United States and—like its counterparts across the country—is largely supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health. According to the NEPRC website, the focuses of its research divisions include AIDS, cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, drug addiction, and neurodegenerative disease.
The decision to “wind down” operations at the Center means that it will not try to renew its five-year grant from the NIH.
“Deciding how to best assign our limited resources is not unique to HMS,” Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said, according to the Medical School’s release. “But this decision was made with a heavy heart.”
The NIH, like many other government agencies, is expected to sustain substantial cuts as Congress trims federal research dollars in an effort to control budget deficits.
“Difficult choices must be made at a time when all of the revenue sources upon which a research university depends are under pressure, and the future of federal support for scientific inquiry seems uncertain,” Garber said in his statement.
The Center has come under fire in recent years after a string of animal deaths and subsequent allegations of negligence prompted the Department of Agriculture to cite the NEPRC numerous times for the improper or insufficient care of primates.
In 2012, after five primates at the Center died within a span of 19 months, the Center’s interim director Frederick Wang resigned and Flier suspended new experimentation at NEPRC.
The statements from both Garber and the Medical School said that the Center will ensure that its primates receive proper care during the transition. The animals will eventually move to other centers or be kept on the current NEPRC site if necessary.
The Medical School’s statement said that the NEPRC is also working with the NIH and University to ensure research activities continue or are moved to other centers with the “least possible disruption.”
“The Center’s research focus on HIV, infectious disease, and vaccines will continue to be effectively pursued through scientific programs throughout HMS,” Flier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the NFL Draft happening later this week (the first round will be held on Thursday night), The Back Page is bringing you full coverage of Harvard’s lone notable prospect, former tight end and current fullback senior Kyle Juszczyk. To start the coverage off, staff writer David Freed previews what analysts have been saying about Harvard’s leading receiver from 2012.
After being projected as a late seventh rounder earlier in January, forecasts for Juszczyk have continued to improve over time. The fullback was invited to the Senior Bowl but not to the combine, but impressed at his Pro Day with a 4.71 time in the 40-yard dash and a vertical jump of 37 inches. According to nfldraftscout.com, 15 teams came to Juszczyk’s pro day and Gil Brandt of NFL.com wrote at the time “this showing will earn Juszczyk a draft selection somewhere in the fifth or sixth rounds.” Since, NFLDraftScout revised Brandt’s estimates to put the former tight end in the third or fourth round.
The consensus among experts is that the senior will go in the third to fourth rounds. In addition to CBSSports, which said that although he “isn’t a household name to fans, he is well-known in NFL scouting circles,” NFLDraftCentral also ranking him in the same area.
In his mock draft where he made himself the general manager of each team—allowing himself to make logical trades between teams and pick based on best fit at every position, ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. picked Juszczyk to go in the third round to the Miami Dolphins. Kiper Jr., who said that the Dolphins have a need for fullback, called Juszczyk “The best one in the draft.”
The Dolphins are one of twelve official visits that Juszczyk is making in the weeks leading up to the draft, according to The Baltimore Sun. The others were the Minnesota Vikings, Jacksonville Jaguars, Cincinnati Bengals, Indianapolis Colts, Detroit Lions, Buffalo Bills, Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, Seattle Seahawks, and the Carolina Panthers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Jeremy Lin ‘10 and the Houston Rockets (eighth seed in the Western Conference) make their way through the NBA playoffs, The Back Page will provide game-by-game updates on Lin’s play.
Although Lin’s New York Knicks made the playoffs last year, Sunday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder represented his first taste of the postseason. Lin sat out last year’s series nursing an injury, but this year took the court for a young Rockets squad that dropped from the seventh to the eighth seed on the final game of the season, drawing the conference-leading Thunder instead of the a San Antonio team which finished 2-5 in its last seven games.
This meant that instead of being matched up against San Antonio’s Tony Parker, who is recovering from an ankle injury, Lin drew the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, who averaged 23 points, seven assists, and five rebounds this year. Westbrook dominated Lin in the first matchup of the first-round series, making seven of 15 shots on his way to a near triple-double on the offensive end while hounding the Harvard graduate into a night where he had as many turnovers as points (four).
Lin struggled to stop Westbrook from getting out in transition the entire game, with his turnovers repeatedly leading to long outlet passes from the athletic Thunder guards that led to easy points on the fast break. Oklahoma City finished with 24 fast break points and 21 points off of 15 Rockets turnovers. On the other end, Lin’s improved jump shot deserted him (one for seven overall, no makes from three). With the rest of the offense struggling (the team shot an uncharacteristic 22.2 percent from three-point range), there were few opportunities for him to get open looks at the basket.
The series resumes Wednesday in Oklahoma City, where Lin and company will try to salvage a two-game split before heading back home to the Toyota Center, where the team was 31-12 on the year.

The Harvard men’s tennis team (17-4, 5-0 Ivy) is undefeated in Ivy League play this season, and just clinched a share of its second straight Ivy League title after Sunday’s victory over Yale. The Back Page looks at some of the important numbers for the Crimson this season and a few more looking forward.
2...The number of years in a row Harvard has won at least a share of the Ivy League title. Last season, the Crimson went 6-1 in Ancient Eight play, losing only to Columbia en route to the conference title.
5…The number of years since the Harvard last completed an unblemished conference slate, since the 2007-08 season. The Crimson has a chance to wrap up a perfect 7-0 record with wins against Brown and Dartmouth this week.
10…The number of consecutive conference matchups the Crimson has won, stretching back to last year’s road loss to the Lions.
22…Harvard’s ranking in the ITA Men’s National Team Rankings. The Ivy rival closest to the Crimson is Columbia, who sits at No. 47 and at second place in the Ivy League.
12…The number of consecutive matches the team has won, dating back to a loss to Cornell at the ECAC Championships on Feb. 16th. Not coincidentally, 12 is also the number of consecutive matches in which Harvard has captured the all-important doubles point.
52...The national ranking of the Crimson’s top doubles tandem, sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster. The pair is a dominant 11-1 in dual play this season.
12-2…Senior co-captain Andy Nguyen’s record at fourth singles this season. His successful senior season has been crucial to Harvard’s winning ways this year.
75-7…The Crimson’s all-time record against the Bears dating back to 1929, who they will face on Thursday in their final home match of the year.
3…The number of conference wins (out of 11 matches) that Brown and the Big Green have combined for this season. Harvard has two more than that—and in six fewer matches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over a year ago, Alex Killorn ’12 wore his #19 jersey for the Harvard men’s hockey team for the last time. Now, after transitioning to the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League, and with his rookie campaign having come to an end, the recent alum appears to have found a home on the ice professionally.
In his four years at Harvard, Killorn led the Crimson on and off the ice. As assistant captain his senior year, he was named a CCM Hockey First Team All-American, first-team All-ECAC, and received unanimous selection to the All-Ivy League first team. While at Harvard, Killorn became the first 100-point career scorer since 2005, and led the team with 46 points on 23 goals and 23 assists his senior season.
In 35 games in the NHL this year, Killorn maintained his scoring ways, netting 7 goals and providing 12 assists.
 
“What [makes] ‘Kill’ a special player [is] his combination of size and speed,” senior forward Luke Greiner said. “He’s incredibly fast, and he has a long reach. He can really hold on to the puck and take over the game with it.”
Days after losing to Union in the 2012 ECAC finals, Killorn signed a two-year deal with the Lightning, making his first major move into the professional stage. The government concentrator from Dunster house negotiated with his professors to let him turn in his final papers while training off campus.
“For me it kind of happened all really quickly,” the rookie said. “I had about a day and a half or two days to get ready for pro hockey.”
 
In the nine months after graduation, Killorn played for Tampa Bay’s minor league affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, helping the Admirals win the American Hockey League’s Calder Cup.
Following the season, the Lightning dropped its affiliation with Norfolk, prompting a move to the Syracuse Crunch, also of the AHL.
 
On Feb. 10, Killorn got pulled up to the big show, playing his first game against the New York Rangers that night, in what will be an experience he is sure to never forget.
“From the day he stepped foot on the ice he showed that he belongs in the NHL, both in terms of his skill and his attitude,” said Lightning  Owner and Chairman Jeff Vinik. “He has been a very strong addition to the Lightning.”
Killorn’s 19 points this season rank him ninth among rookies, despite playing in fewer games than the majority of his fellow first-years.
“We watch our young guys very closely,” Vinik said. “We were very confident in bringing Alex up to the NHL, and what he has done over the last two months; it proves to be the case [that he was ready].” 
 
“When I got there I was excited,” Killorn said. “But I knew the importance of keeping it simple. I just tried not to make mistakes and blend in at first.”
Watching from back in Cambridge, his teammates are not surprised with his success.
“We could tell last year that he was just a step above everybody else in the college game,” said junior defenseman Dan Ford, who was recently named Harvard’s 2013-14 captain.
“Especially coach Donato, he wasn’t surprised,” added Greiner. “It was a matter of time with Alex.”
Killorn started playing when he was four years old at the outdoor rink that was just down the street from his home in Beaconsfield, Quebec.
“We would just walk down and skate,” he said.
From there, as with so many young boys in Quebec, Killorn fell in love with the game.
Killorn decided he wanted to play hockey in college when he realized his potential in middle school. He knew hockey would open up incredible opportunities, as it does today, and Harvard was the right choice for him.
“Education is something that is important for my family and for me, and I was very pleased to go to Harvard,” Killorn said.
In addition to academics, across the river, Killorn could let his skill and passion for hockey take form.
One moment in particular stands out to Greiner as one of his fondest memories of his former teammate.
“[Killorn] scored one of the nicest goals I have ever seen against North Dakota his senior year on a power-play,” Greiner recalled. “[It was] from the right side, high glove. One of my buddies on the North Dakota team came up to me and said, ‘Oh my God, that was one of the nicest shots I’ve ever seen, that kid is probably going to play in the NHL.’”
Despite a high number of Crimson players selected in the NHL draft—including nine on this year’s roster—few are able to turn that potential into professional success. One such player who found success in the pros is Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, who left after his freshman year here to have an incredible rookie season with the Montreal Canadiens. Killorn grew up down the street from Leblanc, and was impressed by his precocious success.
“He was like a little brother…to watch him go pro was amazing,” Killorn said. “Last year was an unbelievable experience for him, it helped to show guys can go from Harvard straight to NHL, it’s possible. He’s definitely some guys’ motivation.”
The same now goes for Killorn.
In his transition from the Ivy League to the NHL, a lot has changed for the 23-year old rookie. Besides the food and travel that he candidly noted are profoundly better with the Lightning, there are some adjustments that are still taking time for him to get used to.
“The NHL is top-notch, and very different,” Killorn said. “I go into hotels, and have fans waiting for me to come out when I’m going to get a coffee, asking me to sign stuff. I’m definitely more in the spotlight.”
Helping in the transition to the big leagues was Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. His own impressive playing career at Harvard, and after with a 13-year career in the NHL primarily with the Boston Bruins, makes him a perfect mentor for stars like Killorn.
“He has always been very supportive,” the rookie said, referring to a time this year when he called, just days before the then anxious Killorn was pulled up.
Besides Donato, current Crimson players make a point to stay in touch with Killorn. After a good game or a nice goal, they admit to texting or tweeting their virtual congratulations to their former teammate.
During a Lightning road trip to play the Bruins, Killorn came to Cambridge and watched his former team upset No. 1 Quinnipiac, 2-1, in overtime on Mar. 1.  
 
Back in the locker room, the atmosphere was casual. It was like he never left.
"'Kill’ was a pretty good dude, a great teammate,” Greiner said. “Our class was very close with the graduating class from last year; we spent a lot of time with them.”
From all the excitement and the hype of the NHL, Killorn shared one moment that stands out as the greatest from his experience thus far.
“Last week we played at the Bell Centre [in Montreal], where I grew up watching so many games,” Killorn said. “To play there in front of my friends was really exciting.”
The worst moment, he added, was nearly breaking his nose. Escaping with just a black eye and few stitches, Killorn brushed it off, casually, as him being lucky.
With all the ups and downs, Killorn has established himself as a likely long-time NHL player.
“He’s big, he’s tough, he gives us some muscle, he has good skills, and he can give us good hockey IQ,” Vinik said. “We see him as a very strong, well-rounded hockey player. Alex is going to be a great player for us in years ahead.”
The season has come to an end for Killorn and the Lightning, which failed to qualify for the NHL playoff, and finished second-to-last in the Eastern Conference. Last month, Tampa Bay hired Jon Cooper, Killorn’s former coach with the Admirals, in the hope that some change will bring better success on the ice.
“I think we have real good hockey players, it just takes time for everybody to develop, but in a few years we’ll be a very good team we have no doubt,” Vinik said.
“I hope he has a very long career,” Ford added. “He was playing college a year ago, and now is one of the top guys on his team. I always knew he was a good player, and that he was going to play at the next level, but playing this last year without him, it gave a further appreciation for how good he really was.”
As opposed to playing with a group of fellow student-athletes, Killorn is now in a locker room full of veterans and up-and-comers alike, all getting paid to play the game they love. With that comes an added responsibility akin to regular recent college graduates thrust into the real world.
“The team dynamic is still the same,” Killorn said. “We’re just a group of guys trying to win a couple hockey games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In five weeks time, the No. 2 Radcliffe lightweight crew team will head across the country to Sacramento, Calif., hoping to upset reigning champion No. 1 Stanford at the IRA National Championships. Until then, the Black and White will continue to train, now with the knowledge that they have already bested the Cardinals this season.
“It has been goal number one this season to be the best, and that obviously meant beating Stanford,” coach Michiel Bartman said.
Despite a tumultuous week in Boston that shuffled the Harvard athletics calendar, Radcliffe took to the Charles on Sunday morning, as the first varsity boat proved exactly how swift it could be.
On the tail of their teammates in the second varsity boat winning their race by eight seconds, the Black and White’s fastest eight lined up alongside cross-town rival Boston University, Ivy foe Princeton and title-favorite Stanford.
“It’s always hard to tell, but knowing the work we have done and the speed I see with my girls, I knew we had a pretty good chance of either being closer or being faster than Stanford, compared to last year,” Bartman said. “The way the second varsity rowed, I was pretty sure that the first varsity was also going to win.”
While the first 250 meters saw Radcliffe emerging with a slim lead, by the 500-meter mark, the advantage was decidedly the property of the Black and White. Radcliffe would never yield this full boat length, coming up on the halfway point in the race.
At the 1000-meter mark, when most teams that have fallen behind start to make their move ahead, the second-place Cardinals were unable to catch the Black and White, as Radcliffe increased its stroke rate and its lead.
By the time the boats had emerged from behind Harvard Bridge, the Black and White held a vast stretch of open water on its three opponents. The race was theirs; the favorites toppled, and Stanford and Princeton were left to battle for second and third. Radcliffe took the race by almost six seconds, with a time of 7:05.7 to the Cardinals’ 7:11.1.
Last June, the first eight and first-year coach Bartman broke a program drought by winning the first national medal since 2006. Having finished fourth for three years straight, the Black and White finally made it back onto the podium with a bronze medal behind winning Stanford and second-place Bucknell.
Sunday’s race represents the first time the varsity boat, which returns four rowers from last year’s IRA race, has seen the defending champions in a head-to-head sprint race.
New to the eight is sophomore Emma Framson, who moved up to the first boat after spending her rookie season in the second eight. Framson took to the bow seat, with classmates Claire Harmange and Taylor Garden following her closely in the two and three-seats, respectively.
“Especially after the long week we had in Boston, we were thankful such good competition could come out,” Framson said. “I think as a boat we really came together and we all really worked hard to prepare, and were really excited to have a chance to compete with such high competition.”
In the four-seat was Naomi Lang, the sole freshman to make the first eight, next to junior Katherine Mallett, who has raced with the varsity boat since her freshman season. Rounding out the boat was veteran six-seat Emma Lukasiewicz, sophomore Adelaide Backer in seven and last year’s stroke Elizabeth Lenczowski returning the eight-seat.
“It’s the rhythm of the group,” Bartman said. “Not just the eight, but it’s also the second varsity. Obviously there are girls in our second varsity that want to be in the first varsity…. It pushes the girls in the first varsity harder.”
Equally important is junior Erin Driscoll at coxswain, who coxed the second varsity and first four in 2012. Driscoll guided the varsity four to fourth place at last year’s IRA’s.
Together, the nine women have had tremendous success this spring, winning each of their three races thus far. The team has one dual race left, against MIT, before taking on a formidable field at Eastern Sprints and again at this year’s IRA’s.
“Every single day it’s a light atmosphere coming to the boathouse, and as soon as we’re in the boat, as soon as we’ve been working, it’s business,” Bartman said. “We try to make our water time as efficient as it can be. As soon as we’re off the water, we go back to our good preparation and relaxation. I think it’s a very good balance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, an NFL team will draft Harvard senior Kyle Juszczyk. The Crimson standout has had official visits with a dozen teams, all of which are presumably interested in drafting the FCS All-American somewhere between the third and sixth rounds. One team that hasn’t shown interest in Juszczyk is the Philadelphia Eagles, which makes sense given that they already have his NFL doppelganger. This offseason, the Eagles signed former Houston Texan James Casey, who shares a number of similarities with Juszczyk.
For one, Casey went to Rice, a school also known more for its academics than its football team. Though they play in the FBS, the Owls have only played in three bowl games in the last 50 years. While there, Casey saw some action both in the backfield and out of Wildcat sets, but like Juszczyk, mainly played tight end, leading his team in receptions during his final season in 2009.
Lacking the physical traits of a prototypical tight end, Casey was scouted as a fullback for the NFL Draft. At 6’1”, Juszczyk was forced to make a similar transition this year. Though Juszczyk didn’t get an NFL Draft Combine invite like Casey did, their key measurables turned out to be eerily similar. The 248-pound Casey and the 246-Juszczyk both ran 4.7 40-yard dashes and were each timed at 2.75 seconds and 1.6 seconds in the 20 and 10-yard sprints, respectively. Thanks to their performances, both prospects emerged as the No. 1 fullback option in their respective drafts, according to nfldraftscout.com.
Though Casey was projected to be a slightly more valuable pick overall than Juszczyk does, the former Owl ended up sliding to the middle of the fifth round before the Texans grabbed him with the 152nd pick in the draft. Since then, Casey has been more productive than an average pick in the fifth round, starting 20 games over four years between the fullback and tight end positions. Last year, he was on the field for 17 of Houston’s 19 rushing touchdowns, and he proved to be a threat with the ball in his hands as well.
His performance earned him nearly $15 million in free agency from the Eagles, for whom he projects to be an H-back, a more natural position for someone with his athletic ability.
At this point, it is not unreasonable to imagine Juszczyk being as productive as Casey in his first few years, given he lands with the right team. Both are tough runners, Juszczyk is nearly as athletically versatile, and if he lacks some of Casey’s height, he more than makes up for it in blocking prowess. After all, it was Juszczyk’s ability to knock back linebackers during practice before the Senior Bowl that initially caught scouts’ eyes.

Last week's events may seem like a distant, bizarre nightmare now. Or, they might seem all too fresh and returning to quotidian life might seem daunting. It may seem completely natural to throw yourself back into that Stat 104 p-set or nearly impossible to transition back from days that played out like an episode of 24.
No matter how you're feeling, know that pretty much anything falls into the range of normal in the aftermath of traumatic events like those we've watched unfold over the past week.
We consulted with Dr. Katherine A. Lapierre, chief of student mental health services at Harvard University Health Services, who provided us with several guides to coping with abnormal events.
We at Flyby know that many Harvard students who were emotionally affected by the highly abnormal week may not have time to consult mental health professionals at UHS, or pick up these guides between office hours and club meetings. So we've compiled our own brief list of suggestions for feeling better and moving forward.
1. Try to get exercise and eat balanced meals. Perhaps, the stress of trying to simultaneously follow Twitter, the police scanner, and CNN induced compulsive junk food eating. Not only will hitting up the elliptical negate some of those excess calories, but it will also serve as a positive distraction. Better yet, exercising outside on a nice day (we're expecting a few of these this week) can lift your mood and remind you there's life beyond the MAC.
2. Get enough sleep. Or at least as much as possible.
3. These things can take much time to mull over, and there's no one recipe for expediting that process. In the meantime, talk to friends, family, and others.
4. Don’t be hard on yourself or play down the trauma. Last week was intense and unusual and no one would blame you for feeling weird about it, so you shouldn't blame yourself.

Today, as I checked out of the Greenhouse Café in the Science Center, I looked up at the cash register to see that my remaining BoardPlus balance was $0.00. I actually had to finish paying for my two slices of Tuesday lunch pizza with cold, hard cash.
I am humbled. Done with BoardPlus for the semester. About ready to go home. Now what?
 
For those of you who still have copious amounts left to spend, I have two things to say to you.
1. You dirty dog.
 2. Have a look at this. Treat yourself, and your friends—and me—to a little special treat around campus.
 
CGIS Café: When you have class in William James until noon, and section at CGIS at 1:00, suddenly even Quincy seems too far. CGIS Café to the rescue! Located on the first floor of the Knafel Building (the one that isn't CGIS South), the CGIS Café is airy, modern, and never too loud. Food-wise, you can choose from custom grilled sandwiches, salads, and a solid selection of drinks—fun alternatives to Flyby PB&J, apples, and those bags of air that occasionally come with chips.
Lamont Café: Never hesitate. Just buy the salted caramel cupcake behind the glass. When have you ever regretted cream cheese icing? Never. If you like cookies and want to create a spectacle, buy a dozen packets of Milanos. It's legal, you'll get a laugh and make a few friends along the way. BoardPlus is a great and easy way to be generous with friends, old and new alike. One might even say that BoardPlus is the gateway to the land of "sharing is caring," with no real down payment.
 
Cronkhite Dining Hall: The tastiest place you've never heard of. I have a friend who rarely touches her BoardPlus. With almost $100.00 left to spend, she should treat herself and take an adventure with a friend. If you have the time, walk to Cronkhite Dining Hall at 84 Brattle Street, just behind the Admissions Office in Radcliffe Yard. As warm spring days brighten our afternoons, sit outside and dine. Have a hot entrée and everyone's favorite uncle, BoardPlus, will pick up the tab.
 
For a complete list of places which accept BoardPlus, check out this list from HUDS. 
Other highlights include:
Greenhouse Café: Odwalla drinks or Greek yogurt make nice breaks from the wealth of greasy, albeit tasty, fried options. 
House Grilles: Eliot mozz sticks and root beer floats have been a pleasant way to pass the time while the dryer persistently eats my socks.  
Cabot Café: What more could you want from this coffee shop/student art gallery/performance venue that bills itself as "one of Harvard's best social spaces?"
 
Wherever you go, enjoy the small pleasures. For those of you with large balances remaining, remember—use it or lose it! Happy snacking.

We asked, "What would you have done with the Science Center plaza redesign?"
