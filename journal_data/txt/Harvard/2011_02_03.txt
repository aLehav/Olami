After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Halfway through “Nine,” Arthur L. Kopit ’59 and Maury Yeston’s 1982 adaptation of Fredrico Fellini’s film “8½,” I had to face the truth: This was not a sexy musical.
There had been the initial promise of sexy. The cast of “Nine” is composed almost entirely of women. Frequent dance numbers take their cue from burlesque or Hollywood movie sets. In this production by the SpeakEasy Stage Company, which runs through February 20th at the Boston Center for the Arts, several scenes feature ladies banging tambourines on their bosoms. But while “Nine” may have the veneer of glitz and glamour, the luster can’t cover the musical’s setbacks. “Nine” is a misguided adaptation, and one that runs on shallow ideas about women and relationships. Even the extravagant boas in Paul Daigneault’s production (and there are long, lush, red ones) don’t dress up the show’s dull foundations.
Guido Contini (Timothy John Smith) is in a bind. A once-successful filmmaker, he needs to write a new movie lest his career come to an end. On top of that, his marriage is falling apart. Luisa, his wife, (Aimee Doherty) can no longer stand his infidelity with his mistress Carla (McCaela Donovan) or his infatuation with a French starlet, Claudia (Jennifer Ellis). When Guido goes to a Venetian spa in search of some rest, he finds himself overcome with anxiety about the women in his life.
Taking its cue from the original film, which flits between the director’s time at the spa and dream sequences, “Nine” moves in and out of Guido’s memories. At a parochial school, he was taught that all women were “whores or wives.” An old woman of loose morals corrupted the boy by teaching him how to seduce the female sex. These flashbacks serve as heavy-handed explanations for Guido’s midlife crisis. No wonder that his current predicament is: “One woman is not enough!”
Guido’s female relations—wife, mistress, mother, colleagues—undertake similar psychoanalyzing about the man. Unfortunately, they have little room for expression. “Nine” suffers at moments of terrible script writing, and the lyrics of the numbers for women are particularly thin. Many of the play’s female monologues vacillate between self-pity and campy raunch. It’s hard to imagine an actress could make lines like “Be Italian / You rapscallion” stand for some piece of women’s wisdom.
This production does not do much to overcome the script’s shortcomings. Paul Daigneault’s direction has his actors speaking in cheesy fake Italian accents, then slipping into American intonations whenever they break out in song. The resulting back and forth, combined with the cast’s exaggerated “Italian” hand gestures, makes it even more difficult to take Guido’s existential drama with any sort of sympathy. We may be watching a man’s life in upheaval, but the staging is more often reminiscent of a lavish pasta commercial.
This would be the foundation for a great farce, were it not that “Nine” takes itself extremely seriously. Maury Yetson, the play’s composer, has said that he wished to fill in female characters that Fellini’s movie leave in the dark by illustrating the “inner workings” of the women around Guido. And Daigneault chose the show, he writes, to bring together Boston’s female talent in one play. True, the fifteen female cast members have wide range of vocal expression. As Luisa, Doherty shows considerable poise, and her voice is strong and expressive. Some of the younger actresses, like Celia Hottenstein and Holly King, display commanding stage presence. But the female parts are so flimsy—and so emotionally empty—that one wonders what they are really meant to showcase.
Hopefully, these actresses can find themselves in roles more deserving than the weak ones “Nine” offers. In the meantime, for a subtle, intelligent look at the same issues—watch 8 ½ instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over winter break, The New York Times published “Why Criticism Matters,” a series of beautifully written, passionately argued essays by today’s leading literary critics about why their profession remains relevant in the information age. Though the series was openly inspired by Alfred Kazin’s 1960 treatise, “The Function of Criticism Today,” the works could not be more different. Kazin proposed a bold, progressive approach to arts criticism, claiming that the best critics “[work] toward the future.” They “suggest new possibilities for art” and “welcome new writers.” Kazin felt that many of his contemporaries did not live up to these goals, but the values of his essay was liberal, in the best sense of the word.
The same cannot be said for The New York Times group, whose contributions, though enlightening and variegated in their approaches to criticism, share a reactionary defensiveness of the necessity of their work. Culture may change, they argue, but the value of literature and literary criticism can only endure in its present form, or at least a minimally modified version of it. Their panic is easy to understand––in general, journalism has lost its glamour and its profitability, and arts criticism has been tarnished more than any other branch. To the extent that the masses have a unified opinion about the genre, it seems to be: “Hey, I could do that.” And they have—some of them, quite well—leaving professional critics in a financial and creative lurch. Although this situation has led the Times critics to defend a specific (and soon to be outmoded) set of reading practices and the critical apparatuses that accompany them, their pessimism is misplaced. The changes that arts criticism is enduring will ultimately allow more people to engage more deeply with culture—but not without growing pains.
Amid this ruckus, the student critic finds herself in an untenable position. On the staff of The Crimson’s Arts section, we like to think of ourselves as semi-professional critics. We get advance copies of books, music, and movies; we strive to hold our copy to professional standards. “Why Criticism Matters” was circulated on our listserv, and many of us sympathized with the authors. We were on the same side as them. Yet, for all our pretensions, the Arts staff has more in common with the customer critics on Amazon.com that Katie Roiphe ’90 skewers in her Times essay, quoting a particularly unfortunate review of Jonathan Franzen’s “Freedom.” Roiphe writes, “more than ever, critical authority comes from the power of the critic’s prose, the force and clarity of her language.”
Yet, graceful writing has never been solely the prerogative of the professional critic, and if money is the primary motivator behind creating beautiful prose, I daresay the writer is doing something wrong. To be hired, would-be professional critics must complete internships for free or a pittance, or write for “amateur” publications like The Crimson. And even after “making it,” professional critics often write pro bono. The popular literary and film blogs, The Millions and The House Next Door, were both started as side projects by professional critics. Woebegone professional critics like to flatter themselves that they are fundamentally different from amateurs assigning stars on Netflix, but to draw such a divide is fallacious at best and at worst, politically problematic.
The rise of amateur arts criticism certainly has its disappointments: Finding worthwhile discussion of a new book or album means ignoring the increasingly loud white noise of uninteresting material—irrational, indulgent, poorly written. But ultimately, the “crowdsourcing” of arts criticism is good for the arts and good for consumers, even if it means that there are fewer niches for paid critics.
As Sam Anderson observed in his exceptionally pleasant-natured Times essay, content aggregators like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic mean that professional critics can no longer afford to rest on their laurels. The consumer report mode of arts criticism is obsolete, but this applies as much to amateur critics as it does to professionals. If anything, amateur critics are more affected by this competition than their paid counterparts, because they are not backed by a well-known media outlet. The old boys’ club of arts criticism is dealing with an infusion of meritocracy, and it will be stronger for it.
These changes do not just affect the people who write criticism. In a decade, the critics that readers love and trust will look very different. They will have day jobs. They will come from around the world; they will elevate new canons and offer fresh perspectives on old ones. They will not live in New   York; they will not have been born privileged; they will have no connections to the literary establishment. Accomplished, articulate tastemakers will not disappear, but diversify—and in doing so, matter more, to more people, than ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just fifty years ago, a Harvard graduate was sworn in as the 35th president of the United   States. In his now-famous inaugural address that took just shy of 14 minutes to deliver, John F. Kennedy ’40 inspired thousands of Americans to do what they could for their communities with whatever resources they had. “Ask not what your country can do for you,” he urged in what is perhaps his most famous sentence, “ask what you can do for your country.”
Half a century later, it is high time for the University to take those words to heart and renew its commitment to inspiring public service among its students. In tribute to the legacy of one of its most accomplished graduates, Harvard, in these trying times, must take a public stance in support of public service, reiterating that its students have a moral imperative to use their educations for the betterment of society, not merely the betterment of themselves. As Kennedy’s alma mater and an institution of global regard, Harvard must do what it can to eradicate the all-too-pervasive idea that its educational function is merely to churn out students whose sole purpose in life is to pursue their own ends.
Of course, not every Harvard student today can claim the privileged position Kennedy enjoyed, but it is a mistake to see public service as the exclusive domain of the rich and the privileged. Obviously, one does not have to give $100 million to the Newark public school system, like Mark Zuckerberg, or $100 million to the eradication of polio, like Bill Gates, to count as a “public servant.” And while it is unfortunate that such a misperception exists, it is Harvard’s job to impress that all of its graduates can and should embrace public service in whatever careers they choose and to whatever extent possible. Of course, “public service” is a broad, nebulous term—but we mean it as Kennedy did, in the general sense of applying one’s chosen field to social betterment. To be sure, not everyone should enter government bureaucracy or join the Peace Corps, but all Harvard students, by virtue of the innumerable privileges this institution has afforded them, must recognize their obligation to give back to society however they can. We call on the University to bring its students to that realization—it has the unique power to do so.
To that end, there are some additions the University could make right away. At the graduate level, we hope that funding for public service careers will be reinstated as soon as possible. At the undergraduate level, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should establish a secondary field in public policy, along the lines of the existing program in Global Health and Health Policy. Ideally, this program would be an interdisciplinary approach to public policy and would present the field as it should be presented to students, as something that can apply to any academic interest, whether in the sciences, the social sciences, or the humanities. In short, it should be designed to show that the public interest mentality can—and should—interest everyone.
Additionally, certain General Education requirements should deal more actively with the question of students’ obligations to society, especially coming from a Harvard background. General Education bills itself as a method of linking “the arts and sciences with the 21st century world that students will face and the lives they will lead after college.” General Education serves as our doctrine, thus we wish that the University would consider adding a provision that went beyond merely understanding the “world students will face” after college and that actually stressed the moral obligation students have to serve, as per Kennedy’s example.
Students can do their part by making serving others a part of their lives even while they are still in school. This can mean volunteering with a community service program, resurrecting the lessons of a forgotten scholar, or weighing in on policy debates in Washington.
In the speech that precipitated the establishment of the Peace Corps, then-Senator Kennedy told an audience in October 1960 at the University of Michigan that the “University is not maintained by its alumni, or by the state, merely to help its graduates have an economic advantage in the life struggle. There is certainly a greater purpose, and I’m sure you recognize it.”
In an age in which public service has come to seem a niche interest, we urge to Harvard to ensure that sense of purpose is still clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bright flags rippling in the wind, roaring crowds, an everlasting flame— these are the images most commonly associated with the Olympics. Social unrest and forced uprooting of people to build stadiums, roads, and houses do not immediately come to mind.
For three weeks this January, I, along with 14 other students from the undergraduate and graduate schools of Harvard University spent three weeks in Brazil participating in a collaborative field course with 15 Brazilian students. The course, called Engineering and the Urban Environment, was sponsored by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies in conjunction with the Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the University of São Paulo, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. It incorporated site visits and classroom discussions led by faculty from all three schools. One of the most memorable field visits for me was to Vila Autódromo, a developing area called a favela, surrounding the site of the future 2016 Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro. Often times, houses in these favelas do not have adequate plumbing or proper waste treatment. The land that these settlements are on will be used for Olympic infrastructure.
“We don’t want to move—the government always asks us to move and we feel like we are being taken advantage of,” said one woman living in the settlement we visited.
Tiago Donato, a policy intern at Catalytic Communities, a non-profit representing some of these communities, explained that the Brazilian government “counts on the international community not having direct contact with the communities that are being impacted by forced evictions.” He added, “The real problem is that our government employs several means, often successfully, to get residents of informal settlements to accept less than our law and Constitution provides them.” These injustices occur despite the fact that many settlement residents want to move to areas with better infrastructure. “Rio's public defenders currently represent communities in over 200 cases where residents are determined to stay on their land,” Donato said.
This situation is particularly striking because the Olympic Games are a symbolic gesture of world peace. During the sixteen days of the Olympics, countries set aside their differences in order to unite in friendly competition. Forced relocation and unhappy citizens are bizarrely out of place alongside the vision of Ralph Lauren tracksuits and spectacular firework displays. It is unfair that those from privileged backgrounds benefit from the enjoyment of watching the Olympics every four years while those in the poor neighborhoods where Olympic facilities are deemed necessary give up their friends and family ties to make room for expensive stadiums and large displays of a nation’s wealth and power.
Carlos Krykhtine and Luis Valverde, Secretariats of Housing for the City of Rio de Janeiro assured us, as Donato had said they would, that those living in informal settlements were eager to move into new housing developments. Gentrification is common in developing areas because new businesses and buildings are built; it is inevitable in a fast-paced economy. However, a better business solution would incorporate a more amicable arrangement for the locals who need to be relocated. Perhaps the government would be more successful if it incorporated community involvement, such as by employing the locals to help build new homes. Maybe the government needs to institute a more legitimate agreement to ensure that those who are relocated receive fair compensation. In addition, it seems that the effort to relocate people is met with resistance because it lacks a personal touch. Community developers, who can connect with the locals, rather than hoity politicians or businessmen, need to have greater involvement in such a relocation project.
This J-term trip was exemplary in that it enlightened students to the challenges of the real work environment. Engineers sometimes forget that simply installing the infrastructure isn’t enough—any type of significant social or environmental change is a result of collaboration across many different sectors and countries. I hope that the organizers of the Olympics in Rio do not forget this.

On Jan. 28, a Flyby Blog headline read, “Harvard Debates Life on Other Planets.” Unfortunately, in her Jan. 31 op-ed arguing for abortion rights, “Rethinking the Right to Choose,” Katie Zavadski ’13 refuses to debate it on this one.
“It’s time to talk about abortion as a medical procedure and not get caught up in the rhetoric,” Zavadski declares. Having decided that abortion is merely a medical procedure, she notes that “it would be utterly unacceptable” to oppose blood transfusions and wonders why there is such a different attitude when it comes to terminating pregnancies. Since “we can agree that everyone should have access to quality medical care,” Zavadski reasons, we should all embrace government support for abortion.
Her utter confusion about the opposition to her beliefs is pretty easy to straighten out. Ultimately, only the debate over the beginning of human life matters. Nowhere does Zavadski argue that her opponents are wrong to think that the unborn are human beings, yet she is baffled by their support for banning abortion and accuses them of “misrepresenting the truth” about it.
What is Ms. Zavadski referring to as “the truth”? Evidently, her own rhetoric and unsupported assertions.

We certainly welcome the opinion and tone of The Crimson Staff in its editorial "The Return of ROTC". ROTC has been an option for undergraduates since its arrival on campus in 1915, however it is but one element of the long, proud history of service and sacrifice in the U.S. military by more than 10 generations of Harvard men and women. One example is the fact that more than 150 Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are currently students at our graduate schools. Indeed, we commend Harvard’s decision and The Crimson’s subsequent reaction.

I am a junior at Stanford University and an officer of Stanford Students for Queer Liberation. I am frustrated and appalled by the rhetoric displayed in The Crimson’s Staff editorial “The Return of ROTC” published on January 31. As an advocate for civil rights, our organization is working against ROTC’s return to Stanford and against President Obama’s rallying cry for reinstituting the program across the nation.
The Crimson Staff first lauds the repeal of DADT and uses the now ostensible openness of the military as justification for ROTC’s return. In almost the same breath, The Staff points out the continued military exclusion of transgender and intersex people (though actually using the disparaging term "transgendered"), and then declares that this de jure discrimination should not be sufficient grounds for keeping ROTC away. To me, this is a huge logical hole. If discrimination against lesbian, gay, and bisexual servicemembers was a barrier, explicit exclusion of another identity group protected by Harvard and Stanford’s own respective non-discrimination policies should also be a barrier. Along those lines, if the excluded group were a racial minority, would this discourse be as defiantly pro-ROTC?
The Staff posits that the trans/intersex discrimination issue was not discussed until after DADT was repealed. No doubt, mainstream LGB (not T) organizations have been uncritically excluding transgender politics from the public discourse on DADT, but the National Center for Transgender Equality and other queer and transgender advocacy groups have been discussing these issues of access and discrimination. We should be questioning our unawareness of the transgender student exclusion issue.
The Staff also theorizes that Harvard failing to bring back ROTC risks a loss of credibility to administrators who promised ROTC would return after DADT. Schools like Harvard and Stanford do indeed have the ability to engage their communities in nuanced, self-critical dialogue. We, at both Harvard and Stanford, recognize that gender identity is more than a token addition to our non-discrimination policies. We can ask administrators to state that they were previously incognizant or unsympathetic to the institutional discrimination against transgender students, but that this argument is a compelling reason to uphold our investments in equal opportunity and oppose ROTC.
I ask that all universities considering ROTC, but especially those like Harvard and Stanford who possess huge cultural capital, issue statements opposing the program in support of their transgender students. Several of us at Stanford are working with queer and transgender advocacy groups like the NCTE, and they have explicitly stated that such statements would indeed have significant positive impact for their work in the area of military discrimination. This is not merely a “queer agenda,” however, but a problem that behooves attention from us all as students opposed to de jure discrimination in favor of civil rights.

Social media is a lot like the ugly cousin in the family: it’s not me. To be fair, it’s not you, either, because for every Facebook I didn’t invent, there’s a MySpace you utterly failed to dream up. The corporate ranks are filled with drones who weren’t the first to get LinkedIn, and lining the sunny beaches of Rio are thousands of sunbathers who aren’t much for wearing bikini tops and who never got around to creating Orkut.
And as for Twitter? It’s blocked in China, so that’s 1,331,460,000-plus non-innovators right there (Thanks, Google!).
No, ma’am, social media does not belong to us. We’re just the popularly elected and term-limited mayors of Foursquare, and we can’t do better than renting one of You’s Tubes. The people controlling these platforms are new-money aristocrats, an elite few who wooed venture capitalists and/or dropped out of this very institution, all with historically impeccable timing. They’re making moo-lah like White Castle makes hamburgers: really, really well, and you and I won’t see a dime of that money unless they decide to build their mansions out of dimes. They’re raking in that money from us, and from all our hard work cropping photos so you can’t see the bottles of Jägermeister taped to our hands.
And what paltry seconds will we get out of this? The ability to be active participants in the growing technological utopia? A new dawn of political transparency? Closer friendships, the ability to reconnect with our hottest flings, and business connections that might—might—lead to a lucrative career? The only guarantees in this world are the ones on these sites’ setup pages, as the industry begins standardizing privacy settings to protect users. Basically, we should be mad as hell.
Yet like all good things in life, my disappointment with social media has run its course. Sure, these sites got us hooked because everyone around us was hooked, and in the midst of the ensuing frenzy we uploaded all our personal information, only to have it sold to advertisers by the kilo. The Zuckerbergs of the world might have set out to create systems to connect people, but in the process they commoditized identity and began trading in our Jersey Shore-sized senses of self-worth.
But I think that’s kind of what we wanted all along. Never before has it been so easy to be seen, and never before has a generation felt they had so much to say. These internet oligarchs might have some ethical kinks to iron out, but what’s more important is that they recognized our need for expressive outlets and then gave them to the masses. We drank their new media Kool-Aid, and while their systems aren’t perfect, who are we to judge inventors for taking some license with their creations? Our generation’s main contribution to society thus far has been self-promotion, at least until my roommate gets through med school.
The majority of us who aren’t 6’5”, jacked, and Winklevi don’t have a whole lot of claim to the social media pot of gold. At the same time, however, these sites would be nothing without us and our incredible knack for complaining, 140 characters at a time. Imagine a Blogger without hipsters or a Flickr without drunks. They just wouldn’t work. Ideas were sparked, stolen, and used, but at the end of the day the same demographic that made “Gossip Girl” a hit also catalyzed one of history’s great communicative revolutions. We’re talking to more people in more ways than most ever thought possible, lighting up forums and flocking to the news like it’s free burritos. For a generation of individuals obsessed with taking photos of themselves in bathroom mirrors, the collaborative effort has been nothing short of stunning.
That’s right, people. It’s not “me.”
[Pause]
It’s “we.”
Thanks, folks, I’ll be here all semester. Possibly longer if my thesis doesn’t magically conclude itself.
Speaking of my thesis, I gotta run. It’s going to take all weekend to tweet this sucker, and that’s not even including the footnotes.

“The Big Shamrock,” what Shaquille O’Neal seems to be calling himself lately, was once one of the most dominant players in the NBA and is widely considered to be a future Hall of Famer. Since taking his talents to Boston, however, Shaq’s play on the court has been less notable than his well-publicized shenanigans off it (posing as a statue in Harvard Square, directing the Boston Pops Orchestra, etc.). He keeps his fans abreast of his Shaqtivities via his extremely popular Twitter account, which has nearly three and a half million followers.
“J. Lin,” what Jeremy Lin ’10 seems to be called by those who know him (keep working on that nickname Jeremy), was one of the most dominant basketball players in the Ivy League when he played for the Crimson and was recently named the NBA Developmental League’s Co-Performer of the Week. However, he has not played for the Golden State Warriors, the NBA team that signed him as a free agent this summer, since Dec. 20. This conserved energy has enabled him to satisfy the 22,000 people who “Like” him on Facebook and the 11,000 people who follow him on Twitter.
With so much social networking going on, it’s tough to keep up with these former and current Boston area stars. Here are some of the most insightful, useful, and beautifully worded tweets from our boys on the court. Let the tide of emotions that these verses inspire wash over you and transport you into the complicated lives of NBA players.

Last month, when astrologists reconfigured the 12 traditional zodiac signs, they were met with cries of outrage. After all, if you can’t count on the stars, what can you rely on? But now, with the heavens up for grabs, FM has decided to reach for the skies. Here, we bring you a sampling of our brand new horoscopes, based on previously neglected constellations.
Vulpeluca
Symbol: The Fox 
Birthday: May 1-31
Amateur astrologists would say that the Fox is sneaky or clever, right? Wrong! We know better; you are a final club rock star. On Saturday nights, you’re partying at the Fox, your final club sign-sake, and making Mark E. Zuckerberg totally jealous.
Pyxis
Symbol: The Compass Box
Birthday: Jan. 1-Feb. 28
You are a compass. You always know where you are going. Always. In life, and on road trips. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially don’t let your significant other make you pull over and ask for directions. You don’t need them. You’re not lost. Anyway, GPS is for wimps.
Corvus

It all started with this car they had, a 1964 candy red Ford Mustang, that my neighbor Joe had gone to pick up off a guy in Mill Basin. We were sitting at his kitchen counter, me trying to edge out the door, him telling stories. Back then—it had to be nearly 50 years ago—it was still forests there, and the guy had 20 or so cars in a lot he’d carved out from the trees. Fifteen bucks, he said. Joe had a friend named Cappy, who knew a bunch about cars, and he checked it out and said it was good to go. They pulled their buddy Johnny into it too and for five bucks each they had themselves a ride.
One night they decided that nothing much was going on in Brooklyn so they went into Manhattan to go to a club where they knew there would be a party. It was a Puerto Rican club, and all the women were Puerto Rican, and they wanted the boys to buy them two-dollar drinks, which the kids just didn’t have. So after a while they decided it was time to split, and they jumped on the FDR to head home. But on the Brooklyn Bridge, Joe looked up for a second because all the cars were honking, and he realized that they were going in the wrong direction. “Am I gonna get home tonight?” he thought to himself. Cappy was driving, and that was the last time they let Cappy drive, Joe switching with him once they got on dry land to get back to their homes.
They were dropping Cappy off first on Mill Avenue near Ocean when Joe, who had picked up the driving, realized the breaks didn’t work. He said, “Listen Cappy, I’m driving real slow, so you’re gonna just jump out when we get to your house and I’ll keep going.” So he did, and it turned out alright, until the old lady who lives a few doors down called the cops, said there was a mob drive-by and they threw a body out onto the street. The cops came to Cappy’s house first because he was Italian-American and he said, “I don’t know nothing about it.”
But what happened to the car? It turned out that Joe knew a guy a few blocks from there, who had a garage, and they pumped the brakes real slow until they were traveling slow enough down the avenue to stop. Some cars were really honking at them from behind and cursing, what’s going on here? The street got backed up for a few blocks and some of the cars darted up and down the side streets to get away. In the morning the guy gave them a new set of brakes, for a few dollars, at least that’s what they said.
That was a few months after they bought it. They still had the plates on from the guy in Mill Basin who sold it to them. Things were different back then. Eventually they figured they were pushing their luck enough with this piece of junk so they sunk it in the marsh off Avenue U, license plates and all. Who knows, it could still be there, roof just above the surface. You always remember your first car.
—Mark J. Chiusano ’12 is an English concentrator in Winthrop House. His parents always told him it’s not good to throw people out of cars.

It was a Thursday night, and my friend who had worked for the circus was administering my cheeks with lipstick until he deemed me audition-ready. For this night—the night of the Eleganza model auditions—the pants were coming off, the dresses were going on, and the heels were getting taken out of the closet. I was going to get an inside look at Harvard’s model selection process.
I’ve had some modeling experience in the past. In the photo, my eight-year-old self stood holding a stopwatch, my face partially obscured by a beaming blonde girl. But now it was runway, and my ankles felt wobbly in the four-inch stilts. After some pump up music from Enrique Iglesias and a few rounds of liquid courage, I was as ready as I would ever be.
When I arrived at Mather dining hall, I was ushered behind a line of long-legged girls (and a few very tall, very good looking guys—call me?). Prospective models had to fill out a short form. Special talent: strutting. Personal style—I hesitated on this one, considering some of my past fashion choices, like baggy pajama pants and two-day-old shirts whenever finals rolled around. I abashedly wrote, “too cool for school.” After a head shot with my model number, 78, I sat down and waited. I learned from the old timers that the auditions were held privately, in front of a panel of judges. You had to do two walks: a normal walk and a “pump up the crowd” walk.
The wait was a long one.  The buzz from the beginning of the night was slowly wearing off, and I became more acutely aware that I would be facing four girls who were going to decide if I was hot or not. That, and the burgeoning realization that my exaggerated blush made my face look like a huge stop sign.
Finally, number 78 was called. I was told to walk, pose, walk, then rouse the crowd. I strutted to “Whip My Hair” and my hips swung like they’d never been swung before. To rouse the crowd I tried to do a moonwalk—a bad idea in heels, for the record—and I shook my body like I was the weird sweaty guy gyrating by himself on the dance floor. One of the judges laughed, though I’m not sure if it was with me or at me. At any rate, the audition was over and I was out of the room before I knew it.
I have not heard back from them, yet, but I figure it doesn’t matter. I’m a supermodel now. No big deal.

We get it; it’s cold. Some combination of global warming, condensation, and karma has led to the skies regularly opening up and dumping frozen water on our heads. This has surely been and will continue to be supremely detrimental for travelers, and you can almost hear those mountains of crystals laughing at anyone who’s tried to board a plane since the first Snowpocalypse of the season. However, where the snow seems to have slowed us down most is on the streets. More specifically, the sidewalks. And it’s really not okay.
Although your average Harvard student is more than capable of barreling through crowds of tourists (always crowded around the John Harvard statue six minutes after the hour in rain, wind, or shine), snow seems to have reduced our pedestrian capabilities. There is no worse feeling than walking along Plympton Street, shuffling behind an Ugg-clad snail, with snow piled on either side of the path without a way to pass.
Granted, FM does not condone power-walking your way across black-ice straight to the doors of UHS, but why no middle ground? It’s pretty simple: Find some shoes with traction and prance your path to class. You will even get there faster, likely reducing the winter whines, which seem to be the topic of 95 percent of student conversations these days. (Exceptions: “What are you taking?” and “We should totally grab lunch and catch up!”)
So, if you’re on a sidewalk and a person going the other way can’t pass you because the Phoenix hasn’t shoveled, let’s make a pact: use the right side—that is, not the left. In fact, pretend you’re a car in general: stay to the right, pull over where needed, and if you feel compelled, honk.

The Crib: The bottom floor of Mass Hall
The Vibe: Like a classic New England home, with lots of white wood and brick, but with pieces of modern, ethnic-inspired flair. Completed in 1720, it’s surprisingly sturdy.
The Price: With artifacts as old as Charles William Eliot’s 19th-century desk, let’s not even go there. Just know that buildings just outside the Yard cost upwards of $1 million.
THE ENTRANCE
Entering the office’s lobby, the first thing that strikes you is how unassuming the entrance is for the number of important visitors who must pass through the space each year. The room is small, colonial, and warm. The three unupholstered chairs are light wood, and the small coat closet, where we hang our protective winter gear before University Spokesperson John D. Longbrake leads us through a set of glass doors down a long hallway to Faust’s primary office, is as mundane as they come.
THE OFFICE
Faust’s office continues to surprise—no ancient books, no dim lighting, none of the intimidation-inducing effects experienced by the Winklevoss twins in “The Social Network.” The office is a curious and well-balanced mix of furniture from former presidents, paintings and sculptures rented from Harvard’s collections, and Faust’s own belongings, from gifts from the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to a framed picture of her husband and daughter. The first piece of furniture you notice is the desk, an old mahogany-colored piece (Faust was unsure whether the wood was indeed mahogany) entirely covered with books.
“This desk belonged to Charles William Eliot—he was president from 1869-1909—and every president since then has used this in their office,” Faust says. (Maybe the office is intimidating for those who know the history of the furniture?)
The rest of Faust’s office is an eclectic mix of pieces collected in her travels and from Harvard’s museum collections. Above the fireplace hang some unconventional pieces of decoration—a textile from Zaire and two walking sticks, one that is African and one that is Native American. As a historian of the American South, Faust remarks that she learned all about the Southern tradition of carving walking sticks during her studies, and these pieces remind her of her academic passions.
She then proudly points out a Liberian statue of a gigantic spoon taken from the Peabody Museum. “The spoon statue is supposed to be in the dwelling of the most hospitable woman in the village,” Faust jokes. “That’s why it’s in here!”
Next to the statue lie two pieces that are particularly close to her heart—an intricate fan decorated with the Harvard shield and images of cranes, and a folded American flag. The fan was presented to her on a trip to Japan. “It was commissioned,” Faust explains. “It shows that the Japanese wanted to connect with and build a relationship with Harvard—our shield and the crane are placed side by side.” The flag was presented to her by the Reserve Officer Training Corps class of 2010. Faust displays other objects that remind her of Harvard’s students—in the hallway leading to the main office she has a rotating exhibition of student art, and on her computer table behind her desk she has an autographed picture of last year’s football captain, which he gave to her at the end of last year.
But, though much of her office decor is steeped in history, Faust has definitely put her own quirky mark on the space. “The furniture is much the same—the rug, desk, and chairs have always been here, but I moved everything around and added some more seating” to make it more comfortable, she says. Two soft couches are decorated with multi-colored pillows that Faust bought on Newbury Street during her days as the dean of Radcliffe, and her computer table is covered with personal mementos, from pictures of her family to the first-pitch baseball she threw at Fenway Park. Also framed is a  picture of her with Paul McCartney.
“My days are long. I am on the go from 7:45 a.m. to dinner, and this office is my home base for a good 12 hours,” she says. Faust spends a lot of time in her office, but how does she keep track of all she has to do as Harvard’s president? Not in the way you might expect—she writes herself reminders on Post-it notes and places them around her computer screen, counting on the bright hue of the paper to draw her eye to the tasks.
The last piece that Faust shows FM is the coffee table in between her two couches. As Faust opens it to show us that the table is actually an old, dark wood chest (which Faust guesses to be a dowry chest), she exclaims in surprise: “This coffee table is filled with alcohol! Oh no, don’t tell anyone that.” It’s okay, Drew. Even the president of Harvard has to have fun!

Ten years ago, Harold A. Moore was sleeping on the streets of Boston. Today, he has a red motor scooter, a college degree, and his own apartment.
Ellen “Helen John” E. Cromarty’s struggles with mental and physical health problems have resulted in homelessness on several occasions since her illness began 36 years ago. Employed and housed today, she gives change to homeless people she passes as she glides down the street in her motorized wheelchair. When she can’t afford to hand out coins, she carries sandwiches to distribute.
Poor business decisions compelled Shawn Lawrence to close his computer repair shop and take up construction work; then an on-the-job injury forced him out of work and onto the streets. Today, he is living in transitional housing and looking forward to renting an apartment and completing a degree in computer science.
Through Spare Change News, a biweekly Boston newspaper, these individuals and others like them have the chance to voice their stories. For many men and women—such as Moore, Cromarty, and Lawrence, all of whom make their livings by selling this newspaper on the streets—Spare Change itself becomes a meaningful new chapter in their narratives.
BY, FOR, AND ABOUT THE HOMELESS
Spare Change News bills itself as a “newspaper with a conscience.” The publication contains articles on topics affecting the homeless, poetry and artwork submitted by people living on the streets, and a listing of support services available to homeless people in the Boston area. The writers are drawn from two different pools—college students, who typically write for free, and Spare Change’s homeless and formerly homeless vendors, who receive a $50 payment for each piece they contribute.
Each Spare Change News vendor buys copies of the newspaper for 25 cents per issue and then sells them on the street for one dollar. Most vendors buy at least 50 papers each week; some of the top sellers hawk upwards of 300 papers weekly. All together, the corps of vendors sells 8,500 papers each week.
“It just goes to show that stereotypes—that the homeless are lazy, that they don’t want to work, that they’re all addicts—aren’t always true,” says Editor-in-Chief Adam J. Sennott. “Our vendors work tirelessly. I don’t know how they do it, rain or shine.”
STARTING FROM SCRATCH
Spare Change News was born in 1992, the brainchild of Tim Hobson, a homeless man, and Timothy Harris, a housed member of Boston Jobs with Peace. Hobson recruited about a dozen other homeless people whom he met at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, including James L. Shearer.
“I thought he was insane,” Shearer recalls. “How are we going to write and produce this thing when we all live in the shelter?”
Yet, inspired by the example of street papers in New York City and London, Spare Change’s eager founders unified around the idea and resolved to take their publication one step further: while the other papers were written by volunteers and then given to homeless people to sell, according to Shearer, the founders of Spare Change dreamed that theirs would be written as well as distributed by the homeless.
They met every day at the McDonald’s in Central Square, sometimes riding the T for hours to keep warm while they planned their project. After about seven months, the first issue rolled off the presses at The Crimson, which printed the paper for its first two years.
Within the first year, all of the founding members had earned enough money to get off the streets—and more than 60 additional people had signed up to become vendors. Shearer left the paper for other employment in 1994, then returned as a vendor in 2003. Two years later, he took over as the president of the organization’s board of trustees.
This January, Shearer, still the board’s president, returned to selling the paper two to three days each week. Due to “relationship issues,” he says, “I got in a situation where I might be facing homelessness again.” He insists, “It’s not a bad thing” and says that he is happy to be selling papers again at his former post in Brookline.
“This is my old corner. People remember me,” he says. “I missed it.”
WORK IN PROGRESS
Housed in the basement of Harvard Square’s Old Cambridge Baptist Church, Spare Change News’ main office is a cluttered room holding two computers (“When we can get new ones, we’re probably going to donate these to the Smithsonian,” Sennott says ruefully, gesturing at the bulky machines), a few rolling chairs, a bookshelf, and the hustle and bustle typical of any newsroom in the world.
Robert Sondak, a Spare Change vendor and one of the paper’s most frequent writers, strides into the office, fresh from an event he was covering.
“I interviewed five volunteers and the manager,” he reports.
Sennott quizzes him on the details of the event, then hits a snag. “You didn’t get any of their last names?” he repeats. His face registers the thought processes of a trained editor: mild disappointment, quick evaluation of options, and mental reshaping of the story flash across his youthful features. “We’ll just quote the manager heavily then,” he tells the writer matter-of-factly. Sondak agrees.
“I don’t consider myself a professional writer,” Sondak says in a conversation two months later—then reveals that he has written over 50 articles for Spare Change, one for nearly every issue of the paper that has come out since he started writing.
Sondak is an old hat at this, but “not every writer is at the same level as others,” says Sennott. While he tries to impart an editor’s guidance, he says he also strives to leave the writers’ unique styles intact.
“One thing Spare Change prides itself on is providing a voice for people,” Sennott says. “They each have their own kind of shock value. It’s amazing what people have been through ... there are so many different reasons people are on the street.”
There were 7,681 homeless men, women, and children counted in the 2008-2009 Homeless Census in Boston—an 11 percent uptick from 2007 to 2008. This is the community that Spare Change’s vendors know. “Our vendors have expertise about facets of society that mainstream society typically doesn’t see,” says Executive Director David J. Jefferson. “We try to be a catalyst through which mainstream society can learn about these human stories.”
SHELTER TO SCHOLAR
Moore has made his living entirely from selling Spare Change News for the past 10 years. When he embarked on his career as a vendor, he was sleeping on the streets, staying in shelters only during the coldest weeks of the year. He manages to sound nonchalant as he discusses his years of homelessness. “It wasn’t too bad,” he says, perched on his red Honda scooter as he sells his wares outside Shaw’s grocery store in Porter Square. “But by then I got sick and tired of the shelter. After selling the paper for a couple years, I got myself a bed.”
After a stint in that bed, which was a Single Room Occupancy unit at a YMCA, Moore purchased a van which he lived in temporarily, retaining his Y membership to use the facilities. Shortly thereafter, he decided to return to Newbury College to finish the degree that he had begun as an 18-year-old, nearly 30 years earlier. He sold the van, rented an apartment, and hit the books.
“For five years, I was working 30, 35 hours a week [selling Spare Change News], and another 20 going to class,” he recalls. “I was getting up at seven—and not getting home until 11 two nights a week. It didn’t seem like I never took a day off.”
One of Moore’s regular customers, who passed him in the Porter Square T station every morning, noticed his exhausting schedule. Concerned for his favorite paper vendor, this man took up a collection at his workplace and presented Moore with over $200 last Christmas, telling him to use it to take a vacation.
Instead, Moore put the money toward paying his expenses when he was unable to work for four months due to a debilitating foot condition. Today, his feet are on the mend—he’s walking again, though he relies on crutches—and he hopes to take that vacation sometime soon.
“I’ll get away for two to three days,” he says. “It’s going to be someplace warm. I haven’t been to too many places. Las Vegas, Miami, something like that.”
As his costs rise—he predicts that he will soon need to move farther from Boston as rent on his current apartment creeps higher—Moore says he will soon look to use his new college degree to get a different job, but he hopes to continue to sell Spare Change part-time.
A PRACTICED SALESMAN
Across the same parking lot, another vendor, Algia L. Benjamin, softly sings “Spare Change Newspaper,” as passersby head into CVS.
“I think I’ve made like four dollars today,” he grumbles. He says he sells “20, maybe 30” papers in a typical day, and this week—it’s just past Thanksgiving the first time I talk to him—Benjamin says that his intake “is really supposed to be better.” The Christmas spirit isn’t brightening today’s sales, though.
A woman bundled in a swank coat glances up from the ground when Benjamin croons the name of the paper.
“No, I’m sorry, I don’t,” she mutters. “At least she spoke,” he comments.
“A lot of people walking past tend to ignore you,” says Benjamin, who has been selling the paper since the year it was founded. “Even when you speak in a clear tone, they still pretend they don’t hear you.”
Things pick up a bit, though; in the next 45 minutes, one woman, who Benjamin says is a regular customer, buys a paper, and two more hand him a dollar but decline to take the news
paper. In the same amount of time earlier that morning, Moore made no transactions.
A few years ago, Benjamin attended the North American Street Newspaper Association’s annual conference where he met with representatives from the 30 other street papers in the organization. The highlight for Benjamin was the opportunity to travel to the event, which was held in San Francisco. “I’d never been there before,” he says. “I got to see the Golden Gate Bridge.”
As an early vendor and longtime staunch supporter, Benjamin is proud of the difference that Spare Change News has made in vendors’ lives. He numbers himself as one of the most profoundly affected by the project.
Talking about his sadness today when he passes panhandlers, Benjamin says, “I used to be like that. I’d sit on a crate with a sign. No sir, I don’t want to be out there—drunk all the time, drugged out. It’s not a good feeling.”
I ask how he overcame that time in his life, and he answers instantly: “Spare Change News.”
Now, he talks about his hopes for starting his own “non-profit landscaping business,” which will employ needy people to do yard work at low cost for elderly customers. He’s consulted businessmen for advice, and he plans to apply for a grant to get the project rolling.
Yet his troubled past is never far from his mind. “I just know I never want to be homeless again,” he says. “Like a lot of people are one paycheck away from homelessness—if I get sick and can’t work I’ll be back there. I have to make sure I eat right, dress right when we’re out here when it snows. It could be hailing and we’d be out here.”
He has just returned from visiting his parents, who moved from Boston to Florida in 1978 after a record-breaking blizzard hit New England. Even though he spends five to six hours outdoors selling the paper each day, Benjamin says he doesn’t want to relocate to a warmer climate like his parents.
“I think about it,” he acknowledges. “But my daughter’s here, and it’s not right for me to move .... If I could get [the girl’s mother] to move to Florida, I’d move. I’d go wherever she’s at.”
Benjamin and his daughter’s mom split up several years ago, but he and 10-year-old Jessica are still close. Sometimes, she comes to work with him. She helps him promote his wares—“People tend to buy the paper when you have a kid with you”—and he splits the day’s profits with her.
VETERAN ON THE STREETS
It’s a cold but sunny Saturday morning on Newbury Street, and Boston’s ritziest shopping district is still largely asleep. With a cup half-full of change and an orange plastic crate to sit on, however, Michael W. Wingate is already open for business.
Wingate’s story is the reverse of Benjamin’s and Moore’s: rather than coming to Spare Change homeless and securing housing through his earnings, Wingate has gone from sleeping in his own apartment to a shelter since he began selling Spare Change News in August.
A native of Alabama and an army veteran, Wingate moved to Boston with the assistance of the Veterans’ Association. The price of living in the city on just his Social Security Disability Insurance benefits was steep. Paying his rent became more difficult when his grandmother died and he began sending part of his monthly checks to his family to help them make ends meet. Considering panhandling but wary of asking for money outright, he befriended a group of experienced beggars who congregated at a Burger King. There, he learned about Spare Change News.
He began to buy papers, 20 at a time. On a good day, he says, he sells all 20; other days, he only makes eight sales.
The extra income was not enough to pay the rent on his apartment. Since November, he’s been sleeping in Boston’s Long Island Shelter. Five days a week, he sits on his crate in front of Dunkin’ Donuts. Usually, he’s selling Spare Change; when he does not have money to buy the 25-cent papers, he seeks donations from passersby. “Some days I use the money to buy me some food,” he explains. “Then I have to wait a few days and shake the cup to get up some money to go buy the papers.”
On Mondays and Wednesdays, he takes the day off to travel to Brockton, a multi-bus journey that takes him from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. to complete. He makes the arduous trip, he says, “for love.”
His girlfriend lives there, along with their 22-month-old daughter. Wingate, 52, sees his young daughter as frequently as he can—in part because he is still mindful of his other child whom he does not get to visit, a son now four years older than his own 30-year-old current girlfriend.
At age 17, Wingate engaged in a high school romance with a 16-year-old classmate. “We fooled around,” he says. “She ended up pregnant.” Feeling compelled to “be an honorable man,” Wingate joined the army in order to support his son.
He saw the child only once, when he traveled from his station in Fort Benning, Ga, to visit the baby and his girlfriend—and found that she had become involved with another man in his absence. All these years later, he still thinks about going to Cleveland, where he recently learned that the woman lives: “just kicking the door in and saying, ‘Where’s my boy?’”
He notes immediately that he would need money to finance such a trip, however, and every night in the shelter reminds him that he is not in a position to travel. At Long Island, Wingate says he encounters “crazy folks screaming and hollering like a mental institution.”
As if to illustrate his point, a person comes toward us. Wingate counsels me not to make eye contact with the person when they begin shouting into the nearly empty street.
The person is “partial to E&J,” Wingate says. He catches my blank look and clarifies, “Brandy.”
In his time at Long Island, Wingate says that he has witnessed drug use, even though shelter rules ban controlled substances. “They shoot dope there; they’re smoking crack. They’re selling five-dollar pints of liquor,” he says. “You see people naked in the bathroom looking for little white specks on the floor. Everybody thinks they dropped some.”
Wingate is no stranger to drugs. He was arrested in 1990 for cocaine distribution and spent seven years in prison. His youngest brother is serving a life sentence for fatally shooting a 15-year-old during a drug transaction gone tragically wrong.
“I put all that behind me,” Wingate says. “I constantly think about how I went wrong so I don’t go wrong again.”
Since he was imprisoned, he says, “I savor life a little bit more now. I enjoy the people. I don’t worry about money much.”
“I get my blessings from God,” he says. Even if “home” is a homeless shelter, “I go home with 10 to 13 dollars, and that’s enough for me. I ain’t greedy.”
He is generous enough to share his small fortune with the birds. He walks into Dunkin’ Donuts and purchases a bagel, which he crumbles into pieces and sprinkles on the sidewalk. “Come on, chilluns,” he coos approvingly, as the birds of Back Bay flutter down in front of him.
PROBLEMS IN THE PROCESS
These vendors have cultivated the trust of loyal customers. Not all, however, are so scrupulous.
Spare Change has been plagued by vendors who attempt to charge more than one dollar for the paper, claiming that the money is a donation to some nonexistent charitable fund.
Jefferson acknowledges that “even though it’s against our policies, there are some vendors out there who will have a nip [of alcohol] before they go out to sell.”
To address these problems, Spare Change gives badges to its approved vendors and prints a warning to customers on the front page advising them to buy the paper only from vendors sporting the fuschia tags.
WIELDING THE RED PEN
As editor-in-chief, Sennott hears stories like Wingate’s, Benjamin’s, and Moore’s every day—and helps them make it to press. It was stories like these that led him to Spare Change News in the first place.
Two years after dropping out of high school at age 16, Sennott decided that he wanted an education after all. He enrolled in an adult education program. Three years after he achieved his GED, Sennott was a junior at Bunker Hill Community College aspiring to become a sportswriter when he happened to walk past a Spare Change News vendor. Aspiring to write, he contacted the paper. His first piece was published, and the editor asked him to write another one. And another. And another.
By the time he graduated, Sennott had covered a multitude of topics for Spare Change News: a 93-year-old woman who has opened her home to nearly 100 foster children in her lifetime; a bill protecting homeless people from hate crimes which passed Maryland’s legislature but failed in Massachusetts; a book club for the homeless which meets regularly on the street. (When Sennott visited, they were reading O. Henry; he was surprised to learn that one of the members was a Yale graduate. “He had a degree in philosophy. That might have contributed to it,” Sennott smirks.)
At the time that Sennott graduated from college last June, the position of editor-in-chief had just opened up at Spare Change News. Though he is again applying to universities, including Harvard, and he still hopes to find a job in sportswriting someday, he’s happy in the editor’s desk for the moment.
“If the Celtics win another championship, it doesn’t really matter,” he says. “These stories that we publish really affect people’s lives. Someday when I’m a sports journalist, I’ll get to write useless stories, and that will be fun.”
PLANNING AHEAD, REVISITING ROOTS
Right now, Spare Change needs funds to continue telling its stories.
In 2008, the paper found itself on shaky financial ground. The newspaper draws the majority of its operating budget from donations, not paper sales, and everyone was giving less as the economy tanked. The cancellation of a major annual gift—The Crimson reported in 2008 that the donor, a member of the Buffett family, had formerly contributed $40,000 per year to Spare Change—left the paper’s leaders unsure whether it could survive.
“For a moment there, we didn’t think we were going to make it,” recalls Shearer. He and dozens of other dedicated vendors and volunteers redoubled their fundraising efforts. “This is something that we really can’t let go by the wayside,” Shearer says. “It gives people a voice; it gives people hope. It’s helped thousands of people get off the streets.”
So far, Spare Change has held on, mainly through appeals to individual donors. “Things have turned around to a degree,” says Jefferson. “Our funding is not nearly as secure as it ought to be. We’re okay for the next several months.”
Yet Shearer is optimistic. He hopes that following the paper’s 20th birthday, which it will celebrate in 2012, Spare Change will even be secure enough to increase publication to weekly rather than biweekly.
Shearer mentions that Harvard could help Spare Change meet that goal. “It’s our neighbor,” he says. The Spare Change office is located just down the street from Mr. Bartley’s and the Kong, and longtime vendor Gregory H. Daugherty’s booming sales pitch to each “young man” and “pretty lady” who walk through Harvard Square has been a fixture of undergraduates’ experiences for more than 15 years.
Shearer briefly refers to a $10,000 grant which Spare Change received in 2008 from a Harvard Business School student-run foundation, but he then enumerates what he considers more extensive involvement from other nearby universities. Suffolk University sends numerous students and faculty to volunteer; a lab at MIT has recently partnered with Spare Change to create online profiles for several vendors; and college students from throughout the region write for the paper, though Sennott says he has yet to have a writer from Harvard.
“I wish Harvard was a little bit more involved,” says Shearer. “We’d welcome them with open arms.”
For now, Shearer is concentrating on refocusing the paper on its original purpose. Before his tenure as president, he says that the organization came under the leadership of “your basic suit-and-tie crowd, Starbucks crowd, do-gooders” who neglected to focus the paper on homeless peoples’ views.
Benjamin complains that some of the stories that Sennott and Jefferson are most excited about—interviews with Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis, for example—do not directly voice the experiences of people on the street. “This is not the Boston Globe or the Herald. This is Spare Change, a homeless newspaper,” he says.
The current leaders are committed to keeping homeless perspectives central to Spare Change. Sennott proudly announces that an average of five to six vendors have been contributing to each issue recently, pointing out a cartoon drawn by a homeless veteran that adorns the back cover of the current issue.
Shearer shares this vision as well: “I want to get it back to low-income individuals running the entire operation,” he says.
KEEPING PERSPECTIVE
That original concept still holds a prominent place on the wall of Jefferson’s office, where a framed copy of the first issue announces, “Welcome to Our World.”
In the makeshift newsroom across the hallway, Sennott keeps another piece of Spare Change memorabilia tacked to the wall, a computer print-out in a plastic frame. It’s a quote from historian and Cambridge resident Howard Zinn: “Spare Change to me is an extraordinary illustration of what homeless people can do, because they can reach out to the public and say, ‘Here we are, and we’re intelligent and sensitive people. We’re poets; we’re writers. We’ll tell you what caused our situation and we’ll ask you to do something about it.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some undergraduates were upset by the College’s decision to hold classes in the wake of an almost seven-inch snowfall yesterday, but Harvard historically has been reluctant to declare a snow day.
The record-breaking snowstorm of 1978 was the first and only time in history that Harvard closed because of snow, according to Rev. Peter J. Gomes in a Crimson article in 2006.
The blizzard hit Massachusetts on Monday, Feb. 6, 1978, and The Crimson reported winds of up to 92 miles an hour and snow accumulations of 8 to 16 inches the next morning.
Administrators decided to officially shut down Harvard on Feb. 7, only after then-Gov. Michael S. Dukakis declared a state of emergency, closed schools for two days and called in 8,500 members of the National Guard to help clear the roads.
Many criticized then-University President Derek C. Bok for not closing the University immediately after the storm hit. According to Gomes, Bok responded, “I tried to, but I didn’t know how.”
By Wednesday, two days after the snow started, 29 inches had accumulated in Boston.
The snow was so deep that it buried any cars left abandoned on the road. Because Dukakis banned all means of transportation except for emergency vehicles, many students used skis to get around campus.
“We were cross-country skiing and literally going across the tops of cars,” said Patricia M. Nolan ’80.
Students entertained themselves in a variety of ways, holding snowball fights in the Yard and creating figures from the snow.
“Some of the sculptures were more artistic, and some were more graphic—like one might see in an art class with nude bodies and nude body parts,” Cara B. Seiderman ’81 said.
A group of freshmen created a make-shift ski jump on the steps of Widener, while other students sledded down the back of the library on “borrowed” dining hall trays. Some Kirkland residents elected to don bathing suits before venturing into the snow.
The three-day shutdown officially ended on Thursday, Feb. 9.
Students were encouraged to walk to classes the following day, but according to Seiderman, few students showed up.
“We didn’t have e-mail systems or anything like that, so there wasn’t instant notification for the students,” Seiderman said.
“So the professors came to classes and didn’t have many students,” Seiderman said.
The University officially resumed normal operations the following Monday, one week after the start of the snowfall.
Although the academic calendar remained unchanged, many professors held additional sections or added a class on weekends to make up for missed instruction.
Before the storm of ’78, the last time the College closed for weather-related reasons was during the New England Hurricane of 1938, a devastating storm that destroyed billions of dollars worth of property and killed hundreds of people.

It is unlikely that Harvard will be able to boast a full Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program in the next three to five years, according to Chairman of Harvard Advocates for ROTC Capt. Paul E. Mawn USNR (Ret.) ’63.
Many observers expected Harvard to officially recognize ROTC after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” but the University has not publicly recognized the military training program.
The University must take several steps and overcome obstacles if it wants to host the ROTC’s three programs—Army, Navy, and Air Force—Mawn said.
University President Drew G. Faust met with Admiral Mike Mullen in November shortly before the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which prohibited gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military, while he was visiting the Institute of Politics, University spokesperson John D. Longbrake said.
Despite the University’s expressed interest in bringing back the program—which withdrew from Harvard’s campus in 1969—“nothing concrete has been done yet,” according to Mawn.
The unit’s return to the University faces a series of hurdles including questions over funding and whether—despite the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military might still be in violation of Harvard’s non-discrimination policy.
Openly gay and lesbian individuals are expected to be able to serve after top government officials certify the policy’s repeal, but transgender and intersex-identified individuals are still not permitted to enlist because the military considers gender identity disorder—the psychological classification that describes transgenderism—and intersexism to be medical disqualifications.
Members of the Harvard queer community have said that the University—with its policy of non-discrimination—would be taking a hypocritical position if it allowed ROTC to return to campus.
“I think it’s wonderful that gay and lesbian folks can serve openly and can take on their right to serve, but ROTC and the military still openly violate Harvard’s non-discrimination policy,” said Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11. “Harvard needs to uphold our fundamental ethic of equal opportunity.”
Additionally, the lack of student interest in ROTC poses a major challenge for the unit’s return to campus because low enrollment would not justify having a unit on campus, said Isaiah T. Peterson ’12, who is in Air Force ROTC.
“Harvard needs to open up dialogue about what it means to train leaders,” said Associate Professor Kevin Kit Parker, who is a Major in the active US Army Reserve and a combat veteran.
In order to increase student interest, Mawn said that Harvard would have to refocus its admissions policies by actively recruiting and prioritizing students who exhibit an interest in military service.
But Parker said that this is the wrong way to increase ROTC enrollment at Harvard.
“I don’t think that we should re-look at the way that we admit. Harvard should endeavor to have the best ROTC program as part of endeavoring to be the best university. We will draw the very best ROTC students if we have the very best program,” Parker said.
Attempting to bolster the level of student interest in ROTC raises larger questions about the role of military service in the lives of Harvard undergraduates, who, Mawn says, do not consider the military a form of public service.
An attitude shift needs to occur and “Harvard has to show good faith in the process,” Mawn said.
ROTC may also face resistance from the faculty because of concern that military courses would not meet Harvard’s academic standards. A school that hosts ROTC is obligated to accept into the faculty any military instructors that are chosen by the Pentagon, according to Mawn.
Nathaniel G. Butler ’68, a Navy veteran and board member of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, believes that this opposition may simply be an attempt to delay the return of ROTC.
But Mawn does not foresee this as a significant hurdle, in part because many of the dissenting faculty are preparing for retirement, he said. “We can work around that.”
Though the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” passed last November, the measure is unlikely to be implemented until next fall as the Pentagon puts in place a plan to roll out the new policy without detracting from military readiness.

A Harvard professor accepted a prestigious New York City art prize for his firm’s work designing the Brooklyn Bridge Park.
Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor Michael R. Van Valkenburgh received the Brendan Gill Prize for the design of Brooklyn Bridge Park by his firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates.
The prize, which was awarded Monday evening, aims to honor artistic creations that “capture the spirit of New York.”
The Brooklyn Bridge Park—formerly a series of industrial piers that fell into disuse—is located along the East River in New York City. The park’s waterfront stretches 1.3 miles from the Manhattan Bridge to the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side of the river.
According to Van Valkenburgh, when his firm began working on the project eight years ago, the site’s former use as a pier and as an industrial space made it appear inhospitable to a green park.
“As cities, we have used up the conventional places for park-making,” Van Valkenburgh said. “Landscape architects work on disenfranchised sites—abnormal places for making landscapes.”
The park covers 85 acres of urban real estate with space for kayaking and traditional park features such as green space and playgrounds.
According to Matthew L. Urbanski, a design school lecturer, the location presented a unique challenge for the designers.
“It’s an incredible site with incredible opportunities in terms of reconnecting the city with the river,” said Urbanski, who is also a principal at Van Valkenburgh Associates.
According to Van Valkenburgh, the unusual quality of the site required innovation on the part of the designers who adapted technology from rooftop gardens and dry landscapes to help create a green landscape on a space that was largely paved over.
Van Valkenburgh also noted that the park’s view is one of its unique elements.
“You see the water in a lot of places in Manhattan, but you don’t sense this enormous boundless landscape of the water,” he said, referring to 800 acres of water visible from the park.
Past winners of the Brendan Gill Prize, including musician Sufjan Stevens and film director Ang Lee, have received the award for a broad range of artistic achievement, but Urbanski said that it is rare that it is given for landscape architecture.
“It’s quite an honor for a landscape architect,” he said. “We get awards for our work, but the Brendan Gill award is an artistic merit award.”
Van Valkenburgh said that he felt that receiving an award that had previously been awarded to artists in so many different disciplines was a tribute to landscape architecture.
“One of the things I’m the proudest of is that works of film, music, [and other disciplines] are spoken in the same paragraph as landscape architecture,” he said.

They didn’t care much about the sleet that beat down on Cambridge.
Three women jumped excitedly on the six-foot-high piles of snow outside the Science Center, opening their arms and embracing the heavy downpour.
Freshmen watched them with awe and frustration, as they clenched their jackets tight and waited to get into Annenberg Dining Hall, in a line that snaked nearly halfway to the Science Center.
A freshman, wearing jeans that were short enough to reveal her white socks and a pair of silver-blue athletic shoes blackened from the slush, dared to dart ahead of a break in the line.
“Shoot. I hate this weather,” she muttered, as she shook off her newly drenched shoes, cursing at the barely discernible puddle of slush that divided the line.
Her white socks had turned gray.
And so has Cambridge over the past week.
Nearly six feet of snow, much turned blackish-gray slush, has blanketed the city in a little over a month.
While some has melted away, the sidewalks of Cambridge are no longer hogged by huddles of friends, as three-foot-high piles of snow creep halfway onto the walkways.
Late students no longer leapfrog past their peers to hurry to class, forced to wait patiently in a single-file line up the streets.
The high snow piles notched a new record—the snowfall in the past January is the third highest amount of snow the city has ever received on record, at 38 inches.
The historic amount of snowfall shut down much of the University.
Many graduate schools were closed, and only necessary staff was required to come to work today, with Facilities Maintenance Operations staffers salting and cleaning paths.
“But not everyone has good boots,” said one staff member, who was clad in
a pair of the “better” black snow boots that came up to his ankle. He was headed home after shoveling snow from the steps of Widener Library.
Another FMO staff member silently continued to sprinkle salt on the steps, wearing the regular black shoes that he said most FMO workers receive as part of their uniform.
Below the stairs, two upperclassmen crossed from Old Yard to Harvard Yard, wearing Hunter boots and playing hopscotch around the freezing puddles that were forming black ice.
“I can’t wait to get back to Adams,” one said to her friend outside Thayer Hall, as they passed a graveyard of nine-feet-tall snowmen, who were pock-marked by pellets of sleet from the day, dehumanized now into large mounds of snow.
Just around the bend, leading to the Science Center, evergreen bushes peeked through their snow hats, a preview of the warm spring to come.

Gender, race, class, and other dimensions of identity are inherently related and intertwined, thereby contributing to systematic social injustice, said UCLA and Columbia Law School Professor Kimberlé W. Crenshaw at the second of a three-part lecture series on race.
Titled “Intersectional Interventions: Unmasking and Dismantling Racial Power,” the lecture focused on Crenshaw’s claim that oppressive forces in society, such as racism and sexism, intersect and can give rise to systems that reinforce power dynamics on the basis of discrimination.
“We should hire her to join the Harvard Law School faculty, which would directly incorporate her marvelous contribution to law directly into our curriculum,” said W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research Director Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr.
“Her pioneering theory and remarkable work to advance social justice should be shared with the Harvard community.”
At the lecture—hosted by the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute—Crenshaw discussed the DeGraffenreid v. General Motors Assembly Division court case in which a collective of black female employees sued G.M. under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the company’s industrial policies discriminated against black women. The court, according to Crenshaw, failed to recognize that the identity for which black women sought protection was at the intersection of the legally protected categories of race and sex, and consequently dismissed the claim.
Crenshaw further analyzed the historic 2008 Democratic presidential nomination process as a race that pitted feminists, siding with then-candidate Hillary Clinton, against anti-racism activists, advocating for then-candidate Barack Obama.
“Crenshaw is brilliant, and she identified how intersectionality can be used and misused,” said Emily A. Owens ’09, a graduate student in the African and African American Studies Department.
Crenshaw—a leading scholar in the arenas of civil rights, black feminist legal theory, and of the junction of race, racism, and law—accredited her sensibilities to her mother, Marian Crenshaw, the “quintessential woman of the 20th century.”
Marian integrated her community’s public swimming pool at age 4 and desegregated the local theater at age 17.
“My mother’s sense of gender was also a part of her radical anti-racism,” Crenshaw said.
Her opening lecture on Tuesday explored how the law constructs dynamics of racial power and privilege.
Crenshaw’s concluding lecture of the “Racing to Postracialism” series—“Global Iterations of the Du Boisian Knot: The Problem of the 21st Century is the Problem of the Color-Blind”—will be held today.

In light of the current turmoil on the streets of Egypt, the co-director of Harvard Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society has called upon Facebook and Twitter to announce and abide by a code of conduct that prioritizes user rights in the face of government crack downs.
“Twitter and Facebook have played a crucial role in almost any mass protest in the last few years,” co-director John G. Palfrey ’94 said. “They are taking on a special role, [so] they have special responsibilities.”
Palfrey called upon Twitter and Facebook to either come out with a code of conduct on their own or to join the Global Network Initiative—whose members include Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo—which created a code of conduct for companies in responses to crises like the current uprising in Egypt.
The GNI, of which Facebook and Twitter are not members, provides guidelines for how websites should “respect, protect and advance user rights to freedom of expression and privacy, including when faced with government demands for censorship and disclosure of users’ personal information,” according to the their website.
Though websites are bound to follow local law in the countries in which their users reside, local statutes sometimes conflict with the core values of the sites, said Jillian C. York, a project coordinator for the Berkman Center.
For example, if the Egyptian government petitioned Facebook to release names of all citizens who organized protests on the site, Facebook would be obligated under local law to comply, Palfrey said.
Although neither Twitter nor Facebook have joined the GNI or publicly announced codes of conduct, the two networking giants have responded differently to the uprising in Egypt.
Twitter worked with Google and SayNow to ensure that Egyptians had a way to access the social networking site during the internet blackout.
On Jan. 31, the three companies announced a service called “Speak2Tweet,” which allows users to call one of three international lines and leave a message. Workers then dictate the message, translate them to English, and make the posts public on the “Speak2Tweet” Twitter account. York said that staffers at the OpenNet Initiative—which partners with the Berkman Center—have helped to translate the messages, which have been posted on a separate Twitter account called “AliveInEgypt.”
Facebook, which critics allege has been more hesitant to fight government filtering than companies like Google, said in a statement that the turmoil in Egypt “is a matter for the Egyptian people and their government to resolve” and that “no one should be denied access to the Internet.”
Despite Facebook’s alleged passivity during the Egyptian uprising, Facebook membership in the country is at an all-time high at five million. In the past two weeks in Egypt, 14,000 pages and 32,000 groups were made by Egyptian users.
Media reports indicate that Facebook has been a critical tool for organizers behind the protests, which threaten to topple the long-time regime of Hosni Mubarak.
The Egyptian government’s move to shut off the internet from Jan. 27 to Feb. 1 was “rare” and “much more dramatic” than most other cases of government moves to control the Internet, Palfrey said.
While several dozen countries filter the internet—like China and Turkey—Palfrey said that the 2007 Safron Revolution in Burma was the only other incident in recent history where a country was taken completely off-line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the regular season draws to a close for squash teams across the country, the Harvard men and women will hit the road to take on Ivy League foes Penn and Princeton.
The No. 6 Crimson men (6-2, 2-1 Ivy) come into this weekend ranked between its next two opponents, with Penn (4-5, 1-3 Ivy) claiming the tenth spot in the nation and Princeton (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) falling a few spots above Harvard at No. 3. The Ancient Eight rivalry adds an additional spark to this weekend’s contests between Harvard and the two top-ten teams.
“It is always tougher playing Ivy League schools, because there’s a little bit more heat and tensions are high,” captain Reed Endresen said. “Everyone wants to win the Ivy League title, so this weekend will definitely be challenging.”
The Crimson visits the Quakers on Saturday for the weekend’s first match. Though Harvard comes in as the favorite, the contest is of utmost importance to the Crimson squad, and the team plans to approach the game with playoff implications in mind.
“We played both [Penn and Princeton] earlier in season in during the Ivy Scrimmages, and we beat both of them,” Endresen said. “Penn has dropped down a bit in the rankings since then, but we still have to take care of business on Saturday.”
After what Harvard hopes is enough time to recover between matches, the Crimson will face its toughest opponent thus far in No. 3 Princeton this Sunday. The Tigers sit second in the Ivy League, after a tight 5-4 loss to Yale last weekend.
“We want to go into the Princeton game both mentally and physically ready to play,” Endresen said. “Our goal is to win both matches and stay in contention to win the Ivy League.”
This weekend is key for Harvard if the team hopes to have a shot at the Ancient Eight crown this season, especially with a loss to No. 5 Cornell already in the books.
And with each member of the men’s team picking up two individual wins last weekend, the Crimson appears to be ready to begin the last stretch of the regular season.
“We’ve done what we need up to this point, and right now we’re just sharpening up,” Endresen said. “These next couple days we need to keep our minds on our team goals and stay mentally prepared to play tough matches.”
On the women’s side, matchups look to be challenging as well. Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) plays its next Ivy League opponents in the same order as their male counterparts, starting with the No. 5 Quakers (6-2, 3-1 Ivy) on Saturday and facing off against the No. 4 Tigers (6-2, 3-2 Ivy) the following day.
Currently ranked number one in the nation, the Crimson will focus on playing up to its full potential against No. 5 Penn and No. 4 Princeton.
The Quakers have already proven themselves capable of an upset, winning their most recent matchup against the Tigers, 5-4.
“You can never underestimate teams like Penn and Princeton. ” captain Alisha Mashruwala said. “They’re currently ranked fourth and fifth in the country and we’re ranked at number one, but that doesn’t say much. A lot of [what happens] depends on the day. We’ve trained hard leading up to these matches and everyone is playing really well.”
The women’s team picked up right where it left off last season—one in which Harvard earned a national team championship—continuing its undefeated streak through its six matches so far this year.
The Crimson has swept every one of its opponents by a score of 9-0 and sophomore Laura Gemmell—who looks to defend her national individual championship title this year—claims the top individual rank in the country.
Still, this weekend will provide Harvard with a big test, as the team will take on two of the country’s top squads.
“Penn and Princeton are two very strong teams,” Mashruwala said. “We’ve trained very hard these last few weeks, so what we want to do is just play our best and hopefully we’ll come out [of the weekend] with two wins.”
To do this, the women’s team will rely on their training regimen leading up to the weekend and a lot of team chemistry.
“The biggest things we have going for our team are our team sprint and the hard work that every single player shows, day in and day out,” Mashruwala said. “There is never a day when everyone is not giving her all. I think a lot of our success has come because we’ve worked very hard this season.”
“It’s weird because squash is an individual sport when you go out there,” she continued. “But you also have to do well as a team, which makes it a bit harder. The team aspect is what we thrive on. We really motivate each other to do well as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the last thing any of us want to do is go outside. Yup, the Super Bowl couldn’t come at a better time, and neither could the exciting Ivy League weekend we have in store. Specifically, in what should be a tight contest, the top men’s basketball squads—Princeton and Harvard—will face off this Friday night (the game will be broadcast on ESPNU). But the men’s game will have to share the spotlight with a duel between the top dogs of women’s Ancient Eight basketball—once again, the Crimson and the Tigers. We’ll give you an inside look at these games, so just stay where you are—it’s time for a little talk Around the Water Cooler.
Harvard men’s basketball is still riding high after beating Columbia and Cornell this past weekend, in the process extending its winning streak to eight games. But Friday and Saturday nights could change that, as the Crimson face off against the only two undefeated teams left in the Ancient Eight: Penn and Princeton. And unfortunately, Harvard will have to face both of these teams on the road.
At Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard has been nearly unstoppable, having won 13 contests in a row dating back to last year. But on the road, the Crimson hasn’t been quite as dynamic, winning just five of eight.
While the Quakers look beatable, Princeton will be a challenge. Certainly one of the most talented teams in the league, the Tigers just don’t lose to Harvard at home, having beaten the Crimson 21 straight times and in 37 of 41 tries at Jadwin Gym. Yikes.
It’s a big weekend for women’s basketball too, as Princeton and Harvard face off at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night. It should be a good game—so good, in fact, that ESPN called it one of the women’s basketball games to watch for the week. The undefeated Crimson will try to unseat the undefeated Tigers, who dominated the Ancient Eight last year. Princeton only lost one conference match in its entire 2009-2010 campaign, scoring 944 points while only allowing 705 in 14 conference games.
On a different note, February is, of course, Black History Month. And the Ivy League is doing its part in the celebration. Every weekday this month, IvyLeagueSports.com will highlight a different African-American in the Ancient Eight sports community, asking him or her questions related to the black community. The celebration began by highlighting Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who in his video interview discussed the importance of Martin Luther King Jr. and his messages of nonviolence and understanding. It’ll be sophomore forward Kyle Casey’s turn to share his thoughts on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of sports, “tough” is a botched shot, a missed field goal, or a loss at the buzzer.
But the adversity that 12-year-old Nathan Potvin faces gives new meaning to what a tough situation really is.
At five years old, the New Hampshire native was diagnosed with a spinal cord tumor. After a series of brutal procedures, the disease went into remission.
A boy who once faced possible paralysis now plays Little League baseball and youth-league hockey, where a two-sport middle school student finds his true calling.
Even after leading a normal and healthy life for years—as Nathan did—all patients with serious illness fear the news that he got last spring. During a check-up with specialists in Boston, Nathan and his family were informed that the tumors had returned, and that he would need to undergo an aggressive course of treatment. Doctors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute prescribed 15 months of chemotherapy, a grueling treatment for anyone, let alone a seventh grader.
Despite the prognosis, Nathan hasn’t stopped participating in hockey. The only difference is that his practices and games are in Cambridge instead.
Nathan’s doctor recommended him to Friends of Jaclyn a few months ago. The foundation pairs children facing serious illness with local high school or college teams and has developed a national presence.
FOJ has worked with Harvard before—the baseball team “adopted” a three-year-old, Alex Wawrzyniak, last spring, and softball coach Brandi Gordon works with the non-profit. The team is looking to adopt a girl of its own this year.
When the charity connected Nathan to the Crimson men’s hockey team, the coaching staff was quick to jump on the unique opportunity.
“Coach Donato brought it to my attention earlier in the year, just after I was hired here,” said Bill Downey, director of hockey operations. “I knew it was something that the players on the team would really take a hold of and get involved with.”
Downey says that Nathan, who comes to team functions with his father, family, and sometimes with friends, has become full member of Harvard hockey. One of the primary goals of FOJ, after the adoption, is to incorporate the child into the team to create an extended support group.
“He was a little shy at first, but he’s opened up quite a bit and the team has really taken a [liking] to him,” co-captain Chris Huxley says. “He’s part of the team. It’s good to have him be part of the team.”
As a member of the Harvard hockey, Nathan gets to enjoy some of the benefits that come with being an athlete for the Crimson. Like his teammates, Nathan has his own locker.
Last Friday, Nathan was introduced at a game with the team. Downey asked Mike Potvin, Nathan’s father, to get his hockey gear—which Nathan usually keeps in the car—out of the trunk.
“And then [Downey] said, ‘Here’s what I want to do: during lineups, we introduce Harvard, but we also want to introduce Nathan,’” Mike remembers. “[That] was really cool.”
On January 28, Nathan was introduced to the crowd at Bright Hockey Center as a member of the team.
His new-found team participation has meant more than a roster full of new older friends.
Throughout most of his life, Nathan’s visits to Boston have usually been associated with treatments or medical consultations.
These days, trips to Beantown aren’t just about hospital visits anymore.
“The biggest thing for Nathan is that it gives him something good to look forward to going to Boston,” Mike says. “Every time before the Harvard relationship, he always thought of Boston as treatments, shots, probing and prodding. Now when he goes to Harvard, it’s a good distraction.”
Nathan will often join the team shortly after finishing a day’s treatment. Despite the often agonizing side-effects of chemotherapy, he remains upbeat when he spends time with the team.
“He’s a fun-loving kid; he’s very positive,” Huxley says. “To be honest, if you just met him, you wouldn’t even know there’s anything going on. He’s really happy every time he’s around the rink.”
Visitation hasn’t been one-sided. A few members of the team surprised Nathan after one of his treatments at the hospital. But it was the team’s presents, not its presence, that surprised the 12-year-old the most.
“[Co-captain] Michael [Del Mauro] came up to me and said, ‘Hey, does Nathan play video games or anything?’” Mike recounts.
Nathan’s father said the he had planned on giving Nathan a Playstation 3 for his birthday later this month, and suggested that the team buy NHL 11, a popular hockey game for the system. Del Mauro declined.
“[Del Mauro] said, ‘No, Mr. Potvin,…you don’t understand. We want to come by the hospital and bring the whole console, with the NHL 11,’” Mike remembers the co-captain saying.
The team gave its early birthday present to Nathan later during the hospital visit.
“When he opened it up, he had no idea,” Mike says. “He was really shocked.”
Nathan now gets to play NHL 11 with some of his teammates, using Xbox live to take on the members of the Crimson back in Cambridge. His father also says that he has regular e-mail contact with Del Mauro, and regularly communicates with the team in one way or another.
Nathan’s time at Harvard has turned the whole Potvin family—who previously had no connection to the school—into some of its most ardent fans. According to Mike, everyone in the family, including Nathan’s younger sisters Paige and Grace, proudly wears Crimson gear.
“Right there near the top of their [Christmas] list was Harvard gear,” Mike says. “Anything that says Harvard on it. I actually just bought a Harvard hat the other day at the rink.”
Likewise, Nathan has turned the Crimson hockey team into ardent Potvin fans.
“You see him cheering the guys on and…being positive,” Downey says. “You think about the things that you’re faced with every day, [and then you see] a kid like that is battling such a tough disease and he can remain upbeat and lives to be around the game.”
“Having him around has kept morale up with the guys, and hopefully in return, him being around us helps him out in some ways as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Step aside, Yale. This is the year of Harvard-Princeton—as far as Crimson basketball is concerned.
Friday marks the first contest between the Ivy League’s two currently undefeated teams: the Harvard women’s basketball team (11-6, 3-0 Ivy) and the Tigers (14-3, 3-0). Quite the rivalry is brewing up between these two squads, as Princeton was the only team to sweep the Crimson during the regular season last year. Saturday will feature Harvard’s second conference game at home this weekend, as the Crimson will host Penn (7-10, 1-2) in an evening contest at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We’re really excited going into the Princeton game,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “Since Princeton is undefeated and the defending Ivy champion, everyone is looking to them and looking to match them up. We’re hoping to be the first team to do so.”
Two losses against the Tigers and one defeat against Dartmouth at the start of last season were the only blemishes on Harvard’s Ivy record, denying the Crimson the top spot and just earning the team an entry in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament (WNIT) for the second year in a row.
The Tigers went to a different competition—the NCAA tournament—where the Ivy League champions lost against a then-No. 6 St. John’s squad. The loss denoted the end of a 21-game winning streak, a feat for a team that had finished below Harvard in third place just the year before.
“Last year, we were pretty disappointed with the losses,” junior point guard Brogan Berry said. “Everyone is eager to get back into Ivy League play, especially for this game. We are the underdog again this year and are going to use the early season rankings as added motivation to beat Princeton.”
Harvard has remained stagnant in second place for the past three seasons. It was almost four years ago, on Mar. 18, 2007, when the Crimson last made an appearance in the NCAA tournament in a first-round loss to Maryland.
Penn women’s basketball has failed to rise above the bottom half of the standings ever since the 2006-7 season, when the Quakers boasted a .500 record.
“Both games this weekend are really important,” Berry said.  “We try to act like every game is a championship game. Our goal is to regroup after Friday’s game and come out hard against Penn…they’ve been playing a bunch of teams really [closely], so we want to come out with the same amount of energy and focus [against the Quakers].”
After demolishing the Big Green at the start of the season and taking care of Columbia and Cornell on the road, the Crimson will face its biggest test of the season thus far by hosting the defending Ivy League champions. No other conference opponent is projected to give Harvard such a battle since the Tigers are the team to beat. Capturing the win in the first game of the season between the two squads would be a key step towards the Crimson’s 12th Ivy League championship.
“This weekend is obviously huge for us,” Berry said. “We’ve been planning and preparing during the whole season for this one. We’re getting ready to take the hard work we’ve been putting in during practice and apply it to the game.”
The home team can afford to be confident, as it has recently put a string of wins together after starting out the season alternating wins and losses for several weeks. Harvard has won its last five games in a row by an average of 18 points, though that number can be a bit deceiving.
The Crimson had a scare last weekend against the Lions in a game that came down to the final three seconds of the contest. It was rookie Christine Clark who sunk a baseline jumper with the shot clock running down to give Harvard the much-contested win. The Crimson then shook off the jitters to embarrass Cornell by a 31-point margin of victory.
Princeton will be coming into the game with momentum on its side as well. The Tigers haven’t had a close game in conference play yet, defeating Penn by nine points and blowing out both Brown and Yale on the road last weekend. Princeton is also enjoying a winning streak of its own, securing the win in six consecutive games and 11 out of its last 12 contests.
Penn’s current Ivy League season started out with two losses—at Princeton and at Yale—but the Quakers got a bit of confidence last weekend after handily defeating Brown by 20 points. Though Penn hasn’t consistently played at a level to beat the Crimson the past couple of seasons, Harvard cannot take any game for granted, especially a night after a marquee matchup.
“We don’t want to overlook any other team—just look at the game against Columbia; it was a one-point game,” Matera said. “[The Lions] only had two wins this season prior to playing us. Obviously, Princeton is the No. 1 team to beat, but we need to come ready to play every game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nowadays Joe Philbin can be seen roaming the sidelines of Lambeau, coaching a team many New Englanders still haven't forgiven for Super Bowl XXXI.
But before the Springfield, Mass. alum became a Super Bowl-bound offensive coordinator, he was an assistant coach for Northeastern and then Harvard.
A graduate of Worcestor Academy, Philbin coached the Huskies from 1995-1996 followed by a stint with the Crimson from 1997-1998.
“I think in terms of him becoming a high-level coach, his success is no surprise,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy told Christopher Price of WEEI. “The guy was always fundamentally sound, he was always prepared and he was always very easy going and a great teacher. You put all those things together and it’s not a major leap of faith to think that he’s going to be a success at the highest level.”
Read the full article here to learn of Philbin's journey from Massachusetts to Green Bay:
http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/football/christopher-price/2011/01/31/ex-harvard-nu-assistant-verge-super-bowl-title-p
The schools Philbin left behind have gone in opposite directions following his departure. The Crimson has emerged as a perennial title contender and won the Ivies in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2008.
Northeastern won the Atlantic 10 in 2002 but had struggled ever since, prompting the university to cut the program following the 2009 season.

Harvard biomedical engineering professor David A. Edwards, creator of the "breathable chocolate" device Le Whif, has developed a new breathable food product: Le Whaf. The difference? 
"If 'whiffing' is eating by breathing, Le Whaf is drinking by breathing," Edwards said.

Le Whif delivers the taste of chocolate via a breathable powder. Le Whaf is a bit more complicated: it uses ultrasound to create a liquid cloud of flavor. Formed in a large bowl, the cloud can be "poured" into a glass and "sipped" through a straw. Beverages such as juice work best, but special liquid mixes can be used to create the taste of foods like pie.
While it may seem odd to eat without actually chewing your food or feeling its texture, a major bonus to "whiffing" and "whaffing" is that you barely take in any calories. That means delicious chocolate sans weight gain. (We'll let you digest that for a moment.)
Edwards believes that in today’s world, "we are now eating to taste, not to get full." Using Le Whaf, food lovers can enjoy their favorite flavors without packing on the pounds.
In the beginning, breathable food was "very much an artistic experiment," said Edwards. He didn’t imagine it going commercial. Now, Le Whif can be bought online and Le Whaf will be launched this fall in France. "Restaurants have for quite a while expressed interest in this," he added, hinting at a future where we could enter cloud filled restaurants and breathe in a multitude of flavors.

Closet American Idol followers and enthusiasts need no longer hide away in their rooms to watch the show on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. They can now justify procrastination (and secret Idol obsession) by supporting Molly D. Swenson '10, who is a contestant on the tenth season of the popular television show. Swenson, currently a White House intern, made her American Idol debut last Wednesday night on Fox.
The tall blond beauty impressed the judges with her credentials, but she blew them away with her rendition of Otis Redding's "(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay."
"I was impressed at how low you started ... It sounded really rich down there, which is a tough thing and tough to control when you're nervous," said Jennifer Lopez, a judge on the show.
The other judges seemed very impressed as well.
"I think you're terrific," Steven Tyler said.
Randy Jackson seemed to have a hard time figuring out why it had taken her so long to audition. Now that she had though, they weren't about to let her go, White House intern or not.
"Tell Obama we need you," Jackson said. "Who knew what was going on at the White House?"
He might as well have asked what was going on at Harvard. Swenson had an illustrious singing career at the College as a four-year member of the Harvard Opportunes, the oldest mixed gender a cappella group at Harvard. Swenson held the position of musical director her sophomore year and was the main choreographer for the group during her last two years.
From the very beginning of her career with the Opportunes, Swenson stood out.
"She was one of the most incredible singers I had ever heard," said former Opportune Sam L. Linden '10. "You could tell there was something really remarkable about her voice."
"Even if it was a guy's solo, she was always a contender," said Opportunes President Ebele M. Anidi '12.
Swenson wore many hats at Harvard. Besides singing, she played volleyball and served as one of the club volleyball team's co-captains during her junior and senior years. Swenson was also one of the earliest members of La Vie, one of Harvard's five female final clubs and served as its vice president during her senior year.
The more pressing question at the moment, however, is how she will handle the transition from Sanders Theatre to Hollywood.
"I think she'd handle it perfectly, because she's Molly Swenson," said Opportune Sasha A. Rohret '12.

It's not every day that you see a penguin come to tea. But if you  happened to waddle through the puddles of Quincy yesterday, you might  have noticed four of them smiling back at you through the rain.
About this time last year, Ann E. Kurrasch '07, a Quincy house elf, sculpted a whole living room—including television set, armchair, footstool, dog, and cat—out of snow in the  courtyard of Quincy House. Yesterday, she set out in the cold rain to  sculpt the Quincy House mascot.
With the help of a crowbar she borrowed from Quincy House Co-Master  Deborah J. Gehrke, Kurrasch later completed her rendition of "Make Way for  Ducklings" with three smaller penguins. Some black spray paint and  orange food coloring would help complete the quartet.

Students were forced to wade through large slushy puddles or find creative ways around them in order to get to classes on Wednesday. Some wore practical rain boots while others sported high-heeled shoes or even flip-flops. Particularly perilous crossings inlcuded Mount Auburn Street by the Hurst Gallery, Quincy Street by the Sackler Museum, and the main stretch of Mass. Ave.

Tomorrow night, the Office for the Arts is hosting a Clay All Night event for all of us looking to express our creative sides. Open to people with all (or no) levels of experience, this activity runs from 8:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. and is completely free. Participants will have the opportunity to sculpt clay, learn to use a pottery wheel, and enjoy food and music. If you want to return later to glaze and fire your project, you can pay $20 or spend two hours after the event helping to clean up the studio.
"It's a ton of fun," said Heather V. Hawkes '13, who has attended the biannual Clay All Night event twice. "It is kind of a rare opportunity to play with, basically, mud."
A special shuttle will take clay enthusiasts from the Holyoke  Center to the studio across the river every half hour, starting at 8:30 p.m.
Intrigued? Check out a video of last spring's event, and click here for more details.
