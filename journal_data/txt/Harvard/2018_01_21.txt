After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

HANOVER, N.H.—It would take 45 minutes—not 40—for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to earn his 200th career win for the Crimson on Saturday night in a road contest against Dartmouth.
Despite holding a commanding 41-24 lead at the 12-minute mark of the second frame, Harvard (7-10, 2-0 Ivy League) went stone-cold for the ensuing five minute stretch and saw the hosts (4-11, 0-2) turn a previously one-sided game into a nailbiter. The Big Green scored 10 unanswered points in that span and continued a dominant 22-5 run to even the game with 2:03 remaining.
The Crimson, however, was able to temper the raucous Hanover crowd to finish regulation. Sophomore forward Seth Towns, who matched a career-high with 26 points during the game, was fouled driving to the basket with just 2.6 seconds left to play and his team trailing by two. Unfazed by the clamorous roar of the Dartmouth fan base, Towns knocked down both shots to force overtime.
“I shoot free throws every day,” Towns said. “I went to the line and said this was no different from any other free throw I shoot. That is always my mentality.”
In extra time, Harvard regained its shooting stroke and appeared re-energized on the defensive end. Critical interior field goals by sophomore forward Chris Lewis and triples from Towns and classmate Justin Bassey were sufficient to close out a 62-57 final game score. Bassey tallied a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds, while also snatching four steals.
“We talk about three things in terms of the C words for us: concentration, composure, and confidence,” Amaker said. “We got into a drought there and couldn’t score but we needed to maintain composure and at the end of it, you got to have confidence to finish it. I thought we did those two things incredibly well.”
The Crimson limited the Big Green to just 18 points in the first half while forcing nine turnovers. Much like Harvard’s second half scoring drought, Dartmouth had its own extended stretch of blankness in the first frame. For a eight-minute stretch beginning with 12 minutes to play, the Big Green missed six consecutive field goals and two free throws, and consistently had difficulty bringing the ball into the painted area.
Harvard’s impressive first half defense dipped slightly in the final minutes of the first frame and the Big Green appeared rebooted after a powerful two-handed slam by freshman forward Chris Knight at the four-minute mark. From there, Dartmouth strung together two consecutive baskets in the paint and then denied two straight shot attempts on the other end. The Big Green still trailed 27-18 at the half, but those eight points in the final four minutes were enough to bring the Dartmouth crowd to its feet leading up to intermission.
“Give them a whole lot of credit for regrouping,” Amaker said. “I thought the shot at the end of the half was a big momentum shot for them…The game is 40 minutes. I was just pleased and proud of our kids for making the necessary plays to gut out a win on the road.”
Both teams appeared sluggish coming out of the locker rooms, combining for just five points in the first four minutes of play. The next four minutes, however, was all Seth Towns. Until the Big Green’s massive run starting at the 12-minute mark, the Crimson’s high point man on the evening demonstrated his finesse from a variety of spots on the court, including a step-back three, crossover deuce, and a drive-in to the basket.
Another player who played a critical role in the Harvard victory was sophomore forward Henry Welsh, who logged six points, six rebounds, and two blocks in a season-high 16 minutes of action. With Lewis in foul trouble, Amaker turned to Welsh in the final few minutes of play. Beyond the numbers, Welsh also created important opportunities for his teammates through setting screens and commanding the paint on the defensive end.
“I thought Henry was tremendous,” Amaker said. “I don’t think we were able to come away with this victory without his solid, savvy play…He is so unselfish and certainly played a big role for us this evening for how he came in and gave us moments on the glass [including] offensive rebounds, just keeping the ball alive.”
The victory on Saturday moved the Crimson to 2-0 in overtime games. While sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken—who was inactive on Saturday with a knee injury—led his team to a 70-67 win over UMass on Nov. 12, it was a balanced and resilient attack on Saturday that willed Harvard to victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team hardly has a storied rivalry with St. Lawrence. As the teams faced off for overtime on Saturday night, though, the boos that filled Appleton Arena could’ve fooled anyone.
In a game with multiple momentum shifts and an audience that only got more boisterous, the Crimson put away the 4-3 win in overtime, and returned from its annual weekend in the North Country with three of four points.
“We feel fortunate to get the win tonight,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We probably could have done some things to close the game out when we had the lead, but give them credit.”
The Crimson (9-6-4, 8-3-3 ECAC) bested the Saints (4-18-2, 0-11-1) on the back of a two-goal performance from junior forward Ryan Donato and a seven-point night from its top line.
Junior net-minder Michael Lackey (3-1-1, .904 SV%, 2.65 GAA) started his first game since a Jan. 9 tie against RPI after coach Donato yanked go-to goalie and tri-captain Merrick Madsen on Friday for conceding five goals to Clarkson.
Saturday night marked Harvard’s fifth overtime game in its past six contests. Despite the extra mileage on the team’s legs, this stretch has treated the Crimson icemen well, as they are 3-0-3 in that time.
“We’re a good 5-on-5 team,” said the younger Donato when asked about the team’s approach to extra hockey. “We like to get it behind their D...to the point that they get worn down. Especially when we’re playing late in a game or going to overtime, that’ll matter for us.”
Despite the home team’s winless ECAC record and Harvard’s 3-1 lead early in the third period, St. Lawrence managed to tie the game with less than one minute remaining in regulation time.
Senior Mike Marnell, who had already scored on a shorthanded breakaway in regulation, almost had a second go at Lackey in overtime. A diving glove save kept the Crimson in it.
“They were playing hard,” coach Donato said. “Lackey made a huge save there.”
Soon after, Harvard sophomore Nathan Krusko’s shot went wide of the cage. Freshman Jack Badini jumped on the puck, banking it off the pads of junior goalie Arthur Brey and over the goal line. Much to the crowd’s dismay, a review confirmed the play as a good goal.
“[It was] maybe a little fortuitous bounce off the end-wall,” Badini recalled. “I just went to the net and shoveled it in...I’m pretty happy about that.”
The hosts broke the ice early in the first, as St. Lawrence senior forward Ryan Lough cleaned up a rebound past a falling Lackey. Only a few minutes later, though, Donato notched two quick goals on near-indistinguishable snipes from the left circle, giving the visitors a 2-1 lead midway through the first 20.
Linemate and fellow junior Lewis Zerter-Gossage nabbed a pair of primary assists on the goals, which also demonstrated the smooth puck-moving abilities of sophomore defenseman Adam Fox. Incidentally, the two are now tied for the most assists (12) on the team.
Donato’s two tallies give him sole possession of the NCAA goal-scoring lead, as the recently-named Olympian is the first skater to 20 goals this season. The 19 games in which he reached that milestone are the fewest played of the top 30 goal-scorers nationally.
“I’ve got two great linemates, Pelton-Byce and Zerter-Gossage,” said Donato, spreading the praise. “One of the things I can do well is put the puck in the net; these guys put me in good situations.”
The second period, while goalless, saw Harvard kill both its penalties with some sprawling saves on Lackey’s part. A 5-on-3 for the Crimson early in the third frame proved fruitful, as Zerter-Gossage dug the biscuit free of a scramble in front of the net and stuffed it past a stretched-out Brey. Zerter-Gossage’s three-point night brings him to 19 overall, good for second on the team.
The weekend’s valuable three points maintain Harvard’s position at fourth in the ECAC as of Saturday night. As conference standings begin to settle, the Crimson will look to grab every point it can get.
“Knowing this league, every point is enormous,” coach Donato said. “[It] could be the difference between going on the road or having home ice or having a bye.”
In the nearer future—the ECAC tournament is still weeks away—Harvard will return home for tilts with Cornell and Colgate as it looks to avenge a two-loss weekend and heartbreaking defeat at Lynah Rink back in November.

As a pre-frosh, you probably imagined that your breaks from Harvard would be filled with extravagant vacations and engaging opportunities. But alas, you’re broke, no one wanted you as an intern, and you spent break dressed in pajama casual more than in business casual. So what to say when your jet-setting, pants-wearing peers ask what you did over break? Flyby has prepared some half-truths to have at the ready:
Talk about a made-up significant other from back home
Yes, we baked cookies and wore matching sweaters every day. No, he doesn’t have a Facebook.
Pull out Instagram pictures from past vacations
Your holiday plans might have been boring, but you’ve probably gone on a cool trip at some point. We all told some white lies on our Harvard applications anyway, so who cares if you (re)post some old photos?
Pretend that you get along with your family
Tell everyone you enjoyed spending quality time with your parents. Leave out the fact that you only went near them if they were buying you dinner.
Glorify your hometown
Oh you’ve never heard of the random suburb that I grew up in? That’s such a shame, we have really cute coffee shops and beautiful hiking trails.
If your winter break really was mediocre, don’t worry about it; in a few days you’ll be too busy to dwell on it at all. And, yes, I for one actually did interesting things over break. Like...uh...write this one post.
