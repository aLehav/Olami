After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Last Stand” opens with a policeman sitting on the side of a road at night eating a donut. This is not a particularly novel sight in television or film; cops eating donuts are an old trope. The issue with this flimsy initial scene, however, is the same problem that plagues the entire film. While covering well-tread ground is not itself a flaw, it can be a serious misstep without interesting characters or plot developments to make it more than just hackneyed. “The Last Stand” contains some competently shot action sequences, but its thin plot and shallow characters make it nothing more than a feeble echo of other films of its genre.
“The Last Stand” is set in the fictional border town of Sommerton Junction, the inhabitants of which include sheriff and shell-shocked LAPD veteran Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Law enforcement in Sommerton Junction is usually uneventful, but this changes when FBI Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) and Owens learn that a fugitive named Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) plans flee to Mexico through the town. With major reinforcements too far off to intervene, Owens and his misfit crew must act as the final barrier between Cortez and freedom.
Schwarzenegger has been largely absent from cinema in recent years, but he is back to his old routine in “The Last Stand.” Sheriff Owens shoots big guns, beats up baddies, and delivers punchy one-liners. Schwarzenegger’s trademark stoic demeanor holds firm throughout the film, save for during a few emotional scenes that could have benefitted from him displaying more vulnerability. This is not an issue with Schwarzenegger alone; many principal characters lack complexity or nuance. As Agent Bannister, Whitaker does little more than bark commands to subordinates while making cartoonishly angry faces. Johnny Knoxville as Lewis Dinkum, a goofy firearm collector who provides weapons to Owens’s force, brings some laughs but seems only to be playing his “Jackass” persona with a Southern accent. Noriega’s Cortez delivers one monologue that seems to be the screenwriters’ attempt to indicate that he has a tragic backstory, but this is presented so briefly and abruptly that it has little impact.
It may have been easier for the actors to portray memorable characters if the film didn’t suffer from such poor writing. The trite dialogue could have been thrown together by anyone who has seen a hodge-podge of action movies, and some characters deliver baffling punchlines that would be better suited for an episode of “Full House.” Perhaps writers Andrew Knauer, Jeffry Nachmanoff, and George Nolfi felt that this ’90s-era humor would help Schwarzenegger channel some of his “Terminator 2” self, but for the most part, the jokes fall flat. There are a few genuinely funny lines and several somewhat moving scenes, but not enough to make the movie clever or touching.
The film also squanders a number of palpable opportunities to add depth or intrigue to the plot. Owens’s traumatic experiences as an LAPD officer are barely addressed. Cortez’s plan to escape to Mexico is at first mysterious and turns out to be rather ingenious, but it is revealed so nonchalantly that any mystique that the plot initially had vanishes without a payoff.
An action movie with relatively weak plots or characters can sometimes redeem these flaws with spectacular action, and “The Last Stand” has some impressive feats and striking sequences in the second half. But despite a few high points, there are blunders to be found in the these scenes as well. During a sequence in which the villain makes an escape from the FBI prison caravan, the camera flits wildly between different shots of police and the villains in a manner that is more disorienting than thrilling. Some of the action becomes repetitive and predictable; there are so many scenes centered on the souped-up Corvette ZR1 (identified by name and model by a character whose sole purpose in the movie seems to be doing so) that Cortez uses as his escape vehicle that one might begin to wonder whether the entire movie was conceived as an elaborate car commercial. This is particularly disappointing coming from director Jee-Woon Kim, whose films, such as “I Saw the Devil” and “The Good, the Bad, the Weird,” have garnered him a reputation for captivating, tightly choreographed action sequences.
The few interesting stunts and funny moments in “The Last Stand” are ultimately insufficient to save the movie from its formulaic composition and unimaginative writing. In preparing for the explosive standoff between his police force and Cortez’s men, Owens, having dealt with similar situations in the past, solemnly warns one of his officers, “I know what’s coming.” It would be hard not to, sheriff.

Imposing  a viselike grip on Los Angeles, thug Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn),  pontificates to his henchmen: “All things must be burned to the  ground—for the insurance money.” So begins the 1940’s stereotyping and  violence of the stylish “Gangster Squad.” 
 
The  movie quickly becomes an appealing film noir drama and violent  shoot-‘em-up, but throughout it all, “Gangster Squad” is formulaic.  Viewers can take bets on which characters would ultimately end up in  jail or be sacrificed to the movie formula gods. Nevertheless, the ride  was worth it at times. Despite a delayed release date and significant  reshooting of a key scene, director Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland” and  “30 Minutes or Less”) incorporated the alterations seamlessly.
 
The  setting is 1949 Los Angeles—almost every man is home from WWII and  wearing period suits and fedoras. Cohen, having left the “Chicago  outfit” mob for L.A., has his West Coast crime syndicate operating drug  trade, prostitution, and the sole transcontinental wire for all gambling  transactions in the city. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte)  pleads with rebellious Sergeant John O’Mara (Josh Brolin) to lead an  “off the books” team of stereotypical fringe police officers to take  down Cohen’s illicit empire.
With  the exception of Sergeant O’Mara, this team feels expendable. The squad  members become stock characters, such as an electronics expert, an old  timer with experience, and an eager young gun, and they utilize their  special skills in scene after scene. Tension builds predictably  throughout the mayhem, but because key characters such as O’Mara are one  dimensional, the tension never fulfills its potential. O’Mara, however  likeable, never convincingly progresses from a frenzied rebel cop to a  calm, collected character with clear resolve.
 
Despite  the formulaic nature of many of the characters, some of them still  manage to feel compelling. The team also includes archetypal  loose-cannon cool guy Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). Gosling steals the  show as a Doc Holliday-type figure, bringing pithy comments and cool  demeanor during the intense gunfights, leaving the viewer yearning for  more of his compellingly ambiguous character. Yet Wooters’ romance with  Cohen’s girl, Gracie (Emma Stone) is sexually charged but lacks a  convincing emotional connection, and as a result, she serves as little  more than eye candy.
 
Like  other gangster movies inspired by a true story, the memorability of the  movie is dependent on the realistic villainy of the bad guy.  Unfortunately, Penn’s portrayal of real-life 1940s gangster Cohen fails  to carry the movie—his malice is too rehearsed and cartoonish. His  speeches about “manifest destiny” and “building his city on the ashes of  L.A.” come off as caricaturish. In “Gangster Squad” it is the good guys  who must carry the movie, which goes against the spirit of the classic gangster genre.
 
The  film is well paced, with action that was not too overwhelming and solid  dialogue and one-liners that prevented the film from straying into the  realm of camp. And even with the incredible amount of violence  perpetuated by the crime syndicate, “Gangster Squad” evokes nostalgia  for a bygone era. It stylistically portrays a simpler time when  criminals were only wicked for power and money, which is a breath of  fresh air in a cinematic period where Joker-esque mad men seem all too  prevalent. However, the film’s weak character development makes it  difficult to emotionally invest in the great cast, preventing the film  from realizing its full potential.

“The Servant of Two Masters” is aptly titled—it overextends in its desire to embrace two different genres of dramatic expression, and, like its title character, risks not entirely satisfying either group. This new adaptation, performed by the Yale Repertory Theatre and directed by Christopher Bayes, attempts to satisfy the parameters of traditional commedia dell’arte and also relate to a contemporary crowd. The production, which plays at the Paramount Center Mainstage through Sunday, is at times confusing; the moments when the actors puncture the commedia with meta-commentary and modern jokes hamper the overall aesthetic.
 
Traditionally, actors in commedia dell’arte play stock types, a goal that “The Servant” achieves quite well. Beatrice (Sarah Agnew) disguises herself as her dead brother and orders her servant Truffaldino (Steven Epp) to handle her belongings when Beatrice’s lover Florindo (Randy Reyes) arrives in town. Truffaldino offers to serve Florindo as well and meddles in both his masters’ dealings. Predictably, Truffaldino fails to get away with secretly serving both masters at the same time but still wins the heart of the servant girl Smeraldina (Liz Wisan). 
 
If some of the comedy succeeds in this play, it is because the actors each embody their type with a delightful generosity of body language. Like a demented array of Pez dispensers, they lean back their furiously bobbing heads every so often and open their mouths to sing pseudo-opera or roar replies to other characters. Consistent with the commedia, each character has a physical tic that recurs each time he or she enters the stage. As Florindo,  Reyes holds his arms out, trembling all over, each time he is overcome by emotion. Wisan, as Smeraldina, is hilariously gung-ho, and in her signature gesture she lifts her arms vigorously and pumps them over her head. Epp, as Truffaldino, frequently stumbles or drops important papers.
 
However, the play’s modern humor was largely hit-or-miss. The modern jokes that the actors improvised into the script sacrifice the comic unity of the dell’arte. In a running gag, Epp casts himself as a starving Boston graduate student, frequently making asides like, “I’m working on my doctoral dissertation,” and, “You can’t throw a rock in this town without hitting a Ph.D.” He also wonders—perhaps a little too often—about being an actor in the play; several times he asks, “Seriously, when is the play going to begin?” or, “Is that the exit door?” Comments like these bring  Truffaldino out of the plot and presents him as simply a hapless actor on the stage.
 
However, to clear up any doubts about the intended comedy, many of the actions onstage are accompanied by musical cues. Camped on the edge of the stage, a violinist and an accordionist play melodramatic ditties when a character appears or some crisis occurs to herald an ironic or whimsical tone. Intimate, less ironic music—or no music at all—accompanies Truffaldino’s more serious moments. At the end of the play, when Truffaldino has been found out, he can only stare at the empty stage without musical accompaniment or even human voice. The music serves to orient the humor, and was effective in tone-setting, more tastefully comic than the comparatively crude throwaways like Epp’s quippy one-liners. 
 
The set, designed by Katherine Akiko Day, includes a curtain backdrop painted with clouds. At the end of the play, Truffaldino accidentally pulls down the backdrop, leaving a bare wall that reveals the actors to be just performers in a play. It is an oddly serious conclusion to a play so invested in traditional commedia. After Truffaldino pulls down the curtain, the resulting aesthetic seems to fall short of the intended emotion. This and other deviations from dell’arte such as the modern jokes and meta-commentary are ultimately incongruous with its more traditional comic delivery. There is something perhaps too precious about the final scene, when the backdrop comes down and lovers Truffaldino and Smeraldina disappear into the night as if in a fairy tale.
Less gratifying in its tooth-grinding, modern-day humor and at times irritatingly insistent on  employing modern-day humor, “The Servant” is otherwise wonderfully acted, and it succeeds in its better moments through its focus on traditional comic tropes.

Yoko Ogawa’s short story collection “Revenge” begins and ends with the discovery of a six-year-old boy’s corpse folded up inside a refrigerator. Another author might have engineered such a specifically macabre framework with the goal of explaining the circumstances of the child’s death and his placement in the refrigerator throughout the collection’s action. Ogawa’s prose, in opting to shroud the details of the boy’s death, instead casts a sense of unease and suspicion that carries throughout the collection, only to be left vexingly unresolved by the final rediscovery of the still unexplained corpse.
Ogawa pulls the reader into a stiflingly morbid universe without ever directly focusing her lens on the dark happenings, and the work thus suffers from an overreliance on disconnected rhetoric and a pervasive nightmarish slowness. Her strategy of shrouding the bloody deaths and tortuous lives is completed by focusing instead on symbolic use of the mundane—of kiwis and tomatoes, of cakes and aging tigers. Ultimately, while such a strategy could work to augment fear of the unknown by avoiding the outright macabre, “Revenge” fails as a lesson in disassembly and distraction that ultimately pushes the work a step too far from its gory core, leaving the action congealed.
The slim volume contains 11 short stories, all of which revolve around the same cast of uncompromisingly reserved characters. Their dovetailing stories form a dark narrative marked by heartbreak and physical trauma—usually highlighted in each story’s climactic scene, in which scenes of murder and mutilation are detailed in elegant and spare prose. In the unsubtly titled “Welcome to the Museum of Torture,” Ogawa’s protagonist meditates on the possibility of torturing her boyfriend with strand-by-strand hair removal, “And then I’ll pluck out his hair…They’ll flutter down like insects with long wings. I’ll enjoy that tiny bit of resistance each time I pluck a hair, the feeling of the skin ripping, of fat popping to the surface.” This moment is demonstrative of the piece’s most gruesome scenes—there is an uncomfortable sense of disconnection in the speaker’s voice, a formality and control that leeches the violence from the act and leaves the reader with a sense of nausea that the story refuses to relieve. It’s an effective technique in moderation, but as Ogawa applies it again and again the disaffection and unreality become too strong, and the reader is forced out of sympathy with such closed characters.
The monotony of narrative distance is aggravated by the heavy-handed use of domestic tropes—usually food-centered—that prevent true immersion. For example, strawberry shortcake appears in the first story, “Afternoon at the Bakery,” as an obvious symbol of domestic life gone wrong. The narrator finds herself in an empty bakery and waits for hours to purchase a strawberry shortcake to celebrate the anniversary of her son’s death. As she waits, she recalls the ruined cake that rotted after her son’s death years ago: “I passed my days watching it rot. First, the cream turned brown and separated from the fat, staining the cellophane wrapper. Then the strawberries dried out, wrinkling up like the heads of deformed babies.” This description, at once grotesque and clinical, is followed by a meditation on the still-fresh shortcakes behind the bakery counter in the present moment: “Each was topped with three whole strawberries. They looked perfectly preserved, no sign of mold.” The final line of the story is a spoken request for “‘two strawberry shortcakes, please.’” The relentless repetition of the cakes throughout this short story eventually begins to read as an affected obsession, as opposed to a haunting refrain. Ogawa does not relent, including strawberry shortcakes and mentions of strawberries and cream throughout many of the following stories in the collection. As these tropes echo through every story, they become gimmicky and technically clumsy—an obvious attempt to infuse the dark material with a contrasting element of the everyday. As such, the pastries—along with other over-used symbols like tomatoes and kiwis—become a kind of distracting shorthand for a foil which is never fully realized.
In the penultimate piece, “Tomatoes and the Full Moon,” many of the characters who have starred individually in the previous stories come together to reach an uneasy pseudo-union. An elderly woman who has been seen earlier in the collection as a young aspiring novelist and  an absentminded stepmother is dealing with the suspected theft of her novel’s manuscript by a possibly imaginary hunchback at a seaside resort. A man visiting the hotel for work reminds her of a man earlier in her life who saved her and her stepson from a hypothermic death, and given the shaky timeline of the book as a whole, he could potentially be this same man. The two of them have close ties to every major player within the collection and appear independently of one another often throughout the book.
Here, then, is the moment when the disparate threads of the collection are meant to come together to complete an eerie and compelling universe through which these characters trace their sorrowful trajectories. Whenever a character reappears—which happens with whiplash frequency towards the end of the book—the reader is tempted to turn back through the past stories and find his or her other appearances, but ultimately the plot lines are not compelling enough to merit such effort. These moments, engineered to spark recognition and motivate further study of the characters throughout the narrative, fall flat due to the collections’ lack of momentum.
Ogawa’s collection seems engineered to haunt. The self-awareness of the structure and its rendering in delicate and biting prose, when coupled with the omnipresent tropes of domesticity, create a sense of being in a waking dream. The stories aspire to be inescapable—repetitious as only nightmares can be. However, the techniques that Ogawa employs towards this end are clumsy and wear thin from overuse. With a lighter hand or an even shorter page count, Ogawa’s efforts would bear strange and horrifying fruit in the minds of her readers. However, as Ogawa leans harder and harder on her thematic crutches, she cripples even the most disturbing and effective moments in the collection, relegating the work as a whole to that classification which never describes a terrifying nightmare—forgettable.

Hundreds of people packed The Middle East’s downstairs Wednesday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Pharcyde’s debut album, “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,” which was performed from start to finish by members of the original group.
“We been doin’ this shit since 1993!” yelled original Pharcyde member Slimkid3 at one point, polling the concertgoers about the decades they were born in. A vast majority of the crowd hailed from the 80s, while a smaller contingent, closer to the stage, were children of the 90s. Mathematically that meant that the majority of the people in the crowd were at most 12 years old when “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde” was released in 1992, coming as an antidote to the more hardcore gangsta rap coming from the west coast. (At one point in the show, Fatlip mentioned “the east coast showin’ us love” even when the tension between east and west was at its zenith.) Presumably, many in the audience discovered the album years after its initial release, and so one could also assume that the younger showgoers were not there to celebrate two decades of the album’s existence as much as to hear an album that has always been regarded as “classic.”
But regardless of when and where each attendee discovered Bizarre Ride, the level of enthusiasm for the album was universally high at The Middle East. Former Pharcyde members Slimkid3 and Fatlip as well as producers J-Swift and LA Jay hit the stage to perform, and the atmosphere remained electric from the first track to the last. (The group is not technically allowed to tour as The Pharcyde. That right belongs to the group’s other two members, Imani and Bootie Brown.) “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde” is a wonderful relic of old-school hip-hop, a lighthearted romp of an album more suited to the live stage than a pair of earbuds. It’s the kind of album you’d imagine playing during a house party (or a “House Party”).
The show got energized quickly, with the audience bouncing along to “Oh Shit”—a song titled with, depending on the context, a worried exclamation or a phrase to mutter when something exciting is about to happen. At The Middle East, it was the latter.
Supplementing the group were images and video, projected behind the musicians, that corresponded to each track. “Oh Shit” ended with a photo of someone lying down, wearing pants bearing the titular stain. That just about sums up the tone of the show: exciting, impressive, sweaty, and unafraid of the occasional poop joke.
Many of the tracks from Bizarre Ride are easy to sing along to, even if you’ve never heard them before. Most of the choruses are just a single repeated lyric. The crowd chanted along, asking, “Who is the nigga in charge over here? / Who is the nigga in charge?” on “I’m That Type of Nigga” and chanting “ee ah oo ah ah” on “Soul Flower.”
Slimkid3, Fatlip and crew kept the energy going throughout, interacting with the crowd, grabbing phones from the audience in order to take pictures, and—much to the chagrin of security—encouraging members to crowd surf. The room was crowded, but not nearly dense enough to sustain anyone aloft for more than a few seconds. During “Passin’ Me By,” one of the less boisterous tracks on the album but also its most popular cut, audience participation peaked as everyone sang along to the chorus.
The crew carried it home, performing “Quinton’s On The Way (skit)” and “Pack The Pipe” with a lot of audience support. “This isn’t a beer song. This is a weed song,” Slimkid3 announced as the audience cheered. “The pipe, the pipe, let’s pack the pipe!” they chanted.
The album performance came to a close with “Return of the B-Boy,” complete with a breakdancing section particularly impressive given that everyone who was on stage is in their early 40s. But while the group’s faces may show signs of aging, their energy and limberness onstage do not. Even after bouncing around onstage for an hour, nobody looked or sounded closer to retirement than they did on the album 20 years ago.
The final song of the night, “Runnin’,” off of the group’s second album, was a tribute to J Dilla, a deceased producer great. And following that, Slimkid3 announced that the group was working on new material. If that material is nearly as electric as last Wednesday’s performance, it can’t come soon enough.

"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)"
Fall Out Boy, "Save Rock and Roll"
Fall Out Boy are a national treasure. They recently came screaming back from a three-year break with a new single, “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)”. The latest track from pop punk’s darlings is strange in the way of creatures from the Mariana Trench—the group has emerged from the depths of hiatus grotesquely changed. Between hair-metal cries of “fire” (pronounced “fiyah”) and a music video featuring 2 Chainz (formerly known as Tity Boi), it feels as if the band is trying its hardest to confuse its longtime fans. The song has none of the trademark wordplay or infectious riffs of classic Fall Out Boy. Pete Wentz, what hath thou wrought?
"So Many Details"
Toro y Moi, "Anything in Return"
Multilingually named artist and producer Toro y Moi (real name Chazwick Bundick) is famed for his ability to seamlessly blend dark, almost sinister sonic elements into seemingly simple and poppy songs. “So Many Details” is a shining example of this style, with staccato synth notes in minor modes punctuating Bundick’s sensual and understated vocals. The tension between the lyrics and the production delicately underscores Bundick’s romantic contemplation. “So Many Details” plays like a nighttime ocean swim: dangerous, refreshing, and alluring. Toro y Moi makes it clear with this single that he has depth that far surpasses the superficial charms of a typical chillwave artist.
"Suit and Tie"
Justin Timberlake, "The 20/20 Experience"
Justin Timberlake has released a single as inscrutable as his plans for his upcoming album. “Suit and Tie” is so very close to being a classic JT jam, filled with funk and falsetto that gets fans yelling and dogs howling, but in the end, it falls short. Jay-Z’s verse is an awkward interruption, more like a lazy cameo than a complementary aside, and is indicative of the song’s larger failure to coalesce. The jerky nature detracts from the Curtis Mayfield feel that Timberlake nearly captures. This song is only relevant because it is a Justin Timberlake song, and after JT’s six-year hiatus, fans will take whatever they can get.

Don’t start putting together your survival kits just yet—everything  you know about zombies is about to change. In “Warm Bodies,” directed  by Jonathan Levine and based off the book of the same title by Isaac  Marion, zombies—which have already evolved dramatically since they first  entered pop culture in the early 20th century—take a new and touching  turn. While suggesting a whole host of new considerations in planning  for zombie apocalypse survival, Levine’s heart-warming film drastically  and hilariously reinterprets what it means to be a zombie and advances  the genre in an unconventional direction.
Unlike most films of the subgenre, in which zombie characters  aren’t much more than stock monsters and tragedies; in “Warm Bodies,”  they are the most compelling and well-acted figures in the film.  Essential to this is the film’s unapologetic departure from the  traditional definition of zombies as brain-dead, which allows for the  entertainingly angsty inner monologue of R (Nicholas Hoult). R’s best  friend Marcus (Rob Corddry) is superb comic relief as well. They are  part of a multitude of zombies who may or may not also have active minds  themselves, perhaps frustrated like R by their inability to express  themselves or even move easily.
These zombies hunt humans for food, but they are still not the  greatest threat to the surviving community of humans. Worse than  regular, slow moving zombies are so-called “bonies,”—a sort of skeletal  super-zombie, larger and more dangerously agile than the standard type.  These extra-zombified zombies provide a further twist to the traditional  zombie narrative by pushing the regular zombies closer to humans and  eventually giving zombies and humans a common enemy. The plot follows  the “Romeo and Juliet”-based love story between R and the human girl  Julie (Teresa Palmer), whose father (John Malkovich) is the leader of  the remaining survivors. By another quirk of this strain of zombie-ness,  R falls in love with Julie and takes her to the airport where he and  the other zombies live. A long and somewhat predictable process ensues,  in which R tries first to win her over and then to impress upon her  society the idea that zombies are people too. Palmer plays her role as  straight woman well, but it is Hoult and the hilariously well-integrated  soundtrack that keep the film engaging and fresh—throughout “Warm  Bodies,” Hoult showcases his ability to be goofy and expressive despite  his limited range of movement, and the music both complements and  injects additional humor into the story with choices such as Bruce  Springsteen’s “Hungry Heart.”
It’s worth noting that “Warm Bodies” is not “Twilight” with  zombies. While it is a romance between a human girl and a  not-exactly-human guy, the irreverence with which “Warm Bodies” treats  the entire subject matter sets it entirely apart. Different too is how the liberties taken with zombie psychology and  physiology not only give the plot more flexibility, but suggest that  zombies have a strong metaphorical significance within this film. In  many horror movies, zombies either serve as little more than plot  devices or have symbolic meaning that is difficult to detect. In “Warm  Bodies,” the terror of R’s nearly locked-in experience and his inability  to communicate, though masked with levity, could be seen as reminiscent  of the increasing complexity of communication and expression in modern  society. The tension he feels while trying desperately to speak like a  normal human, is reminiscent of the general feelings of nervousness and  social awkwardness that so many people feel at some point. More  generally, though, his grunt-like conversations with Marcus, their  completely incomprehensible attempts to get through to each other, as  well as R’s use of music to communicate his good intentions when he  first meets Julie, seem to echo the confusion and limitation imposed on  communication today by the array of technologies which so often confound  interpersonal contact.
Thematics aside, “Warm Bodies” is extraordinarily sweet and  energetic. The new perspective on zombies it presents is at once  outlandish and also quite intriguing. It is fitting that as we progress  scientifically and culturally, our conception of zombies within film  should evolve and we should strive to understand them better. Perhaps  “Warm Bodies” ought to teach us to consider building loving  relationships with zombies as a viable plan for zombie apocalypse  survival, or perhaps it is a movie about acceptance and learning to  communicate comfortably with others. Likely, it is just the latter.

The Jazz Composers Alliance Orchestra may not set its instruments on fire, but the group will carry the wild and adventurous spirit of Jimi Hendrix to the Berklee Performance Center tonight in a concert entitled “Manic Depression: Music of Jimi Hendrix.” The 19-piece big band is led by Berklee faculty member Darrell Katz, a composer and guitarist and the founder of the Jazz Composers Alliance, parent organization of the Jazz Composers Alliance Orchestra. The group will play a collection of arrangements based on the iconic guitarist’s compositions.
The Alliance has celebrated Hendrix’s music several times over the course of its 27-year existence, and these themed concerts have always drawn large crowds and acclaim. The idea arose when Katz saw a string quartet play Hendrix’s “Manic Depression” in concert. “I thought, I could do way better than that,” Katz says. He wrote his own arrangement of “Manic Depression” for a chamber group and eventually decided to develop a whole concert around the concept.
Although Hendrix’s hard rock may seem like an odd fit for an avant-garde jazz band, Katz sees many connections between the two distinct styles. “[Hendrix’s] music is more open-ended, blues-oriented,” he says. “It lends itself to extended forms and improvisation.”
Katz wrote several arrangements for the concert, and the group will also play jazz pianist Gil Evans’s arrangements of Hendrix tunes. Among the classics being performed are “Stone Free,” “Purple Haze,” and “If 6 Was 9.” Guitarist and Berklee faculty member Norm Zocher  wrote an arrangement of “Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)” in which the horns play a reharmonized version of the opening riff and Zocher himself takes the melody. “It’s very challenging to not make it sound cheesy,” Zocher says.
The performance will be driven by the improvisation and innovative arrangements of the band rather than by the theatrics that were typically at the heart of Hendrix’s live performances. However, this doesn’t mean that the musicians won’t have a little fun with the show. “I do know how to play with my teeth, so maybe I’ll do that,” Zocher says, laughing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Boston University Gallery at the Stone Gallery's "Teaching the Body," a new exhibit running until March 31, the boundary between art and medicine is shown to be not conventionally steadfast but unexpectedly fluid. The various featured artworks show how surgeons and their dissections have informed artists’ conceptions of the human form, and how artistic pieces were used in medicine long before the invention of modern medical imaging techniques. The exhibition follows artistic representations of human anatomy from 200 years ago up until the present day and concludes with unconventional, contemporary interpretations of the human body.
“Before the arts or medicine in America were professionalized, they really had to collaborate,” exhibition curator Naomi H. Slipp says. Collaboration is the lynchpin of the exhibit’s artwork and is very much evident in the earlier works, such as Oscar Wallis’s detailed paintings of the musculature of the neck and forearm. “The artists had to turn to the doctors to teach them how to picture the body,” Slipp says. In turn, doctors would then use the resulting works as a teaching guide in a time when cadavers were rare. “[The exhibition has] been a really interesting way to see the two things converge,” says Joshua R. Buckno, assistant director of the Boston University Gallery.
From Wallis’s precise anatomical watercolor plates to more conceptual modern works by Kiki Smith and Lisa Nilsson, the artworks themselves are surprisingly diverse in their treatment of rather exact medical content. The exhibition gives a clear view not only of the beauty of the human body but also of the patience and skill of the doctors and artists who collaborated to produce these works of art. The range of media is impressive, from sculptures in bronze and paper to treatises on the human body. There is even a small annex room where visitors can watch a videotaped anatomy lecture. “The great thing is just how full it is and how many dimensions can be approached,” Buckno says.
The exhibit contains many photographs of the casts of classical sculptures from which many anatomical drawings were rendered. These casts represented an ideal of the human form not reflective of the diversity of depicted individuals, particularly in terms of race. “Picturing the body is very much about class, and it’s about gender, and it’s about race. A lot of the sort of politics of anatomy are really fascinating,” Slipp says. There are other parts of the exhibition where these issues arise: In Emma Augusta Cross’s 1886 sketch “Skulls and heads,” the crania of different races are depicted in a way that clearly likens non-Caucasian peoples to apes.
Gender also informs some works in the exhibition. The restricted opportunities available to women in the past two centuries made their role in medical art all the more significant. One telling piece in the exhibit is a small sepia photograph from 1894 of a women’s sketching class. At the center of the photograph, one of the women confidently cradles a human skull among the easels and other students that surround her. The visible self-assurance of these women artists makes for a powerful image, particularly when juxtaposed against a written account elsewhere in the exhibition of female art students forced to wear veils to hide their identities while drawing nudes.
The exhibition explores the relationship between people and the body as well as the overlap between art and science. “I believe, as someone who’s very invested in the contemporary arts and art practices, that this kind of exhibition foregrounds just that relationship [between art and science],” says Kate McNamara, director and chief curator of the Boston University Art Gallery.  This relationship is still present today, as evidenced by the exhibition’s contemporary works like Nilsson’s rolled paper pieces. These appear at first glance to be sagittal slices of the head and neck but in fact are carefully constructed from coiled multicolored paper. Throughout the exhibit, the continued urge to understand and represent the human body is clear.
Though “Teaching the Body” explores an interdisciplinary connection that has existed for centuries, it is by no means, as the title might have one believe, yet another chance to exhibit Renaissance prints and old Rembrandts. Instead, by drawing from a range of media and time periods—including the present day—“Teaching the Body” not only explores both art and anatomy but also demonstrates how the two historically linked disciplines still impact each other today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget going platinum or snagging a Grammy nomination—the gold standard of musical success in today’s world is appearing on a 2 Chainz track. The list of individuals whose voices have been heard alongside 2 Chainz is a heavyweight lineup: Kanye West, Drake, John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, and, of course, famed musical satirist Thomas A. Lehrer ’46.
Perhaps some explaining is in order. Last year, 2 Chainz’s record company sent a letter to the octogenarian Lehrer in Santa Cruz, Calif., asking permission to sample Lehrer’s song “The Old Dope Peddler” (a drugged-up parody of “The Old Lamplighter”) on 2 Chainz’s track “Dope Peddler.” Lehrer sent back a letter giving his consent, and then, as if to casually prove he hadn’t lost his sense of humor, tacked the following note onto the end: “My regards go out to Mr. Chainz. And may I call him 2?”
Lehrer’s been happily retired from teaching math at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for several years now, but he’s been out of musical comedy for almost 40. It’s rare, almost unheard of, for a comedian’s material to remain relevant and resurface this long after he’s stopped producing new material. Comedy, especially satire, doesn’t usually have the shelf life of other genres—it often relies on referencing culture and contemporary events that become less and less relatable to newer generations. Is Lehrer’s star as bright as it was decades ago? Has his work stood the test of time? Sixty years after the release of his first record, what makes Lehrer relevant today?
Looking beyond the locally revered “Fight Fiercely, Harvard” and Jell-O shots (which Lehrer allegedly invented while in the Army), the short answer is that Lehrer’s tongue-in-cheek style of illuminating absurdities—whether in politics or popular culture, whether through parody or satire—hasn’t been replicated since his retirement. Though that’s due partially to his irreverent, sometimes morbid approach, Lehrer’s attitude towards the production of his material was equally unique. Unlike many artists, Lehrer recognized that he was at his best when writing and performing songs was genuinely fun for him. As a result, he remained a purposeful outsider to the world of comedy, selectively employing his observational wit and eye for irony to construct a small but inimitable catalog of thought-provoking music.
PEER REVUE
The only “dissertation” Lehrer ever finished was a poem he wrote at 15 (he never completed one on statistics started as a graduate student in Harvard’s math department). Entitled “Dissertation on Education,” the poem exhaustively enumerated Lehrer’s academic disinterests—Roman history, trigonometry, and poetry, among other topics—or “the things one must know to have ‘culture,’” the young Lehrer termed them. However, in the type of ironic twist that would later become one of his musical trademarks, Lehrer submitted the seemingly anti-education poem as his application essay to Harvard, ending it in a boldfaced appeal: “And I’ll work like a slave / And always behave / And maybe I’ll get into Harvard.” The quasi-reverse psychological ploy worked; Lehrer matriculated in 1944.“
[Tom] had a way of looking at the world…from a distance. He would see things that people didn’t see,” recalls Lehrer’s classmate, musical collaborator, and lifelong friend David Z. Robinson ’46. During graduate school, Robinson says, Lehrer’s unique, witty viewpoint made him stand out even among extraordinarily smart people. “A group of 8 to 10 [of us] would eat every meal [together]. That included people like [Philip W. Anderson ’43], who later won a Nobel Prize,” Robinson says. “Tom was the intellectual center of this group.”
After entering Harvard’s doctoral math program, Lehrer started to channel his wry sense of humor into more focused artistic output. In 1951, Lehrer wrote “The Physical Revue,” a comedic musical review session for the freshman-level physics class his friend Lewis M. Branscomb was teaching. For the “Revue,” Lehrer wrote almost 20 songs about what seemed to be irredeemably mundane topics (physics, math, and chemistry), setting many of those songs to show tunes and popular melodies. Take a stanza from “There’s a Delta For Every Epsilon”: “If an epsilon is a hero / Just because it is greater than zero / It must be mighty discouragin’ / To lie to the left of the origin.”
Lehrer and the “Tom Lehrer Quartet” (which featured Robinson and Branscomb) then performed the “Revue” for Branscomb’s class. According to Branscomb, the show was a smash with both the students and the faculty at whom the show poked good-natured fun. “There was loud enough laughter and applause that the faculty in the building could hear it.... They insisted that we re-perform ‘The Physical Revue’ the next day,” Branscomb says.
Following a later performance of the “Revue” in front of an audience of 500 at Allston Burr Hall, The Crimson published an enthusiastic review, deeming Lehrer “the most original funnyman in this—or almost any other—vicinity.” The success of the “Revue” encouraged Lehrer to start writing more original material, which would become the basis for his first studio album.
HOUSEHOLD FAME 
That resulting album, “Songs By Tom Lehrer,” featured early examples of Lehrer’s satire, including “I Wanna Go Back To Dixie” (“I wanna talk with southern gentlemen / And put my white sheet on again / I ain’t seen one good lynchin’ in years”), and his morbid humor, as on “I Hold Your Hand In Mine” (hint: the hand isn’t attached to her arm). Lehrer personally bought 400 copies, hoping to sell 250 to friends, family, and classmates in order to break even. The 24-minute album sold 10,000 copies in its first year and would go on to sell 370,000 copies in the 1950s alone.
Jeffrey B. Morris, an archivist for the radio program “The Dr. Demento Show” who has interviewed Lehrer multiple times as research for an informal biography, says that the record’s success is all the more impressive given Lehrer’s nonexistent advertising and constrained distribution. “He was not signed to a major record label…he wasn’t on any major TV and didn’t get any major airplay in the ’50s. It was all basically word-of-mouth—to sell 370,000 records that way is just astounding,” Morris says.
Even as “Songs By Tom Lehrer” was beginning to sell steadily, Robinson and Branscomb both say that at the time, Lehrer still had no desire to embark on a long-term, professional musical career. “The music and the performance were a sideline,” Robinson says. Branscomb agrees, emphasizing that Lehrer was mostly in it for the fun of the thing. “Tom never particularly wanted to be a celebrity.”
FREEDOM OF CHOICE
Even if he wasn’t seeking it, celebrity found Tom Lehrer. After two years in the Army, Lehrer started to perform full-time and eventually gained an international following. “He was a cult hero in England,” Robinson says. “He came in on a plane, and all of the reporters were waiting for him.” Lehrer also released an album of new material, “More Songs By Tom Lehrer.” The album included the darkly comedic song “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,” a bouncy satire of cheesy springtime tunes featuring some truly inspired rhymes: “My pulse will be quickenin’ / With each drop of strychnine / We feed to a pigeon / It just takes a smidgen!” Barret E. Hansen—better known as Dr. Demento, the prominent radio host largely responsible for introducing recent generations to Lehrer—named “Pigeons” the most-requested Lehrer song on his program over the years.
And then, at the peak of his popularity up to that point, Lehrer decided to quit, returning to his graduate studies and teaching at Harvard. According to Robinson, performing had lost the novelty that made comedy so appealing for Lehrer—as audiences became more and more familiar with his catalog, Lehrer began to lose the sense of personal fulfillment he gained from surprising and intriguing people with his humor. Furthermore, as an outsider to the world of entertainment, Lehrer never felt controlled by the contracts and companies that keep many artists on the stage and in the studio when they have nothing compelling left to offer. When Lehrer stopped having fun playing music, he was able to stop performing without repercussions or regrets, Robinson said.
Lehrer’s reappearance in musical comedy would be his own decision. After returning to Harvard, Lehrer continued to work on his dissertation while teaching math and statistics at MIT, Harvard Business School, and Wellesley—but by the time he became a sixteenth-year graduate student, he left Harvard without finishing his Ph.D.
No longer an official scholar, Lehrer would find himself free to enter a new phase of his life—one that brought him back to the performing arts. In 1964, the American version of the satirical television news show “That Was The Week That Was” began to air. Without a Ph.D. to pursue, Lehrer found himself following the show, which would ultimately inspire another collection of comedic songs. According to Robinson, Lehrer realized that he was funnier than the show’s writers and began sending in his music, which quickly found its way onto the air.
RELIABLE NARRATOR
To many comedians and lovers of comedy, the unique satirical style of the songs written for “That Was The Week That Was” is Lehrer’s greatest legacy. The songs deal with the hot-button news stories of the time, ranging from Wernher Von Braun (“A man whose allegiance / Is ruled by expedience”) to pollution (“Just go out for a breath of air / And you’ll be ready for Medicare”) to censorship of “smut” (“Who needs a hobby like tennis or philately? / I’ve got a hobby: rereading ‘Lady Chatterley’”).
“Tom’s songs have a way of cutting straight to the essential absurdity of the subject, and revealing it directly, without over-explanation,” says Roy Zimmerman, a modern musical satirist whom Lehrer praised in the ’90s.
Hansen agrees with this characterization of Lehrer’s music. “He doesn’t hit you over the head with a baseball bat; he cuts with a scalpel. A lot of people do [satire] different ways,” Hansen says. “For Tom, it’s a way of assuming the narrator’s voice in a very believable way…he makes you believe that the voice of the narrator you hear in the song is true.” This, then might be the defining characteristic of Lehrer’s music. “Nobody since Tom has really been able to do what he’s done. There are no real successors to him.”
Even as a liberal, Lehrer deliberately avoided using his satire to push a political agenda, another choice that distinguishes him from modern-day satirists from Zimmerman to Stephen Colbert. Lehrer’s true agenda was to point out what he believed was hypocrisy and poor rhetoric regardless of the source—he suggests that the United States over-relies on the military in “Send The Marines,” but also pokes fun at what he calls a predominantly liberal crusade of political correctness in “National Brotherhood Week.” Hansen attributes this willingness to attack all ends of the spectrum partly to the fact that Lehrer worked in a time of significantly less political polarization than today: “Now, it’s almost impossible for somebody to carry on a career as a satirist and even attempt to provide a neutral point of view, which I think Tom was always trying to do.”
However, Hansen doesn’t see lack of neutrality as a reason to stop producing satire altogether. “Preaching to the choir is an often-heard word for what satirists do, but I think it’s valuable—reinforcing people’s commitment to the way they feel, and perhaps giving them a little more ammunition when they’re trying to convince other people.” Nevertheless, Lehrer’s type of satire allowed him to “preach” to both sides of the church, a capability rarely seen today.
DOUBLE IRONY 
Lehrer stopped producing new political satire after the American version of “That Was The Week That Was” was canceled following its first season. The lack of any real successors to Lehrer’s style since his exit may, in fact, have as much to do with a fundamental shift in source material as gap in ability. Lehrer is fond of quipping that political satire became obsolete after the Nobel Peace Prize went to Henry Kissinger—in short, a suggestion that it’s impossible to apply Lehrer’s subtle brand of satire to events that themselves are already ironic. “Today, the line between satire and the original event is often invisible,” says Mark Russell, a musical satirist best known for his political specials on PBS.
Even when that line was more defined, though, Lehrer never bought into the idea that his songs could affect people’s politics. “As opposed to Pete Seeger, who believed that his songs could change views, Tom never really believed that his songs could change views,” Robinson, Lehrer’s friend and former classmate, says. “He believed that the people who liked your songs were the people who agreed with them. He just put together songs that he thought were funny.” It was that simple humor Lehrer found in crafting his songs that he truly hoped to share with his audience. His work sought common ground and a common sense of fun with his audience rather than mocked or discredited them. That process may have been easier since Lehrer never felt defined by his work as a musical comedian, choosing instead to remain an outsider and allowing himself to adopt a wide variety of narrative voices. Perhaps that was part of his broad appeal half a century ago, and what keeps him just as entertaining, intriguing, and provocative today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite having advised the film “Black Swan” and released singles in Europe and Japan as a singer and lyricist, Francesca Harper is best known for her uniquely expressive dance performances and original choreography. Harper trained at the School of American Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet School, and The Ailey School and acclaimed dance teacher Madame Gabriela Darvash and dancer Barbara Walczak. Harper was the principal dancer in William Forsythe’s Ballet Frankfurt from 1994-1999, and performed in Broadway productions including “Fosse” and “The Producers.” On Thursday, Harper will give a master class for student dancers at the Harvard Dance Center. She will bring her experience not only as a dancer, but also as the founder of a non profit. In 2005, she created The Francesca Harper Project, which fuses classical dance forms with text, music, and film to explore themes of politics, race, sexuality, love, and humanity.
The Harvard Crimson: What drew you and inspired you to dance?Francesca Harper: I always knew that I wanted to pursue a career in dance. My mother, Denise Jefferson, was a dance teacher. She was modern dancer and ended [up] being the director for The Ailey School for 26 years.  She had been gifted in ballet, but because of the race issues in the ‘60s, she felt discouraged. She found ballet again after college. I heard her story, [and it] encouraged me.
THC: How did you transition from being a dancer to choreographing your own works?FH: William Forsythe worked very collaboratively with [me]. He would sometimes ask us to create material, which he would use in his own works. That made me think that I could choreograph my own works, and I went on to start my own company in 2005.
THC: Your works often incorporate film into the choreography. How does video function in your artistry? FH: I always have enjoyed [video]. I really loved the aesthetic it brings. It speaks as an unconscious layer to the movement on stage. And I showcased at the Video Dance Awards in 1998 in Frankfurt. That experience became integrated into my creative thesis.THC: You’re also a singer and are known for your 2003 single, “Would I?” How did you come to explore singing and lyricism?FH: Forsythe knew that I had a voice, so he had me sing at a performance, and there was a music producer that was there in the audience. [He] asked if I could release a track. It went worldwide from Germany. Then I came back to New York to work on my voice. I did Broadway for six years…including “The Color Purple.” I received principal roles as well. Now I’m currently working on my first opera, working with director Robert Wilson.
THC: What do you look forward to most in your upcoming collaboration with the Harvard Dance Program?FH: [Director of the Office for the Arts at Dance Program]  Jill Johnson and I are old colleagues and old friends. I’m looking forward to seeing the foundation she has built in the past few years. Knowing the brilliance and intellectual rigor at Harvard, I am looking forward to the exchange with students’ insight and knowledge. This will be very exciting for me.
THC: And how will you engage with students in the master class? Are there certain techniques student dancers can look forward to practicing?FH: [After] doing a warm-up, I’ll introduce some of Forsythe’s technique. He really set dance improvisation systems. Then I will also have dancers improvise and create their own dance constructions.
THC: What words do have for anyone who is interested in dance or artistic exploration?FH: [From] Martha Graham: your artistic voice needs to be honored. She says, “There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique.” It is your duty as an artist to honor that. To anyone who wants practice their artistry, it is their duty to honor that voice and need.—Staff writer Nzuekoh N. Nchinda can be reached at nzuekohnchinda14@college.harvard.edu.

Friday in Sanders Theatre, the Venice Baroque Orchestra will attempt to recreate one of the exemplary epochs in classical music and to transport its audience to the golden age of 17th- and 18th- century classical Italian Baroque music.
Established in 1997 by Baroque conductor, musician and scholar Andrea Marcon, the Venice Baroque Orchestra has garnered international acclaim after several world tours to destinations in England, France, Japan, Greece, Germany, and, recently, New York. The musicians have collaborated in the past with the likes of composer Philip Glass, Italian violinist Giuliano Carmignola and mezzo-soprano singer Romina Basso. On Friday, the period instrument ensemble’s concert will feature a solo performance of a Baroque Italian concerto, played by Marcon on the harpsichord. The performance will also include pieces written by famed Baroque musician composer Antonio Vivaldi, a native of Venice.
 
Brian R. Stuart, marketing and publicity director of the Boston Early Music Festival, says, “[What distinguishes the Orchestra is] its close interaction and interplay between the full orchestra and the soloists themselves.”
 The orchestra prides itself on using techniques and instruments authentic to the Italian Baroque. “We’re bringing some of the greatest artists in the world that perform some of this classical music better than anyone else,” Stuart says. “It’ll be a unique opportunity for the Boston community to hear this music from the best ensemble in the world, who are really unparalleled in terms of performance.”  Almost 4,000 miles away from Venice and over 300 hundred years after its composition, the VBO will give the music of the Italian Baroque era new life.

 Seeing one’s creative work on display in a gallery is typically a privilege reserved for professional artists. But for two weeks, the lobby of the University Place Gallery in Harvard Square gave many amateur photographers a brief moment in the limelight as part of the show “GRAM IT: Instagram Pop Up Show.” This exhibit featured images taken with the popular mobile phone app Instagram, which allows users to quickly snap photos, stylize them with filters, and share them on the web. “GRAM IT,” which closed Wednesday, was organized by the Cambridge Art Association. According to Erin Becker, the executive director of the Association and curator of the show, the motivating question was whether these quickly and casually snapped images can have a lasting effect on public memory. “How could we take Instagram on its own out of the box and put it on the wall?” Becker says.
  The idea for this exhibit came to Becker over the summer, when she saw a photo spread that interested her in the New York Times Magazine. “They had put out a call not to professional photographers, but to New York City residents who used Instagram to take pictures of rooftop summer parties,” she says.   Becker and the team at the Association arranged the photos in a temporary gallery space into five rows of square prints, grouped roughly by theme. Subjects ranged from abstract, stylized forms to naturalistic landscapes and close-up shots of everyday objects. The display was also unique in that it encouraged audience participation. At a reception for the show, viewers were invited to affix heart-shaped stickers below the images they liked, intended to mimic the online phenomenon of “liking” a piece of digital content.  
 To arrange work into an exhibition is to make people take notice of it, and while it may be easy to brush off Instagram as a popular entertainment device, the exhibit suggests that there are reasons to take a closer look at it. As a tool for capturing images, Instagram embodies a bizarre mix of dualities. It is intimate, used to document unique moments of people’s daily lives, and yet homogenizing in the way it makes every user’s images look alike. Though it is cutting-edge consumer technology, it is nostalgic in the way it simulates the look of analog photos. And while the images created by Instagram exist online in perpetuity, they are ephemeral in the way they are captured and quickly forgotten by users after being shared with friends online. While the Association originally considered hiring a jurist to select works for its exhibit, it decided to keep the spirit of the activity truly open to the community and to accept all submissions for the display. Such a system is a radical departure from the selection method more commonly found in professional museums. The majority of individuals who submitted to this show were not professional photographers, although some were artists in other mediums. “We kind of spun it as, ‘Become an instant artist,’” the Association assistant director Cory Shea says. The call for entries went out through flyers and online. “We kept it egalitarian,” Becker says. “You get an interesting slice of the population with Instagram.” The individuals who take photos and share them online are simply people who have a bit of media savvy.
    Shea, who is a professional photographer herself, says that the difference between the work of amateur and professional photographers, as well as that of other kinds of visual artists, is one of concentrated intention and execution of individual techniques. “The works around us are premeditated.  [The artists] thought consciously of every stroke they made,” she says, gesturing at the paintings hung on the walls of the University Place Gallery.  “With Instagram you capture a moment and it’s more, well, ‘instant,’” Shea says. In the age of accessibility, Instagram has made it possible to take photos that are artistically appealing, but its products have yet to be validated as artistic expressions in their own right, they say. For Shea and Becker, Instagram has the potential to become an accepted art form.

“Photos, no matter how compelling or evocative, draw us in to learn more,” Lesley University President Joseph Moore said at the beginning of a panel discussion on photojournalism and the Arab Spring. The Wednesday discussion at Lesley’s Washburn Auditorium featured panelists Karim Ben Khelifa, a photojournalist and Nieman Fellow, Ludovic Blecher, editor-in-chief of Libération.fr and also a Nieman Fellow, and Judith E. Matloff ’81, a faculty member at the Columbia Journalism School. During the talk, the panelists described the lives of the people behind the camera and emphasized the need for journalists to get up-close views of their subjects while staying safe.
 
The discussion was presented in conjunction with “Revolutions: Photographs of the Arab Spring,” an exhibition of Rémi Ochlik’s photographs on display until February 22 at the Art Institute of Boston. Ochlik, whose photographs of protests in the Middle East were shown on a screen behind the panelists, was killed in Syria a year ago at age 28. Ochlik is just one of the over 50 journalists, both foreign and local, who lost their lives in Syria in 2012. Though the discussion ranged from personal anecdotes of work in the field to comments on the technical work of editors, Khelifa, Matloff, and Blecher all spoke of appreciation for Ochlik and the other journalists who have lost their lives while fighting to communicate stories to the world. 
 
“For me, the camera is nothing: [the important thing is] how you connect to the story and people around you,” said Khelifa. For him, safety in a conflict area often depended on his ability to blend into the crowd. Khelifa said that in Arab countries he grows a beard and often refuses to wear the flak jacket that would label him a member of the foreign press. 
 
Khelifa described a situation in which he was forced to use his iPhone instead of his big, professional camera. “For the first time, I was invisible,” he said. He was able to get closer to the action using the iPhone as a cover; he was no longer an intruding reporter, but just another young man with a phone. Indeed, taking photographs is no longer a privilege limited to members of the press with fancy cameras, a fact the panelists returned to in their discussion. Many protesters in Arab countries take their own phone pictures to update their Twitter or Instagram followers on the action; Khelifa said his iPhone photos have even been published in professional news outlets such as The Daily Beast. 
 
Blecher similarly discussed the shift from the professional photographer to the citizen reporter. As an editor, Blecher said, he spends a lot of time sifting through massive amounts of information for pieces that are credible, clear, and accurate. “Many voices [come] from the citizens using the Internet to express their emotions,”  Blecher said. In particular, he mentioned social media sources like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. “The job of the journalist has always been to choose what is important and what is not,” he said. With so many places to turn to for information, Blecher said that he would choose to publish photos from journalists like Khelifa over local Twitter updates because professional journalists can be held accountable for the information they report.
 
Matloff joked that when she started reporting, information was spread through telegrams, not Instagram. Matloff was a foreign correspondent for 20 years in 62 countries and is now a contributing editor at the Columbia Journalism Review, where she has written about another type of revolution—that of women in journalism. According to Matloff, there are more females out in the field than when she started reporting. But while both men and women risk their lives when they go into countries of conflict, Matloff proposed that women especially approach the job with caution. Matloff mentioned the high rates of sexual harassment and rape in violent political areas and the increased prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Arab countries as factors that might discourage women from reporting abroad. Because of the these dangers, getting close to the action in order to take photos and relay stories to the world might be even riskier for women. There are still many advancements to be made in terms of ensuring women are able to prevent harassment and rape in foreign countries, Matloff said. 
 
For both men and women, Khelifa said, it is a brave and personal choice to go to these dangerous places, and returning with meaningful photos requires an immense amount of dedication to the cause. “You need to care, you need commitment, you need resilience, and you need to be a little bit nuts,” said Khelifa.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the traditional model of theater, text is a tyrant—actors and directors pay it the utmost attention and devotion, believing it to be the most efficacious way to convey the story. But think of a particularly powerful moment in theater. Is a line from the text itself, or some dramatic action: the smashing of a music box, the destruction of a beautiful family heirloom—or even the “aha” moment, the sudden realization that the story being told through dance is one that you have read several times before?
 
Students in actor Scott Barrow’s Wintersession workshop “Introduction to Moment Work: Exploring Elements of the Stage” identified moments in theater most poignant to them, many of the participants focusing on such visceral instants. As one of the January Arts and Media Seminars organized by the Office for the Arts, Barrow’s workshop offered a limited number of students the opportunity to dissect other facets of theater, such as space, props, and overall aesthetic. 
 
The JAMS programs offered students and non-students the unique opportunity to come in close contact with professional actors, musicians and other artists. Seminars and conversations held throughout the last full week of January were designed to connect students with the arts.
 
Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a student in Barrow’s seminar and a Crimson Arts editor, got that chance as he recalled his moment from theater. For him, the actors’ electric performance in a production of Philip Ridley’s “Mercury Fur” culminated in a particularly charged scene. “Unlike ever before, I felt that I shouldn’t be watching this,” McTaggart said. “I felt as a viewer that I was intruding. And for the first time in theater, I felt a real sense of danger.”
 
These moments are made of the type of non-textual elements that Barrow encouraged his students to consider. A member of the Tectonic Theater Project, Barrow believes that the actor is a storyteller who, in order to better tell the theatrical story, should deeply understand its elements beyond the bare text. “The best thing for the students to get out of this would be to be able to develop a vocabulary with the more subtle elements of the stage so we can create an alternative to text-driven theater,”  Barrow says. In order to understand theater, the students first deconstructed it by listing its components: light, shadow, sound, direction, tempo. After delving into these elements, the students created theatrical moments of their own.
 
As the JAMS initiative aims to draw in people of diverse backgrounds, however, the workshop did not attract only actors or even only those involved directly with theater. Nicolas Maffey ’13, who performed in Cirque du Soleil after high school, joined actors, directors, and playwrights in the workshop. “Being a more holistic, a more well-rounded artist is extremely important [in the circus],” Maffey said. “I’m always very interested in learning more about all the tools I have available to come up with a better routine and to become a better artist.”
 
While Barrow’s workshop was limited to students, public conversations were also held around campus as part of the JAMS initiative. In a master class with Christine Ebersole, the public listened as three undergraduates performed and were afterwards advised by the celebrated Broadway star. And audience members learned the tricks of the comedic trade during an afternoon with “Seinfeld” writers Tom Gammill ’79 and Max Pross ’79.
 
In the Kirkland Junior Common Room, Harvard undergraduates had another chance to learn from some other successful artistic alumni: Richard Kogan ’77, Lynn Chang ’75, and Yo-Yo Ma ’76. In a conversation entitled “Forty Years of Music Making: The Divergent Musical Paths of the Kogan Chang Ma Trio,” the three musicians spoke about their experiences since attending Harvard and how they got to where they are today as artists. Kogan, who is both a psychiatrist and a pianist, recalled how his undergraduate experience encouraged his musical talent. “I became really interested in music my freshman year,” he said. “But, probably the more important thing was the friendship I made with [Ma and Chang].” 
 
The three friends alternated between reminiscing on undergraduate times and offering advice on how to pursue one’s passion. Though he also emphasized the possibility of combining the humanities and science, Chang encouraged those in pursuit of a purely musical career. “If you have a passion for it, why not?” Chang said.
 
Ma’s particular interest was in the innovative power of music and art. Specifically, he spoke about art’s ability to unite divergent fields, as with Kogan’s marriage of medicine and music. “For something where you think there is a dichotomy, you can creatively find a connection that no one else has thought of,” Ma said.
 
This concept of the unifying power of art encompasses, in a sense, the mission of Harvard JAMS. Whether they brought little theater knowledge or had already directed multiple productions, aspired to become professional musicians or sought to pursue art alongside a career in medicine, students and non-students had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the arts through these Wintersession activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following his second inaugural address, The Crimson Staff criticized President Barack Obama for defending entitlement programs “wholesale” and advocating for deficit reduction only in passing. In the conventional wisdom, to which the piece dutifully adhered, the federal government has a borrowing problem that poses a major threat to the economy now and in the future, and immediate and significant cuts to entitlement programs represent the only real solution.
On its face, the conventional wisdom is correct. America does have a debt problem, it is dragging on our economy, and entitlements could use reform. But the true fiscal crisis America faces right now is not fundamentally an economic one—it’s political. For this crisis, Obama’s speech was dead on.
The prevailing economic argument against current debt levels says that, despite record-low interest rates on Treasury bonds today, the United States’ creditors will eventually demand higher interest rates out of fear that the government will be unable to meet its obligations. While no one can pinpoint the exact debt level at which this crisis will occur, America’s debt over the past four years theoretically presents a huge risk.
Yet, despite years of dire warnings, no such crisis is upon us. Short-term Treasury rates remain near all-time lows, negative when adjusted for inflation—investors are effectively paying the U.S. government to hold their money. Indeed, market signals today suggest the American government should be borrowing more, not less, while it is so cheap to do so.
Further, in spite of these signals, Obama and the Congress have already reduced the deficit by about $2.4 trillion in a series of deals. Another $1.4 trillion, analysts say, and the deficit and debt will both remain at reasonable levels for the next 10 years.
And yet, says the conventional wisdom, we have a debt crisis.
Deficit hawks insist that stabilizing the debt over the next 10 years is not enough, pointing to unsustainable debt-to-GDP ratios in the 2040s or ’50s. Lacking the economic impetus for action on a problem years down the road, however, they have turned to political tactics. Economists and politicians on both sides have elevated the debt to a national emergency through doomsday debt crisis scenarios—rather than an honest debate about the virtues of deficit reduction—knowing that nothing gets done in Washington without a crisis.
Aided by Washington gridlock, this political maneuver has succeeded. Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to reduce the deficit, so every fiscal battle comes with the possibility of default, downgrade, and/or recession. Such high levels of uncertainty, combined with the austerity that eventually emerges, have hindered the recovery and called into question our political system’s ability to, quite literally, pay the bills. Many have mistaken these as consequences of our debt itself, rather than the way we have chosen to approach it. This mistake only fuels the crisis narrative.
Yes, our recent fiscal conundrums have had some benefit. It should take only one or two more fiscal-cliff-type dramas this spring to bring the debt on a sustainable path for the coming decade. Addressing the debt beyond that, however, requires major reforms to programs, like Medicare, contingent upon future health care costs that are unpredictable today—and may already be falling thanks to the Affordable Care Act. All told, the high costs these manufactured crises have wrought on our economy and political system seem to far outweigh the potential benefits of further budget cuts.
Yet the debt crisis narrative—a political choice disguised as economic reality—has gained so much credence that it is unlikely to fade.
Unless politicians begin to change the conversation.
Unless, that is, lawmakers finally start emphasizing our pressing national issues—like climate change, immigration, gun violence, and most of all, unemployment—rather than persisting in their failed attempts at “grand bargains” designed to brace for potentialities many years down the road while distracting from other priorities.
President Obama’s second inaugural aimed to do just that. Calling upon Americans to “act in our time,” the president signaled an end to debt crisis politics. The speech displayed a new Obama pragmatism that aims to improve America’s future prospects by addressing current realities.
This may seem like a plea for shortsightedness, and in a strict sense it is. But politics is the art of the possible. Is it possible that we could set the debt on a steady course not only ten but 30, 40 years down the road? Just 15 years ago, the federal government was projected to pay off its entire debt by the year 2009. Unfortunately, things like 9/11, two wars, and a massive financial crisis got in the way.
So let’s continue to reduce the debt to manageable levels. Let’s reform entitlements to improve efficiency and secure them for the future. Let’s make our tax code fairer and more pro-growth. And let’s implement and improve Obamacare to start bending the health care cost curve and reducing long-term debt responsibly. But let’s say goodbye to the debt crisis narrative that has outlived its usefulness and now works to the detriment of concrete economic and social goals. The President has.

Often described as a puzzling and ineffective bureaucratic machine, Harvard’s Office of Student Life has the potential to greatly benefit from the recent appointment of Stephen Lassonde as its dean. Lassonde's extensive experience as a superintendent and advocate of student residential life positions him well to reshape the OSL into a friendlier institution and more strongly support the activities of undergraduate student organizations.
Designed to serve as the focal point of extracurricular life at the College and an important source of guidance for Harvard’s more than 400 extracurricular organiations, the OSL has not yet measured up to its promise. A number of weak points in the way student life is conducted at Harvard could stand for substantial reform. The lack of an intuitive application process for student organization grants, an excessively tight regulation of undergraduate activities, as well as the current processes of annual re-registration and room booking that student groups undergo have been described as cumbersome and contribute to the unfriendly and counterproductive image that the OSL holds. 
Dean of Calhoun College at Yale and later Deputy Dean of the College at Brown, Lassonde brings to Harvard the experience of a seasoned, well-versed administrator. At Brown, Lassonde garnered a reputation as an accessible and unpretentious advisor, despite his high rank in the university’s hierarchy. Throughout his tenure, he maintained regular office hours open to all students, and self-reportedly tried to make himself a “resource for students” rather than a distant executive. Moreover, Lassonde made efforts to expand the office hours of all university deans—an endeavor that he hoped would herald ever more lively and regular communication between students and administrators.
Furthermore, Lassonde has had experience overseeing disciplinary proceedings and matters of academic integrity, having served on the Committee on Academic Integrity at Yale and the Committee on Academic Standing at Brown. This is especially relevant at Harvard in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating scandal. As Dean of Student Life, Lassonde will hopefully be able to serve as an effective point of reference for the students who were asked to withdraw from the College as they resume their studies.
Lassonde has clearly learned the right lessons from his time at Brown, telling the Brown Daily Herald that “[h]aving conversations with students [made] a difference” during his time there. Building upon the work of former Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and upon his background, Lassonde could conceivably steer the OSL in a direction that is friendlier to students. While most of the interactions that Harvard undergraduates have with the office are currently burdensome or unpleasant, we hope that its new leadership will make for an improved Office of Student Life at Harvard.

Last month, the students, alumni, and workers in the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition won a great victory: President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard would, for the first time, create a Social Choice Fund to invest designated alumni donations in a socially responsible manner. This is certainly an important step—and the fact that more than 450 people donated to the Fair Harvard Fund last spring indicates how many alums want Harvard to invest its money for social good. Harvard’s speedy acknowledgement of this interest bodes well for the future of student activism.
Yet, one important detail of Harvard’s announcement has thus far been largely overlooked. Although Harvard will create a Social Choice fund on July 1, this fund will not be part of Harvard’s $31 billion endowment and the Harvard Management Company will not manage it. Instead, Harvard has cleverly maintained the position of its endowment as removed from moral or ethical considerations. Members of the Harvard community must keep working if they truly want our university to use its money responsibly.
Harvard invests its endowment with principles generally in accordance with modern portfolio theory, which requires that no limitations be placed on the investments a fund can make in order to maximize returns. Although environmental, social, and governance considerations may come into play when the university considers the long-term sustainability of an investment, the Harvard Management Company fundamentally makes investment decisions simply based on what it thinks will earn it the most profit.
For example, Harvard declared last year that it would not reinvest in HEI Hotels and Resorts, a hotel company accussed of labor rights violations (for example, HEI owns the Le Meridien Cambridge hotel in Central Square, currently involved in a labor dispute and under boycott by its own workers). However, although Brown University condemned HEI’s labor practices in its own decision not to reinvest, the Harvard Gazette reported that Harvard’s decision was simply based on “portfolio” reasons.
Of course, this should not be discouraging to student activists, like those in the Student Labor Action Movement who advocated for non-reinvestment in HEI and those in Students for a Just and Stable Future currently advocating for Harvard to divest its endowment from corporations with large fossil fuel holdings. One of the factors taken into consideration when deciding the usefulness of an investment is undoubtedly public image. If students, alumni, and other community members can make a university look poor enough for continuing to invest in a destructive industry or company, the threat of decreased alumni donations and poor public relations may encourage the university to cede to student demands—whether or not they market their decision as a move towards social responsibility or a “portfolio” decision. If we cannot appeal to the ethics of the university, at least we can appeal to the ethics of its community.
But more fundamentally, it is time to question the relevance of modern portfolio theory to the Harvard Management Company’s endowment. After all, it is ridiculous to think that HMC could possibly select the “best” investments from the entire field of possible investments. Any choices of what to invest in are subjective, dependent upon human choice. This became obvious in 2008, when Harvard’s endowment plummeted 27 percent, much more than the 18 percent median drop that large endowments faced. This suggests that the Harvard Management Company had invested its endowment disproportionately in financial corporations like Goldman Sachs, which suffered much more in the financial crisis than the average company.
Proponents of socially responsible investment often cite studies demonstrating that funds that engage in socially responsible investing, especially when they employ only negative screens to screen out a few egregiously irresponsible companies, have comparable returns to funds that do not specifically do socially responsible investment. While this may be true, this rhetoric ignores the moral motivation behind socially responsible investing: to actually do significant good for the world. If Harvard wants to act like the non-profit that it is, it must abandon the idea that its endowment’s investments are entirely separate from its moral purview as a university—and it must stop insisting that the endowment is now invested in accordance to some perfectly balanced formula to maximize returns.
Creating a social choice fund that exists outside of the endowment is an important first step. But ultimately, if students and other Harvard community members truly want their university to act responsibly, they must demand that Harvard invest its entire endowment in a socially responsible manner—and give up on the myth of modern portfolio theory.

On Nov. 7, 2012, Barack Obama was reelected as President of the United States.  For many hopeful Republicans, that same night marked an arguably bigger event—Mitt Romney lost. After months of parading around the ideal moderate-conservative candidate, pundits on the right were shocked by the final outcome. Staunch fiscal conservatives believe the Republican Party’s inability to shift with modern social trends was the reason for the loss, while others claimed it was Romney’s moderate stance on social issues that forced millions of Republicans to not even show up on voting day.
I believe both sides are right.
Modern social conservatism has been branded by its reactionary positions to the hyper-sexualized revolution of the 1960s. The movement has become too narrowly defined and has greatly divided the Republican Party between those who are too afraid to defend those positions and those who fervently support them at all costs. Not to diminish the importance of various positions held on the two most controversial issues associated with social conservatism—abortion and same-sex marriage—but these issues have pigeonholed the Republican Party in a very vulnerable, defensive position. While the party platform does not need to necessarily abandon these ideas, the party must shift its focus. Rather than promoting social conservatism as a force resistant to change, Republicans need to boldly propose forward-moving ideas that emphatically promote traditional values
Social conservatism is at the heart of the Republican movement. Though fiscal conservatives and libertarians are ready to do away with social conservatives and their seemingly aggressive stances on particular issues, the principles of those groups present an incomplete solution when not embracing their inherent roots in social conservatism. Central to Republican ideology is the belief that government should be limited in both size and influence. But a party cannot push for a society of individuals free from excessive government without helping them build the necessary societal support systems around them.
In the past, these support systems used to be validated from social values that easily resonated with the majority of Americans. However, we are currently living in an America in which 25 percent of children are being raised in single-parent households, 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, and only 60 percent of Americans self-identify as “religious.” We are fortunate to live in a country where we are free to believe, say, and do as we please. Yet without support, this has translated into the abandonment and sometimes purposeful rejection of the traditional ideas that helped build this nation. We ignore the free and willing strength of the people—grounded in various forms of faith in civil society, families, and God—that was once crucial in guiding our intrinsic American values.
The leadership of the Republican Party either thinks that the values of community strength are already implied or is otherwise too afraid to appear “backward” in its societal beliefs. Either way, the public is not getting the whole message. Today, the general population has a sense of distrust toward establishments such as marriage, family, and religious groups, as there is no voice to protect the permanency of these institutions. This is what the Republican Party needs to do. It should look at the general public and see this clearly identifiable void of strength in the social sphere. As such, it should give Americans viable solutions and policies that will restore trust in these communities.
Alexis de Tocqueville said, “I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on…every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and they may absolutely refuse to move at all.” Understandably, I think many would argue that this quote represents everything that appears so wrong with what has been considered as today’s social conservative movement. But if the Republican Party can revert to original, more-generalized forms of true social conservatism, the different factions of the Party can reunite in positively initiating and inspiring the American public. No longer can the Republican Party, or the nation, afford to let social conservatism—real social conservatism—be seen as dead weight holding Americans back. Social conservatism as a greater fundamental ideology needs to be redefined, emphasized, and embraced. It is an affirmative reminder of the true potential and greatness of the American people. The people are ready, and all we need now is a strong Republican Party to lead the way.

The year 2012 saw fewer crimes in Cambridge, continuing a trend where the overall serious crime rate decreased for each of the last three years and violent crime declined for each of the past four.
Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas gave credit for the decrease to not only the police officers in the field, but also the employees who analyze and synthesize data related to crime.
“By giving our officers this information, they have done an exceptional job of working to break patterns before they are able to fully materialize,” he said in a press release last week. “It is their hard work and commitment to this community which have made us successful in working to reduce crime.”
Several important indicators of crime in Cambridge fell over the past year. Property crime fell by two percent and violent crime was down five percent. Serious crime, an aggregate statistic including property crime and violent crime, fell three percent total. Much of this improvement was due to a remarkably low number of commercial robberies in 2012—last year, only 16 businesses were burglarized, down from 34 in 2011.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello told The Crimson that while he could not attribute the decline in commercial robberies to a single initiative, the department has been working with local businesses for years to decrease robberies. Rivello pointed to one particular program that sends officers to local businesses to work with owners on an crafting effective security plans as a potential contributor.
“We have officers that go and meet with the business community and address any concerns, share any [relevant] information we might have, and talk to owners about how the business can protect themselves,” he said.
Despite last year’s improvements, the frequency of some types of crime remained the same, or even increased in 2012. Twenty-three rapes, including the two that occurred last August on Harvard’s campus, took place in 2012—the same number as in 2011. And even with what CPD in its press release called “successful undercover operations” against pickpockets, larceny from a person in 2012 increased by 15 percent. Larceny from a motor vehicle grew by seven percent last year.
Riviello added that despite the improvements reflected in last year’s statistics, CPD attempts to look beyond the numbers.
“We’re very excited about the fall in crime,” he said. “It’s the fourth year in a row. But we’re not just focusing on the numbers, because every time there is a crime, there are still people being victimized.”

The social anthropology department is thinking about group interactions and new furniture as it makes plans to move from William James Hall on Kirkland Street to Tozzer Library on Divinity Ave.
The relocation—slated to be completed in 2014— represents an effort to foster greater departmental unity between social anthropology and anthropology’s archeology program, which is currently located adjacent to Tozzer in the Peabody Museum.
The project is estimated to cost at least $12 million, according to anthropology department chair Gary Urton, and officially began about three weeks ago. It will feature a complete renovation of Tozzer Library including the addition of two new floors dedicated to social anthropology. Faculty expect to move to their new offices in May of 2014.
Faculty response to the move has been “really enthusiastic,” said Urton.
“They’re getting new offices in the Tozzer building,” he said. “They will have a much clearer sense of themselves as being a unit that’s devoted to the work that they are doing.”
Lynne M. Schmelz, librarian for the sciences at Harvard, said that she is similarly eager for the construction to conclude.
“There will be new space for the students to visit,” she said. “That’s exciting for the library.”
The anthropology department began considering consolidation after human and evolutionary biology, formerly known as biological anthropology, became its own separate department in 2009.
“We just felt that it was very important to reestablish, to reexamine, what unites us,” Urton said.
Anthropology professor Mary M. Steedly—a member of a project planning committee comprised of faculty members, project architects, and designers—said she believes the construction on Tozzer Library will create “newly renovated spaces up-to-the-minute technologically and designed with efficiency and comfort in mind.” She added that the project will also allow the social anthropology program to make greater use of the Peabody Museum’s collections.
Social anthropology’s new home will accommodate about 15 faculty, with some additional office space for emeritus faculty members and guest faculty, said Urton.
“One of the nicest things about the plan is that it creates—in the middle of the space—an open common area with a skylight that’s really going to be beautiful,” said Steedly. “It’s been a really exciting experience seeing this all come together—it’s going to be a great improvement over the current situation.”

In what indicates his possible interest in entering the special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Massachusetts State Representative Daniel B. Winslow has announced that he will issue a press release “regarding his plans for the U.S. Senate special election” and hold a press conference Tuesday.
Before the press release was announced, Republican sources told The Crimson that Winslow, a Republican from Norfolk and a former advisor to then-Governor Mitt Romney, would likely enter the race.
Winslow said Friday that he would take the weekend to make a decision about running.
Winslow announced his upcoming press release in a post on Twitter Monday, writing “Can we fix America and break the gridlock?” He also included in his tweet the hashtag “#masen.”
As of Monday no other Republicans have announced their candidacy for the race. Former U.S. Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez, who has been identified by multiple sources as a potential candidate, has indicated a possible interest in entering.
Former Mass. Senator Scott P. Brown, former Governor William F. Weld ’66, and other Republicans well-known in the state have said they will not run.
Winslow, a former district court judge, left the bench in 2002 to advise Romney and, more recently, Brown. Winslow has served as Norfolk’s representative in the Massachusetts House of Representative since 2011.
Though Winslow may not have the statewide name recognition of some, politically-connected Republicans told The Crimson Monday that they were optimistic about his chances.
“Dan Winslow is a leader that I would be excited about,” said former Republican congressional candidate Joseph A. Selvaggi. “He is smart, honest, and tells it like it is. I think people admire him as a principled person.”
Todd Domke, a Republican media analyst, called Winslow “formidable, successful, and articulate.”
Both the Democratic and Republican primaries will be held on April 30. The winner of the Republican primary will likely face either Representative Stephen F. Lynch or Representative Edward J. Markey, who is currently leads in Democratic primary polls.
Domke, who was also complimentary of Gomez, said that a Winslow-Gomez primary could be beneficial to the Massachusetts Republican party, presenting an opportunity for the party to remake its image after Brown, Romney, and numerous other Republicans nation-wide lost their races during the 2012 elections.
“If the party is going to rebuild and revive itself then this primary contest could be the beginning,” said Domke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives discussed the launch of a new UC website and an initiative to increase funding for UC-sponsored study breaks during the group’s first general meeting of the spring semester Monday night. The meeting was the first led by new UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14.
The website, which is still in its beta version and went live at 1 a.m. Monday morning, is designed to be more user-friendly than the blog-like format of the organization’s previous website.
“I think this is something that is going to be a really big step for the UC if we have an intuitive website that’s really easy to use and really accessible,” Raghuveer said.
Though members were generally enthusiastic about the new website, some going so far as to describe it as “beautiful” and “sleek,” others voiced concerns about its technical aspects.
During the meeting the UC also debated legislation about study break funding, ultimately deciding to table the issue until after spring recess.
The legislation, entitled the “Study Break Funding Act,” would have increased funding for UC-sponsored study breaks from $50 to $80 for each House per semester.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the act’s sponsor, argued that $50 is not enough money to purchase the food necessary to hold an effective study break, especially given the increasing price of food.
Goffard reasoned that increasing the budget for UC study breaks would increase their frequency, which in turn would bolster the visibility of the organization on campus. Only two UC study breaks were held last semester,
“Especially during exam week and especially when the workload starts increasing, even just one study break makes a big difference,” Goffard said.
Although members seemed generally supportive of the initiative, the members voted to postpone a vote on the act until they have more information on whether there is room in the group’s operations budget for the spending increase. The motion to table the legislation passed 13-10.
In an interview with The Crimson after the meeting, Goffard said he was disappointed with the tabling of the legislation and the lack of emphasis on study breaks on campus. He said that even though study breaks are budgeted for, many UC members tend to hold very few of them.
“I didn’t think it would be so controversial because it was just $500,” Goffard said, “I really wanted to encourage people to do these study breaks and to reach out, and the fact that we only had two last semester was a little disappointing.”
Raghuveer said that she thought that overall the UC’s first meeting represented a succesful start to the semester.
“I think [the meeting] went really well and honestly it doesn’t feel like this was my first UC meeting because the [representatives] were active over winter break,” Raghuveer said in an interview following the event. “It doesn’t feel like anyone is unprepared to get started on a really productive semester.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pointing out that the days of playing pick-up baseball after school are long gone, officials from the Cambridge City Council and the Cambridge Schools Committee discussed ways to enrich Cantabrigian students’ extracurricular lives at the Council’s weekly meeting Monday night.
At the round table meeting, officials stressed the need to expand student participation in so-called “out-of-school-time programs”—extracurricular activities occurring afterschool and over breaks.
“There should be no kid that goes home and plays Nintendo,” said Councillor Leland Cheung. “There’s no need to go home before five, six o’ clock.”
Many officials said they were concerned that the cost of extracurricular activities was discouraging students from participating and suggested creating scholarships for programs with hefty pricetags.
“Sometimes, children see the price column and shut down,” said Susan Richards, coordinator of out-of-school-time activities for the city of Cambridge. “Let’s take away the price column.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 asked officials to concentrate not only on increasing the number of afterschool programs in Cambridge but also on improving the quality of those programs that already exist. He noted the absence of extracurricular activities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
“We need to focus on things that will give us outcomes,” said Reeves. “I just don’t think that cheerleading and football are what we’re looking for in terms of outcome.”
On Monday a task force of school administrators and educators called the Out-of-School-Time Design Team presented their proposals for increasing extra-curricular participation. One program that the task force will pilot this year involves creating online “out-of-school-time passports” for middle-schoolers. Teachers and coaches from participating extracurricular programs would modify these passports, awarding their students “stamps” for significant participation and “badges” for improvement.
“We want the OST passport to grow within the upper school culture,” said Richards. “We hope that it will be something the students will want show-off.”
In an effort to raise awareness about opportunities that already exist, the Design Team recently compiled a booklet of out-of-school-time programs.
“Education happens beyond the framework of the school day,” said Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young at the start of the meeting. “We are really committed to providing those enriching opportunities to students.”

Memorial Church hosted a screening of “Soundtrack for a Revolution,” a film commemorating the life and message of Martin Luther King, Jr., during the first in a series of events planned to celebrate the University’s third annual Interfaith Awareness Week.
The Harvard community adopted Interfaith Awareness Week in 2011, echoing a United Nations initiative that dedicated the first week of February to the task of commemorating and affirming international peace.
Those involved in Harvard’s events hope that the week will foster a respectful environment and encourage students to explore the commonalities between all faiths and non-faiths.
“This is a very delicate subject, very personal for many of us,” said Harvard Zoroastrian Chaplain Daryush Mehta. “Even if you get just one student who comes to a realization or we’re able to affect a few people, it’s worth it.”
In addition to Monday’s screening, the week will also include a talk by former Vice President Al Gore '69 on the health of the planet and its inhabitants, an open meditation sponsored by the Harvard Buddhist Chaplaincy, and a panel entitled “Doubt and Religion.”
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation, said he thinks that because many students were not on campus to celebrate Martin Luther King Day, which fell during Harvard’s winter break, the film on King’s life was an appropriate way to kick off the week’s events.
“Dr. King was a very active Christian who used his Christian philosophy to advance the civil rights movement,” Counter said.
The film incorporated soulful music with footage and personal testimonies from Freedom Riders and civil rights activists. Music by contemporary artists was juxtaposed with black-and-white mug shots of various Freedom Riders. Grainy film footage of former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace condemning integration was interspersed with clips of a church choir belting “We Shall Not Be Moved.”
“Last year we had a speaker, we had a program. I thought, ‘Let’s try something a little different to get the younger generation more aware,’” said Counter. “John Legend can reach your generation much better than I could.”
Following the film, the Kuumba Singers sang “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round,” a song that was prevalent throughout the film.
Lea E. Parker ’15, a member of the Kuumba Singers, said she felt a connection to the music in the film.
“The way that they used song was particularly meaningful to me,” said Parker. “It was a similar mode of expression that I can relate to.”
After the Kuumba Singers’ performance, Aubrey J. Walker ’15 offered the event’s closing remarks, emphasizing the continued need for young people to come together around social movements ranging from mass incarceration to gun control.
“We are the voice of a generation and together, we will be heard,” Walker said.

Professors and administrators will discuss the Government 1310 cheating scandal at their monthly Faculty Meeting Tuesday, according to faculty members who have received the meeting agenda. The discussion is the first among faculty since Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced the results of the investigation in a University-wide email Friday.
The University announced in August that it was investigating approximately 125 students thought to be involved in widespread cheating on a take-home exam last spring in the course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Professors said Smith’s email on Friday was the first they had heard of the case from the administration since the initial announcement. Discussion amongst faculty members since then, they said, has been largely limited to personal conversations.
The University made the investigation public in the hopes that it could be used as a “teaching opportunity” that fostered broader discussion on academic honesty. Faculty members are hopeful that Tuesday’s meeting will give them a chance to reflect on the University’s handling of the case.
Government professor Michael E. Rosen said that he has no reason to question the way in which Harvard handled the controversy. He said he thinks that trust amongst the students and faculty is essential as Harvard looks to prevent such incidents in the future.
“Harvard—universities in general—are learning institutions, and we all make mistakes,” Rosen said. “And while cheating is a very grave mistake, it’s very important that...the University handles it in a way that people can learn from it.”
In his email to faculty and students, Smith indicated that the Committee on Academic Integrity hopes to release a number of proposals in the coming months regarding the scholarly values of both students and professors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the addition of a fourth sorority on campus, the number of women who signed up for sorority recruitment at Harvard this year remained constant from last.
Approximately 250 women attended the first recruitment event for Harvard’s four sororities on Saturday, the same number as in 2012. Last year’s showing represented a small decrease from the record-breaking group of 268 women who showed up in 2011. Prior to 2011, recruitment classes averaged about 150 women.
The recent stabilization of large rush numbers led to interest in introducing a fourth sorority to campus. This year, Alpha Phi joined Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
After the conclusion of the second recruitment event on Wednesday, women will rank their sorority preferences. They will then receive invitations to attend further events.
The procedures to rush Alpha Phi differ from the recruitment process for the other three. Women who attend the first two recruitment events have the opportunity to meet members from all four sororities. Because there are no current Harvard students in Alpha Phi, women from other school’s chapters of the sorority will come to host the first and second recruitment rounds along with the other three sororities. However, Alpha Phi will not hold a third or fourth round at the same time as the other three sororities, and will instead postpone recruitment events until the end of February. Therefore, women who were not offered bids by another sororities, chose not to join another sorority, or did not participate in the first rounds of recruitment at all will still be able to join Alpha Phi.
National standards require new chapters on a university campus to complete the recruitment process after the established sororities.
“Right now, since [Alpha Phi has] not colonized yet, that’s the way national rules dictate recruitment has to be,” said Natalia Duarte ’14, vice president of recruitment for the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.
Regardless of a potential new member’s interest in joining Alpha Phi, the Panhellenic Coucil suggested that women attend the first two general recruitment events.
“We really encourage girls who are thinking about joining a sorority to try and meet the girls from all four sororities before they make up their minds,” Duarte said.
Women may still rush Alpha Phi without attending rush events this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 4:54 a.m.
As Harvard sought to bookend its massive cheating investigation with an announcement last Friday, students implicated in the scandal said the new information raised more questions than it answered.
On Friday morning, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent an email to the Harvard community to offer what he called “a few final, general words” on the academic integrity investigation that has rocked Harvard’s campus for the past five months.
Smith’s email concerned the Administrative Board’s investigation of about 125 students in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” who were accused of cheating on the class’s take-home final. He was writing, he said, “to shine a bright light on the important issue of academic integrity and what we are doing on this issue.”
In his announcement, Smith reported that more than half of the implicated students—a figure that translates to approximately 70 undergraduates—were forced to temporarily withdraw from the College following the Ad Board’s investigation. Smith wrote that of the remaining investigated students, half received probation, while the other half received no punishment.
Even so the email did not name the class and provided no precise numbers about how many students were disciplined.
One investigated student, whose case resulted in probation, said he was disappointed by the contents of Smith’s message.
“I think that it was a bunch of fluff, had absolutely no significant content, and trivialized how unfairly every student involved was treated,” said the student, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he was worried about retaliation from administrators.
Smith provided the details about the distribution of punishments nearly 800 words into his email, following a lengthy explanation of the general purpose and procedures of the Ad Board. Some students said they did not immediately realize Smith’s email concerned the cheating scandal.
“I didn’t even read all the way through the email because I thought it was just another administrative announcement,” said Emily J. Reese ’14, who took Government 1310 last spring and was not investigated by the Ad Board. “I deleted it right away.”
Several accused students said the email also failed to address lingering questions about the scandal, the way it was handled, and what criteria were used to reach their decisions.
The father of a varsity athlete implicated in the scandal said he was frustrated that the email did not acknowledge the mistakes that he believes Harvard made over the course of the investigation.
“I find the whole letter insulting and offensive,” said the man, whose son lost NCAA eligibility after he was forced to withdraw late in the fall term. “There’s been no acknowledgment of [Harvard’s] responsibility.”
In his email, Smith wrote that due to the “unprecedented number and complexity of cases,” some students did not receive their verdicts until December, more than three months after the investigation was announced.
Delays in the investigation also caused concern among implicated students about tuition payments. According to the student handbook, students who withdrew from the College for any reason this past fall were required to pay tuition in increasing increments up to $18,788 after the Sept. 11 study card day. But to “create greater financial equity” for students who received their decisions later than others, Smith announced in his email Friday that anyone who was asked to withdraw after Sept. 30 would be issued refunds for all tuition paid past that date.
The father of the accused varsity athlete, as well as another implicated student, said that while they appreciated Harvard’s gesture, they questioned its timing, saying that the move seemed like a last-minute public relations effort.
The latter student, who was notified in late August that his case would go before the Ad Board, said Smith’s email came too late for him. Last fall, he decided to withdraw even before his case was heard so that he would not be a financial burden on his family.
“I had to make a hard decision with my family and withdraw, which included implicitly admitting to something I did not do, because I couldn’t be sure when my case was going to be heard,” he said. “My biggest consideration in terms of withdrawing was the tuition increase.”
That student said he was dismayed when he learned of Smith’s email, which was sent to the Harvard community around 11 a.m. Friday morning. He had been notified of Harvard’s decision to reimburse his tuition earlier that morning, just hours before Smith sent his message to the Harvard community, according to a copy of the student’s letter obtained by The Crimson.
In an emailed statement, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on when Harvard made its decision to partially refund tuition for students who were required to withdraw.
“Communications about tuition, fees and financial aid are between the College and students and their families,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:36 a.m.
Massachusetts State Representative Daniel B. Winslow announced Tuesday that he will form an exploratory committee to help him consider a run for the Senate seat vacated last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Winslow, who has represented Norfolk since 2011, would be the first major Republican to enter the special election and is the first to form an exploratory committee.
“We need to fix a broken Washington where progress is being hampered by partisan gridlock,” Winslow said in a press release Tuesday morning. “If we continue to elect the same Washington politicians, we can not expect different results.”
Though the forming of an exploratory committee does not necessarily represent a decision to run, Winslow may be pressured to make a quick decision. Massachusetts law requires that any candidate who wishes to enter a party primary for a U.S. Senate seat must collect 10,000 valid signatures from registered party members.
The signatures must be presented for verification by February 27.
“Getting 10,000 signatures, that might not sound so hard, but it can be an uphill battle,” said former Republican congressional candidate Joseph A. Selvaggi.
Selvaggi estimated that a candidate would have to collect over 15,000 signatures to ensure that he had 10,000 eligible names.
“That’s no easy task,” Selvaggi concluded.
As of Tuesday evening, no other major Republicans had launched a campaign, but Douglas Bennett, a two-time Boston city council candidate, had announced that he would run.
Gabriel E. Gomez, a venture capitalist and former Navy Seal, expressed a strong interest in running last week, and sources told The Crimson Monday that a Gomez-Winslow primary was a strong possibility.
The new entrants to the Republican primary come after a host of other influential Massachusetts Republicans—including former U.S. Senator Scott P. Brown, former Governor William F. Weld ’66, and former gubernatorial hopeful Charles D. Baker ’79—turned down the opportunity to run.
Primaries for both parties will be held on April 30. The winner of the Republican primary will likely be an underdog to the Democratic nominee. Congressman Edward J. Markey of Malden is currently favored in his primary against Congressman Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston.

It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.
Those words have been a saving grace for Harvard men’s hockey in recent years as the Crimson has suffered through characteristically slow starts before turning up the heat in February to salvage its seasons.
On Monday night though, against defending national champion No. 4/5 Boston College (16-7-2, 12-6-1 Hockey East), it was an inability to close otherwise even periods that doomed Harvard (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) to a 4-1 loss in the first round of the Beanpot at TD Garden.
“The last couple minutes of the periods I think our game management took away any opportunity to be in the game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
The overmatched Crimson kept pace with the Eagles for the majority of the first period, but with the clock winding down on the first stanza the puck found BC sophomore Quinn Smith off of a face-off in Harvard’s zone and Smith was one-on-one with junior goaltender Raphael Girard. A feint followed by a shot over Girard’s left shoulder put the Eagles up 1-0 with only 28 seconds left until intermission.
"The first goal was a little bit of a heartbreaker for us," Donato said.
Up until that point, the first period saw the two teams go back and forth with Girard turning away a number of BC shots as the Crimson offense challenged Eagles net-minder Parker Milner on the other end.  With just under six minutes left in the opening frame, senior Luke Greiner fired a shot toward net that beat Milner, but could not beat the post marking the best scoring opportunity yet for either team.
“Greiner maybe caught the goalie sleeping a bit with the post,” Girard said. “[After that] we knew we could maybe get some goals. We knew we could play with this team, that’s for sure.”
Then, with 3:13 left in the first, senior defenseman Brendan Rempel was whistled for holding after a crushing hit behind net. The Crimson was able to mount a successful penalty kill, but shortly after the team’s returned to even numbers Smith found the back of the net to open up the scoring.
The Crimson came out of the first break composed as a series of Girard saves kept the deficit to one. Girard finished with 42 saves, his second highest total all season.
“I thought Raph was outstanding,” Donato said. “When he’s playing like that it gives a lot of confidence up and down the bench.”
Two holding calls on Eagles senior Patrick Wey gave Harvard opportunities on the power play, but the BC penalty kill and defense proved formidable on the night, successfully killing three penalties and limiting the Crimson to just 20 shots. With two minutes left on the clock in the second period Girard had recorded 27 saves and Harvard was still down just one.
“When we did have our chances I’m not sure we took full advantage of them,” Donato said. “A couple guys had the puck alone in front of net and of course Millner had some good saves. There are not a lot of teams that will win trading chances with that Boston College team. They certainly have a lot of firepower.”
That firepower was on full display in the last two minutes of the second period. Smith once again found himself on the receiving end of a fortuitous pass as the puck made its way across net untouched. Smith fired a shot into the upper left corner for his second goal of the game and fourth of the season.
51 seconds later BC defenseman Michael Matheson received the puck off the draw and fired a slapshot over Girard’s left shoulder to put the Eagles up, 3-0, and put the game out of reach.
A Danny Biega slapshot in the third period saved the Crimson from enduring its fifth shutout of the season, bringing the score to 3-1. The goal was the captain’s first of the year, after posting 10 last season en route to a first team All-America nod.
“I just thought about shooting it as hard as I could and I thought it gave us a little more of an edge after the shot,” Biega said.
That edge was not sustained as BC’s Steven Whitney would score an unassisted goal late in the third to close out the scoring.
Harvard’s inability to advance to next Monday’s Beanpot championship game marked the fifth straight year that the Crimson has been relegated to the consolation game after falling in the first round. Harvard has not won the Beanpot since 1993. Before the Eagles take on Northeastern in the championship in six days’ time, the Crimson will face a rematch with No. 13 Boston University, which Harvard beat, 6-5, in a stunning upset on Jan. 9.

Going into the 35th Annual Beanpot Tournament, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team (17-2-2, 14-1-1 ECAC) will be playing with a bit of a chip on its shoulder.
“Our attitude is that we have something to prove,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “Especially after last year.”
It was a tough go-around for the Crimson in the 2012 tournament. Harvard dropped a 5-2 decision to Boston University in the first round. The Crimson then went on to suffer a 4-2 loss at the hands of Boston College in the consolation game.
“Last season, we struggled with beating teams outside of our conference that were ranked,” Fry said.
This year will be a fresh start for Harvard, who looks to avenge its poor showing last year and return to its winning ways.
The Crimson last captured the cross-town tournament title in 2010, edging out Northeastern with a 1-0 victory in the finals. Harvard has won the Beanpot a grand total of 13 times, second only to Northeastern’s 15 titles.
But success in this year’s Beanpot will not come easy. First up on the schedule for the Crimson is a Tuesday night contest against the No. 2 Eagles (20-4-2, 13-2-1 Hockey East).
“This game against BC is huge,” Fry said. “Of the Boston teams, they’re probably our biggest rival. It’s going to be a fun game.”
The Eagles enter the Beanpot fresh off a 6-3 road win against Maine, capping a three-game win streak. Boston College got off to a rough start to its 2012-13 campaign, dropping three of its first four games of the season. Since then, the Eagles have found its form. The team’s only loss since October is a 3-2 defeat at Mercyhurst two weeks ago.
For Harvard, it will be an important game against a familiar opponent.
“We always know they have a solid team,” Fry said. “We know most of the players, just from being a part of national camps and what not. They have a lot of talent. But I don’t think there is anything there that we can’t be ready for and we can’t be ready to compete with. It’s going to be a battle. I think it’s really going to be about who decides to show up that day.”
The Crimson has had a season full of successes so far, but the team has hit a few roadblocks in recent weeks. Riding a seven game win streak, Harvard suffered its first loss since November at the hands of Clarkson on Jan. 25. The team bounced back with a 3-2 win over St. Lawrence the next day. The Crimson enters the Beanpot tournament fresh off a 2-2 overtime tie against Dartmouth
“Obviously we were bummed to get the tie, but we weren’t disappointed in our performance necessarily,” Fry said. “I think after the [Dartmouth] game, the team is heading in the right direction. That was the first time in a while we’ve played true Harvard hockey. This is a good a time as any to get back on that track.”
It will be a taxing few weeks for the Crimson, though, as the team works to balance its critical ECAC weekend contests while also fitting in Tuesday night Beanpot games.
“It’s tough in February, when you’re playing a lot of games, and it is going to be about which team is in the best shape and has fresh legs,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said.
Harvard scheduled some Tuesday night contests earlier in the season against non-conference opponents to prepare for the Beanpot tournament.
“It always takes a physical toll, but we personally take it upon ourselves to do what we need to do to recover,” Fry said. “It’s good to have had some Tuesday night games already this season. Now, with school starting, we are realizing that we have all these other distractions, but when we get to the rink, it’s game time, whether it’s a Tuesday night, Friday night, or Saturday night.”
A strong showing over the next two weeks would add to the Crimson’s already impressive season. The tournament will also give Harvard a chance to compete against top-tier opponents before post-season play. BC and BU are both ranked in the top three teams in the country, while Northeastern sits just outside the top 10. The cross-town showdown promises to feature some of this season’s national title contenders.
“When the Beanpot comes around, it’s so much about pride that a lot of the toll that the season is taking is less noticeable,” Bellamy said. “You’re playing with so much pride.”

A bevy of school records fell this weekend as the Harvard men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams bested their competition in the HYP dual meet at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J.
For the men’s team (8-0, 6-0 Ivy), the win was a piece of history, the first time an Ivy opponent has beaten Princeton at home and ensured a share of the dual meet title. The squad bested the Tigers by a margin of 200-153 and topped the Bulldogs, 292-61.
For the women (9-0, 7-0 Ivy), the win closed out a second consecutive undefeated conference season, a feat the Crimson hadn’t accomplished for six years. The team swept Yale, 209-89, and Princeton, 199-99.
“It was an awesome accomplishment to have beaten them in their own pool,” junior Oliver Lee said. “Our team is stronger than it has ever been, and that we are breaking school records in-season complements our victory over Princeton in their own pool.”
Lee had a superlative performance during the meet, breaking three school records and turning in two other times that were the second fastest in program history. He earned an individual record in the 50 free with a time of 19.74, eclipsing junior Chris Satterthwaite’s previous time of 19.84.
Lee and Satterthwaite joined sophomore Griffin Schumacher and junior Will Brophy to set the record in the 200 free relay in 1.18.71. Later in the meet, Lee teamed up with Schumacher and juniors Jack Pretto and Chuck Katis with a record time of 1.27.18 in the 200 medley relay.
Lee swam five races total, capturing first place in every single event. The team captured a win in 14 of the 19 events through the weekend.
“I was really happy with my own swims,” Lee said. “Personal bests when we aren’t yet tapered are always good. Going into Ivy’s, our team is excited and hoping to send a solid group to NCAA’s.”
Going into Ivy League Championships, Lee is no stranger to success. Last year, as a sophomore, he raced in the 200 and 400 free relay teams that set earlier school records at the championship meet.
Newer to the conference title race is freshman Kendall Crawford, who also had a banner weekend at Princeton. Crawford set school records in the 100 backstroke with a time of 53.59 and 100 butterfly, finishing in 53.79. She also won the 200 backstroke in 1:55.16, with teammates Danielle Lee, Caroline Weaver and Deirdre Clute trailing behind.
“We walked onto Princeton’s deck, and from the first step off the bus, we dominated,” Crawford said. “Getting two records was so beyond anything I’d ever expected. The atmosphere was so exciting and the excitement from the team fueled better and better swims. Everyone had great swims and each race led off to the other. Everything was perfect.”
Crawford has been breaking Harvard records since starting her collegiate career. In both of her first two meets, the freshman set landmark times for the Crimson in the 100 backstroke. Her time of 53.59 just eclipsed her previous record of 54.20, set at the Georgia Invitational on Dec. 2.
Crawford has picked up at least two wins in every meet she has competed in this January.
“[I] take each meet one step at a time,” Crawford said. “Closing out the season, I’d love to be able to help the team win an Ivy League championship…. It’s such a great team to be part of, and to be able to help it is just the best feeling. I guess personally I’d love to make NCAA’s. To be able to be a part of representing Harvard on a national level would be incredible.”
The rookie has her sights set beyond this season, which continues on Feb. 28 at Ivy Championships, and into the future. The Crimson enters the post-dual meet season with 14 straight wins and last year’s title on its record. With the strong crop of freshmen, including Crawford, the speed they carry doesn’t appear to be going away soon.
“I’m so honored to be able to help this team,” Crawford said. “I want to help start a dynasty of Harvard swimming as being the ones to beat. Princeton has won the past couple of years prior to 2011-12. I want to be able to start something new, start a Harvard dynasty. To be part of that is such an honor I can’t even describe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Girard, Girard. It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault.”
After the Eagles’ third goal of the game, the Boston College student section heckled Girard with its traditional and well-rehearsed “sieve” cheer.
Let the record show that the Crimson’s loss was by no stretch Raphael Girard’s fault. In fact, the junior goaltender may have been Harvard’s best man on the ice Monday night.
With two minutes left in the second period, Girard and his teammates seemed poised to achieve high-scale robbery on ice. The Eagles peppered the Crimson with shots during the second frame, yet Girard stood tall in net through 29 Boston College shots on goal.
But a sharp goaltender would not be enough to carry Harvard (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) to its first Beanpot final in five years thanks to an unrelenting Eagles forecheck. Boston College (16-7-2, 12-6-1 HE) found the back of the net on its final two shots of the period as the defending NCAA and Beanpot champions rolled to a 4-1 win over the struggling Crimson.
Girard finished the night with 42 saves as the Eagles outshot Harvard, 46-20. Making his first Beanpot start, the Quebecois did show some nerves early in the contest, tripping on a post the first time he was forced to handle the puck. But the junior quickly found a groove.
“I’ve been waiting for quite awhile,” Girard said. “I was really eager to get in the game. I was really nervous at the start… But I was just trying to go out there and be as aggressive as I could and be really poised because [BC] has a lot of poised players.”
In the first, Girard turned away six shots to stop a buzzing Boston College power play. In the second, he stuffed BC captain Pat Mullane on a shorthanded break-away.
When the Eagles did break through, Girard had little chance. Boston College’s second strike of the game came on a crisply-executed cross-rink pass that left Girard stranded on the other side of the net. Seconds later, Michael Matheson found a clear shooting lane to put the Eagles up, 3-0, into the final intermission.
Despite the high shots on goal count, Girard did receive plenty of help from his teammates. Harvard skaters blocked 21 of Boston College’s 79 attempted shots.
POWERLESS ON THE POWER PLAY
It is official: Harvard has gone from first to worst on the power play.
A year ago, the Crimson led the NCAA with a 27.4 percent success rate on the power play. After going 0-for-3 with the man advantage Monday, Harvard’s power play unit now ranks 59th out of 59 D-I teams.
“I think our power play is something that we’re going to need to improve if we’re going to have some success down the stretch,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We have juggled a bunch of guys in and out of the line-up, just got Kyle Criscuolo back. It’s something that we’ll continue to work on.”
The Crimson struggled to set up a focused attack during each of its three 5-on-4 opportunities. The Boston College penalty kill chewed valuable seconds off the clock with key faceoff wins and clean clears. Despite promising looks from freshman Jimmy Vesey and senior Alex Fallstrom, Harvard had some difficulty establishing the zone and cycling the puck.
BIEGA BREAKS THROUGH
At the beginning of the season, few ECAC prognosticators would have guessed that Danny Biega would have to wait until the first round of the Beanpot for his first goal of the season.
Last year, the Crimson captain finished with 10 goals and 35 points to finish second among all NCAA defensemen in scoring. Biega entered Monday with zero goals and six assists.
“I think he’s really been an outstanding player for us,” Donato said of Biega. “[He] hasn’t really got rewarded, has had a bunch of posts that he’s hit and a bunch of opportunities. But he’s a guy we’re going to need to be a big-time player for us if we’re going to have some success down the stretch.”
The senior’s third period strike was a classic Biega goal. The captain received a tape-to-tape pass from defensive pair Danny Fick and teed-up a slapper from the point that whistled past reigning NCAA tournament MVP Parker Milner.
An offensive resurgence from Biega could serve as a catalyst for another late-season push. The past two Harvard squads have posted a combined 10-2-2 record between the Beanpot consolation game and the ECAC playoffs after a difficult middle of the season.
“The Beanpot consolation game is never a fun game to play in as far as losing in the first round is concerned,” Donato said. “But it can be a little bit of a springboard for the stretch run.”

Something any shopping trip can teach you is that one size does not fit all. That amazing top your friend was raving about can leave you feeling like you've made a major faux pas. And of course, there's always the worry that the ahead-of-the-curve discovery that fits you perfectly this semester will be discovered by the world and their linkmate the next. Shopping, whichever way you look at it, can be stressful.
Sometimes you go window-shopping and immediately find something you just have to have. Occasionally, that gem you've been coveting online turns out to look just as good in person.  But all too often, the cute little number that seemed like such a good idea during the buzz of your shopping trip turns out to be the academic equivalent of sporting socks and Crocs (or honestly, just Crocs alone).
We've all been there, and even Harvard understands that sometimes it takes you more than the short five days of shopping week to find an ensemble you can rock all semester.
So when you realize that you'll have to skip lunch the next few months if you want to keep your purchase, remember the add/drop form, the world's best return policy. Flyby is here to remind you: fret not if your shopping trip takes a little longer than expected. Keep searching for that perfect fit (at least until you lose the receipt for your textbooks, or until that return policy expires on February 25th). And never settle for Crocs.
