After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a season finale—particularly of a season that went to unprecedented emotional depths for “Broad City”—“Jews on a Plane” is surprisingly childish. Abbi and Ilana’s plane flight feels not like a real adult experience but the somewhat uncanny imaginings of someone who has never flown (possibly appropriate, as Ilana says she has never been out of the country). A dog sits on a seat in first class; snack boxes cost $38 and contain almost nothing; random seats get upgraded to first class mid-flight. After Ilana’s affecting breakup with Lincoln, the episode feels almost too light. At the same time, Abbi and Ilana’s antics on the plane are funny, and the episode’s tone lets the viewer know that there will be no real consequences for the pair’s actions.
Without its levity, the episode might have been very grave indeed. At the end of the episode, Abbi and Ilana are interrogated in Israel on suspicion of terrorism after two flight attendants misinterpret the pair’s quest to find Abbi a tampon. During the interrogation, Abbi finds out that the man apparently sleeping between her and Ilana for the entire flight was actually dead—and the viewer learns that Ilana knew the whole time. The joke is executed perfectly: Ilana’s doublespeak throughout the episode hits the right note of cheesiness, and in the absence of the morbidity precluded by the episode’s style, the situation is pretty funny. “I am loving your comfort despite the circumstances!” gushes Ilana when Abbi moves the dead man’s tablet to use his tray table.
At some points, however, Glazer and Jacobson successfully use a much more direct approach. A highlight of the episode is a frank conversation between Abbi and Ilana about the unpleasantness of periods. Menstruation is finally, finally becoming an acceptable topic of discussion, but Glazer and Jacobson go much farther than most other comedians and writers have when they have Ilana and Abbi describe the first day of their periods. “It’s like a side of chutney,” Ilana says, to which Abbi retorts, “It’s like fruit on the bottom.”  In an episode that feels like something of a fever dream, Glazer and Jacobson’s insistence on illuminating the less glamorous aspects of the lives of young adult women is even more refreshing than normal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to fear, whenever I explained “The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane” aloud, that its children’s book premise sounded trite. I hesitated when asked my favorite book, wanting to say something by Chekhov or Orwell, wondering whether I couldn’t find something grander to manifest my views on love. But I’ve realized that the power of the little tome lies in the skill and honesty with which Kate DiCamillo uses its genre to deliver insights in their purest, most urgent form rather than restrict the range and intensity of emotions. It’s a book about a china rabbit who gets lost and goes on a journey, but it’s also a book about love as pain and redemption. It’s a book about—and an inquiry into the heart of—each and every one of its readers.
Edward Tulane is a china rabbit given to Abilene Tulane by her grandmother Pellegrina. He wears custom-made clothing, has bendable joints, and even sits at the family dining table. He is also vain, self-absorbed, and entirely indifferent to Abilene’s unconditional love. During a family cruise to London, a couple of boys steal Edward and accidentally pitch him overboard. From the depths of the ocean, Edward journeys into the home of an old fisherman, Lawrence, who scoops him from the water; on the back of a railcar-hopping hobo, Bull, and his dog Lucy; and to the bedsides of Sarah Ruth and Bryce, impoverished young siblings with an alcoholic father.
Misfortunes tear Edward from each home, but he picks up a bit of each person and leaves a piece of himself at every stop. He learns that Lawrence and his wife Nellie lost a son to pneumonia. He serves as confidante to Bull’s friends, listening as they whisper the names of their left-behind loved ones. He watches from Sarah Ruth’s arms as she dies. He dances as a marionette in Memphis, where Bryce tries to scrape together money as a street performer. When Bryce cannot pay for a meal, the angry restaurant owner smashes Edward to pieces, and the rabbit reawakens to find that Bryce has managed to get him repaired at a high-end doll shop—at the cost of relinquishing Edward to the doll mender. By the time Edward makes it to the doll shop, he has lost Abilene and Lawrence and Nellie and Bull and Lucy and Sarah Ruth and Bryce. He has had his body literally shattered and repaired on account of those he loves. “I’m done with being loved…. I’m done with loving. It’s too painful,” he thinks. But the rabbit continues to let people into his heart—continues to love and lose, love and lose—until one day, Abilene finds him again and brings him home.
The book feels like the condensation of the kind of art that has haunted and influenced me throughout the years: art premised on the acknowledgment that there is everything to lose and that we must put ourselves in a position to lose it all, again and again and again. I love Scarlett O’Hara in “Gone With the Wind,” singlemindedly taking on the ruins of the postwar South and sacrificing reputation, health, and peace of mind in order to restore her family land. I cheer on Riggan Thomson’s borderline suicidal desire for his play to succeed in “Birdman.” Even the non-narrative pieces I enjoy most echo this: the unrelenting, heart-baring torment of Shostakovich’s String Quartet No. 8; or Gainsborough’s impeccable portraits, thousands of brushstrokes tautly and painstakingly controlled, their effort almost unbearable to consider.
“The kind of love I’m talking about, you don’t try and kill someone,” insists Edward Norton’s character in “Birdman,” quoting Raymond Carver’s short story “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love”—but the movie makes very clear that the kind of love that matters is the the kind of love where you just might, or even should, kill someone. I don’t think such statements stay with me because they accurately reflect how I live, but rather because they challenge how I live. They remind me to be honest about how much I’m really putting at stake for the things I care about; to keep my eye on the intensity and courage of love I admire in others; and to strive toward that same intensity and courage in myself. They remind me that despite how much we value dignity and pride, especially at a place like Harvard, there is something vitally humanizing about allowing oneself to be undignified, ugly, and desperate in love, like Riggan Thomson waddling through a sold-out Broadway house in his tighty-whities or Scarlett O’Hara making a dress out of her curtains so she can seduce Rhett Butler into giving her money for Tara’s restoration. Even in the face of imminent and devastating loss, these characters forge ahead in their pursuits in a way that we may often think of as bullheaded or downright foolish but cannot help but root for and aspire to anyway.
Without that determination, all the pride and self-worth in the world props up a mere china shell. “If you have no intention of loving or being loved, then the whole journey is pointless,” another doll berates Edward. “You might as well leap from this shelf right now and let yourself shatter into a million pieces. Get it over with. Get it all over with right now.”
In the vast forest of great literature about the nuances of the human condition and the purpose of life, “The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane” will always be my unobscured beacon. Among all the confounding life philosophies and myopic goals I could lose myself in, it’s comforting to remember that my aspirations can be explained by something so unassuming as the meanderings of a china rabbit: Feel love for which you lose and pay and suffer. Feel love that strikes you as difficult and fraught. Love until it breaks you. Then love until someday, it finally puts you back together.

Last week, an image of Prince photoshopped onto a $20 bill went viral. But the image’s creator, Graduate School of Design Ph.D. student Brett Culbert, never got his fifteen minutes of fame.
After Culbert and his friend decided to post the image on Reddit with the title “party like it’s $19.99”—mixing one of Prince’s most popular songs, “1999,” with the news that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 dollar bill—the photoshopped image spread like wildfire.
On Twitter, one user’s post including the image amassed over 5,000 retweets. Everyone from random users to journalists reposted the image.
Then came the celebrities. Questlove, a performer in The Roots, and comedians Margaret Cho and Amy Sedaris posted the image to their Instagrams without attributing the work to Culbert.
Culbert tried to reach out to some of the celebs so he could alert them to the fact that he was the creator, but he didn’t know how to contact them. His only option was to comment on their feeds, an effort that was quickly drowned out by loads of other comments.
Culbert, a History of Art and Architecture student, said he is against putting watermarks on his creations. He doesn’t see the image as a work of art or as something that is “necessarily original,” given that he photoshopped the bill from two other publicly available images.
“I really like the internet because it’s this free space,” Culbert said.
Culbert came up with the idea and created the image this past Friday. “He had such amazing hair, and Andrew Jackson had amazing hair, and I just kind of merged those two things,” Culbert said. “I was just messing around.”
He then woke up the following morning to the news that his image was all over the place. Culbert is still amazed by how quickly it spread, and by how viral memes can transcend generations.
“Some of my friends were like, ‘Oh my mom just posted that on Facebook!’” he said.
