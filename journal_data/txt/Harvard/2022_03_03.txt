After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January, 24-year-old director Cooper Raiff told The Hollywood Reporter that his second feature film “Cha Cha Real Smooth” was inspired by his idea to tell a coming-of-age story about “a 12-year-old, a 22-year-old and a 32-year-old.” The romantic comedy, which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 23, follows Andrew, the 22-year-old at the center of this trio, who moves back home with his family in New Jersey after graduating from Tulane. Played by Raiff himself, Andrew is a sweet but directionless young man who finds himself working at a mall food court and moonlighting as a bar mitzvah party starter. The 12-year-old and 32-year-old in his life are his little brother David (Evan Assante), with whom he shares a bedroom, and Domino (Dakota Johnson), a local mother. In portraying these parallel coming-of-age stories, Raiff assuages the fears of anyone in his audience, young or old, who feels they aren’t quite sure of their place in the world. “Cha Cha Real Smooth” pulses with a steadily thrumming heartbeat as it honestly and sensitively charts the bittersweet confusion of growing up.
“Cha Cha Real Smooth” features a myriad of moments that reflect the uncertainty of post-grad life with both humor and poignancy. In one instance, Andrew tells his college girlfriend Maya (Amara Pedroso Saquel), who’s heading to Barcelona on a Fulbright scholarship, that he’s going to start working for a “really great” nonprofit after graduation. The scene then immediately cuts to him working at a joint called Meat Sticks, asking a customer if he’d like chili directly on his hot dog or on the side. Raiff brings to life the increasingly likable Andrew with playful humor and a genuine openness. The director may have even written an unrealistically altruistic protagonist, who is more often than not kind to a fault. Nevertheless, Andrew is both disarming and endearing in his somewhat obvious “good guy" characterization.
When Andrew accompanies his brother to a bat mitzvah and coaxes people to join him on the dance floor, he falls into a job he definitely didn’t apply for: the designated party starter at subsequent bar and bat mitzvahs in town. With this amusing premise, the narrative responds lightheartedly and realistically to Andrew’s post-grad stagnation. When he asks his high school friend Macy (Odeya Rush) if she thinks this new gig is silly, she shrewdly responds, “On one hand it is silly, but on the other hand so is every job. Selling your time’s insane.” With smartly written dialogue, “Cha Cha Real Smooth” confronts the reality of entering the often unforgiving capitalist job market with an acerbic, discerning eye.
As Andrew works more parties, he gets to know Domino, portrayed with a subdued wit and wary guardedness by Johnson. Quickly forming a connection with her and her daughter Lola (Vanessa Burghardt), his relationship with both of them grows into a touching exploration of unexpected kinship. Domino hires Andrew to look after Lola, who has autism, when she’s busy, and he and Lola form a special bond of their own as she slowly lets him into her world. Complicating this is the predictable development of Andrew’s feelings for Domino, who is complex and messy yet sympathetic thanks to Johnson’s nuanced performance. Unlike most romantic comedies, their connection is infused with a realism that is at times heartwarming and at times heartbreaking.
“Cha Cha Real Smooth” succeeds in hitting all of its emotional beats, whether lighthearted or serious. A bar mitzvah brawl amongst kids and parents alike unfolds as the titular song “Cha Cha Slide” hilariously plays in the background. A tender moment where Andrew tells his mother (Leslie Mann) he looks back on his childhood with fondness evokes a warm nostalgia that might prompt some viewers to call their parents. As Andrew moves through new relationships and experiences, stumbling and growing along the way, “Cha Cha Real Smooth” is perhaps best described as a film about the inevitability of change. While grappling with the shifting plates of his rapidly transitioning life, he comes to understand that some relationships are beautiful but fleeting. However, as his mother wisely reminds him when he laments this, “Your memories aren’t going anywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bradley Rust Gray’s drama “blood” aligns with meditative films like “Before Sunrise” and “Nomadland” — those that focus more on style or character than developing the rise and fall of a typical plot. “blood,” which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, centers on Chloe (Carla Juri), a photographer who travels to Japan for work following the death of her husband and spends time with an old friend of theirs, Toshi (Takashi Ueno). “blood” might be dissatisfying for those who expect a well-paced film with substantial action guiding a sweeping story arc. Rather, the film is attuned to the small details that make up a life, thoughtfully following Chloe and Toshi around Japan through the observational gaze of long, fixed takes. With its simple, wandering narrative that doesn’t seem to have a particular goal in mind, “blood” is often disappointingly slow moving. However, there is still beauty to be found in its celebration of quiet moments of connection and healing.
Chloe arrives in Japan with a camera and a barely repressed grief that lingers beneath the surface. In sporadic flashbacks that possess a dreamlike quality, we see memories of her and her husband Peter (Gustaf Skarsgård) before his death — skiing, cooking, resting quietly by a waterfall. These glimpses into her life with Peter add a much needed layer of insight to the narrative. But while a refreshing diversion from her experiences in Japan, these flashbacks are few and far between, ultimately feeling like fleeting glimpses into a static backstory rather than providing substantial depth to her character. Chloe, while portrayed with a quiet strength by Carla Juri, is ultimately an enigmatic protagonist. While not entirely inaccessible thanks to Juri’s expressive acting — marked by the occasional silent tear or wordless, pensive stare — the lack of dialogue dedicated to actually discussing her grief is a disservice to the story’s attempted commentary on how we cope with loss.
“blood” is an aesthetic triumph in its portrayal of Japan. The country pulses with life, a character in and of itself. The camera will often stay in a fixed location as Chloe and Toshi meander towards it, cars and passerbys sometimes obscuring them and taking center stage. Indeed, with its limited use of dynamic camera movements, “blood” positions its audience as objective observers of Chloe, who just happened to be allowed this little window into her life. The film lingers on ordinary interactions and experiences: playing with Toshi’s daughter (Futaba Okazaki), attending a dance class, walking lazily around a city. Chloe specializes in taking photographs of people across different professions, including a lobster fisherman and a Kintsugi artist. None of these interactions build to anything exciting, but they are nevertheless contemplative portraits of everyday life.
As Chloe spends time with Toshi, neither of whom are fluent in the other’s native language, it becomes self-evident that they don’t necessarily need spoken language to communicate. Though she grieves Peter, Chloe has an undeniable chemistry with Toshi. They share knowing looks, sleep on each other’s shoulders, and fall into complementary rhythms. The romantic feelings that develop between them for the most part remain unspoken, complicating their easy relationship. However, yet again the reliance on unspoken communication is perhaps detrimental to understanding Chloe and the nuances of her relationships. Though much of their dynamic can be recognized implicitly, some more substantive dialogue would’ve deepened their connection. Takashi Ueno is nevertheless a charismatic costar as Toshi, with his endearingly unkempt hair and soft, probing facial expressions complementing Juri’s performance.
“blood” blends together vignettes from Chloe’s trip into a languid snapshot of her life that perhaps leaves us only slightly more keen to her interiority than we were at the beginning. The story is in no hurry to get anywhere, and there isn’t a remarkable emotional arc for any of the characters. “blood” won the award at Sundance for Uncompromising Artistic Vision — a recognition it certainly lives up to as it refuses to yield to genre or audience expectations. It is certainly commendable for adhering to its distinctive storytelling style; it’s just that this style isn’t in service of a powerful enough narrative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In eighth grade, I was a proud alt kid. My style at the time was defined by the fact that I wore black almost every day. I was never able to shop at Hot Topic, or collect pop punk band tees, or wear thick black eyeliner, but black clothes were my accessible connection to the abstract subcultural style to which I aspired. At age 14, I wasn’t knowledgeable about the deep histories of the emo, scene, goth, and punk subcultures I admired, but I knew that the aesthetics they embodied were associated with unapologetic individuality, freedom, and queerness. Sadly, my adolescent alternative moment was just a phase, but the intentionality of style that is inherent to subcultural aesthetics still influences what I wear today.
My freshman fall, I took a course on subcultures, and it had a profound impact on the way I think about the relationships between style, identity, and community. According to Ross Haenfler, a preeminent scholar of social deviance and the author of Subcultures: The Basics, a subculture is “a relatively diffuse social network having a shared identity, distinctive meanings around certain ideas, practices, and objects, and a sense of marginalization from or resistance to a perceived ‘conventional’ society.” There are an endless number of different subcultures, including punks, dandies, New York City bike messengers, and more. Often, attraction to subcultures is a result of other forms of social deviance or marginalization, as communities form out of a shared experience of exclusion from the mainstream. For Black and queer people, subcultural identification and its accompanying alternative aesthetics can be a means of finding agency and community when society-at-large makes it difficult to do so.
Harvard, as an institution, is rooted in histories of white supremacy and classism. Marginalized people here have had to find ways to create space and visibility for themselves, and some have done so through alternative styles and/or subcultural identities. For this column, I interviewed three Black, queer people who define their style as alternative. Here’s what they had to say.
Halle (they/she, ’24) is an ultra high-femme, alternative, pastel goth, pink-centered, y2k, colorfully sexy fairy/supernatural being/Bratz doll/cartoon character. They don’t identify with a particular subculture, but alternative aesthetics have given them a way to create their own character and to find communities that reflect their interests and identities. Coming to college gave them the opportunity to craft a new wardrobe—one full of clothes that a hot cartoon would wear.
Jaida (any pronouns, ’24) is an urban queer background character in an 80s movie about dancing. Embracing Black alternative aesthetics has allowed them to  find confidence and creativity through their style. However, formal events at Harvard can be daunting for Jaida, because they don’t like traditional formal menswear. This is partially due to an aversion to masculinity, and partially because “the fits just don’t hit like men think they do.” They’ve considered womenswear as an alternative, but that, to them, feels equally incorrect. Now, their style at formal events leans slightly towards the religious side, but they hope to see changes in the gendered stylistic expectations at Harvard’s formal events in the future.
Treasure (she/they, ’22) is a sophisticated and playful sculptor of her own thrifted, vintage, colorblocked style. She’s drawn to 70s and 80s style because she loves funk and soul music, and because of her mother’s influence on her wardrobe. High school Treasure had a shaved head, and she was drawn to oversized graphic tees, cargos, sweats, and sneakers. Embracing masculinity allowed her to create distance from the hegemonic white femininity she saw from the girls at her high school, but as her style has developed, she’s found new ways to display femininity in her presentation through Y2K aesthetics. Y2K fashion is similarly vibrant to 70s fashion, but it incorporates more metallics, cut-outs, and flares. Plus, it’s sexy. Now, Treasure’s style embodies “the feeling of a sweaty night out in the city adorned with fur, heels, mini skirts, mesh tops, and photo-shoot ready hair and makeup.” She likes to feel like a rockstar.
Each of the people profiled above used black in their wardrobe in different ways. Halle’s style is very pink-centric, but most of their clothes are still black, because, as they say, “black has an edge/punch that the other colors just don’t have the same way, and you can feel it even when black is styled with other stuff.” For Jaida, wearing black is about sleekness and comfort, and about the convenience of not having to color-coordinate their outfits. Treasure sees black as the epitome of sophistication. She wears it to convey a sense of seriousness, to elevate her sex appeal, or to draw attention to her face, hair, or a colorful statement piece.
I have so much admiration for the beauty, glamor, and uniqueness of the three people above. Their clothing choices reflect an admirable degree of authenticity and confidence that my eighth grade self could only hope to embody.

I see the bones of my hand moving under my skin like waves under a frozen lake. My metacarpals glide with intention, wanting to do more, more, more. I think about the vessels and veins that carry my blood, and I consider if that blood is completely mine. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down through maternal inheritance; I received my mDNA from my mother, who inherited hers from her mother (my grandmother), who inherited hers from her mother (my great-grandmother). I think about this a lot: the chain of women whom I’m related to, who have passed down this mDNA to me.
I will never learn the names of all the women I’m related to; they will never know that I exist. We are destined to share only genetic history — not hobbies, memories, or time spent together. Still, I wonder: Would they like me?
Just how much of them is in me? When I look at myself in the mirror, am I actually looking at pieces of them? Is there a pastiche of features from women whom I don’t recognize within my own face?
History has not been kind to women. When I think about the past that my female ancestors lived during, I wonder how they were able to summon the persistence and bravery to live through difficult times. As someone currently living through a pandemic and political turbulence, I have realized that living through history is primarily just challenging. We often think that history is abstract, something that happens to other people — other generations — until we find ourselves amidst new events that make us scared for the future. How were my female ancestors able to quell their fears enough to strive in the face of an uncertain future? How were they able to keep going despite not fully knowing what the future might hold for women, for their granddaughters? Women today have more rights than women in previous generations, but there was no guarantee for the women of my past that this would eventually be the case.
Yet, they kept persisting. In the face of a world that did not care for them, did not extend support or sympathy or grace to them, did not effectively compensate them for labor (inside or outside the home), they kept moving forward. How brave did they have to be to look an uncertain future and hostile world in the eyes and declare that it wouldn’t break them? How titanium must their spines have been to decide that their granddaughters should have better lives than them? How drivenly optimistic did they have to be to protest, advocate, and fight for the rights of women who would come after them?
As I walk around campus, I’m frequently reminded of the history of this place, of Radcliffe College and the women who studied there. I’m a Harvard student, but my place here belies the collective ongoing struggle of women who seek higher education, particularly women of color.
I benefit from the sacrifices of nameless women. I have been told that I can be anything I want and do whatever I want to do. I can move through life with relative ease compared to women of the past — especially those disproportionately impacted by cruelty for being women of color, poor, or both. This freedom was not afforded to them. But I have it, and with it, I must continue the tradition of persistence.
How do you make sure the sacrifices of women who came before aren’t in vain? Tangibly support women now. That means decreasing the maternal mortality rate, protecting our trans sisters, ensuring that sex workers are not unfairly criminalized, increasing access to childcare, safeguarding the rights of BGLTQ women, actively practicing intersectionality, closing the racial and gender pay gaps, eliminating racial and gender bias in medicine, protecting voting rights, ensuring women can make their own healthcare decisions, and supporting women of color entrepeneurs, among so many other actions we can take to ensure women now and in the future can live better lives.
You care about women? Show up for them. Make space for them. Believe and protect them when they’re hurt by systems you’re part of.
I want my future daughters’ and granddaughters’ lives to be significantly better than mine; I want them to accomplish more than I ever will. I want them to know that all the women who came before them cared deeply for their ability to lead long, joy-filled lives. I’m sure that the long chain of my female ancestors would have wanted the exact same thing for me.
I’m thankful to my mDNA for connecting me through time with so many persistent, steel-willed women. I’m especially grateful for the women themselves, striving amidst darkness so that I — and all the women who will come after me — can have only light.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universal pre-school is coming to Cambridge. In an afternoon meeting on Feb. 14, Cambridge City Councilors in conjunction with the Cambridge School Committee discussed the plan to increase accessibility, affordability, and quality of childhood education for all. The goal – as outlined by Lisa Grant, the director of Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership and Ellen M. Semonoff, the assistant city manager – is to successfully implement universal pre-K by 2026.
Specific implementation details aside, the debate over universal pre-K’s value is no-brainer: We are, as usual, supportive of any initiative that increases the quality or accessibility of education. Learning has profound, intrinsic value; promoting knowledge and it’s pursuit is inherently good, for almost any age group. That’s only more true for universal education programs and other policies likely to have a positive impact on wealth redistribution. Cambridge’s embrace of universal pre-school is a massive win for the city, no caveats.
Well, maybe just one: Cambridge’s victory is emblematic of America’s loss.
In early 2021, President Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress and proudly touted his American Families Plan. The plan, part of president’s broader Build Back Better framework, would have offered Americans — not just Cantabrigians — two years of universal, high quality preschool, expanding access to free pre-k for over six million children and arguably revolutionizing the American education system.
It was too good to be true.
Barely 10 months later, Biden has changed tune. With large chunks of his domestic agenda fatally stalled, the president’s first State of the Union address featured a single, brief reference to universal education programs, reflecting an uglier political reality. Two stubborn centrist senators and later, the momentum for reform is gone; the window to act seems tight shut. Like with the tolerated expiration the child tax credit — and the subsequent, predictable increase in childhood poverty — our political institutions failed to secure the best for their youngest citizens.
Cambridge’s push for pre-K is thus no doubt laudable — but it’s also only significant against the backdrop of this federal defeat, only notable because of its absence elsewhere.
This regrettable national context also risks creating a self-perpetuating, vicious dynamic. As we lose or fail to increase programs at the federal level, only a very specific subset of localities are likely to even consider reproducing them in a smaller scale — places like the “rich, brainy” Cambridge, with its average household income roughly $30,000 above the national average and heavy blue tint. Wealthier tax bases will enjoy better funded educational programs, everyone else will struggle. That trend is already obvious: Pre-K quality and access varies broadly across the country, with places like Washinton D.C. spending over seven times as much on pre-K per child as states like Mississippi.
That doesn’t mean that Cambridge should not, in fact, aggressively pursue the kind of ambitious social programs that the U.S. writ large badly needs. Good policy is good policy, and local programs can be a blueprint for national equivalents. But make no mistake — our city council’s success is congress’ failing. America lost a chance to radically improve access to education, local victories aside.

“And then they steal this amazing ship called the Waistgold. All along its gunnels there are filigrees of pounded gold, and the ship’s wheel is encrusted in gems,” begins Odds M. Bodkin. “The pirate doesn’t know it yet, but this is a magical, very powerful ship.”
Bodkin’s enchanting voice, musical prowess, and larger-than-life persona have earned him an illustrious career as a master storyteller of 40 years, performing adaptations of ancient poems all over the world as well as writing original works. His travels now beckon him back to Harvard Square to perform at Grendel’s Den, a tavern-style restaurant and bar.
Storytelling wasn’t always his path. As a young man in New York City, Bodkin dabbled in various odd jobs — immersing himself in artistry and working as a freelance science educator for K-12 students on the side. But it always seemed like children were more captivated by his on-the-fly stories than by the scientific lessons he was giving.
“I just said, ‘gee wiz, you know, I think I’m going to become a storyteller.’ And I’d never heard of one. I thought I was the only storyteller on planet earth at that point,” he laughs.
Armed with only tenacity and a jovial outlook, Bodkin made his debut in the creative field.
“I just hung out my shingle and said, ‘I’m Odds Bodkin. I’m a teller of tales. Hire me.’ And lo and behold, people began to do it,” he says.
And so began his ascension to international storytelling prominence. He contorts his deep, rich voice into about ten distinct character impressions per story. He is a versatile performer, his shows ranging from “Golden Rule,” which teaches elementary schoolers about empathy, to rock-and-roll renditions of the “Three Little Pigs” for kids, to sexy tales of swashbuckling pirate exploits — for adults only.
“They’re filled with character voices and vocal sound effects, and they have a full ongoing musical score on either twelve-string guitar or celtic harp,” he says of his adult tales. He also incorporates musical elements into his stories for children, breaking out his six-string guitar for the “Three Little Pigs.”
Bodkin says his storytelling, which has no accompanying visuals and relies solely on sound, still transports his audience. “People just become mesmerized. They become lost and delighted,” he says. “I almost disappear and they’re just watching their inner visions as they listen to these tales.”
He has traveled the world, performed at venues from the White House to the National Storytelling Festival, and published an impressive array of storybooks.
Bodkin’s return to Grendel’s Den continues a relationship that began with his first performance there six years ago. A coincidental link between the name of the restaurant and one of Bodkin’s poetic adaptations sparked the connection. The restaurant is named after the monster Grendel in the story of “Beowulf,” an epic poem Bodkin was planning to perform in 2016. When Grendel’s Den owner Kari Kuelzer learned of his plans, she had an epiphany. “We have to have this premiere at Grendel’s,” she recalls thinking at the time.
This was the first of many performances for Bodkin at Grendel’s Den, which brings him back every year to perform “Beowulf” and other tales. “People are just completely charmed by this unique sort of unicorn performance,” Kuelzer says. “You’ll never see anything like him.”
Bodkin’s ancient form of storytelling complements the atmosphere of the eatery. “I can’t think of a better place for a bard than Grendel’s Den, with its bricks and its old-school European vibe,” Kuelzer says. For each story Bodkin performs, she also crafts a themed menu relevant to the tale.
While Bodkin’s upcoming performances at Grendel’s recount traditional myths, his first performance in this series was a previously unreleased original titled “Voyage of the Waistgold.” Kuelzer calls it “a little bit of a departure from his usual format.” “This is a pirate tale, a tale of adventure on the high seas that is told in an ancient sort of dialect of mariner speak” without music, he says. The format of this poem also differs from his usual storytelling style, as he focuses solely on the language of his manuscript without any musical component or improvisation.
The concept of this poem has been floating in his mind since his twenties. “It’s a wild, wild story filled with cool high fantasy elements,” Bodkin says.
The poem begins when its pirate protagonist steals an enchanted ship and heads off to defeat a beast. “And so he’s on his way to do this when Queen Ood shows up,” Bodkin says. “And she’s young and she’s beautiful, and she wants her boat back.” And from there, the tale takes off.

On Saturday, Feb. 19, fierce, widespread backlash spread against a Harvard Law Review Twitter post promoting a new article.
“Free and fair presidential elections are a cornerstone of American democracy, but are they required by the Constitution?” the post reads. “This Note says no, arguing for state discretion to regulate how, and whether, presidential elections occur.”
The article, entitled “As the Legislature Has Prescribed: Removing Presidential Elections from the Anderson-Burdick Framework,” was first published nine days earlier and didn’t gain much traction until the Harvard Law Review publicized it with this tweet.
The post elicited confusion, ire, and disbelief from prominent historians, pundits, activists, and professors, who wondered how such a bold claim was allowed to be published anonymously in a renowned legal journal. U.S. Senator Brian E. Schatz (D-Hawaii) quote tweeted the article with an ominous warning: “The road to autocracy is paved by fancy lawyers.”
The note featured a legal examination of the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, an esoteric legal theory derived from precedents set in two elections related cases analyzing the power of the state’s interest in instituting electoral restrictions against infringements upon an individual’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
The author, Alexander J. Guerin, a recent Harvard Law School graduate, revealed his identity in an article published by Balls and Strikes, a legal commentary website. Guerin is a former editor of the Law Review and is currently serving as a clerk for Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry E. Smith, appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987.
The response to the piece shocked him, he says.
“I actually didn’t expect the note to be perceived at all,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Most Law Review student writing receives virtually zero engagement after it’s published, which is a shame because most of it is much better than mine.”
However, he sees the backlash not as a result of the note’s actual content, but instead to the tweet itself, which he intended to be facetious.
“I had proposed [the tweet] as a joke,” he wrote. “That was definitely a mistake on my part and I’m sorry for it.”
It was not his decision to have the note published unsigned, he says. The Law Review publishes every piece of student writing anonymously, but it requires named attribution for outside contributors — a policy that has been questioned by Twitter users and some HLS students who stress the importance of accountability in presenting arguments.
This isn’t the first time that papers from the Law Review have stoked controversy.
Less than a year prior, the Harvard Law Review published another controversial note concerning the 2020 court case United States v. Varner (now known as Kathrine Nicole Jett). In the case, Fifth Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, a Trump nominee who participated in anti-LGBTQ litigation prior to nomination, refused to recognize an incarcerated, transgender woman’s pronouns.
The author of the HLR note, however, praised the opinion as “consistent with the robust socially conservative jurisprudence that has won Judge Duncan scholarly acclaim.”
“If courts aim to avoid overreaching — if they refrain from trampling on objections, religious or otherwise, they will follow Varner’s lead and decline to compel the use of preferred pronouns,” the note concludes.
Law Review editors reportedly raised concerns about the note during the editing process. After it was published, backlash ensued, with many calling the note transphobic.
Editors of the Law Review enjoy a certain degree of freedom to express unpopular opinions. The Law Review does not explicitly tie its anonymous student note policy to editorial freedom, instead attributing it to “the fact that many members of the Review besides the author make a contribution to each published piece.” Still, it does allow for open expression without the threat of retaliation.
Priscila E. Coronado, president of the Harvard Law Review, did not respond to an interview request for this article.
The Harvard Law Review’s mandatory student anonymity policy is hardly standard. Peer publications nationwide — like the Yale Law Journal and the Stanford Law Review — name their student contributors.
But at Harvard, the idea of an open forum that allows for students to share their views with some degree of anonymity is a practice that extends to the rest of the Law School. The school’s Community Principle on Non-Attribution is based on the Chatham House Rule; when this rule is in place in meetings, forums, or classrooms, participants are allowed to use the ideas shared, but not to attribute them to the person who said them. The policy is designed to “bring an attitude of openness and experimentation to” student learning experiences, according to the Law School’s website.
In the legal profession more broadly, however, attribution is not only a common practice but an expected one. Judges must sign their opinions and lawyers must lay claim to their briefs, as attribution plays a central role in accountability for judicial arguments.
Harvard Law School student Rachel A. Cohen acknowledges that holding people accountable for opinions they held during their time in college further down the line may not always be reasonable. Despite this, she says, “if the opinion you’re espousing is anti-democracy, or it is anti-existence for an oppressed group, people have a right to know that you held that opinion at any point in your life.”
Cohen believes that Harvard Law students should be required to take ownership for their claims, given that many go on to hold prominent positions in the justice system.
“[The Harvard Law Review has] a responsibility to hold individuals accountable for what they are saying, because of the increased access that those individuals are provided with by nature of a Harvard Law School education,” she says.

“Have consulted w myself and a few others and decided that I need to increase my social media usage to improve my mental health 🌤🔔⛸.”
So reads the half-ironic bio of my newly revived finsta, username “katriarchy.” It is a sentence that feels unexpected to me: my relationship with social media has historically been tumultuous and stubborn, cyclic anger-deleting and re-downloading of Instagram a feature of my high school years. The self that I saw on my screen always felt false and incomplete, like a misrepresentation of my life was a given.
But for most of my freshman fall, I found myself in an almost dialogic back-and-forth with reality — a form of derealization I assumed to escape feelings of isolation from the people and environments around me. I wrote a paper, but I didn’t feel like the person who had written it. I sat at Annenberg laughing with friends, but I wasn’t quite sure what we were laughing at. It was as if when March 2020 rolled around, some force had pressed pause on my life, sliding a glass wall between me and the life I was supposed to be living. Every context that served as part of the glue that held me together was gone, left either back home in New York or in a pre-Covid time.
My New Year’s resolution was to try my best to stop taking everything so damn seriously: do more, think less, lower the stakes. I wanted to do whatever possible to get out of my own head — to reconnect with the humor and voice I felt like I had lost, to move through and inside of my life instead of adjacent to it.
A close friend (whose finsta, “lunchmeatflowercountryvirus,” is iconic in her circles) gave me an unorthodox suggestion to kickstart my quest: that I re-download Instagram and start my finsta anew. So I logged into my old account.
***
It was an unusual suggestion, because I often rant to my friends about how social media is one of the worst things in this world. A never-ending stream of articles explains correlations between the use of these apps and increased anxiety, depression, body image issues, and low self-esteem. Big tech companies, having realized they can exploit the dopamine released by likes and comments to turn a profit, literally capitalize off of human insecurity. I cannot say that I’ve ever fallen down the hole of Snapchat Discover or my Instagram feed and emerged happier than I started.
That doesn’t mean I didn’t fall prey to the apps in middle and high school, begging my parents to let me download Snapchat in eighth grade, posting curated Instagram photos at prom and on the beach. The capacity to feel connected to — seen by — such a wide range of people was dizzying and addictive, even as it remained fundamentally unsatisfying.
There is something about taking a picture that makes me feel furtive and uncomfortable, like I am cheating at what it means to remember. Picture-taking helps us shape our own narratives, slicing our lives into predetermined, frozen-time rectangles. So I am both jealous and skeptical of people who post with seeming carelessness, confused by how they can feel such ownership over their photos, and in a parallel way, over the identity being presented in those photos. There’s a dissonance, seeing someone you feel you know present themself online for the first time.
Then I have to remind myself that I have no idea, really, what is going on in their heads; feigned carelessness is too often the opposite. Maybe the point of Instagram is that we are all just supposed to fake it, do the very best we can to stake a claim to our existence in an inimitably chaotic and crowded world.
***
The first thing I did after reactivating my finsta on January 1 was to go through my camera roll and find 10 pictures I loved for every month in 2021. I posted each series of photos within the span of a half hour, accompanied by long stream-of-consciousness captions where I tried to articulate my relationship with that period of time. They’d go something like this:
“March ish — mentally I was an absolute f*cking mess here like I am remembering the context of some of these photos and the sadness / spirals / etc that surrounded them — but there is something else emerging here which is unexpected warmth. A lot of early March sun and a shot at the food pantry which of course is warm in a whole different way.”
“April ish — this time was far more exquisite than I like or remember to admit. We were on the horizon of something and even though I was stuck in all sorts of anxiety and difficulty adjusting between realities I also experienced a lot of joy and hope and gratitude and forward-looking-ness — so here is to that.”
I skipped September through December, memorializing college with a sole photo of Smith’s tenth floor at sunset instead. (In the late afternoon, when the sky is clear, it is a space so extraordinary it feels like an exception to the rest of my life.)
The aim of this exercise, I think, was to let 2021 catch up to me. If what the pandemic did for me was to forbid time from passing — to tell me that even as things changed around me, I did not have the permission to change along with them — then my posts changed me by force. They turned the experiences and memories that had been grayed over in my mind into snapshots of stark color.
The version of my year I laid out on my screen wasn’t a real representation of 2021, but it was the best thing I had to offer myself. It was a reminder that these past pandemic months had happened, no matter how easy it was to feel like they hadn’t. Part of the person who came through in those photos was fake: she smiled far more than I remembered smiling, and her face occupied strange angles, and her colors didn’t all segue together well. But another part of the person who came through in those photos was real. She was there, and I remember her, photos or no.
***
Finally, I let the real finsta-ing begin.
It didn’t take long for me to get a little power-drunk in my new online space. I posted photos of my unprecedented cooking endeavors (“💫the story here is that im breaking my mothers generational cycle of cooking hatred one 😮‍💨step 😮‍💨at a time 🥂”), the chaotic overstimulating hell that I believe to be grocery stores (spurring LOTS of debate in the comments section), and the extreme attractiveness I believe to be Jamie Tartt’s eyebrow slit (thank you, “Ted Lasso”).
I posted a video of my Brooklyn apartment’s roof in the rain and wrote about how endorphins make my muscles sing back and forth with the air. I wrote about how when I walked over a river frozen over with snow on the way back from club ultimate practice, I felt, physically, the winter breathing. I posted sunsets and subway graffiti I thought were beautiful and a picture of my sister in my great-grandmother’s 1930s yellow dress.
As I let my thoughts and the things that I saw fall onto the inarticulable canvas that is the internet, they became inked onto something both more temporary and more permanent than paper. If I could see what made me me laid out in blue-light color — existing entirely separately from my brain — then maybe I really was me. Maybe I could start reaching through the glass wall in front of my eyes to the real stuff behind.
I probably won’t stop railing against Instagram as a company. But using the app has helped me realize one thing: that it is a losing battle to try to pin yourself down. On my finsta, I’m probably the most unfiltered version of myself out there. My account still can’t get at everything about who I am — but in the in-between space it creates, I can try on different selves without obsessing about it.
I want to learn to accept this dissonance, these fractured realities I hold; I have an inkling they can teach me something about being unfinished. Not all the way whole, not all the way true, but a real person all the same.

Walking through The Garage during peak dining hours, you’ve probably caught sight of a college student sitting at a wooden table inside Lê’s Vietnamese Restaurant, slurping a bowl of Phở with intense focus. The scent of shaved onion and cilantro, tender beef slices covering a bed of white rice noodles like a crown, and clear, rich broth all combine to create the national dish that brings Vietnamese cuisine to global recognition.
However, to students of Viet origin like myself, Vietnamese food is beyond the Phở or bánh mì commonly offered at Vietnamese eateries around America. It is an amalgamation of many dishes, signifying the simplest things: community, love, and belonging.
Growing up, my family had countless gatherings at my parents’ home in Sài Gòn. My mom and aunts would spend several hours preparing all the dishes before everyone arrived — cá tai tượng chiên giòn (fried gourami), gỏi ngó sen tôm thịt (lotus salad with shrimp and pork), cơm gà luộc (herb-boiled chicken thighs with rice), mực nướng muối ớt (grilled dried squid dipped in chili sauce), and the occasional sweet and sour hotpot extravaganza. All of these dishes were served in large trays, which my family members would sit around and share together.
As a young girl and the eldest child in the family, I was the liaison between the busy kitchen and the lively living room, transporting steaming dishes to the dining table. I always had the best seat at the table, between the hosts of the party — my mom and dad — enjoying all the delicacies of Vietnamese cuisine. At the table, we were joined by family, friends, and sometimes friends of friends. We shared conversations about the dishes, released mental strains from daily work, and enjoyed each other’s company without fear of judgment or alienation.
In 2015, my family and I moved to California. Despite our changing lifestyle and new environment, we maintained our daily dinner gatherings, though now a smaller version. Large bowls of jasmine white rice, cá kho tộ (caramelized catfish in a clay pot), muống xào tỏi (sauteed garlic spinach), and canh chua (sweet and sour soup) still made their usual appearance on our large dinner tray.
Like many typical Vietnamese families, we don’t often say “I love you,” or even “I like you.” Instead, we express our affection through food. For us, love is the bún bò Huế (Huế beef noodle soup) my mom would spend the entire afternoon preparing for dinner, the bún thịt nướng chả giò (grilled meat vermicelli with spring rolls) my dad would buy for me and my brother before school, or the freshly-made pastries and frozen thịt kho trứng (caramelized pork and eggs) my family sent via one-day priority mail on my birthday or for Lunar New Year.
Now that I’m in college, where family is far, enjoying a handmade gỏi cuốn (fresh summer roll) dipped in the sweet, rich peanut sauce at Lê’s offers me great comfort and authentic tastes of home. I often converse with Ms. Lê, the restaurant manager, and other restaurant staff, to share updates from school and home. Eating at this small, cozy restaurant right around the corner of JFK Street is like having a home away from home.
Walking back to Kirkland after a draining lab day, particularly when HUDS is not at all appetizing, I find myself sitting at one of the dining tables at Lê’s five minutes later. Without looking at the menu, I order my usual gỏi cuốn (spring rolls), bún thịt nướng chả giò (grilled meat vermicelli), cá kho tộ (caramelized catfish in a clay pot), and canh chua (sweet and sour soup). Yes, even though I usually come to Lê’s by myself, I always order a feast.
***
For other Vietnamese students, the presence of the restaurant is also an indispensable part of their Harvard experience.
“Depend[ing] on how sad I am, Lê’s is gonna get good business from me,” Trâm N. Nguyễn ’22 says with a laugh. Nguyễn moved to the United States with her family at the age of 10, and when she went to college, her family meals were replaced by social gatherings at Lê’s with close friends, loved ones, and members of the Harvard Vietnamese Association.
Over the dinner table filled with Phở, cơm Tấm (Vietnamese broken rice served with grilled pork chop and fish cake), and hotpot, her friend group alleviates their daily school burdens and explores the different presentations, textures, and tastes of the dishes. “That’'s always my favorite part,” Nguyen exclaims, “showing my close friends an integral part of my life.”
Thương  Q. “Alexandria” Hồ ’24, a sophomore in Adams, expresses finding similar solace. “During my first year, if I [had] a bad day in class, I would just go to Lê’s, and 80 percent of the time, Phở would be my go-to. It is my comfort food.”
For Nguyễn, Hồ, and many other students, Vietnamese cuisine relieves stress, allows them to relive their childhood memories, and provides a sense of belonging and identity.
Although we are all far from home, we have found our own Viet family here at Harvard. Every now and then, my friends and I attend an HVA dinner social at Lê’s. Beneath the red lanterns and dim light of the restaurant, we sit around the large wooden table and chat our stress and homesickness away. The dinner table is filled with cơm Tấm, Phở, bún bò Huế, and bún thịt nướng chả giò.
We drink and eat in pure happiness and liberation. Within this haven, there is only food and company.

Emma E. Choi ’22 has had a whirlwind trajectory from an intern on the NPR podcast “Wait Wait...Don’t Tell Me!” to the host of their new, youth-oriented offshoot “Everyone & Their Mom.” She credits this success partly to her diligence and social media savvy, but most of all to the PowerPoints she meticulously constructed during the internship.
“I was doing a ton of unhinged guest PowerPoints which were like 25 percent about the guest, 75 percent about any other thing,” Choi laughs. In an attempt to liven up the podcast teams’ long Wednesday meetings, during her presentations Choi would make fun of her bosses, rank “all the guests we’ve had on by how much I wanted to kiss them on the mouth,” offer updates on her boyfriend, and share harrowing experiences such as her recent prolonged eye contact with a rat. “Apparently, no one’s done that before,” she adds between sips of chai. Choi’s team found her enthusiasm infectious — so when they began planning to expand to younger generations, they looked to their resident energetic young person for advice.
Even after reading the credits for the first discarded pilot and co-hosting a handful more unused pilots, Choi had no expectation that she’d become the host. In fact, she recounts that her supervising producer took her aside and told her candidly, “Emma, I don’t think we can hire you. You’re a college student. We’ve never done that before. We just want to see what it’s like.” But to her surprise, she landed the gig.
“It took a while to sink in. It still hasn’t really sunk in,” she says. “I bill 20 hours, but I think about it all the time, so I’m kind of always on the clock.” Each week for the past few months, Choi has written jokes about a story of her choice, interviewed a guest, attended daily meetings scheduled around her classes, and shot retakes. The final product is weekly 15-minute-long episodes airing each Wednesday that, as Choi describes, bounce “between sketch comedy and variety and stand up and interview format.” The first episode aired on February 23rd.
Before becoming host, Choi spent her early years at Harvard developing her comedic style and found a home in the improv group Immediate Gratification Players. She describes comedy at Harvard as if describing a family member — fondly, but critically.
Harvard’s comedy scene is “one of the most amazing creative communities on campus right now,” but also a “double-edged sword,” she says.
“It’s kind of cutthroat. People are always driving really hard because they’re so focused on doing the damn thing,” she says. “But at the same time, it means that people are really bought in and are really dedicated to making things.”
Beyond her comedy pursuits, Choi is equally dedicated to fiction writing. “It's interesting, because I do really stupid comedy, but I write like, very serious fiction,” she says. She wrote her first play in third grade and continued throughout her academic career, the subject matter ranging from a “school shooting nightmare play” to “one about two Jewish boys trying to be rappers.” She also founded a comedy magazine in her sophomore year of high school.
During the pandemic, she wrote a 400-page book spanning three generations of Korean women, “exploring how we carry folklore and trauma in our bloodlines.” She describes her working style as obsessive. “There was a month where I was writing for 14 hours a day, and just like, barfing it out. Yeah, it wasn’t good, but it happened,” Choi says. Her writing helped her process a difficult breakup as well as the intensity of early pandemic life.
Regardless of the type of writing, Choi finds inspiration in playing around with words. In the first episode of her show, she cracks a “banana-smashing” joke about the Marvin Gaye impersonator hired by a British zoo to serenade endangered Barbary macaque monkeys. “I like experimenting with language, using stuff you would never expect, just like jumbling shit up, which I think makes good comedy. Because word-based humor is never going to hurt anybody, you know?”
In the second episode, Choi discusses her grandmother’s inability to make kimchi, interviewing acclaimed chef Roy Choi to give her grandma some tips. She’s grateful that she can bring her family and her culture into the show — an aspect of her identity that she’s delved into as she’s taken more classes on Korean history and art at Harvard. “College is the first time where I became proud of being Korean, which is a lot of what the podcast is now,” she says. “It’s not necessarily trying to be Korean. It's just not backing away when that comes, you know, not trying to hide that in any way.”
Choi’s bold approach to comedy seeps into every aspect of the podcast. Her upbeat tidbits in each segment make her seem like the kind of friend you’d text immediately after embarrassing yourself in front of strangers, or when you’re deep into a long night of psetting and need a laugh. As for what she wants to make sure listeners take away from the podcast, she’s not quite sure. “I’ve spent a lot of hours hearing people talk about my brand, or my image, which is very strange,” she says. “I’m not going to be like, I hope people really understand me from the podcast, because of course they won’t, but I just want people to have a good time and laugh and be like, Oh, that was weird.” She adds: “I just want people to walk to class, have 15 minutes of pure fun and be like, I can’t wait for next week.”

Throughout high school, Jessica Lao ’23 was set on studying English. Her love of literature dates back to her childhood, when her mother would bring her books from the library: children’s versions of classics like “Pride and Prejudice.”
But when she began college, Lao started doubting whether she should follow this path.
“In the last 20 years or so, there’s been a push that we all need to go to college — it’s how you get social mobility, get a job,” she explains. “I think that with the mindset of ‘we have to go for practical reasons,’ it seems a little ludicrous for us all to go study something really obscure in the humanities and flip through archives. The reason why we all push each other to do finance, consulting clubs, CS and that sort of thing, and the reason we think it’s too ‘indulgent’ to study the humanities is probably because of this wider transformation.”
Indeed, Lao isn’t the only one who has felt these pressures to conform to more “practical” pursuits. In 2008, 236 Harvard students were concentrating in English. That number steadily declined over the next decade, and fell to 54 students in the 2019-20 academic cycle. Meanwhile, the number of Computer Science concentrators rose tremendously, from 86 students in 2008 to 180 in 2019, and it is currently the second most popular concentration at Harvard.
Lao’s story represents a symptom of a problem that has vexed universities in recent decades: the supposed downfall of the humanities, signaled by the decline of undergraduate humanities majors.
In the early 2010s, a wave of coverage detailing this “crisis” swept through American universities. Multiple colleges reported concern for their humanities departments as students’ interests switched over to the sciences, worrying that the humanities would lose necessary funding and that students would miss out on the essential critical thinking skills that are useful for work in all fields. At Harvard, a 2013 article in The Crimson stated that the College had seen a stark decline in humanities concentrators; according to the piece, the number of incoming freshmen who intended to pursue humanities concentrations had fallen 9 percentage points in the previous decade.
Since then, debate around the future of the humanities has died down, as the number of humanities concentrators has stabilized. According to collated data from previous surveys conducted by The Crimson, the number of freshmen intending to concentrate in the humanities has leveled off at around 10 percent of each Harvard class over the last decade.
But this proportion is much lower than it used to be. In the 2019-2020 academic cycle, 13.5 percent of students graduated with a degree in the arts and humanities. By contrast, in the 2010-2011 academic cycle, 21.1 percent of the total class pursued arts and humanities concentrations. This year, the Crimson freshman survey found that only 7.1 percent of the class of 2025 reported an anticipated concentration in the humanities, while 33 percent of the class intended to pursue the social sciences and 49.1 percent intended to pursue the sciences or engineering and applied sciences.
In a 2013 editorial, The Crimson correlated the decline of humanities concentrators to an increase in STEM concentrators, refusing to “rue a development that has advances in things like medicine, and environmental sustainability as its natural consequence.”
The vast disparity between the number of humanities concentrators and social science or STEM concentrators remains indicative of — and risks entrenching — a larger problem: a view of the humanities as notably separate from, and inferior to, these other fields.
“Why spend four years listening to lecturers warn you that you can never really know anything?” the Editorial Board wrote. “To those who are upset with the trend, we say: Let them eat code.”
Cultural perceptions of field divisions have siloed people into thinking of sciences and humanities fields as a zero-sum game, leading them to believe they need to “save” the humanities or that the humanities are “dead.”
This perceived binary between the sciences and the humanities continues to have real consequences: it can leave students feeling locked out of the fields they love. Lao, whose decision to concentrate in Economics was motivated by financial factors, tried to keep up her long standing interests by trying to join an arts organization. But after being rejected twice, she says she began to doubt her abilities to pursue the arts.
“In my mind, I realized that my parents are right; I’m better at being a corporate cog,” she says with a halfhearted laugh, fidgeting with the sleeves of her sweater. “Maybe I personally wasn’t strong enough to keep going on this path.”
Lao’s internal doubts stemmed from external pressures.
“Before I went to college, there were family friends and relatives of mine who kept making fun of my parents because they thought I was going to study English,” she says. “My parents both did [economics], and they were understandably anxious about me studying something with what they assumed to be very low job prospects.”
Lao’s anxieties only deepened when she saw many of her peers join pre-professional groups, she says. Ultimately, these factors swayed her to concentrate in Economics instead, consigning English to a secondary field.
Now a junior, Lao still grapples with conflicting feelings about her decision to pursue Economics. While she currently feels content with her field of study, she recalls reading her admissions file and feeling like she “scammed” the admissions officer, who seemed excited about Lao’s interests in literature and convinced that she would pursue it at Harvard.
Lao is not the only student who has had concerns over the lack of potential job prospects within humanities careers.
The 2008 financial crisis seems to have been a catalyst for this fear of the humanities in terms of financial security; the data for the decline of students pursuing humanities degrees and the rise of those in STEM over the past decade lines up with the crisis’s economic aftermath.
Yet, it turns out that the perception of the humanities as less employable post-graduation is overstated. In fact, the choice between pursuing a humanities or STEM major bears little indication on a person’s job prospects. A 2018 study by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences found that the unemployment rate among holders of a terminal bachelor’s degree in the humanities was 3.6 percent, while that of those with a terminal bachelor’s degree in engineering was 3.1 percent and, for those in the physical sciences, 3.4 percent. The differences are not as stark as fearful students make them out to be.
Still, when Justin G. Han ’24 entered college, he “very quickly got worried” that he wouldn’t be able to “find a career with only Classics.” Instead, his Classics and Applied Math joint concentration is a chance to pursue a humanities field that he loves alongside a field he believes could provide more post-graduate job security.
The belief that the humanities have less industrial value tends to put the humanities on the defensive. But often, this defense backs the humanities into a corner; in the current cultural trend that prioritizes and only values fields for their practicality, humanities scholars must justify their pursuits in terms of their material utility. Such rationalization for the humanities plays out in arguments that aren’t necessarily helpful or complete, such as the idea that the humanities are solely valuable within the realm of ethics. Tara K. Menon, an assistant professor in the English department, refutes this argument.
“Sometimes this debate plays out in terms of ‘Oh, the humanities make you a better person,’” Menon says, rebutting the idea that “you read a book and that makes you more sensitive or sympathetic to other people.”
Instead, she argues that the humanities are important because “they are tools for thinking with.”
According to Menon, global citizens should be “ready to engage with ideas and think better with them.” She continues, “I think that is not only a skill — I don't love the language of skills that is deployed and has been a consequence of STEM winning the battle of the university — but that this is an essential quality for being a human in the world.”
This “battle of the university” is something that Julie Heng ’24 has paid particular attention to. From an early age, Heng, a Crimson Editorial editor, was frustrated by the idea of the humanities- or STEM-oriented brain as innate.
“I can remember, for a really long time, questioning the specialization of fields, starting from probably middle and high school when people say that, ‘Oh, well, I’d rather do hours of math instead of an essay’ or vice versa,” she says.
As Heng describes, students often view their concentration choice as a de facto personality test — as something that reflects an inborn capability.
Even the differences between physical spaces on Harvard’s campus are representative of this perceived division. While humanities concentrators find repose in the Barker Center, with its red-brick walls and cozy classrooms, often decorated by art prints and bookshelves, STEM students have taken ownership of the recently-built $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex in Allston. The SEC commands attention, its sustainable design and angular exterior illustrating its aura of innovation and modernity. Cabot Science Library, located within the Science Center, captures the same aesthetic themes: sleek, bright, new. Meanwhile, Lamont Library houses the Woodberry Poetry Room and Farnsworth Room, low-light spaces filled with books and homey lounge chairs.
According to Joyce E. Chaplin, Professor of Early American History, the division of the fields primarily dates back to the 19th century — as knowledge in various fields deepened, one had to specialize in a particular discipline in order to claim expertise in it.
“To claim in the 16th century you understood mechanical philosophy, which we now regard as an ancestor of physics, is a different proposition from being able to do research in physics now and to claim a part of it in your area of specialization,” Chaplin explains. “We have a kind of investment in claiming that specialization is the way we understand the world, and that there is validity to this.” This specialization, she adds, can cut disciplines off from each other, making interdisciplinary collaboration difficult.
Exacerbating the issues with specialization, however, is a broader problem with the way society values different fields. When people feel pressured to choose between disciplines, they may opt for a field in the sciences due to the aforementioned anxiety about job prospects.
For Jane X. Chen ’12, the realization of this devaluation caused her to shift her career trajectory. Though Chen concentrated in History, she decided to enter the world of finance after graduation. Quickly feeling unfulfilled by her career — a field she says wasn’t “a true reflection of [her] values and what [she] wanted to contribute to society” — she spent time after hours volunteering as a writing tutor for immigrant students in Queens. For the seniors she helped with college essays, Chen realized that the problems with their writing couldn’t be immediately fixed; it was “way too late in the game,” and the issues should have been “dealt with 10 years prior,” she says.
In response, she quit her job in finance and founded the Eyre Writing Center to teach writing skills to elementary schoolers through her own curriculum. To her, the EWC is about “democratizing access to writing,” trying to combat what she sees as a lack of accessible resources in comparison to STEM fields.
“I think there are just a ton of STEM resources out there to get really passionate,” she says, emphasizing that it’s possible to teach STEM subjects in the format of video learning or online quizzes. By contrast, Chen believes that these resources do not adapt as well to something as “personal and high-touch as writing.”
Making the humanities more accessible is imperative for exploring its intersections with other fields. In an op-ed for The Crimson, Heng, who studies Integrative Biology with a secondary in Philosophy, describes a number of modern problems that require solutions which connect the sciences and humanities. At the end of her piece, she shifts focus to the way this issue can be addressed at Harvard in a space she calls a “Third Enlightenment Salon.” The name and concept reference 17th century salon gatherings — popularized in France throughout the Enlightenment era and giving way to the Scientific Revolution — where everyday citizens interested in philosophy and religion could freely discuss their ideas.
Heng writes: “According to Anthony Gottlieb’s ‘The Dream of Enlightenment,’ two Enlightenments — bursts of creativity — have fundamentally shaped Western philosophy: the First Enlightenment in the sixth century B.C. birthed the humanities; the Second in the 17th century grew the sciences.” She argues that society today needs a “Third Enlightenment to harmonize the two.”
Heng has brought that Third Enlightenment Salon to life, founding the Harvard Undergraduate Salon for the Sciences and Humanities along with Chinmay M. Deshpande ’24 and Henry N. Haimo ’24. This past Valentine’s Day, the Salon met for the first time in Memorial Hall 303 above Annenberg.
The Salon hopes to correct the hyper-specialization of fields by providing a space for interdisciplinary discussion. According to Haimo, the Salon’s goal is to “find people who are actively reaching across the academic aisle.”
“What are the unique values that the sciences and humanities bring?” Heng asks. “And how can we put them in conversation together to solve big questions?”
With its plain, cream-colored facade, 42 Kirkland St. looks like an ordinary triple-decker at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. On a regular stroll past the building, it’s easy to miss the three small windows perched along its rooftop, indicators of a fourth floor: the metaLAB.
Founded in January 2011 by Jeffrey T. Schnapp, a professor in the Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature departments, the metaLAB is a “do tank”— an experimental platform of artists, technologists, and scholars delving into novel ways of approaching technology with creative and critical lenses, merging and redefining scientific and artistic fields.
In his clear-framed glasses, neatly-trimmed goatee, and plain mauve sweatshirt, Schnapp lights up describing one of the metaLAB’s ongoing projects, the Future Stage: an initiative to revolutionize the performing arts.
Schnapp says he and his team drew inspiration for this project after watching performing artists turn to technology in order to continue their craft during the pandemic, such as through live streaming or TikTok videos. “How do we take those opportunities and really make them integral to forms of spectacle today, in ways that don't just treat live streaming as a backup?” he asks.
The Future Stage’s visions and principles can be summarized in its manifesto, which has garnered attention worldwide and been translated into eight languages. Written by almost 40 leading figures in the performing arts world, including dancers, technologists, and policymakers, the manifesto includes phrases like “performance as a human right,” “an expanded notion of liveness,” and “democratize and delocalize.”
Although some may conceptualize this type of work as digitizing the arts, Schnapp says he doesn’t view it that way. Rather, he argues, technology and science and the arts feed into each other — and always have fed into each other — to generate projects and ideas that help advance society overall.
“I don’t like the label ‘digital humanities’ because it suggests somehow that the ‘digital’ is doing the innovative work,” he says. “I think it comes on both sides of that formula, that we need to renew and reinvigorate our models of teaching, knowledge production — every aspect.”
Taking the Future Stage as an example, Schnapp explains that part of the project also involves finding ways to engage younger audiences in traditional art forms, like live opera. “It’s not about having screens all over the place,” he says.
The reluctance to erase boundaries between different disciplines, he argues, ultimately prevents academic institutions from addressing key issues, chief among them making knowledge accessible. And although artistic and humanistic fields cannot shoulder this burden alone, Schnapp acknowledges that they are uniquely suited to addressing these problems.
For example, he says, the metaLAB has pursued several projects telling stories of climate change using environmental data, conveying the information in visualizations that are more accessible to the public than academic articles.
“There’s a role for many different disciplinary traditions and practices to be at the cutting edge of how we create meaningful experiences and how we make arguments and how we build knowledge today,” Schnapp argues. Citing the 20th century novelist C.P. Snow, he adds, “The kind of ‘two cultures problem’ is really an artificial division between what are, in reality, all practices that are very closely interconnected.”
The “cutting edge” doesn’t have to be restricted to projects like the metaLAB’s, however. Even in the realm of more traditional academia, scholars can find ways to weave together different fields for broader goals.
Menon, who uses computational methods to study the Victorian-era novel, does just that. Menon researches direct speech within 900 19th-century novels, combining data and literary analyses to observe large-scale trends in the use of speech.
Yet Menon says that she thinks of her methods as reliable tools to “answer the kinds of questions that have always interested [her] in humanistic inquiry,” rather than a form of “digitizing” the humanities.
Both Schnapp’s work with the metaLAB and Menon’s use of computational models exemplify what the collaboration between different fields could yield. But their projects are currently outliers; in order for interdisciplinary projects to become more common, universities and students must first address the “two cultures problem,” primarily by first recognizing that the humanities are worth enough for them to incorporate into their academic repertoire.
The university has been striving to address this through initiatives such as the Intergenerational Humanities Project, a rotating three-year research project that aims to involve students and faculty from all backgrounds in in-depth, interdisciplinary humanities research. Under the I-HUM umbrella is the recently-launched Undergraduate Scholars Initiative, a two-course series for sophomores which emphasizes the foundational skills of the humanities.
The university is expected to approve so-called double concentrations later this month, according to an announcement from the Undergraduate Council. Double concentrations would allow students to study any two concentrations of their choice without the requirement of writing a thesis that combines both disciplines — a common complaint against the current joint concentration system.
But the cultural bias against the humanities makes it difficult to find a path forward. And though a college curriculum isn’t enough to change a culture, Menon argues that incorporating more humanities classes into students’ schedules is a start. She believes that people must value the humanities individually, aside from their possible contributions to other fields.
Menon argues that having a “mandatory class” for all students similar to Humanities 10 could encourage students to engage with the humanities. She says that the syllabus does not need to match up exactly to Humanities 10, but that the class should include “great works of literature.”
In her opinion, there are two ways to measure the decline in the humanities: by concentration numbers or by enrollment figures. While she says that concentration numbers are declining at a much faster rate than enrollment numbers, her suggestion for a mandatory class emphasizes that those enrollment numbers still matter and can make a significant change in students’ understanding of why the humanities are valuable.
Set against a deep plum background, a virtual gallery displays hundreds of works from around the world: poems and letters, both typed and handwritten, paintings of sunsets, sketches of solitary figures, graphic designs, and everything in between. “I ponder over words in solitude,” reads one letter from a 16-year-old girl in India. “I make these turbulent stories that talk of nothing but storms, sometimes paradise too, but storms are more real than utopia.”
Alongside her younger sister Sarah C. Lao ’25 and Carissa J. Chen ’21, Lao launched the Dear Loneliness Project — a part of Schnapp’s metaLAB — shortly after the pandemic began, as a means of helping people navigate large-scale isolation and uncertainty. The project aims to be the longest letter to the world, a memorial to 2020 from people across the globe, each documenting their emotions and experiences during the pandemic.
But for Lao, the Dear Loneliness Project holds a more intimate significance: it allows her to rekindle, even if only briefly, her love for literature. Through reading the letters — like ones from a 70-year-old man inspired to write back to letters he accumulated throughout his life — Lao remembered the distinctly human aspect of literature that she once cherished so much.
During the pandemic, she was reminded of the “empathy superpower” of literature, which helped her reframe her views of what it means to lead a meaningful life beyond having a stable job.
“I think that it really put things into perspective, like, what is our life?” she says. “For me, it's all about developing empathy and being able to live more lives than the one you are confined to, which is important in a time of great turmoil,” she adds.
For Soleil C. Saint-Cyr ’25, the pandemic helped her realize that she didn’t have to — or rather, shouldn’t — choose between her interests in literature and computer science.
She says that during the pandemic, “people became isolated, became depressed, even though there were Zoom calls every day. Because we realize the limitations of technology, a lot more people who have previously heavily invested in the idea that tech can solve all of our problems are kind of shifting away from that.”
For the founders of the Salon, the pandemic also brought to light the broader stakes of treating the humanities as irreconcilable with the sciences. Deshpande describes the “sharp dichotomy” between people who would focus solely on the scientific angle of the pandemic — information on how viruses spread — and people who looked at the pandemic in terms of its social and psychological consequences, determining that humans fundamentally needed in-person connection.
But he says neither side was effective in creating a viable solution to the pandemic for all. “It seems clear that any sort of sensible policy would have to take into account both the first side of things, which is traditionally the scientific enterprise, and the second side of traditionally humanistic enterprise,” he says.
Although it remains too early to determine whether the pandemic will truly lead to the sustained cultural shift required to break down the perceived binary between the humanities and the sciences, it appears that it has at least given some individuals the chance to re-evaluate their priorities when it comes to pursuing a certain field. Efforts like the Salon may be the impetus for generating such a change.
By the end of the hour at the Salon’s first meeting, someone has to remind the group of the time, pulling them from a discussion that leaves them with more questions than answers about the pursuit of knowledge — within and beyond the walls of Harvard. Still, the gathering provides a beacon of hope: the beginnings of a cultural shift away from field divisions that has the power to foster meaningful collaboration.

Harvard is a magnet for the superstitious: its students want everything, and if you say you want everything, you better be sure to knock on wood, lest you jinx yourself.
When we Ivy League aficionados opened our Harvard decision letters one or two eons ago, we didn’t simply open them. Maybe you gathered your family and friends around your laptop to share in the moment (I hope not, because that is the definition of jinxing). Perhaps once you received the email you went quietly to your bedroom, logged into your applicant account, and discreetly read those words that would determine your future membership with the American elite – my reaction was closer to the latter. I waited five hours after it was released before reading my decision, because every college letter I’d leapt on had been a rejection. Each one I’d opened nonchalantly had been an acceptance. The college gods dictated my actions, and my compliance was rewarded.
Such positive reinforcement of sign-seeking behavior leads most admits to carry on the practice during their college years, and slowly but surely, superstition has become embedded in Harvard student life. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the tradition currently on every freshman and bitter sophomore’s mind: River Run. A sordid affair, in my opinion, on account of my pessimistic background. My particular brand of superstition leans towards the tell-the-universe-the-opposite-of-what-you-really-want-because-it’s-out-to-get-you type of thinking. Visiting every single river house in one night and drowning in alcohol seems so totally earnest and desperate that to do so, in my view, will condemn you to Currier. But others, obviously, disagree.
As a freshman myself, I couldn’t give one flying ferret what house I end up in as long as it isn’t Lowell. An unfortunate experience in that dratted house’s bathroom soiled the entire place for me forever. Therefore, despite my largely indifferent attitude, I will have to perform my own preventative ritual, lest I be stormed by a bunch of upperclassmen with an aversion to flushing the toilet.
But no amount of goat’s blood will guarantee my sanitary safety — I will have to offer the housing gods something that matters more to me than anything else. What is closer to a freshman’s heart than the cozy red H-shield sweatshirt given to each Harvard student, that heavy-blend “One Crimson” pullover sported by twenty different people in the Yard at any given moment? Nothing, that’s what.
The week of Housing Day, rather than attend class, I will spend my time slowly unraveling the thread of my “One Crimson” sweatshirt inch by precious inch. Out of that thread I will painstakingly knit a beautiful crimson banner emblazoned with a white capital “L.” This banner will cover all bases. To the malicious housing god, the “L” represents a wish to be assigned to Lowell, and they will do their darndest to keep that from happening. To the benevolent housing god, the “L” represents Leverett, a perfectly respectable house I would be happy to be placed in. And to the inattentive or apathetic housing god, the “L” is simply my last initial, a demonstration of typical human narcissism.
After reading my personal strategy to assuage my Housing Day fears, the question you should be asking yourself is: what will you do to appease the housing gods? Will you too take your destiny by its hand-knit horns? Will you sacrifice your luscious locks for a first-class ticket to Dunster-town? Will you devote yourself to charity and scrounge up enough good karma to send your blocking group to Kirkland? Or, like many of your ill-fated predecessors, will you give yourself a late-night kidney workout and a hangover to secure your Cabot assignment?

Pacing across the small kitchenette, tutor Eric Bersin manages to stop the large pot from boiling over. With the help of some students, he pours two bowls full of yeast into the black, bacon-scented tea. “In 45 minutes, we will start adding the hops for this batch,” he says, swiftly stirring all the ingredients together using a large wooden spoon. The process is reminiscent of the Genie in the movie “Aladdin,” who has the cosmic power to grant any wishes to his master. Just as the Genie hides in his magic lamp to brew all sorts of magic potions for Aladdin, tutors and undergrads gather in this underground kitchenette to make all possible kinds of home-brewed beers. They are the Genies of the Kirkland Brew Club.
Located in Kirkland House’s N entryway (also known as the Annex), the Kirkland Brew Club has met weekly since the spring of 2009, when it was born from a competition between Kirkland and Winthrop to see which house could brew a better batch of beer before commencement. Now The Brew Club is a long-standing community seeking to not only “brew good,” but also “do good.”
Originally founded and led by Kirkland tutor Luke Walczewski, the Brew Club is now managed by two Kirkland resident tutors, Eric Bersin and Stefan Rajkovic, who were both House residents back in the 2010s. Rajkovic brewed his first beers during his senior year in 2017 with Walczewski. Now, as a tutor, he leads a group of enthusiastic undergraduates through the same experience he had.
During every Sunday meeting, the tutors and students boil bread grains to create tea and  add some yeast to produce the fermentation as well as  hops to offset the sweetness of the grain. After the two-hour boiling process, the boiled solution is left to ferment for two weeks. When it’s ready, members bottle it in recycled containers.
The whole process takes about three to four weeks, with plenty of wait time in between. “During the waiting time, we make a new beer,” Bersin explains. “We would start with the bread tea-making process. Then the following week, we either start a new batch of beer, transfer our previous batch to kegs, or bottle the batch that is ready for usage.”
To expedite the brewing process, the club uses a fridge with a temperature controller to optimize the yeast fermentation, a chiller to quickly cool down the boiling beer, a kegerator to hold beer kegs, and various pieces of filtration equipment. With their new equipment, members can now brew not only beer, but also hard seltzers, ginger beer,holiday cheer ale, ciders, kombucha, and any other creative recipes they self-craft or propose to the club.
This semester, the club meets from 3 p.m. till late afternoon every Sunday in the Annex basement. “We typically brew most every weekend, so throughout the semester, we make eight to 10 or so beers,” Rajkovic says. “We do some combinations of vaguely seasonal beer choices, but also cater to what our regular attendees are interested in.”
Scrolling through the 31-page recipes, the tutors show me the 2.0 version of Holiday Cheer Ale, a beer Walczewski created before leaving his resident tutor post and linked in FM’s 2014 coverage of the club. The changes are, as they described, quite “dramatic,” from the elimination of additional ingredients like honey and orange peel to changes in choices of grains, hops, and yeast strains. They also showed many other recipes in their semester brewing line-ups, such as That Good Rye IPA, which they just started last week, Scottish Ale, and dry-hopped Citra Saison. Each recipe is laid out with the creator's name, a list of the ingredients, recent brew dates, and tasting notes from the brewer.
When asked about his reasons for spearheading Brew Club, Bersin explains: “I had no real understanding of what went into beers and how it was made. Brewing beer brings a lot of insights into this type of beverage and allows you to put some meaning behind it.”
The club maintains a mailing list with past alumni, who occasionally assist with the brewing process when they are in the area. The Brew Club opens its door to both Kirklanders and beer enthusiasts in other houses. “We always welcome more people. Not only will you get the appreciation of the beer-making process, but it is also fun, easy, and way cheaper than buying the drinks at a store.” Bersin says.

YEAST STRAIN:
Danstar Nottingham- double pitched
OTHER INGREDIENTS:
none
Process:
Bring 2 gallons of water (we use a 4-gallon pot) to approximately 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  Steep the grains.  After 30 minutes, remove, and sparge.
Bring the wort to a boil, and then add the malt extract.
Bring the wort back to a boil and set a timer for 60 minutes.  At the beginning of the boil, add the bitterness hops.  With 5 minutes remaining in the boil, add the aroma hops.
When the boil has finished, put the pot in an ice bath to bring it down to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  Once the wort has cooled, put it in your primary fermentation bucket, add water to 5 gallons, and add the yeast!
After 1 week in primary fermentation, siphon to secondary.  After 1 week in secondary fermentation, bottle.  Wait about a month, then drink and enjoy!

When Michelle Wu became the first woman and first person of color elected mayor of Boston last November, she was one of a number of politicians from marginalized backgrounds becoming “firsts’”within Massachusetts. 2021 also saw the election of Thu Nguyen, the first nonbinary city council member in Massachusetts, and Joshua Garcia, the first Latino mayor of Holyoke. Efforts by grassroots redistricting groups succeeded in doubling the number of majority-minority State Senate districts from three to six out of 40.
Beth Huang, the executive director of Massachusetts Voter Table, says these changes are both necessary and overdue.
Massachusetts Voter Table is a coalition of organizations focused on civic engagement and voter participation among working- class voters and people of color. In the past decade it has been involved in many efforts to achieve these ends: Before last year’s redistricting push, for instance, a 2014 initiative gave employees of large employers up to five days of paid sick time per year. In 2018, Massachusetts established a $15 hourly minimum wage.
But for Boston, a city with a deep history of both immigration and racist policies such as redlining, these advancements in labor have come in tandem with other, harmful trends. Foremost among them is a surge in gentrification and the resulting displacement of poorer communities, many of them Black, Latino, or Asian, from Boston to “gateway cities” outside it. In fact, Boston was the fourth most intensely gentrified city in the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, according to a 2020 report by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
“First the people move, then the services move,” Huang says. “But political power is often the last thing to move with them.” People who are forced out of areas where they have built community and connections may find it difficult to lay down roots in a new location, where they may not know their city councilors or state representatives or school board members, she warns
“Racial capitalism, right?” she says. “The main thing is that there’s this cycle of, ‘My elected officials don’t respond to my community and don’t respond to my needs.’” This disillusionment decreases voter participation, she says, which in turn causes elected officials to view the community in question as unimportant to their role.
Much of the ground-level work undertaken by Massachusetts Voter Table and like-minded organizations entails talking to these voters. They also work with community groups like True Alliance Center, a Mattapan nonprofit which focuses on outreach to Haitian Creole speakers,and they offer training to local leaders. According to a report on Massachusetts Voter Table’s website, voters who the organizations’ leaders spoke to in 2021 were six percent more likely to vote than a control group. That number reflects an increase of about 30,000 people.
The drive to increase political power in minority communities is inexorably linked to efforts to bolster workers’ rights. “Essential workers” nationwide are more likely to be people of color, a disparity that has been highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic. They are more likely to work unprotected and underpaid gig economy jobs such as driving for Uber or DoorDash.
This drive has not come without pushback, too, and greater visibility for people of color has thrown into stark relief the casual racism entrenched in the area. For instance, Mayor Wu has been subject to xenophobic attacks by protestors who opposed Boston’s January vaccine mandate. At a press conference on February 14, Huang was harassed for several minutes by a protester who mistook her for Wu; Huang later tweeted, “If only being a 5'4" Asian woman imbued in me the powers of being mayor of Boston.”
Convincing potential voters means being able to point to specific issues that will impact those who might otherwise feel powerless, Huang says. With this goal in mind, organizations are focusing their efforts on two measures expected to be on the ballot in November. There is a constitutional amendment, which organizations with beliefs similar to Huang’s support, that would create an additional income tax for income over $1 million to fund education and transportation. And there is an initiative, which they oppose, to classify rideshare and delivery app drivers as “independent contractors” rather than employees and ensure the companies they work for do not have to provide many traditional benefits. The proposal takes cues from California’s landmark Proposition 22, which Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates spent a record $200 million in order to pass in 2020; since then, California gig workers have lost pay and autonomy even as prices for consumers have shot up.
In Massachusetts, Huang says, “while the floor might not be falling out, we certainly are really far away from the ceiling of political potential.”

On April 9, 1969, a dozen Harvard deans were slated to meet in University Hall to discuss the growing student dissent around the school’s stance on the Vietnam War. As they had planned for weeks, a group of 350 students led by the Progressive Labor Party and the Student Workers’ Alliance raided the hall, demanding that the deans leave the building, as a form of protest. While most of the administrators left, Archie C. Epps III, then Associate Dean of Harvard College, stayed, barring himself within his office, leaving only when protestors forcibly carried him out.

As Dean of Students and one of few Black senior administrators in Harvard’s history, Epps occupied a unique position within campus politics. As his refusal to give into the students’ demands illustrates, he had strong convictions on what was just. Throughout his time at Harvard in the ’60s and ’70s, he was heavily involved in local and national activism, helping organize the March on Washington and inviting Malcolm X for debates on campus.
Not long after the student riot, he rose through the ranks at Harvard, becoming Dean of Students in 1971. At age 32, he was one of the youngest appointments in the school’s history — and his term as dean one of the most eventful.
***
Epps was born in 1937, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, as one of three brothers. His parents were both schoolteachers and business owners — their dry-cleaning service, Epps Cleaners, was one of the first Black businesses in the city. They were active members of their community, helping to bring voting machines to their neighborhood and fighting for library privileges for African Americans in the town. So devoted were his parents to activism that a new library for the Black community was eventually built and named in their honor: the Epps Memorial Library.

As a young man, Epps attended Talladega College, majoring in psychology and religion. After he graduated third in his class, a professor pointed him towards Harvard to continue his education. With his mother’s blessing, and help from a scholarship provided by the American Board of Home Missions Congregationalists, Epps attended Harvard Divinity School from 1958 to 1961. From there, he went on to become a teaching assistant for sociology courses and a tutor at Leverett House.

In 1961, Epps met Malcolm X at a lunch in Boston, and the two quickly got to talking about race relations. Epps later recalled that while he was pouring cream into his coffee, Malcolm X quipped, “You don’t want to mix those two things.” Then a stalwart separatist, Malcom X argued it was impossible for African Americans to “move beyond” a history of exploitation and discrimination.. Epps believed strongly in the possibility of racial integration but respected Malcolm X as a peer. He later invited Malcolm to debate twice at Harvard, once with himself as Malcolm’s opponent.

During his time as assistant dean, Epps served as the Boston area coordinator for the March on Washington, traveling around basements and churches to promote awareness about the protest. Afterwards, in the summer of 1964, Epps lobbied and worked as a part of the Freedom Democratic Party to increase Black voter turnout in places rife with voter intimidation and discrimination.
As Dean of Students, Epps fought against separation from both sides. From refusing to support the creation of a cultural center for solely African American students to pushing back against the desire for separated dorms, Epps sought to create a Harvard open to everyone.

In his consistent pushback against separation, in his refusal to leave University Hall unless forcibly carried out, and even in his dedication to wearing a three-piece suit, Epps’s character stands out as consistent and unyielding. “He would sometimes take a long time to come down on something like that, but when he decided … he was always clear and firm,” Harry R. Lewis ’68, Epps’s colleague who served as Dean of the College, told the Crimson in 2011.
In an interview held in 2003, a few months before his death, Epps said he would want to be remembered for three things. First, for promoting an explosive growth in student activities. Next, for establishing the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and releasing Harvard’s first handbook on race relations. And lastly, for working to make Harvard a more “cosmopolitan” and “universal” space.

He abided by a simple principle: “Once you climb the ladder yourself, you have to look back and see who you can help come up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed a newly-released draft of a leadership profile for Cambridge’s next city manager during a virtual meeting of the Government Operations, Rules, and Claims committee Wednesday afternoon.
The leadership profile — made public Wednesday morning — outlines the skills, qualifications, and experience the Council will look for during the selection process for the new manager, an appointed official who oversees the city budget and day-to-day municipal operations. The current city manager, Louis A. DePasquale, plans to retire this summer.
“​​The City Manager will demonstrate an ability to work closely and creatively with the City Council, City departments, stakeholders, and residents,” the profile reads. “The ideal candidate will address issues through strategic thinking and long term plans, seeing the big picture and taking a systemic approach to rectify the problem.”
The profile also emphasizes the “opportunities and challenges” the new manager will face in expanding affordable housing, improving transportation infrastructure, and fighting climate change.
“While Cambridge has been intentional in its resiliency efforts and attempts to reduce local emissions, we have missed recent emissions targets and do not appear to be on track to hit our 2030 climate goals,” the profile reads. “The next City Manager must understand the importance and urgency of the climate crisis and embrace the challenge of making Cambridge a leader in resiliency and emissions reductions.”
The profile was developed by Randi Frank Consulting LLC, a third-party consultant firm coordinating the search for the city.
Randi Frank and the Council released the profile after more than a month of extensive community outreach by Randi Frank and the Council, including a series of nearly 20 focus groups with community leaders and a public comment website that received over 4,000 comments.
Cambridge Vice Mayor Alana M. Mallon, the chair of the Government Operations committee and the leader of the search process, said the Council’s push for public engagement was designed to foster diversity both among the stakeholders involved in the process and the applicants for the position.
“We democratize the process to ensure for a broader range of voices even to develop the leadership profile, to ensure that we have a diverse set of candidates at the end,” Mallon said.
Once the profile is finalized later this month, the consulting firm will distribute it to groups of potential applicants, including the Massachusetts Black Lawyers Association, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and the League of Women in Government.
“We’re really trying to diversify and make sure that we’re getting this leadership profile in front of the right eyeballs,” Mallon said. “As a city, we value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and so we really need to be intentional about recruiting.”

Dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III said last week he hopes the school will name a new head for its Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging in the coming weeks.
Doyle’s remarks come nearly four months after the office’s former leader, Alexis J. Stokes, departed in December 2021.
Stokes, who served as SEAS’s assistant dean for diversity, inclusion and belonging from October 2020 to last December before departing for a job in Harvard’s central administration, has left “big shoes to be filled,” Doyle said last Friday.
“We have a full-court press now on interviewing, screening, and now getting to finalists,” Doyle said.
Doyle said the school’s DIB office is in “good hands” in the interim under Christina Z. Patel, who has headed DIB initiatives following Stokes’ departure.
Doyle also said the school has made progress on recruiting diverse staff, faculty, and students, adding that SEAS is performing “well above national averages on diversity” compared to other schools.
Doyle acknowledged, however, that a gender disparity remains between SEAS and the College overall.
“We still have to close the gap,” he said.
Shi Le Wong ’22, who serves as a DIB fellow at SEAS, wrote in an email that SEAS needs “more transparent and regular data reporting” in order for affiliates to evaluate the school’s diversity progress.
“While we definitely put out diversity related recruitment events, I think we will need more specific feedback mechanisms to determine if the diverse student recruitment is actually a result of our efforts rather than by chance,” she wrote.
Doyle said he hopes to hire a new assistant dean who will be able to implement an updated school-wide climate survey.
Peter W. “Winston” Michalak ’22, who also serves as a DIB fellow, wrote that the climate surveys are “one of the most helpful instruments” for measuring the state of diversity at SEAS.
“I think a sense of inclusion manifests itself in people in different ways, and it is difficult to find a single metric to evaluate the inclusiveness of the campus as a result,” he wrote in an email. “That said, I think the climate surveys have been and remain one of the most helpful instruments for gauging how well SEAS is doing.”
Doyle also said he hopes the new assistant dean will be able to integrate well with SEAS faculty and staff.
“I need somebody coming into this role who’s going to be very effective working across all of the stakeholders at SEAS, and that's no small feat,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard Anthropology department grapples with the aftermath of sexual harassment allegations against professor John L. Comaroff, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said the FAS has provided professional counseling “to rebuild trust and promote healing” in the department.
Gay placed Comaroff on unpaid leave in January after two separate investigations by the FAS and Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution found that he violated the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Fifteen tenured Anthropology professors called for Comaroff’s resignation last month after federal lawsuit filed against Harvard detailed a decade of harassment allegations against him.
The suit alleged that the University mishandled its investigations into the allegations against Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology. The Anthropology Department has been roiled in recent years by allegations of toxicity and gender-based harassment.
In an interview Wednesday, Gay said FAS leaders attended an Anthropology Department town hall last month addressing the recent sanctions and backlash from students and faculty.
“This is a really challenging time for the department — and really, for a number of departments — and there are efforts underway to work to rebuild trust,” Gay said.
The FAS has offered members of the Anthropology Department one-on-one and group counseling sessions from two external mental health counselors, according to department chair Ajantha Subramanian.
“We recognize that this is long-term work and will continue to support the department in its efforts,” Gay said Wednesday.
The FAS' Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging has also produced a guide for all department chairs to help them lead sensitive conversations about departmental culture, Gay added.
Professors from departments across the FAS faced fierce backlash last month after nearly 40 faculty members signed a letter questioning Harvard’s investigations into Comaroff. All but three of the professors who signed the initial letter retracted their support for the statement.
Gay said the FAS' academic mission includes fostering an environment in which people can “reach their full potential.”
“I think we all appreciate how harassment and discrimination are not only personally damaging to the people who are the targets of it, but they are also destructive to the culture and mission,” Gay said Wednesday.
“And in that sense, we have to bring the same urgency, seriousness, resourcefulness, creativity to addressing those issues and building a positive culture that we do anything else that threatens our mission,” she added.
Correction: March 3, 2022
A previous version of this story misquoted FAS Dean Claudine Gay. She said harassment and discrimination are “destructive to the culture and mission,” not “disruptive to the culture and mission.”

The Harvard College Women’s Center kicked off its 16th annual Women’s Week on Tuesday with a presentation entitled “Female Solo Travel” in the first of seven events aimed at recognizing women’s achievements and struggles.
The launch of the week-long series — which the Women's Center has run since 2007 — coincided with the start of Women’s History Month. The theme of this year’s Women’s Week is “On the Horizon,” in recognition of women’s resilience in the face of difficulties and their contributions in various fields.
Lauren E. Naworski ’22, the events coordinator for Women’s Week, said the theme aims to recognize women’s strength.
“When you do see dialogue about women and gender issues, it's often almost framed in an infantilizing way, just reducing women to being victims,” Naworski said. “Yes, womanhood is hard, but also women are amazing, and we should empower women.”
“Our theme of ‘On the Horizon’ is really reflecting both the struggles and the power of women combined,” she added.
Naworski and Ananda M. Birungi ’24, the current design and publicity chair for Women’s Week, have worked since August to organize this iteration of Women’s Week. Other events include “Fetishes, Fantasies, and Fever,” a discussion focusing on the fetishization of Asian women, and “Yoga on the Horizon,” a candle-lit yoga class.
Lisa J. van der Sluijs ’22 led the “Female Solo Travel” event, co-hosted by the Woodbridge International Society. Van der Sluijs shared her experiences backpacking through Europe and the Middle East as a solo traveler and provided advice on logistics and safety.
“Women are not one hundred percent safe in any situation in the world,” Van der Sluijs said. “It doesn’t mean you should tell us not to travel. It means we need a bigger culture shift.”
“It’s my world, too,” she added.
Birungi said the week’s events aim to emphasize the importance of balance in feminist work.
“We should uplift each other, but also take time for ourselves,” Naworski said. “Really balancing how we view our own gender and both appreciating women but recognizing our struggles — I hope that [students] get that holistic picture from these events.”
Birungi said the week’s programming covers a wide range of perspectives and issues.
“Especially this year, you'll notice if you've looked at our events schedule, we have clubs that aren't just about gender,” Birungi said. “Facilitating conversations on gender across clubs that you wouldn't normally expect to necessarily talk about [gender] is a really important thing that we're very happy to do.”
Birungi and Naworski encouraged everyone to attend the week’s events, regardless of identity, and said the programming is meant to engage all students.
“The purpose of women's week is to have a dialogue about gender struggles, especially at Harvard. Everybody should come to all of the events if they can,” Naworski said. “Getting people who normally don't talk about gender to talk about it is one of the biggest accomplishments we could have this week.”
Women’s Week will close with the Women in Foreign Policy Conference, a collaboration between the Women’s Center and the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative. The conference brings together students from Boston-area universities and includes keynote speakers, mentorship opportunities, and workshops for students of all identities.
“It's not just about this one week — the Women’s Center is constantly doing work to support women and femme-identifying students on campus throughout the years,” Birungi said. “It's also a reminder to know that this work is continuous and it's not just a one-week thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter discussed the historical events leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its global consequences at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Wednesday evening.
Carter was joined by his former chief of staff, Eric B. Rosenbach — co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center — at the event, which was held less than a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine.
Wednesday’s event was the most-attended IOP forum since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, as loosening safety restrictions allowed the IOP to raise its capacity limit “for the first time since resuming in-person events in September,” according to IOP spokesperson Lauren L. Miller.
“We're excited to safely welcome more people back to Harvard's premier arena for political speech, discussion, and debate,” Miller wrote.
The event began with Ukrainian student Nika O. Rudenko ’24 sharing a personal account of the war in Ukraine and its impact on her.
“I’m originally from Donetsk, Ukraine, which means that in 2014 we were forced to flee my hometown,” she said. “At that moment, my life changed forever, and five days ago, my life changed again.”
Rudenko also called on Harvard to disclose any potential financial connections to Russia.
“We believe that the policymakers have the power and moral obligation to make Harvard disclose its investments or provide proof that there are no companies or funds affiliated with Russia,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton previously declined to comment on whether the school has financial ties to Russian companies.
Carter said he and other colleagues who were in the Pentagon in the 1990s had opposed rapid NATO expansion because they were afraid of creating a situation in which Russia felt “aggrieved.”
“We wanted to slow the ball,” Carter said. “The phrase we used at the time was — we don’t want to create a ‘Weimar Russia.’”
Unlike NATO’s hasty expansion, Carter said the West was too slow to understand the danger posed by Russia’s longtime president.
“I think that the Western family of nations came too late to a realization of what we had in Vladimir Putin,” he said.
Carter also said he does not believe the threat of sanctions would have prevented Putin from invading Ukraine.
“I don’t think that Vladimir Putin was going to be deterred by that,” he said. “I think the purpose of sanctions is punitive, vengeance, and deterrence of something way down the road.”
Carter, however, also said he does not support the implementation of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on the United States to do.
“A no-fly zone implemented by NATO is an act of engaged military engagement with Russia,” he said. “This situation would have been very different if Ukraine had been a NATO ally, but for right now, it is not our policy.”
“I personally don't favor doing that — that we enter the war on Ukraine’s side,” he added. “That’s a very, very dangerous situation. That means war between the United States and Russia.”
In an interview after the forum, Rosenbach said he agrees with Carter that the U.S. should not implement a no-fly zone.
“We do not want something to escalate into an outright war with Russia, in particular given the threat of a nuclear exchange,” he said.
Rosenbach also said he believes Western decision-makers understand that the implications of the war between Russia and Ukraine extend beyond the borders of either country.
“I think most of the senior leaders and thoughtful people in the West realize that this is about more than just Ukraine,” he said. “This is about democracy, it’s about principles, and it’s about values of human rights and international law.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge’s Department of Public Works has a new solution keep the streets squeaky clean: new trash carts intended in part to rein in the city's rat problem.
The city will distribute new trash carts to “all buildings where the City collects their trash” in June to replace residents’ current trash barrels, it announced last month.
According to the announcement, the goals of the initiative are trifold — controlling the city’s rodent problem, easing the lifting burden on trash collection staff, and improving “sidewalk accessibility.”
“Some municipalities provide trash carts, recycle carts, and other carts,” DPW Director of Recycling Michael Orr said in an interview. “Cambridge hasn’t, and one of the big impetuses for changing that is we want to do a better job of controlling rodents in the community.”
Roughly 45 percent of current trash barrels have holes in them, according to the city's announcement — "a sign of rodent activity.”
Daniel Riviello, who works in Cambridge’s Public Information Office, noted that many Cambridge residents may not realize that their current trash barrels are in poor condition.
“A lot of times barrels can be expensive for residents to buy, so they may go with cheaper options that aren’t as thick,” he said. “They may have gotten them years ago and don’t realize that they really need to be replaced to make sure that the lids are still closing tightly and that there’s no cracks in it or holes in it.”
However, the trash carts that will be distributed to residents are not “rodent resistant,” in contrast to the city’s compost carts.
“It’s really important that food waste not go in your trash — that it go in your compost bin,” Riviello said. “[Compost bins] are much more rodent resistant than any trash bin will be because they have a locking lid, there’s thick plastic, and it keeps the food separated from the trash.”
“We estimate somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of residents compost right now,” Orr said. “We definitely have some room for improvement with that.”
In addition to rodent control, city officials also hope the change will make sidewalks less cluttered.
“These carts will have attached lids as opposed to detachable lids, which will help with just less stuff on the street during collections day,” Orr said.
The city plans to host two virtual sessions for residents to learn about the trash carts and composting and will send out a postcard with additional information in April.
“We’re planning on doing some outreach at libraries — maybe bring in the new trash carts that we’re going to be giving out and showing people what it looks like, how to use it,” Orr said.
The distribution initiative was well-received when proposed, according to Orr.
“I think everyone — all the way up to the city manager — was supportive of this, and we’re just very excited to get this off the ground,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard spent $560,000 on federal lobbying during President Joe Biden’s first year in office, pacing the Ivy League alongside Yale, which spent the same amount. The school's expenditures put it atop the Ivy League for the fifth time in the last six years.
The University’s lobbying expenditures rose $5,000 from 2020 levels, breaking a four-year trend of decreases. In the last decade, Harvard’s lobbying peaked in 2017 under former President Donald J. Trump’s administration, reaching $610,000.
During 2021, representatives from Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations and University President Lawrence S. Bacow continued to lobby the White House and Capitol Hill on key issues related to immigration and higher education, according to Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
“Key issues include robust federal funding for research and student aid, welcoming immigration policies for international students and scholars, support for DREAMers and other undocumented students, balanced research policies, and incentives for charitable giving,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard also continued to support Covid-19 relief and stimulus bills.
The University spent $130,000 lobbying in the first quarter of 2021, gradually increasing its quarterly expenditures before plateauing at $145,000 for the second half of the year.
Harvard continued to lobby for increased funding for higher education, including the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, which is supported by more than 60 American research universities. The act would double the maximum grant amounts under the program and expand its coverage, which currently includes 34 percent of American undergraduates.
Harvard also lobbied in favor of the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, which would fund the NSF through 2026 and expand STEM education.
The University also continued to lobby for immigration reform, most notably the American Dream and Promise Act along with the Dream Act. Both bills would create new avenues to citizenship.
Bacow has penned multiple letters advocating for immigration reform, including one last year calling on the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a position endorsed by the Biden administration.
While no immigration reform bills Harvard lobbied for in 2021 passed into law, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan, a Covid-19 relief bill backed by Harvard. Additional bills addressing the pandemic — including the RISE Act to support research related to Covid-19 or disrupted by the pandemic — continue to languish in Congress.
The Harvard School of Public Health also hired Center Road Solutions, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm. HPSH spent less than $35,000 on its lobbying efforts — a drop from last year’s total of $40,000.
Altogether, Ivy League schools spent more than $2.7 million on lobbying in 2021.
Yale also spent $560,000 on lobbying last year, tying Harvard. Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania trailed close behind, with expenditures of $480,000 and $405,000, respectively. Consistent with previous years, Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth spent the least out of the Ivy League schools in 2021.
For several consecutive years, Dartmouth’s lobbying activity has fallen below the minimum threshold for disclosure.
Yale, Princeton, and Harvard saw slight increases in lobbying expenditures compared to 2020. Brown, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania all continued downward trends in spending that began in 2019.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania lobbied against the excise tax on large university endowments, supporting the Don’t Tax Higher Education Act — a bill that would repeal the endowment tax.
Harvard and Penn also backed a second endowment tax bill, the Higher Education Endowment Tax Reform Act, which would phase out the tax so long as universities give financial aid to students.
Harvard has long contended that the endowment tax undercuts the school’s ability to support its students and research. In an interview with The Crimson in November 2017, former University President Drew G. Faust called the endowment tax a “blow at the strength of higher education.”
The endowment tax is a part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the flagship tax reform championed by the Trump administration.
“The University, a charitable tax-exempt organization, is non-partisan, but is active in Washington with policymakers in Congress and the Administration on issues of importance to the University and its faculty and students,” Newton, the Harvard spokesperson, wrote.
