After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not often that an undergraduate-run ballet company produces a full original ballet and score with live orchestra—in fact, Harvard Ballet Company believes that the debut of “In Passage” will be the first of its kind in Ivy League history. The company will perform “In Passage” at Farkas Hall, Nov. 3 to 5.
Nine members of the Harvard Ballet Company choreographed a balletic representation of migration to a score composed by Sam Wu ’17. The Brattle Street Chamber Players will perform it live. Each of the ballet’s nine movements, from “Bleak Icy Winds” to “Love, Warmth, and Romance,” embodies a setting through which the dancers move. The style of ballet ranges from classical to contemporary.
HBC met with Wu, who now studies at Juilliard, last spring to discuss the trajectory of the project. “He came to us with a passion for creating music and really wanted to see how to create music for dance,” said Anna K. Antongiorgi ’19, co-producer and choreographer for HBC.
Over the summer, Wu composed the score at the Bowdoin International Music Festival, while HBC members tackled related projects. Laura Sky Herman ’19, Fundraiser for HBC, worked with leotard companies to coordinate the costume, a navy blue leotard with mesh paneling. Expanding on the inspiration that Wu took from bird migration patterns, the choreographers then developed a broader theme of journey.
This collaboration builds on steps HBC took last year to integrate the ballet company into the Harvard arts scene. In the breakthrough production “Cityscapes” in March, HBC brought in THUD, poets, and other instrumentalists. For the first time, the company sold out the Harvard Dance Center.
“We feel like dance can sometimes be a little isolated on this campus from the rest of the integrated art forms that do a lot of work together, and we wanted to bring dance and the ballet company into that more integrative space,” Alexandra Caffrey ’19, HBC co-director, said. Performing with a full original score and string orchestra is the next collaborative step, and comes with both benefits and challenges.
The ballet’s musical reprises evoke the cyclical nature of journeys and showcase the diversity of choreography. Co-director Alison J. Garber ’19 described two distinct choreographies set to the same slow cello melody. “Phoebe [Amory]’s piece is more classical,” she said. “It’s very soft, lots of beautiful lines and some partnering work. Anna Riley Shepard’s is sharp and it’s surprising, and it’s really percussive, so it’s a complete contrast.”
The first and last movements, large company pieces that include 25 of the 30 dancers in the show, form another musical reprise. Caffrey and Garber choreographed them to frame the show’s theme of migration. “There are lots of group dynamics where it’s like flocks of birds actually moving around,” Garber said.
The climax of the show is “The Thrill of Soaring,” choreographed by Antongiorgi. “I was thinking about what happens when we try too many things and fail. A lot of the movement is on the verge of falling,” she said. Her choreography is innovative—“not perfect classically or perfect in technique, but trying to push the ballet technique to its breaking point,” Antongiorgi said.
Wu’s score was formidable for choreography. “This music is really hard to count, so I’d start by diagramming it,” Caffrey said. In addition, the dancers and musicians had to learn to speak each other’s languages. “The artistic mediums deal on different planes and have different words for different things, but once you figure out a way to creatively explain what you’re going for, it’s a really amazing experience,” Antongiorgi said.
“There are so many layers, we have to decide what the audience is listening to,” Caffrey said, describing moments when the dancing brings out certain cello beats that would otherwise be hard to hear.
“That’s the beauty of the collaboration,” Antongiorgi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” the nine student actors showed a special talent for smiling in character. Spelling bee moderator Rona Lisa Peretti (Olivia Graham ’21) had a beam that was equal parts condescending—as her character required—and endearing. Contestant Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre (Molly Peterson ’21) had a frenetic grin that revealed both her character’s inner anxieties and the actress’s own tireless energy.  Laura Frustaci ’21, who played speller Marcy Park, didn’t smile while in character—but occasionally her lips would flicker up of their own accord after Frustaci got a big laugh from the audience.  This was a play of enthusiastically bared teeth: The actors’ smiles were variously earnest, guilty, or superficial, but they were always present.  “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” had an easygoing and infectious humor. This was a performance that set out to have fun—and succeeded.
The actors had the air of letting the audience in on a big joke, and the cast seemed to be enjoying themselves throughout, making it easy to match their energy.  In one instance, four audience volunteers “entered” the Putnam County spelling bee along with the six cast contestants.  Their lines were unscripted, and the teachers (Graham and Jonathan Castillo ’21) were at their best when they were interacting with their unprepared victims.  “Sophie tried to find a striped shirt to wear this morning,” Graham ad-libbed about an audience member wearing a two-tone color block blouse. “She almost succeeded.” Later, Graham gave an even more audience-specific dig, announcing that “Sophie goes to … an elementary school in Boston.”  The actress didn’t wink, but she might as well have.
If much of the show’s humor was derived from the cast’s boisterousness, however, the jokes never belied the attention that cast members paid to their characters.  Each actor fully embodied the personality he or she depicted.  No matter how ridiculous, the play does not belittle their elementary school spellers. Their juvenile earnestness was sometimes played for laughs (a character is often funniest when he doesn’t realize it), but it was also a source of genuine character development.  At any given time, a performer was doing something their speller would do: Leaf Coneybear, a free-spirited homeschooler played by Ben Topa ’21, looked understandably confused during the Pledge of Allegiance.  The over-pressured and spiritless Marcy Park appeared robotic while other contestants spelled.  The politically minded Logainne smiled ingratiatingly at almost everything. If “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” is a comedy, it never sacrificed character development for cheap humor.
The talent of the cast, too, was far from a joke.  Each speller got at least one major song to him- or herself, giving the actors a chance to showcase athletic dancing and big voices.  Frustaci’s number, “I Speak Six Languages,” featured incredibly acrobatic choreography.  Sophie Bauder ’21 played Olive Ostrovsky, the show’s underdog, and her forceful performance of “The I Love You Song” was a jarringly emotional moment in an otherwise light play.  The people behind the scenes were equally qualified: the choreographer (Fotini Anastopoulos ’20) designed compelling dance numbers, most notably Frustaci’s gymnastics and an impressive kickline during “Magic Foot.”  The band was eclectic and interesting: the synthesizer, especially, oscillated rapidly between haunting and humorous.  The enthusiasm of its actors defined the show—but its high spirits came alongside a genuine display of talent.
To its credit, “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” also had moments of poignancy and self-awareness. The show was strategically placed during Freshman Family Weekend: The cast, all Harvard freshman, were singing to their parents. This made the play’s underlying messages of pressure, familial duty, and parental love strikingly relevant.  There was something touching about Harvard students performing a play for their families about what it means to win or to lose, about the costs of success. The ultimate moral of the play is that winning isn’t everything—like in so much fiction, the real answer involves friends and family and love.  But in this particular production, such serious themes were coupled with sparkling enthusiasm and engaging humor.  As they looked out at their families, the cast members had to know that maybe a first place spelling bee trophy didn’t matter much—but their performance was a whole different kind of win.

The actors almost never make eye contact with each other in “Tomes of Terror: Lenore.” They stand in fixed positions at their microphones, looking down at white stacks of printer paper on which their lines are printed. The show takes place in an undecorated church, with disappointingly un-spooky cream-colored walls. At times, people at a table offstage start stepping on piles of newspaper, or shaking a large piece of hardened tin foil, and it’s difficult to hear the dialogue with all the noise.
“Tomes of Terror: Lenore” wouldn’t be a very good play. It might be better presented as an audiobook. However, it’s neither. It’s a project by the Post-Meridian Radio Players (PMRP), a troupe focused on the “preservation of radio drama and development of audio theater,” two art forms saved by the growing popularity of podcasts. PMRP is composed of voice actors, Foley artists (the people shaking the tin foil into microphones to mimic the sound of thunder), writers, sound designers, and more. They work on performances of everything from original writing to works of literature to interpretations of B-movies, like the upcoming production of “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.”
Their Halloween show, which is at the Responsible Grace Church until Oct. 28, consists of dramatizations of Edgar Allen Poe’s short poem, “Lenore,” and his stories, “The Premature Burial” and “Hop Frog,” along with Edith Nesbit’s “Hurst of Hurstcote.” A spookier Don Pardo introduces each work with information about the author, historical context, and the work itself. These introductions exploit the horror genre in a clever and chuckle-worthy way, just like the rest of the show. “Tomes of Terror: Lenore” illuminates great works of literature with loving precision[, and thus][AND] demonstrates the whimsical nerdiness of the radio drama genre.
“Hurst of Hurstcote,” adapted and directed by Liz Salazar, follows John Hurst, a man who cannot get over the loss of his young lover, Kate. Kate comes back to haunt him, while a doctor by the name of Bernice does her best to keep him under control. Brit Lee Reese is delicately frightening as Kate, creepily standing in the background, doing her best to speak to John. Throughout the play, madness takes its toll on John (Andrew Winson), who is held back by the strong, but flustered Bernice (Kristen Heider). The voice actors master the art of the hushed, gothic-era British accent to bring this work, reminiscent of an extremely unsettling Jane Austen novel, to life.
Amy Bennet-Zendzian directed and Tegan Kehoe adapted “The Premature Burial,” which tells the story of a delightfully neurotic man named Dr. Bower and his all-consuming fear of being buried alive. Each character in this show is a brilliantly colorful caricature. Pre-psychology psychologist Dr. Mott (Robin Abrahams) lodges artfully crafted comebacks to skeptics of her profession in her rich, deep, [perfectly][AND] unique radio voice. The ensemble (Chris Adams, Carol Sutherland, and Catherine Quintana) provides all sorts of comedic relief, with their hilariously awful French accents and curly white “powdered wigs” made of cheap plastic.
“Hop Frog,” directed by Eric McGowan and adapted by Christian Krenek, is the largest adaptation of the night, with 11 actors in total. In the story, the oppressed Hop Frog overthrows a tyrant and haunts the queen for the rest of history by grinding her teeth to create a horrible screeching sound. Aisha Stewart, who plays Hop Frog, far exceeds her role as a voice actor with a piercing but blank stare that never ceases, until she begins to laugh maniacally—both are equally disturbing. Characters like Chancellor Stultividia (Katie Meyers) and General Bello (Dan Burke) are cleverly nefarious side characters, and the actors’ physical appearances are straight from the original story.
This production dazzles with impassioned delivery, but the most special parts are the goofy and thoughtful touches: strawberry-flavored Whoppers and orange Junior Mints at the concessions stand, Foley artists wearing lab coats covered in fake blood, a playbill filled with festive spooky fonts, hilariously cheap-looking outfits, and an announcement about exits suitable for all emergencies, even existential ones, delivered by Orson Welles, back from the dead. “Tomes of Terror: Lenore” is filled with affectionate winks to the audience in the form of whimsical inside jokes carefully curated by the directors, voice actors, Foley artists, and more who make up PMRP.

Media mogul, feline aficionado, and Grammy magnet, Taylor Swift has been a giant of pop music since her debut in 2006. Her sixth studio album, highly anticipated and heavily promoted, will doubtlessly dominate airwaves upon its release on Nov. 10. Swift has long used lead singles to rebrand—those from both “Red” and “1989” marked a pivot from country towards pure pop—and the first few singles of her “Reputation” era similarly focus on optics. Over the last few years, the star has been embroiled in a slew of controversies. Although they are not among her strongest work, the three songs appropriately address her situation and frame a captivating musical transformation.
The “Reputation” era officially kicked off with the release of Swift’s first single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” Preceded by a total social media blackout and cryptic snake imagery on Instagram, the song offers a radically new sound for the musician. The backing instrumentals are packed with dramatic strings and forceful beats—the keys are aggressively struck, and rattlesnake-like percussion in the background supplements her voice.
Likewise, the lyrical content is harsher, and somewhat less subtle, than that of the “1989” era. The bridge samples a simulated phone conversation in which she mentions that the old Taylor is dead, and the new Taylor is unafraid to repeatedly tell others that “I don’t like you.” Other phrases, such as the “tilted stage” of the first verse and the alliterative “kingdom keys” seem to poke fun at her various ongoing feuds. The song functions on two levels, both as a serious reaction to the media’s reception to her and as self-parody (further evidenced by the music video). Either way, it’s clear Swift is wresting back control of the narrative.
The smashing success of her first single was followed up by a promo single, “…Ready for It?” Its title’s use of ellipses signals something left unsaid, and indeed, this piece occupies a strange space between old and new. The pre-chorus is breathy and trance-like, perhaps a fresh take on “Wildest Dreams.” The rest of the song is riddled with characteristic single-note melodies. There’s no denying, however, that there is stylistic evolution. The second verse is rapped—at least as close to rapping as Swift is going to get—and the prechorus reveals a deepening EDM influence.
Like her first single, “…Ready for It?” ups the lyrical ante. Likening herself to a “phantom” and a “thief,” the new Taylor seems less inclined to hold onto her old, innocent image. It’s also this single which gives us a taste of the relationship subject matter we know so well. Her new lover is aloof, more partner-in-crime than soulmate. Her line “Burton to this Taylor,” a clever reference that laments damaging presence of media on a relationship, is impressively self-aware. Straying from the method-acting of “Blank Space,” “…Ready for It?” reads more as a recognition and reclamation of Swift’s serial dating.
Rounding out the trifecta is “Gorgeous,” a startlingly typical Taylor Swift song. Coming off of her first two singles, it’s regressive in the best way. With its light production, tongue-in-cheek point of view—“but if you’re single that’s honestly worse”—and aesthetic imagery, one could conceivably pass the piece off as a deep cut from “1989.” That isn’t to say the song is flawless, however. It exhibits an alarming new trend in Swift’s music, in which she rhymes words with themselves, a disappointing step back from her previously celebrated ability to weave narratives. That said, the hyperbolic attitude, whimsical use of triangle, and reference to the musician’s cats, seem to hint that perhaps the old Taylor isn’t as dead as she has led us to believe.
Musically, the three singles are all over the place. Understanding their intersection requires reading—or listening—between the lines, contemplating the meta-game Swift is playing. Beneath the musical ambiguity of her first three releases, there is quiet signaling: The pop star is changing, self-aware, and unapologetic about her experiences. Anyone confused about the sonic content of her new album should not be too worried. If these releases are any indication, “Reputation” is shaping up to be one of her most interesting works yet.

To the cast, musicians, and creative team behind this semester’s moving production of “Spring Awakening,” thank you. How rare it is for a production to hit all the right notes with such endearing effortlessness: heart-fluttering chemistry, bone-chilling vocal performances, and staging so perfectly poetic that I have hardly been able to think about anything else for the past few days. Wow.
For those not yet under its spell, “Spring Awakening,” based on a 19th-century German play by Frank Wedekind, combines alluring music by Duncan Sheik and soulful lyrics by Steven Sater to tell a story about young adults wrestling with the constructs of an oppressive society, doubts about religion, and questions about their own sexual awakening—and about the adults who choose not to hear them.
Various iterations of the musical—its Broadway debut in 2006, for example, or the recent revival by Deaf West Theatre—have stirred something electric within audiences. The vibrancy and relatability of the characters transcend historical and social contexts, and the music is just so damn good. Presented by Harvard College Musical Theater and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, this production dazzled. It runs at the Loeb Experimental Theater from Oct. 27 through Nov 4.
The show’s core trio—the angsty misfit Moritz (Blu Frankel ’20), the suave and too-wise-for-his-years Melchior (Jake A. Corvino ’19), and bright but uninformed Wendla (Karalyn E. Joseph ’21)—anchored a confident and compelling cast. Corvino and Joseph embodied their roles with a driven poise and an understated grace, perhaps best showcased in “The Guilty Ones,” performed after Melchior and Wendla’s first time. The pair sat downstage and sang just to themselves, voices soft and eyes locked in intimate understanding, and the Ex’s black box theater setting, little twitches in the audience, and even the other characters on stage were incidental to Corvino and Joseph’s unadorned connection. Frankel, for his part, channeled Moritz’s self-destructive anger, devastating failure at school, and inability to make anyone see him through his scrawny and troubled façade. He conveyed it all with an effectively quivering hold on the notes, especially poignant in the brooding lament, “And Then There Were None.”
The entire cast infused Sater’s lyrics with unbelievable braided harmonies, and indeed it is difficult to isolate just one instance of sheer vocal ecstasy. Corvino, Otto (Christian Savarese ’19), Georg (Noah Barson, Emerson College ’19), and the rest of the company, not to omit the accompanying musicians expertly directed by Liz P. Kantor ’18 and Daniel L. Rodriguez ’18,poured their hearts into their rendition of “Touch Me” toward the middle of Act I, a musical number that just about transported the audience beyond, as the lyrics suggest, “where the winds sigh.” That the cast did not bask in how astonishing they were made their performances all the more irresistible.
The production is a testament to the talent of Director/Choreographer Laura Sky Herman ’19, who assembled such a spot-on team and blocked the show with such meticulous precision that even the placement of the actors’ fingertips and the timing of their breaths struck a chord.
Indeed, the cast breathed lyrical life into certain poses that they sometimes held for only a few seconds. When Melchior and Wendla first meet in a sunlit meadow, the other adolescents—some seated, some standing—rest their bodies on each other, forming nestled, bashful trees. Herman, here, stylized the Melchior and Wendla’s melting into each other and their budding attraction by directing Corvino and Joseph each to reach out with one hand, circle that hand around the other’s—barely grazing fingertips—until the two hands intertwine in time to their back-and-forth lyrics: “Don't feel a thing, you wish / Grasping at pearls with my fingertips / Holding her hand like some little tease.” This scene is just one example of the production’s smooth blend of movement, music, and poetry, bolstered by tasteful lighting, a stripped-down set that highlighted the actors, and a cohesive look overall—elements so mesmerizing that I did not want the production to end.
As Melchior sings toward the end of the show, “There’s a moment, you know….” But, truly, this version “Spring Awakening” cultivated so many moments of splendor, intense connection, and tingling perfection that words alone cannot capture its magic. You just have to see it and believe. (“Oh, I believe.”)

As the new campaign season of the Undergraduate Council begins, the student body gears itself for changes—a new president, a new vice president, and perhaps an opportunity to present new legislative topics through the referendum system. With the recently-revitalized system, UC representatives have been flooding student inboxes, asking them to consider signing petitions that would allow these referenda questions to be placed on the ballot for the coming UC election. Recent legislative changes in the UC now make the governing body unable to overturn a binding referenda, turning the referendum system into a more tangible way to enact changes in the UC.
We believe that the referenda system is a great method to increase student engagement with the UC, allowing it to remain in touch with the body of students that it purportedly represents. The system provides a prominent platform to discuss important issues and creates a framework in which students can feel as though their voices are being heard. Moreover, it can gauge student opinion on substantive issues, and we are hopeful for the ideas and action that will ideally originate from these referenda topics. In particular, we commend the impetus that has been given to issues such as developing a multicultural center on campus as well as further upperclassman programming.
While we find merit in the referenda system, we are wary of its misuse. If students genuinely have an important issue they wish to bring to the attention of the student body, then this is an appropriate mechanism for students to take advantage of. However, we implore students to take this method seriously and not waste space on referendum ballots with frivolous requests, such as making the Harvard Turkey the College’s official mascot. This system is designed to bring important issues to the table at UC meetings—not to waste their time.
Nevertheless, the initiative of UC representatives in widely publicizing these referenda highlights a focus on action rather than mere discussion. This is a step in the right direction, and is a positive sign for change to come out of UC meetings rather than idle conversation. We look forward to seeing more examples in the near future of UC members being active participants in bringing about changes to our campus.
In this vein, we are optimistic that the administration will lend an ear to any referenda that are passed. While we understand that some referenda cannot instantaneously cause large administrative changes, we hope that administrators truly take these issues into consideration, as petition votes show that these sentiments are important to a substantial part of the student body.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

With the federal government’s recent withdrawal of the Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence dated April 4, 2011, and the Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence dated April 29, 2014, there is understandable concern and uncertainty on campus about what will happen to Harvard University’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedures. We write today as partner offices to reaffirm our commitment to promoting gender equity and inclusion at Harvard, and combatting sexual and gender-based harassment, including sexual assault.
The University has reviewed the interim guidance issued last month by the U.S. Department of Education and determined that it does not, at this time, warrant changes to our University-wide Policy or Procedures. We are confident that our Policy and Procedures, as written, meet the requirements of Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, and Massachusetts state law. Furthermore, we are committed to continuing to lead in this area through community outreach, education, and prevention efforts.
Over the past several years, Harvard has invested heavily in preventing gender-based and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and promptly responding when it does occur. Part of this commitment has been the implementation of a University-wide Policy and Procedures that include a fair and neutral investigatory process, which is conducted by professionals with the training to handle these sensitive cases, and who recognize our obligations to all parties involved.
Some may worry that Harvard will back away from its policies and programs, and we want to underscore the University’s unwavering commitment to fostering an environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. While there is much work to be done, we remain dedicated to working together to identify ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate sexual discrimination and violence.
In 2003, Harvard College established the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response as a central resource for education and support of students.  Since that time, OSAPR has expanded to become a University-wide resource and as of 2013, crisis support and educational services became available to all students, staff, and faculty. Now, more than ever, OSAPR remains committed to the compassionate and just treatment of people who have been impacted by interpersonal violence. OSAPR also remains committed to creating attitudinal and behavioral change through discussion and education in our community.
In 2012, the College created the Office of BGLTQ Student Life with the goal of providing support, resources, and a space to build community for the queer student population on campus. The BGLTQ Office was also tasked with educating the broader campus on issues related to gender and sexuality. More recently, these educational efforts have come to include trainings and discussions on sexual violence, assault, and harassment specifically experienced by BGLTQ populations. From its inception, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has dedicated substantial efforts to advocating for inclusivity throughout Harvard College, and to building relationships across campus with students, faculty, and staff.
In 2014, the University unveiled its new Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedure, which includes a preponderance of evidence standard. The University also created the Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution. The Title IX Office works closely with the network of more than 50 trained Title IX Coordinators in schools and centers across campus to provide resources and supports to students, staff, and faculty. The Title IX Office has also partnered with the schools’ and units’ Title IX Coordinators to develop and roll out online training modules designed to raise awareness so that more community members are comfortable accessing resources when they experience or learn of an issue that could fall under our Policy. ODR, which is staffed with impartial and experienced investigators, is available to answer questions about the steps involved in pursuing an informal resolution or filing a formal complaint.
In 2015, the University convened a policy review committee to examine the implementation of the policy. Made up of students, faculty, staff, and administrators, the group meets regularly to examine data and monitor how the Policy and Procedures are implemented across the University.
Collaboration across University offices working on this issue is essential to the success of our education and prevention initiatives. To this end, the heads of the Title IX Office, ODR, OSAPR, and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life have been working closely together over the past year to bolster the University’s efforts in this arena. In addition to regular meetings, we have come together to co-host events and provide resources and trainings throughout the University community. We plan for these efforts not only to continue, but to increase over the coming academic years.
Still, there is much work to be done in this area, and we are committed taking on this task. We understand that the real test of our commitment will be putting words into action—namely through increased awareness, initiatives, educational programming, and improvements to the available resources.
The safety and well-being of the Harvard community remains our top priority. Above and beyond our obligation to follow the law, we remain committed to helping to formulate and to implement policy and procedures that work for, and protect, all of us.
Nicole M. Merhill is the University Title IX Officer. William D. McCants is the Director of the Office for Dispute Resolution. Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 is the Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. Maria Francesconi is the Senior Director of Health Promotion and Education, including oversight of OSAPR.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before I arrived at Harvard, my parents warned me not to come home too liberal. I laughed it off, but there was some truth behind the joke—at one point this school was literally known as the “Kremlin on the Charles.” So naturally, I was ready for an institution where every other student identified as a communist, where conversations were centered around how to overthrow the bourgeoisie, and where Karl Marx could be spotted hiding behind the John Harvard statue.
(Okay, so maybe not that last one. But you get my point.)
At first glance, I was pleasantly surprised to find Harvard much more intellectually diverse than I had initially expected. Before I even arrived on campus, I noticed the increased prominence of the Harvard Republican Club, which was receiving national fame as a result of its strong condemnation of then-candidate Donald Trump. In Annenberg Hall, I engaged in intellectual discussions with those across the aisle—libertarians and Republicans alike. And I became involved in interfaith efforts that allowed me to form relationships with members of the Jewish community.
But I quickly became isolated as I saw the institutional legitimacy that is granted to those who advocate for hatred against Muslims and other minorities. And I realized that behind this veneer of intellectual diversity lays a dangerous status quo.
Just weeks into my freshman fall, I was shocked when the Harvard Foundation awarded the Humanitarian Award to Aung San Suu Kyi, the state counselor of the Republic of Myanmar. Suu Kyi’s regime is currently carrying out a genocide against Rohingya Muslims. She refuses to even acknowledge it, much less take action to condemn it. And Harvard recognized her as an international leader of peace.
Suu Kyi is the rule, not an exception. Currently, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. Ali has promoted the ideology that Islam is a “religion of violence.” Her words are unequivocally hate speech. And she is treated as a scholar and hero by one of the oldest and most powerful educational institutions in the world.
This semester, the Institute of Politics has been filled with hand-me-downs from the Trump administration, including Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski. These men worked for a president who publicly called for a “Muslim ban,” furthered Islamophobic rhetoric during his campaign and presidency, and campaigned for an agenda that could only result in making America white again. And instead of unequivocal condemnation, Harvard offers accolades.
However, recognizing or even honoring individuals like this is not just done by the administration. It is reflected among the student body as well. Look no further than the rise of the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative, which professes to encourage “the freedom of thought.” But the speakers who have been invited fit the same pattern of being among those who speak against minorities. These include Jordan Peterson, who rejected the validity of trans identity, and Charles Murray, who is a white nationalist.
The free speech arguments used to justify the presence of such thinkers on campus would be easier to swallow if the discourse was more equal. I would never consider any sort of leftist comparable to those who disregard the very humanity of others, but there is no denying that the tolerance for even such voices is much lower. Just consider Chelsea Manning’s dismissal by the Kennedy School or the controversy surrounding PBHA’s recognition of Nihad Awad.
And so, a status quo is set. In this status quo, Harvard encourages free speech. Harvard encourages controversial speech. Harvard even encourages hate speech. But with one simple catch—those affected by that speech are those who are already minorities. They are the marginalized students whose voices are easy to push to the side.
This status quo is not just bureaucratic. It is present in campus culture. Minorities are expected to be moderates, reaching across the aisle to those who don’t even respect their humanity. I am not supposed to be angry or radical or too left. When one of my peers makes a joke about “PC culture,” I am expected to laugh instead of pointing out that there’s nothing wrong with tempering our words and actions to make those around us feel safer. I am expected to moderate my opinions and find common ground with those who affiliate with a political party whose leader is literally a white supremacist. In addition, when reaching out, I am expected to temper myself and recognize my privilege as a liberal on this campus.
The fact is that I have no such privilege. Harvard is not a leftist enclave. It is not a liberal safe haven. And it shouldn’t be. But it should be a place for equal dialogue, where every student can feel like they have a voice. But when the institutional structures support those that advocate hatred and campus culture encourages moderation and middle ground and shrinking, this is impossible.
In one of my previous columns, an anonymous commentator suggested that I “unseal [my] lips and engage.” I’m trying to. In fact, that’s the whole point of this column. Since my freshman fall, I’ve been looking to grow and learn from those more conservative and more liberal than me. But while the Trump supporters have proved easy to find, the communists have not. And I’m tired of only speaking with those on the side of the aisle that has summarily rejected me. I’d like to go beyond that.
So if you happen to know a communist, send them my way. I’m looking.

My goggles are pressed tightly into my temples, yet they still slide off of my nose thanks to a slippery mixture of sunscreen and sweat.My SPF-70 zinc melts off my arms in milky beads, and we are only 10 minutes into the warm-up. After our two-lap jog, my teammates and I form lines behind the seniors on the sidelines to start our dynamic stretches. Frankensteins, flamingos, newspapers, elephants. We go through the same stretches, in the same sequence, two hours per day, six days per week.
As I transition from high-knees into butt kicks, one of the captains gives another a look: There’s too much “non-lacrosse talk”  going on. The third captain urges us to stay focused, which we do, for all of two minutes. Then, conversations about homework and social drama quickly resume. Last week, everyone’s high-knees were quick, concise, and actually, well, high. Now, my teammates shuffle through the drill, moving our feet in a way nearly indistinguishable from plain walking.
We finish stretches with a lackluster 10-meter sprint and walk over to grab water and our sticks for passing drills. Another look between the captains. Walking is never tolerated, even during a water break.
We start the game with our usual flow. We win the first few draws and our key midfielders sink the first few goals in. But then we start to miss ground balls, resulting in easily-avoided goals. Soon we start missing shots and lose possession again, because our attacker didn’t stand behind the goal.
Little mistakes turn into repeat offenses. Enthusiasm from the sidelines wavers. The whistle is blown; the ref calls another penalty on my team and puts the ball into the opposing attacker’s stick. Surrounding defenders from my team idly stand by, with sticks halfway in the air, not high enough. Two defenders from my team start to swarm the attacker when the play is resumed, but the attacker slips by and charges for goal. The defenders watch around the eight-meter arc as she drops the ball in the goal. No one slid to slow her down. In practices, we are always reminded on defense that our priority is to protect our goalie from 1v1 shots on goal.
The scoreboard siren rings for half-time. We walk off the field. We still have a three-point lead.
Staring into space, I dig my hand into the Ziploc bag of orange slices and green grapes. I look up from my project when Coach Eileen starts talking.
“Don’t get complacent. This game isn’t over.”
Everyone wears the same look of guilt, masked by exhaustion and dehydration.I listen to the rest of my teammates and coaches discuss strategy and areas for improvement while I untie and retie my laces. If I tighten my cleats snug enough, then I will feel more alert, more pumped.
They must not be tight enough: The number of fumbles doubles in the second half. We win the majority of the draws but no one makes the effort to get open. Our center midfielder is swarmed by three girls, but no one presents their stick as an outlet pass. We quickly lose possession and the ball spends the majority of the game in our defensive end.
The sun sets over the opposing goal, casting a blinding glare on our offensive end. This will definitely motivate us.. We have the ball and a two-point lead. The referee, looking more exhausted than any of us, scurries over. His comb-over is matted down on his sunburned head. He is wearing a knee brace from his ankle up to his mid-thigh.
“Number six, take another step back,” the referee barks. I am number six.
We win possession of the next draw. As we pass the ball down the field, though, the other team intercepts it. They execute clean, direct passes. The defenders flee the midfield region and sprint toward the goal. The strongest player comes barreling down the field with the ball. With 15 seconds left in the game, they make one more pass and dunk the ball in the cage. This must be their underdog story.

Somewhere in the neighborhood of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri—4.25 light years from Cambridge—a small, hyper-reflective spacecraft will home in on an unfamiliar planet.
Catching high-power laser beams shot from Earth on its balloon-shaped sail, the “nanocraft” will hurtle towards the new planet at approximately one-fifth the speed of light. It will have been a long journey from home—more than two decades. But the laser-sail technology is leaps and bounds faster than its unwieldy jet-fueled predecessors, which will allow the lightweight craft to cover vast distances in a fraction of the time it takes today.
The nanocraft will hurtle past the planet. Then, it will send us a picture.
“Proxima Centauri has a planet just at the right distance from the star to potentially have liquid water on its surface, and lead to the chemistry of life as we know it,” Avi Loeb, chair of Harvard’s Astronomy Department, and head of the team that imagined the spacecraft, says. He sits in his office at the Black Hole Initiative, where he’s founding director. The equations on the wall opposite him, he explains, model gravitational waves and black holes. I warn him that I study history, but he is encouraging. “Well, history begins with the big bang.”
“We would like to know whether the surface of the planet has vegetation, whether it’s green, or has an ocean, whether it’s blue,” Loeb says of the photo the nanocraft would take. Four years later, when the photo has traveled from the craft’s tiny onboard computer system back to earth, we could have an answer to the question of whether or not we’re alone in the cold, vast universe.
But that’s not even the exciting part. The exciting part? If everything goes according to Loeb’s plan, all of this will happen no more than a few decades in the future.
Loeb is Chair of the Advisory Board of Breakthrough Starshot, a relentlessly optimistic initiative to pioneer interstellar travel and solve the mysteries of intelligent life in the universe. It was cooked up by the minds of Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg, and Russian physicist-venture capitalist Yuri Milner: titans of industry and/or astrophysics and/or interplanetary diplomacy, depending on how things work out.
In 2015, Milner approached Loeb with a question: would it be possible to bridge the gaps between the stars within his own lifetime?
For Loeb, the answer was a resounding yes. Six months later, Loeb and his team of students had narrowed the field of viable spacecraft options to a single design. A sufficiently reflective sail bombarded with light from a sufficiently focused laser might be able to push a sufficiently light payload—a chip similar in size, cost, and function to the guts of a cellphone—past the reaches of our solar system. Loeb is now so confident in the elegance of this design that he suggests that astronomy professors on other planets might have developed the same technology, and we might look for the telltale flashes of light glancing off their laser sails as a kind of extraterrestrial morse code.
“My hope is that once the spacecraft leaves the solar system, we’ll get a message back saying, ‘Welcome to the interstellar club’ from another civilization,” he says.
In fact, that kind of thinking is at the heart of Loeb’s mission.
“It will make us feel as citizens of a bigger environment,” he says. “Right now, most of us feel as citizens of a country, or the best of us think about ourselves as citizens of the world. But there are ten to the power of 20 planets similar to the earth in the observable volume of the universe—more than the number of grains of sand on all beaches on earth. So an emperor or a king that conquers a piece of land on Earth is similar to an ant that hugs a single grain of sand.”
Regardless of whether Breakthrough nets us interplanetary friends, he adds, we’re currently using up the earth. And, in a few billion years, the sun will explode. It’s high time to start looking for a new home, and “we could discover new worlds this way,” Loeb says.
In much the same vein, Breakthrough’s online copy reads like the starry-eyed manifesto of some benevolent intergalactic governing body in a sci-fi flick. “In the granular details of daily life, it’s easy to forget that we live in a place of astonishing grandeur and mystery,” Breakthrough’s “About” page rhapsodizes .
“The Breakthrough Initiatives are a program of scientific and technological exploration, probing the big questions of life in the Universe: Are we alone? Are there habitable worlds in our galactic neighborhood? Can we make the great leap to the stars? And can we think and act together – as one world in the cosmos?” True to genre, I can’t help but read something slightly sinister into the universe-unifying ambitions of Breakthrough. (And we thought Zuckerberg’s presidential bid was dystopian.)
Anyone who knows Loeb even a little shouldn’t be surprised by that lofty rhetoric. A self-described philosopher at heart, he speaks of astrophysics in amorous terms. He’s fascinated by the colorful details of interstellar travel: the thought that tidally locked planets produce regions of perpetual sunset, and that broadcasts from the golden age of radio are already radiating out past the edges of the solar system. Critics doubt that Starshot will be able to reach outside the solar system in just a few years, but regardless, it represents an unprecedented push skyward.
As fantastical as some of it may sound, Breakthrough is also making some more tangible strides. In June, they launched a number of prototype computer chips called, with characteristic brio, “starchips,” into low Earth orbit. Loeb proffers a chip, pressed between two layers of laminate, for my examination: a maze of minuscule wiring that looks like it weighs nothing (it’s actually more like a gram). For now, Loeb meets weekly with a group of undergrads and postdocs, working to develop the laser and the sail, which will need to be a near-perfect reflector in order to avoid immediately burning up in the laser’s focused beam.
At the heart of Breakthrough seems to be an optimism that, when and if we finally meet our interstellar neighbors, the best of humanity will prevail. Loeb thinks that in this species-defining moment, we’ll muster the ability to put aside our worst impulses and extend a hand in greeting. Judging by how well we’ve managed on just this planet alone, it doesn’t look promising. But standing in Loeb’s office, looking at the fingernail-sized chip of wiring that could carry our hopes to the stars, I want to believe it, too.

At Harvard, majors are called “concentrations” and minors are called “secondary concentrations.” We know what you’re thinking: That’s unnecessarily fancy and vague. Below, FM imagines better labels.
Major, Minor
It is your dear writer’s opinion that these highfalutin appellations are as pretentious as they are absurd; a rose is a rose and all that.
MAJOR, Major
NOTHING CONNOTES MORE AUTHORITY, MORE PRESTIGE, MORE VIGOROUS INTENSITY, THAN SOMETHING IN ALL CAPS.
Colonel, Major
We need an upgrade, so why not promote our titles? What’s better than a major? A colonel, that’s wot!
Majeur, Mineur
Harvard’s first rule when it comes to classing up something; if you want it fancy, it has to be in French. Eliot’s fanciest party isn’t called “Fête” for nothing.
Secondo, Contorno
These are words that describe different parts of an average Italian meal. Secondo dishes typically consist of a meat or fish. A contorno is a vegetable that accompanies said meat or fish. *kisses fingers*
Hypocenter, Epicenter
We are talking earth-shattering achievement here, so why not call it what it is?

Fong Auditorium in Boylston Hall is usually loud and full of activity on a weeknight. On this night, it was silent—but not devoid of conversation: Audience members and interpreters signed animatedly with each other in American Sign Language.
On Thursday, September 28, Harvard’s Deaf Awareness Club organized a panel to mark the close of Deaf Awareness Month. Four Deaf people from Harvard, Boston University, and the Boston Deaf Community answered questions about Deaf Lives—the name of the panel—as well as Deaf culture, and audism, which Bruce M. Bucci, a panelist and Deaf studies professor at Boston University, described as “the intentional ignoring and devaluing of Deaf culture.”
HARD-OF-HEARING AT HARVARD
In 2015, the National Association of the Deaf sued Harvard for failing to provide closed captioning on its online materials.
Sarah D. Gluck, a graduate student at Harvard and a panelist at the September event, highlighted accessibility issues at Harvard. “There are opportunities that I miss because I’m Deaf and because it’s hard to find an interpreter at the last minute,” Gluck said. Gluck said she often had to give more than two weeks’ notice to hire interpreters.
University Disabilities Coordinator Michele A. Clopper wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard University Disabilities Services continues to experience a shortage of in-person and remote interpreters, and seeks solutions to this challenge.
Gluck, in response, suggested that Harvard hire a full time ASL interpreter and caption all information and presentations.
The Harvard Deaf Awareness Club doesn’t know of any Deaf students at Harvard College, but some students are hard-of-hearing.. “A lot of times professors get annoyed with their microphone and so they’ll take it off,”  Kariss M. Alcorn ’18, a club member who is hard-of-hearing, said. “No one will speak up, and you don’t want to be that one person who speaks up, because it’s something that a lot of people with hearing loss are self-conscious about.” Many professors, she added, do not record their lectures or provide transcripts.
Taylor R. Joyce ’19, another hard-of-hearing student in the Harvard Deaf Awareness Club, said that Harvard sees accessibility as a “secondary cost.” According to her, deaf accessibility is not the norm in classrooms.
Clopper wrote that the UDS is “committed to providing supports that enable students to participate fully in all aspects of life at Harvard,” and that the quality of current translation services has been “praised by community members.”
NOT JUST ABOUT GRAMMAR
For-credit ASL classes were first offered at Harvard last year. Before then, students interested in ASL and Deaf culture could only take weekend classes through the Deaf Awareness Club. Kathryn Davidson, the organizer of Harvard’s ASL classes and an Assistant Professor of Linguistics, explained the for-credit classes were added because “a lot of students wanted to go more in-depth and devote more time than you can in weekend classes.”
Harvard currently offers 4 levels of ASL, and enrollment is strong. Last year, 100 people came to the first day of ASL 1, and half that many applied for about 20 spots.
Like any other language class at Harvard, lessons about ASL grammar and vocabulary are paired with lessons about Deaf culture. “That has been a wonderful surprise for lots of the students—how much taking an ASL class is about learning about a whole new culture, not just a completely different grammar,” Davidson said.
Yasmin Yacoby ’19, a member of the Deaf Awareness Club, said ASL, like any spoken language, has its own set of grammar rules and rich culture. But although ASL can now be taken for credit, it still does not fulfill the College’s language requirement, nor is it eligible for a citation.
Davidson said that the language requirement was put into place 10 years ago, when ASL wasn’t even offered. Some students, like  Lincoln J. Craven-Brightman ’20, a current ASL 3 student and Deaf Awareness Club University Initiatives Coordinator, worry that incoming freshmen deciding are discouraged from taking ASL because it does not fulfill the requirement.
“A lot of people have been contacting the office of undergraduate education about the language requirement,” Davidson said, “and so I hope that we won’t have to be asking this question for much longer.”
"ASL does not meet the current language requirement, and although there is interest in reviewing the requirement, students need to understand that the language requirement is set by the faculty and can only be changed by vote of the full faculty,"  Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noël Bisson wrote in an emailed statement. "Changing a faculty rule always takes time, and this particular change will require much consultation and several steps."
DEAF REPRESENTATION AT HARVARD    
Other universities vary in their ASL offerings and for-credit status. At the University of Pennsylvania, where ASL fulfills the language requirement, nine different ASL classes, as well as an ASL/Deaf Studies program, are offered. Yale, on the other hand, allows ASL to fulfill the language requirement only if students come in with prior knowledge of it.
Regardless of where other universities stand, the Deaf Awareness Club believes that Harvard should be a leader, not a follower, on this issue.
And ASL’s administrative status  has a greater impact than its effect on course schedules. For some students, ASL is as much a social justice priority as it is an academic one.
Maya V. Chung ’19, the student director of the Deaf Awareness Club, recounted how several weeks ago, Magdiel Sanchez, a deaf Latino man in Oklahoma, was fatally shot by two police officers. “Especially in this political climate,” Chung insisted, “Harvard needs to support the language and culture of Deaf people because minorities are too often being silenced. I don’t think Harvard can wait any longer.”
Students in the club also hope to change representation of Deaf students in Harvard’s population through campus tours conducted in ASL for prospective Deaf students.
Still, current hard-of-hearing students struggle with accessibility. And until there are adequate resources, bringing in Deaf students will be a challenge. “That’s something we’re working and fighting towards,” Craven-Brightman said. “We want Deaf people to see Harvard as a possibility, an opportunity. As Harvard is.”

When the poet Kevin Young ’92 wrote in his book of cultural criticism, The Grey Album: On the Blackness of Blackness, that “once you’re in, you’re in forever,” he did not mean Harvard, or his house, or a final club. Young meant the Dark Room Collective, one of the dozens of unofficial intellectual societies that have cropped up at Harvard over the centuries. Some of these societies blipped in and out of existence with little to distinguish them, but others gave rise to great minds, national social movements, and celebrated creative endeavors. A few even rubbed against the grain of mainstream Harvard culture. This week, FM takes you inside the histories of two of the groups: the Dark Room Collective and the notorious Psychedelic Club. 
Dark Room Collective
On the 8th of December 1987, Harvard students Sharan Strange ’81 and Thomas Sayers Ellis drove from Cambridge to New York City’s Cathedral of St. John the Divine to celebrate the life of the late writer James Baldwin. On that somber day, Ellis and Strange, aspiring writers themselves, realized they needed to make a major change in their educational and artistic trajectories.
They did not want to wait for the deaths of their idols to celebrate them—they needed to find a way to learn from the art of black poets while they were living. Led by this sentiment, Ellis and Strange founded the Dark Room Collective, a community of poets who would learn from one another and invite notable poets to visit Cambridge and share their work and knowledge. In one poem, Ellis wrote: “Baldwin died/ and we became a church.”
Back in Cambridge, the two poets turned their 3-story Victorian-style house in Central Square—31 Inman Street—into a hub for black artists. Though the building was not far from Harvard’s campus, the Collective was not affiliated with the University. In a 1998 interview with the journal Callaloo, Young recalled that the Collective provided a lesson in “the necessity of working hard, com[ing] up with something new––no one wanted to be the weak link in the chain! It was like joining a big band or something and cutting your chops that way, before you became a soloist or had your own gig.”
The group worked foremost as a literary organization. In the Callaloo interview, Ellis explained their process: “[W]e’d read one book, then trade and share different books. We didn’t always read them in the order they were written, but would place them in order and talk about why one book was written after another; we looked for the things that held books together, argued with decisions authors made and made critical judgments, all the time developing our own tastes and literary vocabularies. Lonely fun done together.”
They also wrote and edited works of their own. The Collective set up a system of pairing older poets with younger ones to review each other’s work. Visiting writers would also help critique the members’ poems and essays—and there were a lot of visitors. The Collective was sprawling, both in terms of its inclusivity and its occupation of physical space. Sometimes the house was so full, audiences for readings would spill out onto the street. In a 2005 interview, member Tisa Bryant said, “We’d get some water and some snacks and some stuff and put some music on, clean the house and everybody would come in.”
The Collective offered more than just literary development for students. It played a vital role in the visibility and solidarity of black poets in America. Strange noted that the Collective provided black writers with “a way of overcoming isolation,” and was an opportunity to “share similar struggles with writing with other Black people.” During the 80’s, mainstream poetry was dominated by the voices of white Americans and Europeans, but the Dark Room Collective subverted that norm. It was a place to celebrate the voices of black writers who were being ignored in white, mainstream literary groups.
Several of the members of the Dark Room Collective went on to win notable awards, including United States Poets Laureates Natasha Trethewey and Tracy K. Smith, New Yorker poetry editor Kevin Young, and MacArthur Genius Colson Whitehead, alongside many others.
And it made room for more kinds of black experiences than Harvard’s white-centric climate had previously allowed. “Thank God there were so many of us,” Ellis told Callaloo. “[We] got to hear so many people and so many people being straight, gay, and of Haitian descent and people from the South and people from the Midwest and the West Coast.” The Dark Room Collective, as Natasha Trethewey put it, took a stand against any “essentialized notion of blackness or black experience,” it made room for “different experiences, different voices, different styles.”
Psychedelic Club
Timothy Leary, a psychologist at Harvard, was first introduced to psychedelic mushrooms during a 1960 trip to Mexico. Leary’s first taste of psilocybin profoundly changed his personal and professional trajectory.
“In four hours by that swimming pool in Guernavaca I learned more about the mind, the brain and its structures than I did in the preceding 15 years as a diligent psychologist,” Leary wrote in his memoir, “Flashbacks.”
“I learned that the brain is an underutilized biocomputer containing billions of unaccessed neurons. I learned that normal consciousness is one drop in an ocean of intelligence. That consciousness and intelligence can be systematically expanded,” he wrote. “The brain can be reprogrammed. That the knowledge of how the brain works is the most pressing scientific issue of our time. I was beside myself with enthusiasm, convinced we had found the key [for behavior change] we had been looking for.”
After 1960, Leary was driven with messianic fervor to investigate psilocybin, which he suspected would unlock the secrets of the mind and subjective consciousness. That year, he began the Harvard Psilocybin Project with his partner Richard Alpert in order to study the drug’s effects on the human psyche and unleash its potential, which to Leary seemed nearly unlimited.
In the first experiment of the Harvard Psilocybin Project, Leary gave 175 participants (mostly men in their late 20s) doses of psilocybin. Responses were overwhelmingly positive. According to the Project’s records, over half of participants claimed they had learned a great deal about themselves and that psilocybin had changed their lives for the better. Ninety percent of participants wanted to take it again.
Outside of the official research of the Harvard Psilocybin Project, a cult-like circle began forming around Leary and these psychedelic drugs. According to Don Lattin, former club member and author of “The Harvard Psychedelic Club,” Leary frequently “turned on” new people, often inviting them to his suburban home in Newton.
Leary was constantly surrounded by a rotating cast of celebrity characters, including his prominent psychology colleagues, religion scholar Huston Smith, the poet Allen Ginsberg, the writer William Burroughs, and even the author Aldous Huxley, who also helped pioneer psychedelics with his 1954 memoir, “The Doors of Perception,” one of the first western accounts of mescaline.
It wasn’t long, however, before the Psychedelic Club ran into trouble. Leary grew less and less concerned with the science of the studies, favoring advocacy for the drug over research—a pursuit that was met with strong disapproval from Harvard. When Leary did conduct research, he did so using unorthodox methods,  drawing skepticism from the scientific community. Leary often took drugs alongside his test subjects, for example, flouting standard practice.
In response, some of Leary’s colleagues, including Frank Barron, distanced themselves from the Project. Shortly after, Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) replaced Leary as the Project’s senior advisor.
Eventually, the club collapsed. As Lattin told it, the final straw came from two undergraduates—Ronnie Winston and Andrew Weil—who wanted desperately to try out the psychedelic experience. Leary refused the two students, because at 18, they were too young to participate in the project. But Winston soon developed a close relationship with Alpert, who gave him some psilocybin at a party.
When Weil found out, he was overcome with jealousy. He decided to destroy the club. Weil called Winston’s father—the wealthy diamond magnate, Harry Winston—who pressured his son to speak up about his involvement with the Psychedelic Club. Winston’s confession was all the evidence Weil needed to take down the Harvard Psilocybin Project in a scathing Crimson Op-Ed.
In 1963, Alpert and Leary were fired from Harvard. In response to his dismissal, Leary famously quipped, “LSD is more important than Harvard.” Soon after, the two founded the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF), an independent corporation to further investigate psychedelics.
“The relationship of our project to Harvard has always been uneasy,” Leary wrote regarding his work. “We were enthusiastically introducing a powerful, non-verbal, meta-intellectual agent into a community which is fervently dedicated to words and intellectuality. We appreciated and sympathized with the academy’s dilemma, and congenially separated when IFIF was formed.”
The split may have been good for Leary in the long run. After Harvard, he and Alpert became the self-stylized prophets of 60’s counterculture, popping up in places like Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, and giving interviews in the pages of popular magazines. Three years after his firing, Learing told Playboy about his first psychedelic experience.
“At that time, I was a middle-aged man involved in the middle-aged process of dying,” he said. “My joy in life, my sensual openness, my creativity were all sliding downhill. Since that time, six years ago, my life has been renewed in almost every dimension.”

The Ridge Top Swim Club in North Haven, Connecticut has a pool, a jungle gym and a gazebo. It also has some beat-up tennis courts, a snackbar run by an ex-con named Sal, and a large field that would almost be good for soccer if not for the slight incline. Ridge Top offers a range of standard summertime amenities, but my parents, who don’t play tennis or swim really, joined back in 2002 for the discount day camp, the gaggle of old ladies with whom my father played bridge every Sunday, and an annual event that my sister and I fell in love with, anticipating every year with the anxiety we usually reserved for Christmas: the end-of-season, all-club Camp Out.
The Camp Out arrived after a stretch of slow, summer weeks which followed a certain rhythm. Mornings, my sister and I spent hours at the day camp, which consisted of, more or less, a babysitter with an assortment of colorful string for converting into bracelets. Evenings, my parents would meet us for a picnic dinner and then we’d pile in the battered silver conversion van we called simply “The Van,” and head home. By the second week of summer, my sister and I were desperate for a break from braiding lanyards, capturing flags, and weaving hotpads for the kitchen.
But the suspense really mounted in July, when flyers for the Camp Out went up all around Ridge Top. They were unavoidable: The big day bragged on the page in a fat red font; the rain date hid in italics below, dangling the prospect of still more postponement. The design always involved the same stock image: a perfect triangular prism of a tent, a fire, and weenies roasting on a spit, all over a backdrop of cartoonish pine trees. The captions, with the pithy vagueness of a little league coach, alternately implored us to “Get back to nature!,” “Sleep under the stars!,” or “Take a walk on the wild side!”
There were few trees or weenies at Ridge Top and, like our summer schedule, there was nothing wild or unpredictable about the Camp Out. Everything was planned. At 6:00 p.m., families pitched their tents. This was not a gradual process: the field filled with tarps and poles all at once, transforming the slope into a patchwork of beige, navy, and forest green. After the set-up, everyone ate dinners in a public and overlapping way — kids could jump between one table of collards and potato salad to another serving hotdogs, or barter their Capri-suns for cups of red Koolaid. After dark, everyone migrated to a back part of the field, where years ago, someone had dug a fire-pit. One of the parents would build a Jenga-tower of Duraflame logs and get a big pyre going, while kids foraged for long s’mores roasting sticks. (Even in the dark, you could tell who had hit puberty from how they made s’mores. Older kids stuck to the embers, slowly roasting their marshmallows into subtle, golden orbs. Younger kids lit their marshmallows on fire. They would blow out the flames and slip off the charred skin, unveiling a small, soft center.) At eleven, my parents would drive home to sleep in their real bed, while my sister and I roughed it in a paper-thin tent my dad had snagged from a Walmart discount sale. In the morning, everyone unzipped their shelters to a light layer of dew, and a spread of Camper’s Breakfast—coffee, bagels and trail mix. We brushed our teeth in the fully-flushable bathrooms, showered, packed up our tent, and waited for our parents to return with The Van.
We had a good five-year run of Camp Outs before I realized the flaw in this ritual, while sitting in the backseat of The Van. This car, notably, was not a standard suburban minivan, but a massive cargo vehicle with seven seats, fourteen cup holders, a decade of stains, and a small TV squished between the driver and passenger seats. This was my family’s only TV, so it was in The Van that my sister and I first became familiar with Pixar or Martin Scorsese or the soundtrack to Dirty Dancing. Twice a year we made 16-hour slogs to South Carolina to visit our relatives, and on one of these trips my sister and I went on a survival story bender. We watched movies like Castaway, Robinson Crusoe and Jeremiah Johnson. Movies where people take to the wild for real — with little more than worn-in hiking boots, a pocket knife and a gift for tying knots. Where characters are on their own for days at a time, cooking food on spits, peeing behind bushes and leaving no trace. Where they swim in lakes, not pools, and light fires with the friction of two sticks, not vacuum-packed firestarters. They are nowhere near flush toilets or jungle gyms. They do not make s’mores. On this trip, it struck me that the Ridge Top Camp Out lacked something. That it was too planned. Too tame. The Camp Out wasn’t real camping at all (which would be raw and wild), but a simulation of it. It was fake. If real camping prompted a return to nature, the Camp Out boiled down to a staged encounter, a well-choreographed rendezvous.
Ridge Top might have seemed wild to me because I don’t come from North Haven, but the neighboring New Haven, a city eight times its size with half its median income. New Haven isn’t a big city. But it is urban enough that in the 19th century, a landscape designer named Donald Mitchell undertook to make it somewhat less city-like. New Haven is framed by two massive, jutting rock faces and it was Mitchell’s idea to give both back to nature, to let them be reclaimed by trees and vines, and refresh the city with a small patch of rurality. Mitchell and his design firm—run by the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted—developed the notion of the urban park (Olmsted had first realized his idea in New York; he called it Central Park). Now, Mitchell’s work has surrounded the two rocks with lush green spaces, winding tree-covered trails and rivers dammed into reservoirs. City-dwellers can fish, hike or camp there, while tall trees hide the busy streets nearby.
On one of the trails on East Rock, the closer of the two rocks to my house, the city installed a small gold plaque, engraved with the first sentence of Henry David Thoreau’s famous nature essay, “Walking:”
“I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness, as contrasted with a freedom and culture merely civil—to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.”
There is something contradictory about this plaque—an engraved, civically-funded, professionally-installed monument to absolute freedom and wildness—and only more so because there is nothing free or wild about East Rock. Mitchell wanted the park to serve as a “return to nature,” but he had a very particular idea of how that return should play out. Every element of the design was executed in service of a specific vision laid out by his firm’s founder, Olmsted, who employed a method called the “Seven S’s,” for its seven basic principles: Scenery, Suitability, Style, Subordination, Separation, Sanitation, and Service. “All turf, trees, flowers, fences, walks, water, paint, plaster, posts and pillars in or under which there is not a purpose of direct utility or service are inartistic if not barbarous,” Olmsted wrote in one of his manuscripts. “So long as considerations of utility are neglected or overridden by considerations of ornament, there will be not true art.” As Olmsted’s disciple, Mitchell was no Thoreau, sauntering through the woods with abandon, but more of a Daedalus, the master artificer parading around a maze of his own making.
Implicit in the notion of camping, of hiking, of fishing, at least when performed by city-dwellers whose lifestyle does not rely on those practices, is the belief that getting “back to nature,” getting closer to it, prompts a return to a simpler, more germinal state of being. To that condition Thoreau describes as “a great awakening light, as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in autumn.” I don’t mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with natural activities, or even that they are any less pleasant than advertised, only that to bluntly oppose them to the “freedom and culture merely civil,” as Thoreau does, is deceptive. Or at least requires a suspension of disbelief.
Take, for example, my first real camping trip. In high school, I hiked a part of the Appalachian trail with a small group. On the first night, we stopped in a clearing. I set up the same Walmart tent my sister and I had slept in all those summers, and built a fire from newspaper, nearby twigs and a little lighter fluid—I didn’t rub sticks. We prepared a dinner of sandwiches and s’mores. I wore worn-in hiking boots. The next morning, as we packed up, a friend pulled the surviving scraps of newspaper out of our makeshift fire pit. “Leave no trace,” he said. “We have to leave the landscape as we found it.” He put the scraps in a ziplock bag he carried in his backpack. As he spoke, I realized my friend had said the thing that I had always felt, had spilled the secret, had let slip what Tom Wolfe called the “seemingly innocuous words in passing, that give the game away.” He had admitted, while upholding the cardinal rule of camping, that we were pretending, that our return to nature was part charade. That in entering the wild, we were still outside it. We risked leaving relics, of staining nature with culture merely civil, at every turn. As we continued our hike, we kept collecting traces: slipping newspaper, toilet paper and food scraps into baggies and tossing dirt over our firepits.
There is something undeniably satisfying about camping: a delicious feeling of self-sufficiency, a moment of reprieve from everyday life, an occasion to eat s’mores. But no matter how you shake it, the act is a subtly choreographed affair. There is no rupture from culture merely civil: humans are culture merely civil; our presence implies it. To camp—to leave your bed for the forest, to eat food you catch rather than buy from the butcher—implies the civil and natural spheres are two separate things, and separate enough that you could take leave of the former and immerse yourself in the latter. I’m not convinced. Real camping was no more natural than Ridge Top. For those five days, as we wormed our way through the rocky terrain, we lived somewhat off the land, but mostly off trail mix. At one point, I caught a fish. Then, I cooked it on a portable grill and added the bones to my  collection of trash. At the end of the trip, my parents picked us up in The Van.
Sections
“You did it!” and “Welcome” sprawl across red brick and colorful autumn leaves. Part of a bulking envelope that the College mails to around matriculating students each year, the Harvard College Handbook for Students offers a peek into undergraduate life. Although the handbook advertises the school’s 400+ student organizations, it offers little insight into their often-difficult application processes.
“Comps are this well-hidden secret that admissions never talks about,” Katherine M. Lempres ’21 says.
The word’s origins, too, are mysterious. As early as The Crimson’s founding in 1873, the word “comp” was used to describe what used to be a competitive process for new members vying for spots in the paper. Today, the word is a staple of campus vocabulary, and though it has no official definition, Harvard students know and use it regularly.
A comp “essentially means an elongated application,” Murimi Nyamu ’20, who has successfully comped Harvard Financial Analysts Club, Harvard Investment Association, and Crimson Key Society, says.
At Harvard, these “elongated applications” are ubiquitous. Ask any freshman, and they’ll rattle off notorious comps like digits of pi. Most student organizations require prospective members to jump over at least a hurdle or two, through completing tasks, demonstrating competence, or sometimes, competiting against candidates.
And many students don’t mind. Fresh out of the college admissions process, many Harvard undergrads associate competition with success. If anything, they seek out opportunities to prove themselves.
“I read this somewhere, that you jump through this huge hoop of getting into Harvard, and you just want to jump through more to get this adrenaline going again,” Lauren Fadiman ’21 says.
Then, somebody gets cut. For some groups, not all of those who participate in the “comp” gain admittance to the organization. So, while students may value the competitive nature of these processes, not everyone can win. Resulting disappointments reaffirm criticisms of Harvard’s internal exclusivity.
“For the very first thing to happen to you—for someone to tell you no, you can’t do this thing that you love—that’s a pretty depressing start to college,” Posy Stoller ’21 says.
With so many organizations having comps and barriers to entry, Harvard becomes a difficult place to navigate. Intense comps often intimidate students, driving them away from new activities.
“Harvard always says that we have a million clubs, so there’s so much that you can do, but in reality, the number of clubs that are completely open is pretty limited,” Stoller says. “College is a chance to experiment and try new things, and comping here just makes that impossible. I wish that someone who would’ve told me it’d be like that before I got here.”
Recognizing widely held frustrations and a need for transparency amongst comps, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, created a student organization “Q-Guide” last spring. The Q-Guide is a site of all the student organizations registered under the Office of Student Life, with responses rating organizations and their entry processes, including comps.
One semester yielded 1,200 responses—a good start, but many organizations have less than one can count on a single hand, and some none at all. Updated at the end of each semester, the Q-Guide will serve as a living entity and resource for information and student feedback as it changes over time.
As freshmen scramble to make friends, introducing themselves to new faces in Annenberg, comps can place even more stress on budding relationships. Stoller is hesitant to talk about organizations that she successfully comped in front of friends who didn’t make the cut, and similarly, feels a little jealous of friends who got through comps that she didn’t.
“It’s hard,” Stoller says. “I feel like comping can make you jealous of people, and it can definitely hurt your self esteem.”
COMPETE OR COMPLETE
Completion-based comps, which rarely make cuts based on ability or quality of performance, may be the most accessible. Nonetheless, they can be notoriously difficult.
Students comping the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, for example, must attend one hour of lecture and one other hour of section each week, then complete a mandatory homework assignment. In addition to weekly requirements, HFAC compers are expected to prepare a stock pitch at the end of the comp. For many, this time commitment is equivalent to an academic course.
Julian Ubriaco ’20 said the HFAC comp taught him the basics of finance. Because Harvard doesn’t offer undergraduate finance courses, Ubriaco saw the comp as a valuable way to learn a practical skill.
“I don’t believe people get ‘cut,’” Ubriaco says. “You really have to have poor attendance or not be in contact with the board ahead of time or something.”
That said, HFAC’s requirements usually draw in more ambitious compers in the beginning of the school year, until the semester starts rolling, midterms start hitting, and compers realize that they’ve bit off more than they can chew. At that point, Ubriaco says, many compers drop. Mark Whittaker ’18, HFAC comp director, declined to comment.
The Crimson is also a predominantly completion-based comp that runs through the whole semester. “Joining any of The Crimson’s 10 boards occurs via a semester-long comp process that is designed to be educational and enjoyable,” Crimson President Derek K. Choi ’18 writes in an emailed statement.
Though completion-based comps do not make cuts based on performance, they do have strategies for restricting membership: heavy completion requirements. WHRB, the Harvard Radio Broadcasting club, has a completion-based comp with a large time commitment, according to  Lempres, who recently completed the comp. “It was definitely a completion comp, not competitive,” she says. “But it winnowed people down.”
Yet not every comp is completion-based. Indeed, many of the most prestigious comps are explicitly competitive.
Each spring, a wave of red poster covers campus, from chalkboards to toilet stalls to the nook in the bottom of the library shelf. “Comp Crimson Key!” the posters read.
The Crimson Key Society, which organizes Freshman Orientation Week and runs regular campus tours, is one of the most selective. Membership in the organization is capped at 90 each year, which, according to Comp Director Shub Chhokra ’18, an inactive Crimson editor, yielded 30 new members this past spring from an original 261 compers—an acceptance rate just below 11.5 percent.
Chhokra argues that the comp is especially important to Crimson Key. “We really need to vet people before they can be ambassadors,” he says. “We don’t want to just put anyone in front of tourists. At the end of the day, it shines not only poorly on Crimson Key, but also Harvard University, so you need to have a certain quality of your tour and your professionalism. That’s why we have a comp.”
When it comes to selectivity, HCCG also accepts far less members than vying compers. Founded in 2006, HCCG has quickly risen in recognition for its competitive entry process: a two-week application period that the Q-Guide categorizes as a “comp.” In 2015, it declared itself “the most selective pre-professional student group on Harvard’s campus (~12% acceptance rate).”
“HCCG prides itself on its low acceptance rate (after pulling the classic college admissions trick of getting awareness out there to increase the denominator, applications received), leading to a culture of arrogance,” one Q-guide respondent writes.
Isaac Xia ’18, the director of HCCG, declined to comment.
In the two weeks of the HCCG comp, Carra. S. Wu ’21 prepared for an interview and pulled an all-nighter in order to craft a case presentation. She says that what drew her to comp the organization in the first place was its “compelling informational meeting,” and older friends who told her that HCCG was their “defining moment of Harvard.”
Wu defends the demanding and competitive process, highlighting some of its benefits such as bringing her closer to the board members. “I’m glad, in retrospect, that I did that, because now I have some members on the board who I feel really comfortable around,” Wu says.
Other organizations don’t release statistics about their selectivity, yet word-of-mouth stories about both the comps and the internal nature of the organizations themselves draw people in.
Curious about the myths surrounding the comp of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, Stoller went to the first meeting.
“I think the Lampoon is the example of the group that has the mystery, oh-so-exclusive kind of air around them, and that really does draw people to them,” she says. “I’ve talked to a million people who are like, ‘I don’t get the Lampoon, but I want to be in the Lampoon.’”
Alice Ju ’18, President of the Lampoon, wrote in an emailed statement, “There is no social comp, and we have no quotas. The compers should not contact us, think about us, or come near the Castle on Thursdays.”
A SOCIAL COMPONENT
When it comes to organizations with a competition comp, evaluations aren’t always based solely on the quality of the product at hand. Checking off the boxes on requirements and perfect attendance at meetings isn’t always enough. An organization with a competitive comp oftentimes interacts with compers in more informal settings, introducing the potential for another factor of admittance: a social component.
Grace E. Sullivan ’21, who’s currently going through three comps, says that the ambiguity surrounding comps is confounded by the idea of the social comp. “I think that’s also what strikes a lot of people as unfair at first. It becomes alarming,” she says.
The organization Q-Guide tries to quantify how social a comp is by asking respondents to rate the degree to which selection criteria are based on “relevant skills” on a scale from 5 (absolutely) to 1 (not at all). The plurality of respondents rated the Crimson Key Society, for example, a 1.
“Wow! Did not know this q guide let us rate final clubs!” one respondent writes.
The Crimson Key Society is just one of the organizations that faces criticisms regarding the ambiguity of its social component. From the outside, it may seem arbitrary and immeasurable, yet members justify that certain social skills are inherently tied to the quality of the organization’s product.
Luis Viceira ’20, a member of Crimson Key Society, defends the social component of the comp. “For certain organizations, the ability to be social can be measured,” he says. “For instance, how comfortable are you giving a tour in front of someone? Or, on the other hand, you also have to be able to make your audience member relate to your personal stories about being a college student, in addition to knowing all the facts.”
The Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service comp has a social element too: Prospective members must get a meal with every current member. Membership fluctuates around 30.
Karen L. Yang ’20, a member of OAASIS, says that the comp seemed like an extended application process that tested her commitment. “It’s hard for you to keep your eye on what you want, especially when you’re just putting in 27 hours of getting meals with people,” Yang says.
Many times, students feel affirmed when they are invited to be a part of an organization with such a process. Stoller was recently elected to the tech board of Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which advertises itself as “the most fun group on campus. No experience required. No experience preferred.”
“That was a social comp,” Stoller says. She goes on to characterize the competitive process as a bonding experience, “The Pudding is going to be my family now.”
Sullivan acknowledges that social evaluations can be important but appreciates honesty in how she is evaluated during the comp. “I don’t think it’d be possible to remove the social aspect, but it’d be good to have more transparency about it,” she says. “During the [Intercollegiate Model UN] process, they said, ‘This is a question to see how well you fit in with the group.’”
These concerns are exactly what Sachee and Khansarinia hoped to address with the organization Q-Guide.
“We just wanted to make it transparent, or as transparent as it can be,” Sachee says. “Because right now, every year, we get a new class of students that go through the school, and they go through a lot of the comps, and the same conversations that happened last year happens again, like, ‘This comp was really bad, this comp was this and that.’”
FINDING SUCCESS IN FAILURE
Ubriaco comped HCCG three times, and each time, failed.
While the comp processes for many extracurricular organizations exemplify Harvard’s current obstacles of exclusivity, students often see the value in competition.
“Adversity is something that you’ll face in life,” Viciera says. “So it’s important that you’ll handle it in some manner, and that when something doesn’t go the way you want it to that you’ll focus on the next most important thing.”
For overachieving students, comps are also a way to limit overcommitment. “Everyone here wants to do a million things, but if [they] actually do a million things, then they’re all doing a million things that no one’s really committed to,” Lempres says.
Wu agrees, adding that the process is self-selective and promotes a heightened connection to one’s involvements. “People tend to care more about the clubs that they do,” she says.
Reflecting this pragmatism, the organization Q-Guide sets out only to distribute information about comps, not to change anything about them. Khansarinia thinks that it’s not up to the UC or the College to mandate or restrict the comp processes of Harvard’s student organizations.
“If we take for granted that comps are an imperfect process, then the way to change that should be naturally through students who’ve come through organizations who give comps, not because the [Office of Student Life] or the College or us say, ‘Hey, you better change that,’” he says.
Although some students criticize elements of the comp process and call for increased transparency, most do not seek to abolish comps altogether. And it’s hard to imagine Harvard without them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 3, 2017 at 3:06 p.m.
The Cambridge Human Rights Commission is working to ensure local businesses are aware of and comply with a state law on gender discrimination—particularly when it comes to gender-neutral restrooms.
Last year, Massachusetts updated its laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in places of public accommodation, which include restaurants, theaters, stores, and hotels. According to an explanatory guide that accompanied the updates, Massachusetts “protects the right of all people—including transgender people—to use sex-segregated facilities that are most consistent with their sincerely held gender identity,” including bathrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms.
Nancy B. Schlacter, executive director of the Human Rights Commission—a Cambridge body appointed by the City Manager—said that not all Cambridge businesses are aware of the new law or how it could affect them. To address this, the Commission plans to hold optional trainings for local businesses in February or March to increase awareness of the law, what it stipulates, and how businesses can best comply with it.
“We’re not making law here in Cambridge, we’re just trying to raise awareness about an existing state law,” Schlacter said. “It’s not like we’re calling for them to them to tear up their bathrooms and change them. It’s letting them know what the law is, particularly training the staff to understand the law that a person can use their bathroom of choice based on their gender identity.”
Charlie’s Kitchen, a Harvard Square restaurant and bar, is one of a few local businesses that has explicitly designated gender-neutral bathrooms—its restrooms are three separate stalls with gender-neutral signage. Luke O’Neill-Waddie, a manager at Charlie’s Kitchen, said the bathrooms have been like this for at least five to ten years.
“It’s been quite a normal thing here, especially for the regulars,”said O’Neill-Waddie, although he added that sometimes tourists are “thrown off” by the concept. “Every now and then a person will come up and be like ‘I’m glad you guys are being progressive with the bathrooms’ and we’re like ‘Oh thanks, we’ve been doing it for a while,” he said.
Because not many businesses currently have explicitly gender-neutral bathrooms, Schlacter said it is especially important to help Cambridge store owners understand how to comply with the law.
“Everyone shares the right to use the bathroom that comports with their gender identity,” Schlacter said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said she couldn’t think of any local businesses with gender-neutral bathrooms, but said that Harvard Square businesses are “incredibly welcoming to all people.”
“It’s not an issue here that I know of,” Jillson said. “We’ve never had a complaint come through on an email, a phone call, or in person where somebody felt they had been treated inappropriately. It just doesn’t happen.”
City Councilor Jan Devereux said she supports the Human Rights Commission’s efforts to educate businesses about this, but said she does not expect City Council to be involved unless there is a zoning change that needs to be made. Devereux added that her reelection campaign office at WeWork on Mass. Ave. has a gender-neutral, multi-stall bathroom—the first one she has encountered.
Harvard College has also recently worked to add gender-neutral bathrooms, and all 12 Houses will include gender-neutral bathrooms after House renewal is complete.

Harvard Law School has raised $365 million for its capital campaign since its launch in 2015, according to Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82.
When the campaign publicly launched in 2015, the Law School had already raised $241 million of its $305 million goal. The Law School did not set a new goal after reaching its milestone earlier this year.
Manning said in an interview that the Law School will continue to solicit donations for the campaign—a portion of Harvard’s $8 billion University-wide effort—through the end of the school year.
“We’ve got until June 30th to continue to raise money and we will,” Manning said. “We will be trying.”
The effort is called “The Campaign for the Third Century,” referencing the fact that the Law School celebrates its 200th birthday this year.
The current campaign set a more modest goal than the school’s previous fundraising push—which launched in 2008 and raised $476 million to surpass a $400 million goal. When the “Third Century” campaign was launched in 2015, Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean for development and alumni relations, said the Law School wouldn’t be launching a campaign at that time if not for the University-wide effort. The relative recency of this previous campaign and fears of over-soliciting donations led to the current campaign’s tempered goals.
Manning also said that the Law School’s finances remain “on a good course” despite low returns on the University’s endowment in the past few years—Harvard’s endowment grew 8.1 percent in fiscal year 2017, placing it last among Ivy League endowments. He credited the Law School’s stability to former dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow’s financial management.
“I think my predecessor was a fiscally prudent and responsible steward of the institution,” Manning said.

A student-created report on Harvard Law School and the United States' commitment to providing legal services to the public argues that the Law School needs to do more to guide students into public interest law instead of corporate practice.
The report, primarily authored by current third-year Law student Pete D. Davis ’12, argues that the Law School needs to refocus on training its graduates for public interest careers. Davis released the report to  students, faculty, and alumni at the HLS in the World Summit, which featured a host of prominent speakers and alumni from the school.
“People feel like the law doesn’t work for the many and only works for the few, and I’d love it in our third century for Harvard Law to change that,” he said.
Five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, a Law School graduate, knows Davis and has endorsed the report.  He said that Law Schools clinics — which provide pro bono legal services in a wide variety of legal fields— do not do enough to address the issues the legal system faces.  More than 77 percent of students  work in one of the dozens of clinics.
“The Law School is not making an effort through its influence, through its testimonies, through its leadership, through actually using some of its endowment to start needy legal institutions around the country,” Nader said.  “It’s not addressing the broader need around the country for legal services.”
Dean of the Law School John F. Manning ’82 said in an interview that both he and the Law School are strong advocates for public interest.
“Harvard Law School is very supportive of public interest,” Manning said. “From the very outset we have a very large, energetic office of public advising, we have a program on law and social change that really helps people identify and think about careers that try to affect social change.”
According to Manning, students in the class of 2017 spent an average of 586 hours working pro bono, well beyond the school’s required 50 hours.
Davis’s report examines the school’s statistical record for sending students to public interest careers after graduation, arguing that the school could still do more. He also provides a series of possible solutions, including reforming the first-year curriculum, making admissions decisions based on demonstrated commitment to public interest, and creating a culture of “civic ambition.”

Education school Professor Fernando Reimers discussed the Graduate School of Education’s commitment to global issues, explaining and promoting two of the school’s key initiatives at an event last Friday.
Part of the Education school’s “Askwith” series, the forum, titled “Learning to Change the World,” was part of the University’s first-ever WorldWide Week. Reimers talked about the school’s mission of creating educational opportunities that extend beyond Cambridge.
“The school has educated thousands of students who have gone on to advance public education all over the world,” he said. “Our faculty has conducted research in many different settings around the world, and we have built scores of international collaborations in that process.”
According to Reimers, the Ed School strives to advance “Harvard’s cosmopolitan ambition” to understand the world and to be of service to the world by sharing knowledge that can improve it through education.
Reimers currently leads the school’s Global Education Innovation Initiative, a program that designs new tools and curriculums to support effective educational practices that teach children in ten different countries. The program produces digital resources and hosts conferences for educators from around the world.
“We hope to promote dialogue and learning among education policymakers, leaders, practitioners, and researchers on educational purposes in the 21st century and practices to achieve them,” he said.
Reimers said the initiative works to empower young people, particularly those who are the most vulnerable and least privileged, through public education systems.
Reimers also serves as faculty director of The International Education Policy Program, a year-long and full-time program that allows graduate students to explore educational challenges that pertain to various regions around the world, such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa.
Ameya Kamath, a student at the Education School and a master’s candidate in the program, said that under the Reimers’ guidance, he hopes to implement curriculums that will help to better the quality of education in India, his native country.
“In the classroom we’re focused on our own settings, but thinking of the greater world and education in different contexts and cultures really helps develop competency, leadership, and social entrepreneurship in children,” said Kamath. “We’re using the world as our playground.”
Kamath said the relationships Reimers has developed over the course of his career have positioned him well to lead the Ed School’s global initiatives.
“He’s very connected with multiple state actors and international organizations such as UNESCO and UNICEF and it makes him a very suitable person to be working in the realm of international education,” Kamath said.
Dana C. McCoy, an associate professor at the Education School, said the school’s educational goals should reflect the strength and diversity of a global society.
“I would also say that increasingly outside of Harvard we are a global society,” she said. “The world is becoming more global and interconnected and to ignore those connections is really antithetical to the goals of higher education.”

Brothers Daniel and Jordan Allott, who are currently working on a documentary to understand how President Donald Trump won the 2016 election, encouraged students to engage with citizens from across the political spectrum in a discussion at the Institute of Politics Wednesday evening.
Jordan Allott, a filmmaker, and Daniel Allott, an editor for the Washington Examiner, are currently working on “The Race to 2020,” a project they said will seek to track the popularity of Trump’s presidency.
Between 2017 and 2020, the Allott brothers said they will spend months interviewing and seeking to understand the political climate in nine counties across rural America that they deemed crucial to the 2020 presidential election.
“It’s our attempt to better understand the people and places that put Donald Trump in the White House,” Daniel Allott said. “For us personally, I think after the election, it was pretty clear many people in the media got the election wrong.”
“They didn’t anticipate the rise of Donald Trump or his election victory,” he added.
The brothers said they hope to capture on camera how Trump’s presidential campaign and administration have resonated with voters.
“We wanted to give a voice to people in parts of the country that often feel like they’ve been ignored,” Jordan said.
After almost a year on the project, the Allotts said their experiences have led them to conclude that voters find familiarity in Trump’s honest tone and genuine approach.
They showed previews of their documentary, including a clip of Mark, a lifelong Democrat who had voted for Trump.
“I think there are tens of thousands of people like Mark all over the country,” Daniel Allott said. “This project is about finding them, talking to them, and trying to understand where they’re coming from.”
Jordan Allott added that they found an image of Trump that was more than just the “hatred and fear and doom and gloom” portrayed by the media. When the Allotts had asked voters to sum up the reason for Trump’s victory in one word, he said, the most common answers were “hope” and “change.”
“For a lot of voters, including some Obama voters, [Trump] was a candidate of hope,” Jordan said.

Weeks after their peers hobnobbed with recruiters from management consulting and finance firms, College seniors interested in pursuing public sector careers had their chance to network with potential employers on Oct. 27.
The fourth annual Public Service Recruitment Day consisted of an interview portion with employers including the Boston’s mayor’s office, the NAACP, and the Peace Corps at Philip Brooks House, followed by a reception at Cabot House. According to Travis A. Lovett, who directs the Center for Public Interest Careers, 135 students applied to participate in this year’s recruitment day, a joint effort between the Office of Career Services, CPIC, the Institute of Politics, and Philip Brooks House.
Lovett said that the organizers were motivated to hold Public Service Recruitment Day after hearing student concerns about the lack of structure in public sector hiring. Nonprofit organizations often hire sporadically, waiting until they receive grant money or have a vacancy in a position before they can hire more staff members.
With the Public Service Recruitment Day, Lovett said CPIC sought to emulate the more structured consulting and finance hiring process.
“[OCS has] been able to provide some advice about what it’s like to work with Bain, McKinsey, Goldman-Sachs, and so forth to give us a sense of, ‘Okay, how can we replicate the practices that are working well for these particular organizations?’” he said.
Nicholas J. Abbott ’18, who said he plans to pursue a career in local government, said that waiting for public sector jobs that may come in the springtime can be difficult.
“It’s not just about there being enough opportunities, but the timing of those opportunities, especially for seniors who may be trying to make plans about where they might want to live next year or just have economic security,” Abbott said.
According to Gene A. Corbin, Assistant Dean of Student Life for Public Service, around one in five seniors who participated in the recruiting day have received job offers.
Madeleine H. Stern ’18, who interviewed at the event, commended the office's effort.
“I think it’s a really great and important event that Harvard does to kind of elevate the work that these organizations are doing and give students an opportunity to interact with those kinds of careers in a very serious way, very early on,” Stern said.
Lovett said he hopes to hold another public service recruiting fair during CPIC’s Public Interested conference in January, and potentially another recruiting day in April.
“We try to take some of the guesswork out of this process, but the reality is that it’s just challenging. And that’s something we hope to continue to evolve and to think about how to support our students,” Lovett said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is facing two previously unreported federal investigations into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination Title IX, bringing the total number of active probes of Harvard’s approach to sexual assault to three.
Beyond a widely publicized investigation into a complaint filed against the College in 2014, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has recently launched two additional investigations, according to an OCR list of open cases. One, opened in March 2016, also examines the College’s compliance with Title IX. The other, started in April 2017, focuses on the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
While documentation related to the 2016 complaint is not publicly available, the 2017 investigation is reviewing how GSAS administrators responded to a student’s sexual assault complaint against a fellow student, according to case documents published in a Chronicle of Higher Education database.
The Department of Education redacted the name of the complainant and all identifying information in those documents, which include letters to the complainant and University President Drew G. Faust notifying them about the investigation.
“OCR has determined that this allegation is appropriate for investigation,” both letters read. “OCR has determined that it will also investigate whether the University failed to respond promptly and equitably to reports and/or incidents of sexual violence of which it had notice and whether as a result students were subjected to a sexually hostile environment.”
OCR is also examining whether GSAS failed to adopt and publicize appropriate procedures for responding to sexual assault, designate a Title IX coordinator, and publish notices of nondiscrimination.
GSAS has two Title IX coordinators, Seth Avakian and Jackie Yun, who are part of a network of more than 50 Title IX coordinators across Harvard’s 13 schools.
The office will consolidate the 2017 probe with the other two ongoing Title IX investigations into Harvard, according to the notification letters—meaning that the University is not required to provide data it has already submitted regarding the 2014 and 2016 cases.
When activists with anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better filed the 2014 Title IX compliant, it quickly received widespread media attention and coincided with a number of broader changes to Harvard’s approach to sexual assault on campus. But the subsequent two complaints have largely flown under the radar.
The Crimson obtained a copy of the 2014 complaint via a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year. Among other charges in their 2014 complaint, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better labeled final clubs “major site[s] of sexual violence”—meaning federal officials may be examining the clubs as part of their investigation.
That probe is likely reviewing the Title IX policies in place at Harvard in 2014, though much has changed since. The University has unveiled a new Title IX policy, expanded and restructured its central Title IX office, and rolled out new sexual assault prevention programming.
But the 2016 and 2017 investigations raise the possibility that the federal government may find Harvard’s updated policies in violation of Title IX.
In a statement, University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga pointed to Harvard’s recent efforts to address sexual assault, although she did not explicitly address the three federal investigations.
“Harvard takes all allegations of sexual assault seriously,” she wrote. “The University has, in recent years, invested a great deal in ensuring the community has the right resources to prevent and respond to instances of sexual assault.”
In addition to the three investigations, Harvard is also facing a lawsuit over its handling of  a former student’s sexual assault case. A court denied the University’s motion to dismiss the suit in March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday evening, Harvard women’s soccer will head to Columbia for its final contest of the season. After a hard-earned 2-1 double-overtime win against Dartmouth, the Crimson (8-8, 3-4 Ivy) has the opportunity take home its 11th-straight winning record. The league-leading Lions (9-5-1, 5-1) stand in the way.
“Any away game is going to be a little bit more difficult,” said co-captain Caroline Chagares. “It’s going to be a good opportunity for us to battle against one of the best teams in the Ivy League for our last game.”
While Harvard battled the Big Green last week, Columbia found itself in a similarly tight matchup against Yale. The Lions ultimately fell, 0-1, after the Bulldogs scored on a penalty kick in the last minute of the game. That goal was the only tally Columbia has conceded in all six games of its Ivy League play this season.
But the loss will only serve as motivation. If the Lions defeat the Crimson, they can nab at least a share of the Ivy title.
“Unfortunately, we’re outside of that mix [of Ivy contenders],” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “But we’re going to treat this game as we do any other, and we’re going to put [up] our best performance and try and get the result.”
The Crimson’s offense, which has slowed down in the past few weeks, faces an uphill climb. The team has lost three of its last four games, having just snapped a three-game losing streak last Saturday, and has been shut out in two of those losses.
Meanwhile, the Lions have standout junior goalie Sophie Whitehouse between the posts, who, before last week, hadn’t conceded a single goal since a 3-2 overtime loss against Saint Joseph’s on September 17.
“We’re looking to turn their back line, to get shots off,” said Chagares. “This Columbia team in particular has a very good back line, so it’ll definitely be a challenge.”
A possible solution to this problem for Harvard comes in the form of Ivy League Rookie of the Week Murphy Agnew. Agnew, a forward, scored both goals against Dartmouth to lead all Ivy scorers in the past week, and leads the team in points (13).
Close behind her and just as crucial is junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi, who is tied with Agnew for the team-best in goals (four) and has 12 points on the season. Both of Agnew’s goals on Saturday came off feeds from Mohammadi; the Crimson will hope to see the two link up again against the Lions.
“[Agnew] and [Mohammadi] have been dangerous offensive threats for us all year,” said Hamblin. “It was nice to see that come to fruition against Dartmouth, and we’re going to need to rely on our combination play again against Columbia.”
On the other side of the field, Columbia sports a formidable offensive lineup too. Though Yale shut them out, the Lions have outscored opponents 34-12 over this season. Senior forward Natalie Neshat is the player to watch, with a team-high nine goals and 19 points. While Harvard began its season playing exceptionally tight defense, the team now has a higher goals-against than goals-for average. That is a trend that will need to change on Friday.
“Defenders have had to really step up, which I think they’ve done a good job of doing,” said Chagares. “We have to stay organized, make sure everyone’s communicating in the back. Everyone is going to have to defend hard.”
Critical to this, of course, is the play of the Crimson’s goalies, sophomore Kat Hess and junior Danielle Etzel, who usually split time in the net. Hess did not play against the Big Green due to injury, and Etzel played a full 90 minutes, conceding only one goal on a corner kick. So far, Harvard is undecided on whether Etzel will have the same duties again, or if Hess will join her.
“[Etzel] had a really great game against Dartmouth,” said Hamblin. “Time will tell where [Hess] is at...but obviously [Etzel] is fit and healthy, and we’ll wait to see what our status is on goalkeeping.”
Most of all, Harvard will look to have a triumphant finish in a season of ups and downs. This year saw a strong opening and hopes that the Crimson would once again be in contention for the Ivy title, but injuries to key players—including Chagares and co-captain and defender Marie Becker—threw a wrench into the team’s fine-tuned machine. If not the Ivy crown, this season has featured promising flashes of skill and leadership from a number of younger players that bode well for the future. For now, though, it comes down to Saturday.
“The season went by really fast,” said Chagares. “But we’re just trying to do everything we can control right now, and get this one against Columbia. We’re going to be focusing on ourselves to prepare as best as we can for Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a series that began on Sunday and will continue through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. Coming in at No. 10 is Manhattan.
No. 13: MIT
No. 12: Holy Cross
No. 11: Fordham
Manhattan
2017-2018 Matchup: Saturday, November 18 at Draddy Gymnasium, Bronx, N.Y. (1:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 10-22 overall, 5-15 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference
2016-2017 Matchup: N/A
Head Coach: Steve Masiello (7th season)
Key Returning Players: Senior guard Zavier Turner (team’s leader in points and assists last season, offense will be run by this Ball State transfer who went to the same Indianapolis high school as Jeff Teague, Courtney Lee, and RJ Hunter); senior forward Zane Waterman (averaged 14.5 points per game and seven rebounds last season, will start alongside fellow 6’9” senior Calvin Crawford)
Stat to Watch: 16.6: Manhattan averaged 16.6 turnovers per contest a season ago, with the high water mark coming against West Virginia, when the Jaspers coughed the ball up 40 times.
Overview: Steve Masiello’s bunch likes to run and returns its top five scorers from last season. While the Jaspers should certainly improve on the 10 wins from a year ago, their defense remains a concern—opponents shot nearly 40 percent from three last season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article marks the end of an era. Today, for the first time since the Big Bang, we have to take Columbia seriously.
Despite a loss to Yale last weekend, the Lions sit at 6-1. If Columbia wins three more games, the long-time losers will win the Ivy League championship.
I can’t believe I’m writing these words. Honestly. Four years ago, I would’ve bet on Vince Wilfork to win an Olympic gold in sprinting before the Lions won a title. I would’ve bet on George Washington to rise from the dead and appear at the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. I would’ve bet on the Harvard Management Company to turn a profit.
Columbia’s sudden ascent has left me desperate. I’m gasping for breath like a Yale student escaping a pack of rodents. I’m frozen in confusion like a Yale student facing a multiplication table. To prevent total psychic collapse, let’s survey previous coverage of Lions football:
Article on Nov. 10, 2011, by E. Benjamin Samuels: “Let me give you a list of bowls that mean more than the Empire State Bowl [between Columbia and Cornell]. The Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas. A bowl of chicken gumbo. Lawn bowling.”
Article on Nov. 2, 2012, by Scott A. Sherman: “To call Columbia a doormat would be an insult to front porches. To call it a bottom-dweller would be disrespectful to deep-sea fishermen everywhere.”
Article on Nov. 9, 2012, also by Scott A. Sherman: “The Quakers needed a last-minute drive to squeak by Columbia, which is kind of like needing a harness to successfully climb up that hill where the Teletubbies live.”
Pour one out for those golden days.
BROWN AT YALE
Some call New Haven, Conn., the “Cultural Capital of Connecticut.” That’s akin to calling Subway the “Culinary Capital of Airports.”
Granted, New Haven has a long history. Disaster struck in 1646 when New Haven merchants sent off a huge shipment of local goods that never reached their destination. Hence the origin of the phrase: “Nothing good comes out of New Haven.”
The 2017 Yale team is reversing history. The Bulldogs dominate opponents at the line of scrimmage, holding opponents to six sacks while racking up 31. The team logs 6.2 yards per rush and limits opponents to 2.4.
The Bears, meanwhile, struggle at every level. Brown owns the worst scoring defense (30 points per game) and worst scoring offense (15.3 points per game) in the Ivy League. The Bears also average the most penalty yardage (75 yards a game). Even kicker Ben Rosenblatt has faltered. The senior has hit one of four field goals in 2017. His season long is 19 yards.
Brown’s offense will advance approximately that far on Saturday.
PICK: Yale 36, Brown 6.
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
You’ve probably heard the story already. Midway through last weekend’s Harvard-Dartmouth game, the Crimson forced a fumble. Hundreds of feet away, in the press box at the top of the stadium, a Big Green coach shouted an obscenity and punched a hole in a glass window.
What was the grand strategy here? Was it a one-punch knockout, or did the coach try a few body shots before going for the finish? Why didn’t Dartmouth start this guy at linebacker? Let’s discard the obvious questions and focus on important ones. For example: What will happen next?
Fortunately, this weekend’s contest takes place in Hanover, where there’s nothing valuable to break. Still, Dartmouth will have a chance to shatter some proverbial windows when the team takes on Cornell.
Technically, the Big Red owns a 3-1 Ivy record and a clear path to the championship. I call malarkey. I have absolutely no clue how Cornell beat Princeton last week. What I do know is that Cornell won’t win this weekend. A blind squirrel finds an acorn every now and then—but not that often.
PICK: Dartmouth 33, Cornell 20
PRINCETON AT PENN
This semester, the most well-known class at Penn is called “Existential Despair.” I’m not kidding.
Last week, The Daily Pennsylvanian profiled the course, which meets on Tuesdays from 5 p.m. to midnight. As the article describes, “students cannot speak with one another, take notes, or access outside resources including cell phones or computers.” What a riot.
“Existential Despair” isn’t the most notable course that Professor Justin McDaniel has taught. That honor belongs to the so-called “monk class” last spring. In some ways, that course mirrored others at Penn—there were no exams or readings. Yet the monk class stood out for the unusual requirements. Men had to wear all white, while women had to wear all black. No one could eat when it was dark outside. If you broke a rule, you faced numerous punishments, including “repeatedly walking the crosswalks of the intersection at 34th and Walnut.”
Why mention this oddity in an article about football? Because I’m convinced that wide receiver Justin Watson took the class. If you’ve read my previous columns, you know all about Watson, who can memorize a dictionary with one glance and calm the ocean with the snap of his finger. Well, this Saturday, the football demigod faces a Herculean task.
Princeton quarterback Chad Kanoff has completed 75 percent of his passes for 19 touchdowns. The Quakers, meanwhile, concede 409 yards per game, second-worst in the Ivy League.
My gut tells me to pick the Tigers, but my mind tells me to pick Watson, because otherwise he’ll summon a plague of locusts. I guess I can buy bug spray.
PICK: Princeton 38, Penn 25
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
Here we are again—back to Columbia football.
On Oct. 24, The New York Times published an article called “Columbia Football Keeps Winning. Some Fans Aren’t Happy About It.” That piece revealed several gems about the Lions football program. In 2011, for instance, the university temporarily outlawed the band because the musicians had edited the fight song. They’d changed the lyrics to “We always lose lose lose / By a lot and sometimes by a little.”
These days, the Lions are winning, albeit by a little. Columbia has a physical defensive line and shutdown defensive backs. Quarterback Anders Hill is flirting with 2,000 passing yards. The Lions have topped Princeton and Yale, the most dangerous offenses in the Ancient Eight. Columbia should win the Ivy League this year.
Still, I expect a Harvard win on Saturday.
The program is banged-up, exhausted, and flawed. But the 2017 Crimson has a special ingredient—that mysterious trait that allows championship teams to convert fourth downs and force late fumbles.
Before the Dartmouth game, Harvard coach Tim Murphy called the Big Green “a team of destiny.” Before the Columbia game, he called the Lions “true believers.”
It’s taken me seven games to reach this point, but I’ve made up my mind. In 2017, Harvard is a team of destiny. Crimson players are true believers. No one overcomes this much adversity to end in disappointment.
On Saturday, Harvard will beat Columbia in dramatic fashion, probably on a scoring drive in the final four minutes. If the Crimson downs Penn—which, in my mind, is the more uncertain task—then Harvard will win the league title. You can quote me on that.
PICK: Harvard 17, Columbia 16.
