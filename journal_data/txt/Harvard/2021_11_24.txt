After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the start of Wolf Alice’s sold-out Nov. 11 show at the Paradise Rock Club, guitarist Joff Oddie told a crowd of “familiar faces” that it felt like a “homecoming.” It was the first time the band had been in the states since 2018, but the indie outfit’s three Londoners wasted no time in dazzling their Boston audience. This tour comes on the heels of their latest album, the critically acclaimed “Blue Weekend” from this summer. Most of the show pulled from this album and from 2017’s similarly-acclaimed “Visions of a Life.” The result was a striking set that showcased the band’s power over a stunning range of genres.
Kicking off the show with the explosive firepower of their tracks “Smile” and “You’re a Germ,” the band went on to do what they do best: turn their rich, varied catalog into a dynamic performance. From the heavy, driving force of hard rock songs like “Play the Greatest Hits” to the melodic melancholia and sultriness of songs like, “Feeling Myself,” the band’s decision to juxtapose songs that showcased their impressive range meant that the crowd was captivated from start to finish.
“Let’s all have a dance together, shall we?” Rowsell asked the crowd before breaking out into a supercharged rendition of a sparkling, infectiously-poppy single from their early days, “Bros.” Featuring Rowsell armed with her black electric guitar and a stage overtaken by flashing neon lights, the song brought a palpable rush of energy to an over an hour-long performance already bursting at the seams. They followed that electric strat with their latest single, 2021’s lovesick ballad “Safe From Heartbreak (If You Never Fall in Love” showcasing an enchanting emotional range. That dynamism meant that even the band’s most well-known songs found new meaning in the spaces made between raging guitar solos and soothing synths.
And Wolf Alice sustained that compelling variety throughout the show — a complex mélange of shoegaze, grunge, garage rock, indie, and alternative genres. As proven in their mesmerizing range, the band can do it all. And they reminded their audience of that fact over and over again over the course of the night.
Each of the four members was an integral part of the show’s power, but it was Rowsell’s voice that tied the show together. “I heard that journeys end in lovers meeting / But my journey ends when my heart stops beating / I’m leaving,” she raged in the chorus of “Visions of a Life,” her voice almost seeming to break under the pressure of the song’s cutting lyrics. Her performance of songs like “No Hard Feelings” and “How Can I Make it OK?” carried a similarly compelling weight, complete with growling, shouting, and impossibly high notes that soared over the crowd. Even in lighter songs like “The Last Man on Earth” — which Rowsell performed with a red rose in her hand — her crystalline voice also shone.
“Are you ready for this one?” Rowsell asked the audience one last time before being drowned out by their thunderous applause. In a set driven by the push and pull between roaring bangers and heartfelt ballads, the hyperpop sheen of the band’s encore, 2017’s “Don’t Delete the Kisses,” and the Riot Grrrl-inspired sludge of 2015’s critically acclaimed “Giant Peach” stood out as sure highlights of the night, performed with unapologetic fervor. The show was nothing short of a homecoming.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Akatsuki. The Espada. The Homunculi. The Phantom Troupe. The Ten Commandments.
The monikers above belong to the central criminal organizations in five iconic anime series: “Naruto,” “Bleach,” “Fullmetal Alchemist,” “Hunter x Hunter,” and “The Seven Deadly Sins,” respectively. Within their ranks are some of the most beloved characters in the history of the genre. Sinister and melancholic, they serve as well-defined antitheses to the brighter, morally orthodox teams of protagonists they fight against.
For loyal fans, these names are enduring classics. Ruthless and imaginative, groups like these are what separate the great shows from the good.
There is a distinct romance to the criminal organization in anime. This is apparent in every feature of the animation. Take Akatsuki, the criminal organization in “Naruto.” Its members stand in stark aesthetic and behavioral opposition to the show’s main trio. While Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura wear regular apparel, members of the Akatsuki don flowing black robes adorned with vermillion clouds. One member named Kisame Hoshigaki wields a sword made of shark scales that cleaves metal like butter; his combat partner Itachi Uchiha locks opponents in psychological torture by holding their gaze for a fraction of a second.
All this is a verbose way of articulating a simple truth: Anime criminals are simply more interesting than their morally commendable counterparts.
So what about being criminal is enigmatic? Why, in other words, are we drawn to characters who do bad things?
The answer is necessarily a convergence of factors. For one, criminal groups disrupt traditional structures of power. Protagonists are often frustratingly loyal to societal norms and laws. Rather than bend the rules, the antagonists eschew them entirely, operating in a moral limbo outside the realm of traditional civic affairs. There’s also a tragic allure to the way these characters play God — often to Icarian effect. By attempting to assume power over a reimagined world order, they try to do the impossible: break free from the gravity of the world and move with ease through its wildness. Of course, this liberation does not come without its costs. It isn’t often that antagonists disrupt systems of power in an altruistic fashion; they extort and pillage, taking from others.
Generally, these characters also have interesting backstories. The gradual uncovering of their histories throughout a series allows actions that seemed reprehensible to become understandable at second glance, perhaps even forgivable. Often, members of criminal groups are individuals of exceptional promise who, after a betrayal or an inconceivable loss, determine that they can no longer serve a society that has failed them. This conviction compels them to turn to underground groups that operate outside of the accepted social and political infrastructure. Their moral compromise mirrors a concealed personal trauma.
These criminal groups, then, operate on a paradoxical logic: They accept only the best — the best of the worst. They attract, in other words, exceptional outcasts. They grow into mythic syndicates populated by fallen elites.
Class dynamics often foreground depictions of criminality in anime. Take the Phantom Troupe from “Hunter x Hunter.” It’s a motley crew of lethal, gorgeous, and volatile outcasts helmed by an icy visionary named Chrollo Lucifer — a rather obvious nod to the hellish side of biblical tradition. The majority of the Troupe’s members hail from Meteor City, a wasteland where people from across the planet dump industrial trash. Despite its population of roughly ten million, the official record indicates the number at zero. The very existence of Meteor City’s residents — many of whom, destitute, scrounge the debris for scraps — goes unrecognized.
From this place of destitution, the Troupe emerges. As viewers bear witness to the indignities its infamous members faced in their formative years, it becomes increasingly difficult to pass judgment on their resentment towards the world. Their backstories beg the question: Are morally upright characters intrinsically good, or were they just lucky enough to not be exposed to experiences of abandonment and violence? And even if they were, can we truly criticize those who choose more hostile forms of self-preservation after experiences of trauma?
Other considerations shape conceptions of criminality. Gender undoubtedly plays an important role. It’s notable that the vast majority of members in many criminal organizations are male. Take the Akatsuki from “Naruto.” Despite having over a dozen members, only one, Konan, is a woman. The disproportionate male-female ratio rings true for groups from other shows, including The Espada in “Bleach” and The Ten Commandments in “Seven Deadly Sins.” Though groups like “Hunter”’s Troupe retain a more equal balance, the trend suggests an association — or at least a correlation — of criminality with masculinity. These masculine undertones in qualities including intensity, strategy, decisiveness, and strength, though occasionally subverted, need to be more pointedly challenged in the future.
An exploration into viewers’ infatuation with anime criminals is telling. It reveals complicated truths about consumers and what they demand from their characters. Perhaps more importantly, it opens up a set of urgent questions about the ways in which we relate to structures of power and desire — but perhaps fail to act on our desire — to disrupt the machinery of those structures.
The dialogue that emerges in the wake of this reflection reiterates the core project of this column: to call attention to the wisdom of anime, and firmly critique the normative stance that the genre is a juvenile or otherwise second-class form of entertainment.
Wildly popular and frequently brilliant, anime often presents media at its most interesting and unorthodox. To put a finger on the craze, we must lean in rather than look away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students across campus head home for Thanksgiving break, Harvard women’s hockey will be heading to Durham, N.H., for a matchup with New Hampshire.
The No. 10/RV Crimson (6-3, 4-3 ECAC) returns to the top 10 of the Nov. 22 USCHO poll after securing a 5-2 victory over Brown on Nov. 13, which put Harvard back over .500 in league play and earned head coach Katey Stone her 500th career victory — a distinction that made Stone the first female head coach of a college hockey program to reach the milestone. As Stone looks for 501st win, the opportunity will come against the Wildcats (3-7-2, 3-7-1 Hockey East).
While New Hampshire holds a losing record at the moment, the Wildcats have proven to be a formidable opponent, particularly at home, where UNH actually has a winning 3-2-1 mark at the Whittemore Center. Against common opponent RV/RV Boston College — whom Harvard defeated, 5-2, on Nov. 9 — the Wildcats hung tough twice in two days, losing to the Eagles 2-1 on Oct. 15 and 3-2 on Oct. 16. Of New Hampshire’s seven losses, five have come by two goals or less, and three by a single tally.
Like the Wildcats, the Crimson has also found itself in close games this season. While each of Harvard’s six wins have come by multi-goal margins, two of the Crimson’s three losses have come in overtime. The third, to No. 6/7 Yale, featured a two-goal margin of 3-1. Moreover, all three of Harvard’s losses — Clarkson, Colgate, and Yale — have come against top-10 teams, led by the Bulldogs, whose No. 6 mark in this week’s USCHO poll is their highest this year.
As mentioned, while the Crimson tends to lose close, the team also wins big. Averaging 3.8 goals/game and 34.4 shots/game in the first nine matchups of the season, the Harvard offense has found its stride with senior forward Becca Gilmore providing 11 points so far, which leads the team. Junior forward Anne Bloomer is close behind with 10, and senior forwards Keely Moy and Dominique Petrie remain in striking distance with nine points apiece. Junior Maryna Macdonald paces Crimson defenders on the offensive side of the ice with four points. Continuing with defense, goaltending has been a team effort for Harvard. Senior and captain Becky Dutton and junior Lindsay Reed have each started four times, and first-year Alex Pellicci has gotten the nod in goal once to round out the nine games.
The Crimson will be looking to build momentum in the non-conference in Durham before returning to league play on Dec. 3-4 with a pair of pivotal ECAC contests against Union and RPI. After the early December slate, Harvard will have a few weeks off for exams and winter break but will be back on campus before New Year’s for a Dec. 31/Jan. 1 double-header with Minnesota-Duluth at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first game in 10 days, Harvard earned its first regulation win since Nov. 6, skating to a 5-2 victory over Brown.
In the macro view of the season, Tuesday will stand out as the night Harvard got back on track. After a 4-0 start, the Crimson had gone 0-2-1 in its last three, with losses to Northeastern and Clarkson and a tie at St. Lawrence, though the Crimson notched a shootout win over the Saints after the tie.
“The last stretch has been kind of tough for us, and we haven’t really been able to play the way we want to play,” junior captain and forward Nick Abruzzese said. “So, to get back on home ice and establish a full 60-minute effort is really important for us moving forward. Three more games headed into the [winter] break — obviously, we want to try and win all them. So this was a good first step.”
While the final margin was relatively comfortable, the result was not always in hand for Harvard. Heading to the power play down just 2-1, with 13:06 remaining in the second period, the Bears (1-5, 1-5 ECAC) had suddenly reclaimed the momentum from the Crimson (5-2-1, 4-1-1 ECAC).  Just over 90 seconds earlier, a short-side tally from first-year forward Thomas Manty had cut Brown’s deficit to one. With Crimson junior forward Austin Wong heading to the box for tripping, the Bears found themselves on the doorstep of knotting the game at two.
Harvard’s penalty kill, however, rose to the challenge, and the rest was history as the Crimson scored two goals immediately following the successful kill to increase the margin to 4-1 and put the game out of reach.
Just three seconds after returning to five-on-five play, first-year forward Zakary Karpa scored a highlight-reel goal — the first of his career — outlasting a Brown defender wide and angling himself around graduate student and goaltender Luke Kania to tuck the puck inside the far post. On the rush, Karpa withstood a slash on his way to the net, granting Harvard a power play immediately following the goal.
On the ensuing power play, the Crimson broke the game wide open, with first-year forward Matthew Coronato getting in on the scoring action this time around. On a textbook passing play,  sophomore forward Sean Farrell dealt to Abbruzzese, who one-touched the puck to Coronato in the slot, who wasted no time firing it high blocker side on Kania.
“[A] nice individual effort with Karpa coming off the end of the penalty kill there. That’s a big momentum shift in the game,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The score is 2-1, and they’re on the power play. And then at the end of it, we come and get a... [goal] and then go on the power play, and we’re able to execute there. So I thought there were some good signs across the board.”
Before the Crimson’s second-period run, Abruzzese opened the scoring early for Harvard. Just 2:14 into the game, the junior forward corralled the puck along the goal line just wide of the net, collecting it and depositing it inside the post before Kania could slide back. Sophomore forward Alex Laferriere and junior defenseman Ryan Siedem tacked on assists on the Crimson strike.
“We were able to cycle the puck, get a couple chances, and the puck just squirted to [my] side,” Abruzzese said. “And I was all alone. So it was pretty easy — one of the easier goals we’ll score.”
After the goal, despite sustaining significant pressure, Harvard did not manage to strike again in the first period. Though the Bears registered the first shot in the game, the Crimson quickly gained the edge, racking up a 15-3 shots-on-goal advantage by the first intermission. Kania battled to keep the Bears close. Notably, with the score still 1-0, Kania made one of the plays of the game, pushing across to his right for a bang-bang pad save on what had seemed like an open net. Nonetheless, despite the pro-Harvard shots margin, outside of its goal and the highlight Kania save, the Crimson could not quite create signature chances.
“In the first period, we had the advantage in shots, but I didn’t think we fully established enough zone time and really challenged [Brown],” Donato said. “I thought we lost too many puck battles to be able to sustain the offense in dangerous areas of the ice. We did a little better job in the second period.”
With the game still 1-0 in the early second stanza, Laferriere took matters into his own hands, increasing the Crimson lead to 2-0 with a do-it-yourself effort. In a play that did not look at first like a prime scoring chance, Laferriere drove hard from a tight angle before slicing at the last second into scoring position and knifing a backhander through Kania.
“Nick [Abruzzese] and [junior forward John Farinacci] made a good play on the wall, just chipping it in deep,” Laferriere said. “I picked it up and just tried to drive through the middle and drive to the net. [I] kind of just whacked at it too as I was falling down. Luckily, it went in, so I’ll take it.”
The 2-0 lead did not last for long, however, as just a couple of minutes later Brown cut into the margin. On a two-on-one play, Manty opted to hold the puck for a shot, rifling it into the short-side top corner. The 2-1 score was a close as the Bears would come, however, as the Crimson went on its aforementioned second-period spurt from there.
With 1:53 to go in the second period, Brown had the chance to get back within two before the intermission as Laferriere headed to the box for a slashing minor. Recognizing the chance, the Bears called timeout to talk over its power-play plans. Brown did hit the post — nearly taking a 4-2 scoreline into the locker room. But the Crimson managed to stifle the rest of the Bears power play and preserve its three-goal cushion.
In the third, 4:18 into the final frame, Brown had consecutive power-play chances — with 12 seconds of five-on-three bridging the man-up opportunities. Junior forward Baker Shore went to the box for interference, and Siedem soon followed for boarding.
Nonetheless, the Bears could not cash in, and a few minutes later, Harvard made Brown pay when Laferriere recorded his second of the game to increase the lead to 5-1. The Bears countered with a Jake Harris finish to trim the difference to three, but the Brown senior’s goal was too little, too late, and the game finished 5-2 in favor of the Crimson.
By the end of the contest, Harvard had registered a 40-20 shots-on-goal advantage. On the offensive side of the ice, Abruzzese led the way for Harvard with four points by night’s end (one goal, three assists), and Laferriere followed just behind with three points (two goals, one assist). Junior goalie Mitchell Gibson finished with 18 saves for the Crimson. Kania played two periods for the Bears and made 22 saves on 26 shots while freshman goalie Mathieu Caron came in for Brown in the third, surrendering just one goal on 14 shots.
“I give Brown credit. They come out and play hard,” Donato said. “I thought they made some big saves there, especially in the third, when we had a chance to really extend the lead. So, it’s a nice win. We’re excited to enjoy Thanksgiving and play a tough UNH team here on Friday night.”
Due to Covid-19 protocols in the Boston College program, the Crimson’s Nov. 30 matchup with the Eagles has been postponed, meaning that Harvard only has three more games before winter break. Up next, the Crimson will begin this trio with a Nov. 26 battle against New Hampshire at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Faceoff is slated for 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Tallahassee, Fla., the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams competed in the NCAA Nationals for the second season in a row, with both teams improving on their 2019 finishes. When the dust cleared, the men finished in 12th and the women in 25th.
The No. 25 Crimson men had their best race of the season at nationals, capturing 12th place and crowning three NCAA Division I All-Americans in the process. The 12th-place finish in the 10k race was not only three spots ahead of the strong 2019 team but was also the best finish at the event since 1968.
The Harvard men were led by three top-40 finishes. First-year Graham Blanks, fresh off his second-place overall finish at NCAA Regionals, placed 23rd with a time of 29:21. Blanks opened up the race quickly in 17th and held on to the best individual finish at the NCAA nationals race since Maksim Korolev ’14 captured third place as a senior. This performance even topped the strong 28th-place finish in 2019 of Kieran Tuntivate ’20, one of the most decorated Harvard runners in recent years.
Behind Blanks was senior Matthew Pereira, fresh off winning Ivy Heps, who finished in 35th with a time of 29:28. Pereria continued his dramatic improvement from 2019, finishing over 30 spots ahead of where he was in the 2019 NCAA Nationals race. Finishing only three seconds behind Pereira was sophomore Acer Iverson, who finished in 40th with a time of 29:31. The Crimson has been supported by a strong pack of top three runners all season, and all three were able to get out quickly and hold their positions, helping Harvard capture needed low point values.
“We approach NCAAs with the same focus as most meets throughout the season, just with the awareness that it will be the most crowded and messiest field of the entire season, which is a new challenge to navigate compared to smaller races like Heps,” said Pereira on how nationals is different from other races.
Holding up the back end of the scoring was senior co-captain David Melville, who placed in 156th with a time of 30:39, and sophomore Ben Hartvigsen, who finished in 178th with a time of 30:58. Melville improved upon his 222nd-place 2019 finish by over 50 positions, a big gain for the senior from Greensboro, N.C.
“We train the whole season with the NCAA Championships as the focus, both with the timing of our peak and our style of training,” noted Pereira on the run-up to nationals. “Coach Gibby's training is very aerobic and geared towards the longer distances, so I think we were well prepared for the step-up in race distance to 10k. The two weeks leading up to NCAAs are also really the first time we significantly let up in the volume and intensity of training.”
The Crimson was able to beat 13 teams ranked ahead of the team going into the race, a testament to the performance top to bottom from the Harvard squad. This included overtaking No. 16 Princeton, who beat the Crimson at the Ivy League Championships, and No. 19 Syracuse, who had beaten Harvard at the NCAA Northeast Regionals. Blanks, Pereira, and Iverson were all named NCAA DI All-Americans, becoming the eighth, ninth, and 10th runners to earn the honor in Harvard history.
Meanwhile, coming into the race, the No. 24 Crimson women were coming off their strongest stretch of the year, winning both the Ivy League Championships and the NCAA Northeast Regionals. The team had developed a central core of runners that had kept their point totals very low throughout the championship season.
In the 6k race, the Harvard women came out to a fast start to open the contest, with four scorers in the top 110 places at the 1170m mark. However, as the race progressed, some of the Crimson runners were not able to hold onto their positions. Nevertheless, Harvard finished in 25th in the championship meet, beating out No. 20 Syracuse on the way to its best finish since 1983 — and six spots ahead of the squad’s finish in 2019.
Leading the way for Harvard was first-year Maia Ramsden, who finished in 110th with a time of 20:33. Ramsden continued her fantastic debut season for the Crimson, with a strong finish at nationals. Just behind Ramsden were the two co-captains. In 121st was senior Judy Pendergast with a time of 20:37, and in 126th was senior Anna Juul with a time of 20:38.
“The past few weeks of racing have really shown how strong this team is and what we are capable of. We definitely felt a bit disappointed with our results from the middle of the season, so it was really exciting to be able to win Heps and Regionals,” said Pendergast while reflecting on the season. “This team also had the highest place for Harvard women’s cross country in modern history, which shows just how special this team is. We left NCAAs proud of what we accomplished, but definitely knew we had things to improve on.“
Rounding out the scoring for the Crimson was sophomore Eloise Freitag in 147th with a time of 20:47 and sophomore Iz Sagar in 173rd with a time of 20:57. Only 25 seconds separated the first and the last scorer for Harvard, even though those 25 seconds represented 63 spots in the race. These slim margins show the difficulty of the NCAA meet that has some of the best runners on the strongest teams in the country all competing in the same race.
“Nationals is a great opportunity to showcase our team on a bigger platform compared to regionals or heps,” said Freitag on how nationals is different from prior championship races. “Even though the field is more competitive, we maintained our team identity and strategy by going out and staying out.”
The Crimson women had a fantastic overall season, coming on late to be a dominant force in the Ancient Eight and the Northeast Region. Despite being unranked until the NCAA nationals race, Harvard deserved its spot as a top-25 team in the nation this year, and the Crimson will look to build on this result in track and field in the winter and spring and again in cross country next fall.
For the seniors on both the men’s and women’s teams, nationals represented their last cross country race for the Crimson. However, they have eyes to the future, excited to see what the team is capable of with plenty of underclassmen as strong contributors to the team this year.
“It’s been a really incredible year for this team, and I know that our program is only getting started,” Pendergast commented. “It's truly an honor to be a captain to such an amazing group of humans, and I can’t wait to see what they are capable of in the future.”
Both teams are incredibly proud of what they have accomplished under head coach Alex Gibby in the last four years as Harvard has emerged as one of the best cross country programs in the Ivy League and the Northeast Region and a consistent force in NCAA Nationals.
“This season was a lot of fun and strong evidence of how far our program has come since Coach Gibby started coaching here four years ago,” Pereira reflected. “I'm really thankful to have been around during that transformation and to have had the chance to improve alongside the program and accomplish goals that seemed far out of reach when I started.”
Both teams will have a few weeks off from training to rest and recover before starting training back up again for winter track and field.
