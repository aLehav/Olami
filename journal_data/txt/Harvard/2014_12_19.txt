After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Have you ever tried not being an actor?” Alex (Alex B. Zaloum ’16) asks earnestly in the opening scene of “Players,” a student-written play performed at the Adams Pool Theater from Nov. 14 to 16.
“We all have tried,” Ellen (Alice Abracen ’15, also the playwright) says. Their back-and-forth exchange quickly is quickly cut short, however, as the play plunges into action. Gunshots pop overhead, the theater’s lights black out, and the flimsy set topples down. News reports chronicle a suicide bombing as the house lights fade, leaving a ruined stage bereft of its players. When the noise dies down, Alex is left to pick up the pieces of his broken set, his directorial dreams for the production and his flirty, witty banter with Ellen put on hold indefinitely.
Years into a nameless war, Alex, in an attempt to restore normalcy, gathers his players to put on a production of William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Just as the comedy Alex chose seems out of place, “Players” pokes fun at the life of the actor, a life that seems dramatically more foolish—perhaps even more self-servingly ridiculous—in the context of war. Abracen’s script captured those comedic moments successfully with heart, while the play’s darker notes seemed confused, if not unnatural.
Although subtle costume choices by Nick T.J. Wood ’17 remind the viewer that the war does rage outside the theater, the script does not explicitly clarify the reasons for the fighting. “Players” makes it clear that this company is divided, as some members wear black armbands and other members wear white armbands ones. But these stark divisions are brushed over too abruptly. The theater serves as a platform for the players to interact with one another, even if this communication occurs only because of Alex’s directorial force, but a deeper connection is missing.
The script bombards the audience with the importance of acting to these actors, especially to Alex. “You can try if you want, but you’ll always be an actor,” he says calmly, trying to bring Ellen, changed by the war, back into the fold. Playing aloof and flashing her piercing blue eyes, Abracen pulls off Ellen’s strong reluctance to return to the stage both with casual disinterest and fierce resistance. Ellen has joined the nameless faction perpetuating the war, and, as Abracen portrays successfully, now she seems to have no feelings either. “You think the company will want people like me,” she blurts out, snarkily attempting to emphasize how changed she is.
But Ellen’s moments of isolation, curled in a ball on the tiled ledge of the Adams Pool, do not match with the tone of “Players,” still peppered with puns and slapstick jabs at the theatrical life. Ellen’s melancholia, though portrayed beautifully by Abracen, does not advance the larger, communal purpose Alex and the rest of the cast seem to be supporting.
The success of “Players”, then, lies most strongly in the script’s comedic scenes, which are relatable because of their simultaneous humility and humanity. Abracen’s choice for her characters to use their actors’ names also emphasizes the familial closeness that develops among company members. In one warm-up game, for example, the players form a trust circle, first pushing and catching Juan’s (Juan E. Bedoya ’16) body as it falls into their unfailing arms. Juan’s face, visibly uncomfortable, puckers, and the audience laughs heartily as the players move him around like a sack of potatoes, not outwardly worried about letting him fall. “Oh, that was good until we dropped Juan,” Alex, ever the director, says matter-of-factly to conclude the day’s exercise.
These colloquial, easy lines also work well when Caro (Carolina P. Ribeiro ’18) and Josh (Josh Garcia) rehearse a scene as Hippolyta and Theseus in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The two are intentionally performing terribly because they harbor resentment toward one another, divided by the war. But that backstory is not important here. Instead, it is the theater that persists, voiced by Alex’s concern for his production above all else. “You guys are getting married in four days, and, frankly, I’m not feeling the love,” Alex says.
It is in the tender moments that begin to develop among company members that the war starts to matter less. “Players,” in this way, raises questions about the relevance of war going on outside, but those questions themselves do not seem relevant. Why should people care about it? Does war even matter when life persists inside the theater?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I write to commend President Faust’s decision to investigate the unilateral action of the Harvard University Dining Services to boycott SodaStream products.
I have visited the SodaStream factory and spoken to many of its Palestinian-Arab employees, who love working for a company that pays them high wages and provides excellent working conditions. I saw Jews and Muslims, Israeli and Palestinians, working together and producing an excellent product that is both healthy and economical.
The SodaStream factory I visited was in Ma’ale Adumim—a suburb of Jerusalem that Palestinian Authority leaders acknowledge will remain part of Israel in any negotiated resolution of the conflict. I was told this directly by Palestinian president Mohammad Abbas and by former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
Accordingly, although the factory is in an area beyond the Armistice lines of 1949, it is not really disputed territory. Nor does it pose any barrier to a two-state solution. Moreover, Israel offered to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians in late 2000 and early 2001 and in 2008, but the Palestinian Authority did not accept either offer. Had these generous offers been accepted, the dispute would have ended and Ma’ale Adumim would have been recognized as part of Israel. So the Palestinian leadership shares responsibility for the continuation of the conflict and the unresolved status of the area in which SodaStream operates. Punishing only Israel—and Israeli companies—for not resolving the conflict serves only to disincentivize the Palestinian Authority from accepting compromise solutions.
The students who sought the boycott of SodaStream invoked human rights. But it is they who are causing the firing of more than 500 Palestinian workers who would like to continue to earn a living at SodaStream. As a result of misguided boycotts, such as the one unilaterally adopted by the Harvard University Dining Services, SodaStream has been forced to move its factory to an area in Israel where few, if any, Arabs can be employed. This is not a victory for human rights. It is a victory for human wrongs.
I have no doubt that some students and other members of the Harvard community may be offended by the presence of SodaStream machines. Let them show their displeasure by not using the machines instead of preventing others who are not offended from obtaining their health benefits. Many students are also offended by their removal. Why should the views of the former prevail over those of the latter? I’m sure that some students are offended by any products made in Israel, just as some are offended by products made in Arab or Muslim countries that oppress gays, Christians and women. Why should the Harvard University Dining Service—or a few handfuls of students— get to decide whose feelings of being offended count and whose don’t?
In addition to the substantive error made by HUDS, there is also an important issue of process. What right does a Harvard University entity have to join the boycott movement against Israel without full and open discussion by the entire university community, including students, faculty, alumni and administration? Even the president and provost were unaware of this divisive decision until they read about it in the Crimson. As Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote, “Harvard University’s procurement decisions should not and will not be driven by individuals’ views of highly contested matters of political controversy.”
Were those who made the boycott decision even aware of the arguments on the other side, such as those listed above? The decision of the HUDS must be rescinded immediately and a process should be instituted for discussing this issue openly with all points of view and all members of the university community represented. The end result should be freedom of choice: those who disapprove of SodaStream should be free to drink Pepsi. But those who don’t disapprove should be free to drink SodaStream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring of 2014, Palestinian students and allies of the struggle for Palestinian rights were outraged to find the SodaStream label on water machines in five House dining halls. SodaStream is a beverage machine company notorious for operating out of an Israeli settlement in the occupied Palestinian West Bank. Israeli settlements on Palestinian land represent an ongoing state-sponsored project, with Palestinian villages demolished and hundreds of families displaced every year to make room for new, exclusively Israeli neighborhoods, complete with segregated buses and highways. These settlements have been condemned by both the UN and the Obama administration as a violation of the Geneva Accords and a significant impediment to the peace process between Palestine and Israel.
SodaStream also appeared in the news last year when their celebrity spokesperson, Scarlett Johannson, resigned from her role as Oxfam Ambassador due to her continued appearance in Sodastream advertisements. Oxfam stated, “Businesses that operate in settlements, such as SodaStream, further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support.” Scarlett Johannson chose to leave Oxfam and remain affiliated with SodaStream. Now, in the face of international outcry and plummeting profits, SodaStream announced that it will soon be moving its main production facility out of the West Bank.
For Palestinian students at Harvard, the presence of the SodaStream label represented a direct endorsement of land theft that has destroyed their communities and left thousands without homes. Many Palestinian students at Harvard come from families who have been displaced or refugeed as a direct result of settler expansion and infringement on Palestinian land. Students quickly brought the issue to the attention of the Mather House Masters, Michael D. Rosengarten and Christie A. McDonald, who responded thoughtfully and immediately. Throughout February and March of 2014, multiple meetings were conducted, which together included then-interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, representatives from HUDS, Director of the Harvard Foundation Dr. S. Allen Counter, Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck, students supporting the move away from SodaStream, and students opposing it. The discussion was vibrant and productive, culminating in a commitment by HUDS to purchase from vendors other than SodaStream in the future. HUDS even demonstrated their commitment to this decision by purchasing a new machine for the Adams House dining hall that was not made by SodaStream. This occurred in early April of 2014, long before the SodaStream announcement in November of 2014 that it would be withdrawing from the settlements.
Critics of this move will declare that the conversations behind it were one-sided. They were not. Students representing multiple viewpoints and backgrounds were in attendance, including students who disagreed and voiced a very strong dissenting opinion. These opinions were taken into account and HUDS still chose to move away from SodaStream. Students of dissenting opinions then chose to remove mention of their participation in the official memo documenting the discussions. We ask these students why they removed their names and intentionally made it look like there was no vibrant discussion or progress made on the issue.
Critics will say that it is unfair to single out Israeli human rights abuses when so many other nations are guilty of similar crimes. We would first like to make the distinction that this move was made against an Israeli company which was directly engaged in activity deemed illegal by much of the international community. Even the Israeli High Court of Justice has deemed settlements illegal in the past. Secondly, however, we do not consider the ubiquity of human rights abuses around the world as an excuse for inaction in this particular case. Rather, we have supported and will continue to support moves for Harvard to not endorse the illegal actions of any company in any nation, particularly when these actions directly affect Harvard students.
Critics will ask why we are politicizing the purchase of soda machines, as if to ask why the issue even matters. The SodaStream factory, by virtue of its existence on illegally occupied land, politicized itself. Settlements are an unacceptable violation of international treaties that makes a lasting, political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict impossible. Palestinian students have suffered from these settlements, which SodaStream directly helped to propagate. The issue was politicized long before the SodaStream machine entered the dining hall.
Critics will accuse this move of being nothing more than thinly-veiled anti-Semitism. It is not. To criticize a foreign nation’s policies is not to be biased against its people, as evidenced by the many Israeli and Jewish supporters of a boycott against SodaStream and their calls to end human rights abuses in their own nation.
Critics will say that because SodaStream has announced that it will be moving out of the settlements, we should no longer take a stance against it. As a reminder, these negotiations happened nearly 8 months ago, long before any indication that SodaStream would be leaving the settlements. We understand now that the issue has changed, and are excited to continue working with HUDS and the Harvard administration on it.
Lastly, critics will say that the decision to boycott SodaStream simply limits dialogue and does not allow for true collaboration. We disagree. The initiative itself sparks dialogue and awareness of the human rights issues at hand, and we are sure that many Harvard students were not aware of SodaStream’s presence on illegally occupied land before this move occurred. To discuss SodaStream’s practices promotes thoughtful engagement with the issue. We look forward to hearing and reading the dissenting opinions of our fellow Harvard students and working with them to end the crisis of violence in Israel-Palestine.
On behalf of Palestinian students and Palestinian rights activists here at Harvard, including members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee and members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance who helped us tremendously in this effort, we would like to thank HUDS, the Harvard college administration, and the House Masters for their decision to stand on the side of international justice as well as sensitivity to their own students. The discussion surrounding this move was enlightening, and we hope these events will spark further discussion of the issues of Palestinian human rights and a lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President of Finland Tarja Halonen will join the Harvard Kennedy School in the spring semester as its second Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow, the school announced on Thursday.
As part of the fellowship, Halonen will give speeches, host study groups, and visit classrooms for one semester at the school.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 selected Halonen from “a handful of other very impressive public leaders,” HKS spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email. Faculty and staff, particularly fellowship program faculty co-chairs R. Nicholas Burns and Peter B. Zimmerman, gave Ellwood advice in the selection process.
“We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of leader, what kind of issues that leader has been committed to in office and post-office [would fit HKS], and we thought that President Halonen was really the perfect choice for us,” said Burns, a professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School.
The announcement of Halonen’s appointment comes a year after the departure of the first Angelopoulos Fellow, former Mexican President Felipe Calderón, whose selection in 2012 and subsequent time on campus prompted significant controversy.
Gavel pointed to Halonen’s more than three decades of “impressive” public service on the Finnish and world stages as the key reason for the appointment. Halonen served as president of Finland for two terms and was the first woman to hold the position.
“She is someone who has had real experience—substantial experience—in European politics,” Burns said. “She’s been someone who’s been a pathmaker and pathbreaker in terms of female leadership of the world...and she’s extraordinarily active.”
Halonen’s fellowship, Burns added, is also timely in that it will come at a decisive moment in European history.
“She’s so fully engaged,” he said, “in all of these big issues that are at the center of Europe today: from the Eurozone crisis to the nature of the current European Union, how it’s going to develop, if there’s going to be a fiscal union, [etc.]”
Burns said he hopes that the Angelopoulos fellowship will someday become an annual program, but recognized that the difficult schedules of potential fellowship candidates can make the search process take years. The Kennedy School did not host an Angelopoulos fellow in 2014.
“We know that by conferring the fellowship on someone we are very much affirming their life work,” Burns said. “[Halonen’s] work is well worthy of recognition by the University and our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Education released on Friday a draft plan for a new college rating system that would evaluate institutions of higher education based on a multi-faceted framework, including schools’ accessibility to low-income students and how their students fare in the job market after graduation.
The system would also judge colleges and universities on a number of expected criteria, such as graduation rates, average net price, student loan debt, post-college earnings, and the percentage of students who receive Pell grants, according to the draft report.
The product of a Department of Education effort to assess colleges’ success at “expanding access, maintaining affordability, and ensuring strong student outcomes,” the system is intended to categorize institutions as high-, middle-, or low-performing, but it will not rank colleges numerically. It is also meant to help students evaluate schools in the college search process and improve the federal government’s distribution of federal student aid.
The released framework provoked criticism Friday from some higher education experts, who argued that the criteria would not evaluate institutions effectively.
University President Drew G. Faust, for her part, has been discussing the framework with Department of Education officials for the past two years. Faust was not available for comment immediately following the release of the draft report Friday, but in an interview Tuesday, prior to the report’s release, she questioned the worth of evaluating success in the job market. Specifically, she argued that a framework based on post-graduation earnings could discount contributions made by students who enter the public service or other low-paying sectors.
“I think we need to argue with any notion of college that says it’s simply about putting people in jobs,” Faust said. “Certainly that’s a significant part of what we intend with the way we educate you.… We also want a sense of creativity and adaptability that will ready people for a job that we don’t even know about yet.”
Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said the draft report is unspecific and abstract “as opposed to a hard regulatory structure,” but added that Harvard would likely fare well under the proposed rating system.
“I have a feeling that [Harvard will] come out reasonably well under any kind of rating system that anybody could come out with,” Lake said.
Lake noted, however, the proposed rating system’s emphasis on the matriculation of low-income students might translate into a higher access rating for other colleges compared to Harvard.
“Certain schools that happen to [feed from] historically disadvantaged populations may come out a little stronger [on access] than places like Harvard, which gives the impression that they're making the [accessibility] effort that Harvard is not, which is really not the case,” Lake said.
While Harvard’s financial aid program allows students with household incomes less than $65,000 to attend the College almost for free, the student body is disproportionately wealthy compared to the U.S. population as a whole. Just 13 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2018 reported an annual family income of less than $40,000, while 14 percent of freshman respondents reported annual family incomes above $500,000.
The Department of Education plans to refine its proposed rating system after an open comment period, which ends Feb. 17, 2015.
