After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
France’s cultural and legal struggle with the question of Muslim immigration arose again with French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s proposal to outlaw the wearing of the burqa in public places. His suggestion seems serious, since Belgium moved one step closer to passing a similar bill last Thursday, and comparable debates are occurring in Italy and the Netherlands. Supporters argue that the law would defend women’s freedom and help ensure safety on public transit. However, we oppose the bill soon-to-be under consideration in France as an unjust and unjustifiable measure.
Many proponents of banning full veils in public places argue for it as a means of liberating women who currently wear them, believing they suffer under an oppressive culture. However, this argument is invalid on several grounds. First, it assumes that women who wear the burqa are uniformly forced to do so, which is simply untrue. Like all personal choices, women decide to don this attire for many reasons—some good and some bad, some based on coercion and some on freedom. To tar all burqas with the brush of oppression is condescending and inaccurate. Furthermore, the law itself is clearly coercive. It places specific limits on how women may dress, and enforces these restrictions with the power of the state. The plan to free women from private mandates enforcing one set of clothing standards with a public mandate enforcing the opposite set is logically inconsistent. Although the proposed bill would level substantially greater penalties on those who force other people to wear the burqa, it still penalizes women who themselves elect to wear it. Since the bill targets the burqa even when coercion is not present, it cannot be defended as expanding women’s freedom.
Some proponents of the ban support it on the basis of security concerns. The form-concealing burqa, it is alleged, poses a unique safety risk on public transportation. However, terrorism in France today is predominantly Separatist, not Islamist, and women are rarely directly involved. France reported zero Islamist failed, foiled, or successful terrorist attacks in 2008, as compared with 137 separatist ones. That being said, we recognize France’s concern for the safety of its citizens, and admit that banning burqas may provide some security advantages. Still, such benefits in no way justify infringing on a woman’s right to choose the veil or reject it.
We firmly oppose the French law, and do not believe that it can be defended as a security measure or a feminist one. It acts only to restrict the individual choices and religious expression of French citizens. We recognize the strain that Muslim immigration and integration are putting on French culture but encourage the nation to find a happy medium where the individual religious practices of Muslims are respected, even while preserving French culture. Much has been made over what it means to be truly French—but surely no particular style of dress or worship is more truly French than the enlightenment ideal of genuine religious pluralism. This bill poses a clear danger to that ideal, and it ought not be passed in a fog of anxiety and unfounded rationalization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in September, I was rather puzzled when I heard a friend say, “I expected Harvard to be a more intellectual place.” I asked her exactly what she meant, and she responded that she thought students here would be more willing to have intellectual conversations more often. The thought remained vaguely in my mind and only completely resurfaced when I heard yet another friend voice a similar complaint: He also wanted to discuss more “intelligent” and “intellectual” topics with other students.
Looking back, I also arrived with a similar misconception about the amount of “intellectual” conversation people would have here. I thought students would discuss philosophy, politics, literature, and other intelligent matters regularly over dinner and such. And although my common room does occasionally erupt into a heated debate about politics or religion, this is the exception rather than the rule. We’re more likely to talk about how much work we have, what the weather is like, or what dance is coming up this weekend than we are about Adam Smith or the Arizona immigration law. Still, what I’ve ultimately come to realize is that although casual conversation is not usually centered on larger-than-life subjects, such discussions do happen around campus. That we may use more formal venues to talk about more formally intellectual subjects is understandable.
As students, our personal conversations often venture into less academic matters, and this isn’t necessarily negative. It’s unrealistic and unfair to expect Harvard students to make every conversation a weighty one. We go to classes and attend sections where such conversations take place between students, professors, and teaching fellows. We labor every night over readings and essays that deal precisely with these academic matters. In this context, it’s nice to simply sit down at the lunch table and have a completely nonsensical conversation about sharks swimming up the Ohio River with a group of friends.
Though dinner discussions aren’t filled with purely academic topics, Harvard is still a place where students think about their place and significance in the world. E-mail lists and posters constantly advertise events with public intellectuals like Noam Chomsky and Michael Sandel, and the fact that these events happen so often is an indicator of the thriving intellectual community at our school. Perhaps when we feel that we are losing touch with this community we should blame not our fellow students but ourselves; how often do we delete these emails without reading them or glance at posters without giving them a second thought? Furthermore, many of us may still hesitate to fully participate in section discussions, where the potential to engage in meaningful conversation with both other students and faculty members emerges.
To claim that Harvard is devoid of intellectual discussion is to ignore the endless possibilities for debate and conversation that exist within its walls. Before complaining, students should first seek out established discussions venues and make sure they are participating in them as fully as possible. Most of us probably wouldn’t shy away from a heated high-culture discussion, but we shouldn’t be expected to make every dinner conversation about Nietzsche or “War and Peace.” Sometimes we just need to sit down and have an even more heated conversation about Lady Gaga’s latest antics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Tea Party movement fancies itself the heir of those Founding Fathers who resisted additional British taxation in 1773. Tea partiers consider themselves at the vanguard of a grassroots, nationwide movement. Yet these “true” Americans could use a reality check by following the efforts of the Maoist movement in Nepal.
It is unlikely that the tea partiers will ever look for inspiration from a party seeking to introduce a Marxist administration in its home government. The Maoists, however, know how to convey their intentions to the utmost effect. The nation’s capital, Kathmandu, is currently under a general strike shutting down the city’s operations. While tens of thousands of protesters remain in the streets, only emergency vehicles may pass.
More impressive than the high participation in the strikes is their peaceful nature. The police have complained of confiscating makeshift weapons from supporters but have been able to remove these weapons without violence. The Maoists also represent a legitimate faction of the government they protest: In parliamentary Nepal, the Maoists hold the highest number of parliament seats but contend with a hostile prime minister. Far from the more alarmist analyses of a few years ago, such as a BBC feature from 2005, the Maoists hope to work within the system and lead a coalition government—a legitimate expectation for the majority party.
When the Maoists protest, shops and institutions close; the nation shuts down. It is perhaps counterintuitive, even ironic to compare this Nepalese movement with one that throws out the term “socialist” about any person or thing it distrusts. Yet the comparison is less flattering for the tea partiers.
The Maoists put aside weapons and military ambitions to work within the political system. Unlike rebels in India, for example, who recently bombed a girls’ school, the party in Nepal used peaceful protest to make its voice heard. But, most importantly, the Maoists had the broad support of the population.
Tea partiers in America can claim to represent the every-man in the same breath as they ask for bibs to protect their suits at the $350 tea party conventions like the one in February. Perhaps as Maoists, the movement leadership in Nepal is prohibited from accepting appearance fees. But it is hard to imagine many “revolutionary” leaders demanding $100,000 as Sarah Palin collects.
Another common claim of the tea partier is that those involved represent a cross-section of America: Democrats, Republicans, and independents—all of different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. A New York Times/CBS News poll in April, however, demonstrated that most tea partiers are white, Republican, affluent, and approaching the status of senior citizens. That study, along with other analysis, has indicated that tea partiers hope to rewind the clock to a time when such wealthy white men dictated the direction of the nation. The implication that tea partiers are white-centric might seem obvious after simply scanning the faces of the “Voices of the Tea Party” interactive feature on the New York Times website. Yet tea partiers cannot claim such a narrow focus and maintain their rhetoric about a rising national consensus.
This deficit between self-aggrandizement and the tea partiers’ actual demographic can produce awkward explanations. Danita Kilcullen, the founder of “Tea Party Fort Lauderdale,” recently told Newsweek that the absence of black membership in the movement is “because all the black people voted for Obama.” At first glance, this fact bears some truth—95 percent of African Americans did vote for Obama—but then consider the implication of this argument. Barack Obama won the popular vote in 2008 by seven percentage points. If the tea party movement holds no hope of swaying any of those nearly 67 million voters, it is essentially fighting for a share of a minority from the start.
The truth tea partiers must hope to obscure is that they will never represent a sweeping, forward-thinking movement. When many Republicans are their targets, it seems impossible that the movement will ever gain the support of a united conservative front. And as white people in America continue down the path toward becoming a minority race, the tea partiers’ white majority does not bode well for long-term growth opportunity.
The Maoists in Nepal demonstrated that a peaceful process within the system, if carrying the weight of the people, could change a nation. Supporters of the Obama campaign might argue that they themselves achieved a similar, if less-mandated, position. But the Tea Party movement will never reach such a position. Instead, as a for-profit movement, it has essentially become a lobbying group. When Marco Rubio, the Republican hopeful for the U.S. senate from Florida, recently spoke to CNN, he stressed his “mainstream” identity before he mentioned his support for tea partiers later in the interview. Expect more conservative politicians to follow Rubio in tersely acknowledging the tea partiers while refusing to be defined by their politics.
It remains to be seen whether the resolution of the strike in Kathmandu will yield all the results the Maoists demand. Yet it is already clear that such a truly popular movement has the chance for success the Tea Party will never have—unless success is measured in vitriol and dollars.

Keeping her mouth shut isn’t something Stephanie Grace does particularly well. If it were, she almost certainly wouldn’t have found herself on the Harvard Law Review or graduating from law school to a federal clerkship. She also wouldn’t have found her picture on Gawker, a page I refresh several times a day, next to the headline “Meet Stephanie Grace, the Harvard Law Student Who Started a Racist Email War.” Last November, Grace apparently got into a debate of sorts over dinner and followed up via e-mail. Later, she expressed regret over the message, remarking: “I emphatically do not believe that African Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive.”
While I generally find myself squarely in the Gawker camp, I couldn’t help but cringe when I read their vitriolic take down of the 3L. Before even identifying her, the site playfully asked its readership, “Don’t you love it when the Ivory Tower crumbles?” After discovering her identity, Gawker revealed to an audience of 16 million the young woman’s name and academic history alongside her photograph, later proclaiming, “Let’s all look at this horrible Harvard Law Racist Emailer, who will never drink and Gmail ever again.” It’s entirely possible that I simply don’t want to watch the Tower crumble while I’m still in it, since as Maureen O’Connor of Gawker wrote, “It seems like the word ‘outing’ only comes up when the subject is a person that an upper-middle-class, educated blogger would consider a peer.”
But I think there’s more at work behind my distaste, summed up fairly well by one commenter who remarked, “There is disturbing, sadistic titillation in this.” The problem is that we’ve all seen this before. And it’s generally coming from the other side. Sarah Palin once argued that not attending an Ivy League school made her a qualified vice-presidential candidate. That’s right, the same Sarah Palin regarded with derision by Gawker for her derision of liberal elitism. Bill O’Reilly frequently attempts to distance himself from his Harvard degree, and Gawker was right there cheering Jon Stewart on when he called him out for this hypocrisy. But Gawker can’t have it both ways, denouncing Ivy League-bashing when it’s coming from an unpopular figure and then taking a sick pleasure in it to up their page views.
Gawker was quick to defend itself from these scoldings, claiming “Why did your brain go there? Because you’re an eensy bit racist, is why. In 2010 these people’s rocks should be overturned, because they’re jerks and sometimes public shaming is just what the doctor ordered. Hopefully next time she’ll think before she wonders if, and that’s a big IF guyz!!!, black folks might just be born stupider.”
If you’d asked me, before I arrived at Harvard, whether I were a racist, sexist, or a homophobe, I would have firmly denied all these charges. But during the past four years of my life I’ve adopted radically different views on affirmative action, I’ve realized that societal constructions such as virginity and promiscuity are outdated and harmful, and I’ve tempered previously held notions of heteronormativity. Apparently, I was a little of all three. When we immediately jump to shame into submission those who express views we deem racist, we reinforce a binary in which people are either prejudiced or not. But that’s simply not how “isms” work. None of us have been raised in a post-racial or post-gender society, and this has had an impact on our worldviews.
Which is precisely why it’s so important to have these conversations. When we encourage people to keep possibly prejudiced views to themselves, they never have to confront or defend them. I express such remorse about this loss because, if there has been an overarching theme to my time at Harvard, it’s that when you put two people in a room who disagree, wonderful things can happen. If there’s been a theme to my last week at Harvard, it’s that, apparently, if you put a tape recorder in that room then somebody’s going to get the shaft. Next time you’re about to get into that debate over that e-mail list, aren’t you going to think twice?
Most dangerous of all, this attitude turns those who hold biased views into victims of a politically correct culture in which they can’t express themselves, and so never get a chance to learn from a thoughtful response. All of a sudden, television networks are reminiscing about the good old days instead of focusing on real issues like the achievement gap between white and black youth, and who’s better off? Nobody has really changed their mind. All Stephanie Grace learned was that if you venture an opinion in an e-mail to a friend, the Dean of Harvard Law School might publicly denounce you. So maybe the Ivory Tower is crumbling after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge—and Harvard University facilities in the city—remain unaffected by a major water main leak that took place Saturday in Weston, Mass. and has left an estimated two million Boston area residents without potable tap water.
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) issued a “boil-water” order Saturday, recommending residents of the affected communities boil water for at least one minute before using it for purposes such as drinking, cooking, and brushing their teeth.
Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78  declared a “state of emergency to facilitate the state response to MWRA Water Main Break” in a press release put out by his office Saturday evening.
Although the water main break had been stopped as of Saturday night, the order remains in effect for 30 communities, including neighboring Boston and Somerville.
Cambridge is not affected, as it draws a separate water supply from the Fresh Pond Reservoir, which is municipally operated and owned by the Cambridge Water Department. Since the Cambridge Water Department provides Harvard’s water supply, the campus is not under the “boil-water” order.
According to Ria Convery, MWRA’s communications director, MWRA is in the process of repairing the pipe, which will include welding the coupling between the two pipe sections and water pressure testing.
Subsequently, MWRA will be disinfecting the system and collecting water samples for testing. Convery said that MWRA is “cautiously optimistic” about the situation, which she said will hopefully be resolved by this Wednesday or Thursday.
MWRA is currently delivering water from the emergency back-up reservoir system to the affected households. That water has not been treated for drinking and is thus unsafe for human consumption, although it is suitable for bathing, flushing, and fire prevention.
Residents without treated water have been rushing to stores in search of bottled water, the Boston Globe reported.
MWRA representatives said that the leak began between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. Saturday morning, when a 120-inch diameter pipe transporting water to communities east of Weston started to break.
The leak was dumping water into the Charles River at a rate of over eight million gallons per hour.
A list of communities under the ‘boil-water’ order and regular updates about the pipe leak may be found on the MWRA website.

The banner above the recently-opened Harvard Community Garden at 27 Holyoke Place was stolen Thursday night, according to a complaint filed with the Harvard University Police Department.
According to Garden Co-Manager Rebecca J. Cohen ’12, the banner—which was posted above the entrance to the garden—was a “professionally-produced, durable, four-season banner, meant to last into the foreseeable future” and therefore cost hundreds of dollars. Cohen said that the banner appeared to have been cut from the frame that supported it “and pulled off, deforming the frame in the process.”
The Harvard College Garden Project, the undergraduate arm of the Harvard Community Garden—which opened in April as a joint venture between the Office of Sustainability, the Food Literacy
Project, and other organizations—reported the theft to HUPD on Friday afternoon. HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano said he was unaware of the incident and declined to comment.
This is not the first time that the Harvard Community Garden has been the target of vandalism.
Two weekends ago, one or more vandals entered the garden and stomped around the garden beds. The only harm done by the intruders consisted of minor damage to some arugula seedlings, Cohen said.
The incident is currently being investigated as a theft of University property, and according to Cohen, time-lapse cameras that were installed to record plant growth prior to the incident may help the investigators catch the thieves. Garden administrators are currently reviewing this footage.
The banner was installed a few weeks ago and represented a significant portion of the Harvard Community Garden Project’s startup costs. Due to budget constraints, the Garden administrators will be unable to purchase another banner in the near future.
“It is sad that whoever stole the banner would show such callous disrespect—not only for University property, but also for the goals our project promotes,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I, Part III, and Part IV of this story appeared on April 30, May 5, and May 7, 2010.)
The Administrative Board’s sexual assault policy is a series of paradoxes.
While the Ad Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—is not charged with upholding state law, its definition of sexual assault nearly mirrors state policy.
Lawyers are not welcome in the process, except when they are hired by the College to collect evidence for cases.
Administrators say the Ad Board’s primary mission is to help students learn from their mistakes, but the board can also dole out punishments as severe as required withdrawal or suggest the Faculty Council dismiss a student.
Unwrapping these apparent contradictions can be challenging for both board members and outsiders. Criticisms of the Ad Board’s handling of sexual assault cases run the gamut: for example, many would like to see more sexual assault cases end more frequently with decisive rulings, others complain that the board deprives the accused of due process.
Despite the perpetual criticisms and the complexities of the Ad Board process, many individuals involved with the board say that the way it handles sexual assault cases has seen marked improvement since the 2003 Leaning Committee—tasked with re-evaluating how the Ad Board handles sexual assault cases—recommended the regular use of independent fact-finders and the creation of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
While using fact finders has solved some of the issues with the Ad board’s sexual assault policies, many believe there are still fundamental flaws in the adjudication process that need to be addressed.
A PROFESSIONAL SOLUTION
During their review of the Ad Board’s procedures, the Leaning Committee found that many students involved in the process felt that the board “was not doing a sufficiently comprehensive or timely job” in dealing with cases of sexual assault, according to Jennifer Leaning, a human rights professor and chair of the committee.
“Months would go by, which is a long time to be in limbo about something that you felt was an egregious wrong,” Leaning says about the students coping with the gaps between different steps in the process.
Moreover, Leaning says the lengthy proceedings often ended with inconclusive findings, namely the “take no action” ruling in which the Ad Board declares it does not have enough evidence to decide the case.
Prior to the inclusion of fact-finders in the process, members of the Ad Board—comprised of administrators and faculty members—were responsible for interviewing witnesses, collecting statements, and collating evidence, according to John “Jay” L. Ellison, associate dean of the College and the secretary of the Ad Board.
In the past, sexual assault cases took up to nine months to complete, Ellison says.
“Members of the board are not able to devote 100 percent of their time to this, and they had to balance many committee members’ schedules to meet with students,” he says.
In addition, many members of the Ad Board did not possess the training necessary to deal with the complexities of sexual assault cases.
OSAPR Director Sarah A. Rankin says that many Ad Board officers are “uncomfortable” with sexual assault cases, which can negatively impact students’ willingness to share their experiences.
When the Leaning Committee’s report came out in 2003, it offered a solution: an increased reliance on independent fact-finders. Since then, fact-finders—often attorneys who are hired on a case-by-case basis—have routinely been brought in to deal with much of the evidence gathering in Ad Board cases.
As the Ad Board does not perform or require rape kits or forensic investigation of any kind, the board relies heavily on witness testimony—making the fact-finder particularly important to the process. While there are rarely eyewitnesses in sexual assault cases, the fact-finder will interview students recommended by either the accused or the accuser to gain information, according to Ellison.
Though they were not necessarily present for the alleged incident, witnesses may provide valuable circumstantial information, such as the level of intoxication of the victim or the interactions of the complainant and defendant prior to the event, Rankin says.
And “fresh complaint” witnesses—often close friends of the victims who the victim confides in soon after the incident—can verify the consistency of the victim’s account and provide evidence of the victim’s emotional state shortly after the alleged assault, according to Perry Moriearty, who served as a fact-finder for the Ad Board on multiple occasions before becoming a law professor at the University of Minnesota.
The fact-finder also works to find inconsistencies in students’ accounts.
“If there are two students that are completely in disagreement about what happened, it comes down to credibility,” Ellison says. “If the details vary significantly [with each retelling], the fact-finder judges that for us,” Ellison says.
Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell says she thinks that fact-finders have been a “huge” help to the Ad Board process.
“Because they are professional lawyers, they have a professional sense of what ought to be pursued and what doesn’t necessarily apply to the case,” Howell says. “It’s their dedicated job to organize and follow through with what can be very, very complicated webs of witnesses.”
By the end of the process, the fact-finder has typically interviewed many students—up to 45 in one extreme case, according to Ellison—and written an extensive case report summarizing the information obtained from the witness testimonies and other research.
From start to finish, Moriearty says that the investigation can take fact-finders up to 200 hours.
DEFINING CONSENT
Over the past two decades, criticism of the Ad Board’s handling of sexual assault cases has been divided into two camps: one believes that the Ad Board and the Faculty rules set an unreasonably high bar for finding a student guilty of rape, while the other believes that the board does not treat accused students fairly.
The Faculty’s definition of sexual misconduct, as laid out in the undergraduate student handbook, mandates that sexual assault must “take place against a person’s will or [be] accompanied by physical force or the threat of bodily injury.”
According to the handbook, absence of positive consent is not enough to show sexual assault took place, Ellison says.
“Unwillingness may be expressed verbally or physically,” the handbook reads. The policy adds that sexual activity with a person “incapable of expressing unwillingness”—due to the influence of alcohol or drugs, for example—is also considered sexual misconduct.
However, Pforzheimer House Resident Dean Lisa Boes—who, like all resident deans, sits on the Ad Board—says that this policy is not as inclusive as it should be to encompass the broad spectrum of circumstances surrounding sexual misconduct.
Boes contrasts Harvard’s policy with that of Brandeis University, which defines sexual misconduct as any activity occuring without the “explicit” and “clearly communicated” consent of both parties involved, which shifts the burden of proof to the accused rather than the complainant.
In addition, the Brandeis policy states that evidence of drug and/or alcohol consumption “may raise a presumption of physical and/or mental incapacity,” further broadening the definition of sexual assault.
At Harvard, Boes says, the Ad Board often engages in discussions as to whether or not the accuser was incapable of providing consent due to alcohol consumption—which plays a role in almost every sexual assault at Harvard, according to Ellison.
Boes says that in her experience, the Ad Board often takes examples of the victim being able to carry out a task, such as sending a text message, as evidence that he or she was capable of providing consent.
“I personally believe this is a low standard of conduct for Harvard students,” Boes says. “I think Harvard can do better.”
Howell says she, too, feels that the board’s decision is sometimes restricted by the rules of the Faculty.
“There are moments when what the board is forced to do by Faculty rules feels incommensurate with the outcome I would like to see,” she says.
While some Ad Board members question the Harvard’s definition of sexual assault, Ellison says there has been no formal inquiry into changing the College’s definition of sexual assault.
“There has been discussion at the Board and, I believe, among some members of the faculty, concerning the definition, but I am uncertain if that will end up in a reexamination of the policy,” he wrote in an e-mail.
THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED
While some Ad Board members and other administrators worry that sanctions are not always given when they are warranted, some attorneys involved with the process and Faculty members say they are concerned that students accused of sexual assault are not being treated fairly.
Harvey Silverglate, a lawyer who has been employed by dozens of students going before the Ad Board since 1969, is a strident opponent of the process, going so far as to call it an “evil system.”
Silverglate, a Harvard Law School graduate, says he takes issue with the board’s label as an educational body.
“They don’t get at the problem that this is a disciplinary body that pretends it’s something else,” he says.
Yet members of the Ad Board emphasize the educational nature of the body and say their intention is to have students learn from the proceedings.
Ellison is also quick to point out that the Ad Board does not allocate consequences with the same severity as a court of law.
“Ours is not a criminal process. We’re not going to take away somebody’s civil rights,” he says. “We have a whole different standard: hearsay is fine with us; we take cases that the district attorney would never take; we’re not adjudicating the law.”
Silverglate says he believes many of his clients are innocent, but “getting the board to listen is a next to impossible task.”
Michael Schneider, another lawyer who advises students who go before the Ad Board, says that as “a lawyer, but also as a parent,” he approves of the educational model.
“It often means that their ultimate resolution is not that punitive,” Schneider says. But he says that he is concerned that lawyers cannot be more involved in the Ad Board process.
Unlike the Law School’s disciplinary board, which Schneider says “takes due process quite seriously,” the Ad Board does not allow accused students to have any outside representatives.
“There is a role for lawyers and advocates to play in this process,” he says.
Biology Professor Richard M. Losick agrees that the board does not allow for many of the rights considered fundamental in the American legal system.
“Due process is a casualty of this greater mission of handling things in a educational way,” Losick says.
For example, the current Ad Board process does not allow the accused to be physically present while the accuser is giving testimony. Instead, the accused are given opportunities to respond in written statements and can hear about the information presented from their resident dean.
Though Losick agrees that the presence of the alleged offender would likely intimidate the victim, he points to Yale University’s model, in which the accused is able to listen to the testimony of the accuser through headphones in a separate room.
“It can’t be the case that we lower standards for finding out the truth and due process,” Losick says. “This is a university, of all places. Truth has to come first.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed has been appointed as a professor at Harvard Law School, a professor of History in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and will serve as the Carol K. Pforzheimer Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Gordon-Reed, a 1984 graduate of the Law School, won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in history for her book, “The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,” which traces the lineage of four generations of a slave family descended from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson.
Gordon-Reed will not begin teaching until the fall of 2011. She said she is not yet sure exactly how her time will be divided between the Law School and FAS. In addition, she said she hopes to teach both graduate and undergraduate students at FAS.
She is currently a professor at New York Law School.
Some time after the 2010-2011 academic year, she will conduct research as a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
According to Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Barbara J. Grosz, offering professorships at the institute is often used as a method of attracting tenured professors from other institutions.
Grosz said she met with Gordon-Reed after Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow suggested her. “It was clear that there was a perfect fit between [Gordon-Reed] and Radcliffe,” Grosz said.
“Colleagues, students, and aspiring scholars rejoice over the chance to work with her as she deepens historical understanding of law, slavery, and the human experience,” Minow wrote in a Law School press release.
Grosz said Gordon-Reed’s position at the Radcliffe Institute will provide her with “a second home at which she can work across disciplines.”
Gordon-Reed said that though she is unsure of the exact scope of her research, she plans to continue work on her second volume about the Hemings family while at the Radcliffe Institute.
Grosz said she is sure Gordon-Reed’s research “absolutely will be on the frontiers of knowledge.”
Gordon-Reed, who said she plans to commute between New York City and Cambridge, said that she was drawn back to the Law School because of its familiarity. “I spent some of my most formative years at HLS,” she said.
She believes, she said, that the Law School retains many characteristics from when she was a student, but that the classes are smaller than they used to be and “the students are nicer to each other these days.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:
CORRECTIONS: May 3, 2010
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the May 3 news article "Historian Named to Three Positions" incorrectly stated that historian Annette Gordon-Reed is currently a professor at New York University Law School. In fact, she is a professor at New York Law School, and currently teaches at NYU Law School as a visiting professor.
Due to misinformation from a source, the article also stated that Gordon-Reed will conduct research as a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study next fall. In fact, she will be a Radcliffe fellow some time after the 2010-2011 academic year, according to Cheryl Klufio, public relations director of the Institute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is nearing the end of a redesigned budgeting process used to help reduce a deficit that currently stands at $80 million.
Friday was the tentative deadline for departments to communicate funding requests to the FAS administration, according to a budget guidance letter that Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, the FAS dean of administration and finance, sent to unit administrators in early February.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith will determine unrestricted allocations by May 15, and the budget for the coming academic year is expected to be finalized by the end of May.
This year, FAS administrators have taken a more active role in determining each unit’s budget, waiting until the middle of May to provide departments with their budget allocations.
According to the FAS administration’s “first-dollar principle,” units are being asked to spend all restricted funds—such as endowments and grants associated with spending guidelines—before reaching out to the central FAS administration for additional unrestricted funds known as subventions.
“It would be easier to know exactly what we were doing and to be able to plan earlier, but I think this is the nature of the beast that we’re all struggling to tame,” History of Science Chair Anne Harrington ’82 said.
Facing a $220 million deficit last year, Smith asked departments and centers to trim 15 percent from their expected budgets—traditionally formulated in January or February—for the current academic year.
At the time, administrators scrambled to restructure their expenditures, cutting costs ranging from staff positions to cookies at departmental meetings.
Department administrators have said that FAS’s new approach requires more back and forth discourse with the FAS budgeting office.
Molecular and Cellular Biology Executive Director of Administration Susan H. Foster said that the administration has asked her department to justify all expenses, adding that this approach seemed appropriate.
Foster said that she considered her own budget for the next school year to be complete, since last year saw extensive budgetary changes, when MCB was forced to cut spending for core staff positions by 30 percent.
Smith said in an interview last month that the new budgeting approach has helped ensure “the stability moving forward.”
Given the volatile state of finances, Smith said determining subventions earlier in the process would have forced administrators to “guess” if cuts would still be necessary.
He said he will announce a reduced deficit figure in the coming months, though he acknowledged that there is still much progress to be made toward a balanced budget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Armed with caulk guns, foam insulation, and compact fluorescent light bulbs, sixty volunteers weatherproofed and made energy upgrades to the Phillips Brooks House yesterday.
Students and Office for Sustainability staff members completed 20 separate projects as part of the weatherization, which was co-sponsored by OFS, the Environmental Action Committee, PBHA, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Green Team. The ECMs—energy conservation measures—included sealing gaps in windows with caulk to prevent heat from escaping during the winter, installing water-saving dual-flush handles on toilets, and setting up recycling and electricity-saving programs in the offices.
Although the students only made small changes during yesterday’s weatherization, the updates will save nine tons of carbon dioxide and $3750 in utility bills annually, according to OFS. The savings will pay for the majority of the changes within about a year.
EAC Co-chair Jackson S. Salovaara ’11 said that while FAS has been completing weatherizations and energy audits of larger buildings on campus, this event can be used as a model for using student volunteer labor to make changes to smaller buildings.
Beyond its practical effects, the weatherization was an opportunity for the EAC to make a greater connection with its parent organization, PBHA, according to EAC Co-chair L. Gracie Brown ’11. Brown added that she plans to strengthen these ties by working with other individual PBHA programs to integrate environmentalism into their programming.
PBHA President Kaitlin S.L. Koga ’11 said that the weatherization was also an opportunity for PBHA to branch out into another area of service and work with other student groups on campus.
“The house is a metaphor for the people we serve,” Koga said. “We can make the house fit into the spirit of service that we at PBHA promote.”
EAC member and event organizer Isabella A. Wechsler ’13 added that the weatherization was a “pilot project” for the EAC’s plans to become more involved with hands-on environmental projects.
In addition to bringing together members of the EAC and PBHA volunteers, the event also attracted other service-minded students not involved with either program.
“It’s rare that you get a chance to make a difference without leaving the Harvard bubble,” said Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, who participated in the weatherization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe heavyweights and lightweights wrapped up the dual season last Saturday as the heavyweights competed against other Boston schools in the Beanpot, while the lightweights took on MIT and Wisconsin in the Muri Cup.
With perfect weather and ideal rowing conditions on the Charles River, both crews fared well against their respective competition, ending the regular season with added momentum before entering the postseason.
NO. 18 HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. BEANPOT
With a first-place finish in the Varsity Four B, and two runner-up and two third-place finishes, No. 18 Radcliffe (3-7) relied on its depth to win the fourth annual Beanpot Regatta. The Black and White amassed 43 points–just three points ahead of Northeastern–to claim its fourth-consecutive team championship trophy.
For the rowers, the win provided strong evidence that their efforts are starting to produce winning results.
“It’s always a great feeling to come out on top,” co-captain Christine Baugh said. “Winning the Beanpot team championship is a testament to the depth and strength of our team, and, especially in a season like this, is testament to the resiliency of each and every athlete. It did not start our way this year, so we really had to work hard to get to where we are today.”
While the coaches worked hard all week preparing for the Beanpot, Baugh felt that it was only a matter of time before Radcliffe’s talent would begin to shine through.
“Coaches work hard to do what they think is right to make us faster each week, but it’s also finding that right combination of people and lineup to make the boats go fast,” she said.
The Black and White started out strong against its competition in the varsity eight race, claiming the lead for the first 1,000 meters. From that point on, it was a three boat race, as Northeastern and Columbia both made big moves to stay in contention for a first-place finish.
In the end, it was the Lions who crossed the finish line first at 6:43.18, while the Huskies completed the course in 6:45.55. The Black and White wasn’t far behind, taking third place with a 6:46.38 finish.
“We were excited to have had that start and stick close to the crews,” Baugh said. “All we have to do is figure out how to stick with them and move past them in that last bit of the race.”
The varsity four B established its rhythm early on and never looked back. In a dominant race, Radcliffe recorded a time of 8:01.74, finishing more than four seconds ahead of second-place BU.
The Black and White also finished second in the second varsity eight (7:02.33), second in the varsity four A (7:51.33), and third in the third varsity eight (7:23.27).
With a team championship in hand, Radcliffe just might have found the momentum builder it needs as it looks ahead to the EAWRC Sprints, set to take place in two weeks’ time.
“We definitely feel like we have the potential to do well in Sprints,” Baugh said.
For seniors like Baugh, though, there is added incentive to perform well in the postseason.
“We’re going to put it all out there, and see what we have, because this is it for some of us,” she said.
NO. 4 LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. MIT/NO. 1 WISCONSIN
The fourth-ranked Radcliffe lightweights (4-3) also saw success on the Charles last Saturday, claiming the Muri Cup by defeating MIT. Top-ranked Wisconsin, which participated in the regatta as a guest, won all three races, as expected from its status as the two-time defending national champions.
“All the boats were happy with their performances,” co-captain Amanda Pfabe said. “We were really excited to be able to race against Wisconsin and end our regular season rowing against MIT. We performed well.”
The varsity eight maintained contact with the Badgers for the first 1,000 meters of the race, but in the end, Wisconsin proved to be too fast and experienced for the Black and White. The Badgers finished with a time of 6:49.1, with Radcliffe coming in nine seconds behind at 6:58.8. The Engineers took third with a time of 7:15.6.
“I think that the first varsity boat has gotten a lot better at staying internal, staying composed, and focusing on what we can do to make our own boat go faster,” Pfabe said. “I think we did that well today.”
The second varsity eight clocked in at 7:13.3, 22.6 seconds ahead of MIT, while the Varsity Four B and Varsity Four A boats finished their races with times of 8:03.6 and 8:16.9, respectively–good enough for a second- and third-place finish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is rare in any sport that top competitors get to face each other in the regular season just weeks before they would see each other in championship action. On the collegiate men’s lightweight rowing scene, though, the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton regular season regatta presents exactly this opportunity.
Last Saturday morning in Princeton, N.J., three of the fastest crews in the nation—the No. 1 Princeton Tigers, No. 2 Harvard Crimson, and No. 4 Yale Bulldogs—met in perfect weather conditions to test the rankings and see each other’s speed prior to Eastern Sprints and the IRA Championships. In the first of three consecutive contests between the crews, the Crimson (10-0) walked away as the Vogel Cup team champions, having earned the most points overall.
The first varsity and freshman eights also capped off perfect dual racing seasons.
“I don’t really think you ever have to motivate anyone for HYP’s, because it’s such a historic race,” said captain and varsity five seat Martin Eiermann. “It’s always a very contested race, and this year it was great to have three of the top four teams in the country going after each other.”
Entering the race with an undefeated record in the regular season up until that point, Harvard’s varsity eight was likely motivated to keep its streak alive. The crew fell back a couple seats off of the start, but as the Tigers (7-1)—racing in the middle lane—began to pull away, the Crimson went with them.
“As the race progressed, Yale fell off the pace, and we continued to trail Princeton,” said sophomore stroke Tim Moore. “But then in the third 500 [meters], our base started pushing us up on them, and then with about 400 to go we were even.”
The Harvard varsity persistently chipped away at the Tigers’ advantage down the entire course, letting its strong base rhythm push the boat’s bow-ball back into Princeton.
In the final 250 meters of the race, the Crimson brought up the stroke rating and poured on the power to sprint through the opposition.
Harvard’s varsity finished just over half a second—the equivalent of two seats—ahead of the Tigers in a final time of 5:40.7 to Princeton’s 5:41.4.  With the victory, the Crimson claimed the Goldthwait Cup for the 41st time in program history and also became the 27th Harvard varsity crew to go unbeaten in regular-season competition.
The Harvard second varsity eight entered Saturday’s competition as the top-ranked crew in its category. From the very start, though, it fell behind the pace of the pack and finished down on both Princeton and second-place Yale (3-3-1).
“This was not the kind of speed that they have,” said Eiermann of the 2V boat. “I have no doubt that they will be able to rally back for Sprints. They were ranked No. 1 in the country before this weekend for a reason. And, as long as they put the race behind them and keep looking forward, it ought to be a very good Sprints Regatta.”
The Crimson first freshman eight mirrored the varsity’s performances all season long, and this past Saturday was no exception. The rookies trailed the Tigers for the first 1,200 meters of the race but rowed them down on the second half of the course. Harvard’s final margins of victory over Princeton and Yale were 3.5 and 8.7 seconds, respectively, and the crew’s overall time was 5:53.0.
“These [freshmen] are just a very mentally tough crew,” said junior and varsity six seat Will Newell. “They look very strong, but what’s more noticeable to me is their mental toughness. They all seem to be on the same page.”
The third varsity and second freshman eights each garnered second-place finishes. The third varsity posted a time of 6:06.4 that was 3.3 seconds back from Yale. Similarly, the second freshman crew finished behind Yale by 5.2 seconds in a time of 6:24.4.
The Crimson now has two weeks without a race before meeting Princeton, Yale and the rest of the Eastern Sprints League in Worcester, Mass. More than ever, Harvard will have to push to find speed as everyone else is chasing it down.
“In the end, a lot of the season is measured by how you do at Sprints and IRA’s because those are the races where the stakes are highest,” Eiermann said. “Today was a big stepping stone, but we’re not finished yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For prospective Harvard oarsmen, part of the appeal of rowing on the Charles River is that each day you’ll catch a glimpse of various other crews in training—some of which, like Northeastern, will be your competition later in the year. On the downside, this means that your competition will also be watching you.
From September through April this year, Crimson boats passed Husky crews on the Charles, and rowers likely stole a glance at their opposition doing drill work, taking power strokes, or practicing race pieces. This year, the programs waited until this past Saturday to finally meet in dual racing competition. The highly-anticipated race came just two weeks prior to the Eastern Sprints Regatta and was both squads’ last opportunity to see where they stand in the league before the championships.
This time around, No. 4 Harvard proved its superiority over No. 6 Northeastern, sweeping all events in the Charles Basin and claiming the Smith Cup.
“We’ve seen each other all season,” said sophomore and varsity three seat Michael DiSanto, “and this race is our chance to see who is the fastest crew on the Charles.”
In the varsity race, the Crimson (6-1) jumped out to an early advantage, taking three seats on the Huskies (3-2) in the crews’ starting sequence. The varsity methodically took inch after inch on Northeastern through the first 1,000 meters, building an open-water lead.
“We raced pretty strong through the first 500,” said sophomore and varsity stroke Pat Lapage. “Then we sort of carried on the rest of the way really and pushed it a bit at the end to make sure they weren’t coming back. It was a good race.”
Conditions in the Charles Basin were nearly perfect with placid water and a slight tailwind, allowing for some fast finishes. Harvard crossed the line in a time of 5:51.54, more than six seconds ahead of the Huskies’ time of 5:57.6.
The varsity’s victory was the Crimson’s 13th-consecutive win over Northeastern for the Smith Cup and was the program’s 19th win in the cup’s 22-year existence.
Harvard’s second, third and fourth varsities lined up with the Husky second varsity for one four-boat race. The Crimson’s second and third eights placed first and second in times of 6:00.9 and 6:05.25, respectively. Northeastern finished third in the race just over three seconds back from Harvard’s third varsity in a time of 6:08.3. The Crimson fourth varsity, a combination boat of varsity and freshmen, finished fourth in 6:24.5.
The Harvard first freshman eight continued its undefeated streak, soundly defeating the Husky rookies by a margin of 11.4 seconds in a final time of 6:01.3.
Overall, the Crimson had a successful morning, and because Northeastern recently raced Brown, these results could be an indicator of where Harvard stands not just in comparison to hometown rivals but also in the entire Ivy League.
“We just wanted to see how we matched up against [Northeastern] since they had lost to Brown by about as much as we had,” said Lapage. “We’ve been training hard and hopefully gaining speed, so we wanted to see how our training was going before Sprints.”
The Bears’ varsity was just one second ahead of the Crimson early in the season and was exactly a second faster than the Huskies only two weeks ago. By comparison, Harvard could be as much as five seconds faster than Brown after its six-second margin over Northeastern last Saturday. This remains speculation until Eastern Sprints on May 16 and 17, when all of these crews will go head-to-head once again.
“[Until Sprints] we need to keep making the technical changes and training real hard...to see if we can add speed in these last couple weeks.” Lapage said. “[We’ll] fine tune training and put the cap on the performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Dartmouth softball team was on Soldiers Field, it was celebrating its first-ever North Division title at the expense of the host Crimson.
A year later, Harvard wasn’t about to let that happen again.
Needing two wins in this weekend’s four-game set to clinch the division crown, the Crimson got it done early and in convincing fashion, sweeping the Big Green, 9-0 and 7-1, at home on Saturday.
“I’m proud of our team—everybody contributed,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “Everyone did something great today. We came out fired up, and it was awesome.”
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 1
Just as in the first game, Harvard made a statement in the first inning and never looked back, cruising to a 7-1 victory and punching its ticket to the Ivy League Championship Series.
Junior Ellen Macadam got the game started with a double down the left-field line. Co-captain Melissa Schellberg moved her to third base with a single, and then sophomore Whitney Shaw drove a single through the left side to plate Macadam for the game’s first run.
“[They were] pivotal, Ellen’s hits,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “First batter of the game, to get those hits and get on for us. And that puts Whitney up in that inning, and she’s just a strong, powerful hitter. It’s hard to get her out.”
Senior Jennifer Francis then singled up the middle to score Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and Shaw.
Sophomore Rachel Brown did her part to protect the early three-run lead, scattering a pair of hits over four innings of work for her second win of the day. Brown also struck out 13 batters, which brought her season total to 219—surpassing the program single-season record she set last spring.
Harvard broke the game open in the bottom of the fourth, sparked by a one-out walk from sophomore Jane Alexander. Macadam singled to move Alexander to third and chase Dartmouth starter Kat Hicks from the game.
Reliever Evan Gray fared no better against the potent Crimson offense. After Macadam stole second, senior Stephanie Krysiak singled to shallow left to plate Alexander.
Macadam was tagged out at home on Schellberg’s suicide squeeze, but Shaw followed with a two-RBI double to deep right-center. Freshman Jess Ferri’s single to shallow left brought Shaw home for the seventh run of the game.
Black came on in relief and allowed just one run on four hits in three innings of work to seal the win for Harvard—giving the senior class another shot at winning its second Ivy title.
“I came out knowing that this was my last game on this field, and I really wanted to go out with a bang,” Black said. “It’s awesome to be able to celebrate on our own field.”
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 0
In the first inning of this crucial divisional series, both the Crimson and Big Green came out swinging. But only one pitcher could find her way out of the jam unscathed.
Though Brown allowed a pair of singles in the top of the first, she struck out the side to escape with a scoreless inning. Dartmouth pitcher Hillary Barker was not so lucky.
Macadam got a piece of the first pitch of the inning to open the floodgates, dropping a single into left-center field.
“Ellen’s leadoff, first-pitch single...that set the tone for the entire day,” Black said.
Krysiak reached second base on a throwing error by Barker, and Schellberg followed up with an RBI single over Big Green shortstop Christy Autin’s head.
Shaw then cleared the bases with a three-run bomb over the left-field fence, her 11th dinger of the season.
Brown settled down, scattering two hits over her next three innings of scoreless work.
Meanwhile, the offense continued to pad the advantage.
“I [knew] our pitching was there—we were going to be pretty consistent with that,” Allard said. “We really talked about coming out strong offensively and really playing clean on defense, and we did that.”
Macadam doubled home Alexander in the second, and Schellberg’s single to shallow right scored freshman pinch-runner Ashley Heritage in the bottom of the fourth.
Heritage entered the game after junior Emily Henderson injured her ankle sliding back into first base in the fourth inning. The left fielder missed the rest of the weekend’s action, but Allard hopes to have her back in the lineup for next weekend’s championship series.
The Crimson added one run in the fifth on a sacrifice fly from senior Jessica Pledger, and brought the game to an early conclusion in the sixth.
Francis hit a two-RBI single up the middle which plated Schellberg and Shaw, giving Harvard a 9-0 lead and ending the game by the run rule.
Brown earned the win in four innings of work, while Black pitched two innings of one-hit ball in relief.
“Coming into the weekend, [Dartmouth was] the third-place team in the league, hitting the ball very well,” Allard said. “[Brown and Black] limited them to one run in two games. They were outstanding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of splitting doubleheaders, the Crimson came through with two wins when it counted.
The Harvard baseball team swept division leader Dartmouth in Saturday’s twinbill, besting the Big Green, 8-4, before topping the rival team in the nightcap, 15-7, at O’Donnell Field.
The wins kept the Crimson alive in the race for the Red Rolfe Division title, giving seniors a pair of victories on Senior Day and handing Dartmouth its first pair of losses in an Ivy doubleheader in over three years. Harvard would have needed to repeat its feat yesterday to clinch the division title, but the Big Green took those contests.
“We are just trying to take it inning by inning right now,” said senior first baseman Dan Zailskas. “We have to win four games in a row, so we are just trying to keep focused on every single pitch.”
“It was a nice day today, but it doesn’t mean anything unless we finish it off tomorrow,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh continued. “I’m happy for the guys since we’ve been splitting...all year, so it’s nice to win two.”
HARVARD 15, DARTMOUTH 7
Errors on the field are often mistakes that can come back to haunt a team. Luckily for the Crimson, this wasn’t the case during the nightcap.
Harvard tallied five errors in its 15-7 victory over the Big Green, which posted four miscues of its own.
“We did have some errors, but I don’t think many of them hurt us too bad,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “Generally, four or five errors hurts us a lot, but when our hitters get a lot of hits and get a lot of innings going for us with a lot of runs, it doesn’t matter.”
The errors were secondary when the runs kept coming.
After a quiet start in the first three innings, the Crimson would go on to bang out a season-high of 19 hits. Sophomore Marcus Way helped to dent the scoreboard in the fourth for Harvard with a sacrifice fly to center field to knock in junior Sean O’Hara, who had previously doubled. Zailskas then followed with a single to right for the second run. Sophomore J.T. Tomes bunted for a single, and the runners advanced to second a third on a throwing error, allowing Zailskas to later score the third run of the inning on a wild pitch.
Although Dartmouth was able to tie it up in the top of the fifth, the Crimson was not about to slow down. The home team followed up with three runs in both the fifth and sixth innings for a 9-3 lead.
Dartmouth capitalized on two Harvard errors and a walk to shrink the Crimson’s lead to 9-7 in the top of the seventh, but Harvard quickly gained back an unearned run. The Crimson secured its position in the eighth when Way and sophomore Jeff Reynolds each hit two-run singles, and another score off a wild pitch brought the final count to 15-7.
The Crimson finished the night with Reynolds going 5-for-6, junior Dillon O’Neill, O’Hara, and Albright having three hits, and Way notching five RBI. Junior pitcher Eric Eadington supported the offense with a solid 6.1 innings of work, allowing six runs—but just one earned—and striking out three.
“We had good momentum in both games,” Albright said. “We hit well and just kept going out. We never had one big inning where we scored a lot, but we scored a lot by scoring few and often.”
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 4
The Crimson started the afternoon slowly as well, but the resilient squad dominated the middle innings to cruise to an 8-4 victory in the first game of the twinbill.
Three scoreless innings were broken in the top of the fourth when Dartmouth junior Jason Brookes plated sophomore Joe Sclafani on a two-out single to take the early lead.
It didn’t last for long. O’Hara doubled down the line and was brought in by Albright’s single up the middle to tie the game.
After Albright was picked off, Zailskas, senior Chris Rouches, and freshman Kyle Larrow pounded consecutive two-out singles to score another run. O’Neill then belted the ball to left-center field for two more RBI.
“Knowing that we were behind in the [first] game and were able to get on top was a real big boost to us,” Walsh said. “[We] got the lid off there and got the 4-1 lead even though they climbed back on it.”
Although the Big Green bounced back in the fifth to cut the Harvard advantage to one, another Crimson four-spot secured the lead. Albright plated junior Sam Franklin with a sacrifice fly to center field. Rouches’ fly down the right-field line was then dropped for an error, allowing O’Hara to score and Harvard to stay at the plate. Larrow followed by lacing the ball into left field, where a bad bounce past the fielder helped the Crimson to score two more, bringing the lead to 8-3.
A homer by Dartmouth freshman Zack Bellanger in the seventh was not enough to help the Big Green come back. Sophomore hurler Brent Suter kept Dartmouth in check, remaining unbeaten in Ivy play by striking out six and allowing five hits in his second complete game of the season.
“Our first game, [Suter] threw a gem for us,” Albright said. “He threw hard...and threw a lot of strikes. He did very good for us.”
Suter was supported by an offense that delivered, allowing the Crimson to clinch the first win of the twinbill.
“We are very hot and cold, and it’s very contagious,” Zailskas said. “Once one guy starts hitting, everybody else seems to follow suit...We are confident right now, and we’ve really come together as a team the past few days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team travelled to Dartmouth yesterday, needing a sweep of the two-game doubleheader to capture its first Rolfe Division title since 2006. Instead, it was the Big Green that got to bring out the brooms.
The Crimson (17-25, 10-10 Ivy) fell to Dartmouth (23-15, 13-7), 9-0, in the first game of the twinbill—a result that clinched the division title for the Big Green—before losing, 9-7, in the nightcap.
“We got flat-out beat,” said Harvard junior captain Tyler Albright.
Junior Jason Brooks led Dartmouth’s attack from the batter’s box, hitting 6-for-7 with eight RBI and two runs scored on the day.
“We had a tough day today, but I guess that’s just baseball,” said junior left fielder Sam Franklin.
DARTMOUTH 9, HARVARD 7
With its hopes for a division title crushed, the Crimson stepped back out onto the field for its last Ivy League contest of the season.
“We like playing baseball,” Albright said. “We wanted to come back and get another win and take the series away from them even though we had no shot at the Ivy League title.”
The Big Green had other ideas. Dartmouth scored five times in the bottom of the eighth inning to erase a three-run deficit and take the second game of the twinbill.
Following a double by junior Sam Bean, senior Ezra Josephson hit a two-bagger of his own, scoring Bean. After senior Jim Wren walked, Brooks came through with his sixth hit of the day, bringing home Josephson to close the deficit to one.
Freshman Ennis Coble reached on a fielder’s choice, and classmate Matt Peterson lined a double down the left field line to give the Big Green a one-run lead. Dartmouth tacked on one more insurance run on a single by sophomore David Turnbull.
Harvard put up a five-spot of its own in the visitors’ half of the seventh to open up the game and overcome a 3-1 Big Green lead. Senior Dan Zailskas doubled on the first pitch of the inning and scored on a double by classmate Chris Rouches. After advancing to third on a single by junior Dillon O’Neill, Rouches scored to tie the game on a wild pitch.
Franklin gave the Crimson the lead with an RBI single, and Albright added one more with a sacrifice fly to right, scoring sophomore Jeff Reynolds. Franklin then scored the final run of the inning by stealing home on a delayed-steal play.
Harvard freshman Joey Novak took the loss—his third of the season—surrendering two runs while facing three batters and failing to record an out.
DARTMOUTH 9, HARVARD 0
Dartmouth sophomore pitcher Kyle Hendricks threw a complete-game shutout and allowed only two Crimson hits to earn his fourth win of the season for the Big Green. Hendricks, who was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim while playing in high school, struck out four Harvard batters and faced only one more than the minimum while ending the Crimson’s division title hopes.
“[Hendricks] shut us down pretty good,” Albright said. “We weren’t able to make good, solid contact with him.”
Dartmouth started the scoring early and kept it up throughout the game, as the Big Green put runs on the board in every inning but the first.
The offensive onslaught commenced with Brooks’ three-run home run, his fifth of the season and one of his three hits in the game. He followed it up with an RBI double in the third and a triple that scored two more in the fifth to finish with six RBI. The junior was only a single short of the cycle.
Zailskas pitched a perfect first inning for Harvard, striking out two of the first three Dartmouth batters he faced, before he ran into trouble in the second. The senior pitcher took the loss—his first of the season—after surrendering four runs in three innings of work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say that lacrosse is the fastest game played on two feet.
If that’s the case, then it’s not hard to imagine how painful it was for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team to go scoreless over the final 10:01 of the fourth quarter against Yale, letting the win it needed to make the postseason slip away.
A week after upsetting No. 6 Princeton, the Crimson (6-6, 2-4 Ivy) had improbably put itself in a win-and-in scenario, needing only to beat its archrival Bulldogs (10-3, 4-2) to secure a spot in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament.
Instead, Yale, which trailed for almost the entire second and third quarters, staged an impressive comeback and limited Harvard to only one goal in the fourth quarter to ice a 9-8 victory and secure its spot in the four-team conference tournament.
The Crimson, which was only 1-3 when giving up the game’s first goal this season, fell behind, 2-0, after the Bulldogs scored two unassisted goals within the first five minutes. Harvard wouldn’t strike back until sophomore Jeff Cohen scored off an assist from classmate Kevin Vaughan with three minutes left in the first quarter.
Despite holding a 13-5 shot advantage in the first, the Crimson headed into the second quarter with a 2-1 deficit on its plate.
“We came out very slow,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “We had a lot of shot opportunities but didn’t capitalize on [them]. They had a lot of breaks early, and we didn’t come back how we could have.”
Senior Jason Duboe opened the scoring in the second frame with an unassisted goal that evened the score at 2-2 with 13:49 left in the quarter. Another Vaughan-to-Cohen score at the 6:51 mark gave Harvard its first lead of the game, 3-2.
But the lead was short-lived, as Yale’s Brendan Gibson tied the game back up just over a minute later.
“[Jeff and Kevin] are both excellent players who hold a bright future for the program,” senior defenseman Ben Smith said. “Kevin was really challenging the opposition, and both of those guys are starting to build some chemistry, and they’re starting to be really effective.”
Junior Dean Gibbons and Cohen each recorded a goal as the second quarter came to a close to give the Crimson a 5-3 lead heading into the half. Even though Harvard held a 23-9 shot advantage at halftime, the Crimson was only able to maintain a slim lead due to the Bulldogs’ efficient shooting and just two saves by freshman goalie Harry Krieger.
Co-captain Travis Burr added another goal for Harvard at the opening of the third quarter to stretch the Crimson’s lead to 6-3.
Harvard was unable to bury Yale, though, and Bulldog leading scorer Brian Douglass scored his 30th goal of the season to close the gap to 6-4.
Sophomore Andrew Pataki committed a costly illegal body-check penalty later in the quarter, and Yale capitalized with a goal 13 seconds later to come within one of the Crimson.
Gibbons scored his second goal of the game to put Harvard back up by two, but the Bulldogs scored the final two goals of the period—including one with nine seconds left—to tie the game at seven entering the final quarter.
Cohen scored his fourth goal of the game at the 10:01 mark of the final quarter to put the lead back in the hands of the Crimson.
Douglass would tie the game up for Yale less than two minutes later and iced the game with what would be the game-winner at the 5:48 mark of the fourth quarter.
Despite the disappointing end to the season, Harvard finished the season at least .500 for the second-straight year after having consecutive losing seasons from 2005-2008.
“I wouldn’t want to sell our seniors short of what all they contributed this season by looking too far ahead, because they were a strong class with a lot of leadership,” Parchman said, “but this team will be strong next year as well.”
Overall, the Crimson held a 37-27 shot advantage but was an abysmal 7-for-21 on faceoffs, including 0-for-4 in the crucial fourth quarter. The loss was Harvard’s first this season when holding its opponent to less than 10 goals.
“It just came down to energy and focus,” Smith said. “Had we maybe focused on the little plays, things would have been different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a record of 12-12 going into the Eastern Championship, the women’s water polo team knew it had the opportunity to grab either a winning season or a losing one. Unfortunately for Harvard, the unranked Crimson squad fell in three close contests to No. 7 Michigan (32-6), No. 19 Bucknell (17-10) and Maryland (15-19) to end the year 12-15.
Harvard entered the three-game championship seeded eighth out of eight teams, knowing that a victory over some of the top seeds would propel the Crimson into the NCAA tournament. But while Harvard did improve on last year’s 12-16 record, a win was not in the cards.
“It was kind of hard—we set ourselves up coming in eighth seed,” junior Patty Smith said. “But every single game we did not give up. We put up a really good fight.”
The fight was obvious, with each match ending in a tighter score as the weekend progressed. Although the Crimson could not pull out a win, the team was still proud of the good moments it earned.
“I like to think the weekend will be remembered more for the good things, since it was our last tournament,” Smith said. “We’re looking to hopefully build on what we have now and get ready for a better season next year.”
Additionally, with three-straight losses going into summer and fall training, the team hopes to learn, improve, and be more determined next year.
“It really [is frustrating] to end your season with three losses,” freshman Elise Molnar said. “The thing about losing big games is that people get frustrated, and as they are training they really remember. It pushes people to work harder and push themselves harder so that it doesn’t happen again.”
MARYLAND 12, HARVARD 11
Harvard ended its season yesterday with one of the most impressive goals of the weekend. Trailing with only seconds on the clock, junior goalkeeper Shami Entenman volleyed the ball up to the four Crimson players lined up in front of the Terrapins’ goal. As the ball flew towards the cage, co-captain Kristina Berqquist tipped it in with only two seconds remaining in the game.
“That was a standout moment of the weekend,” Smith said. “It was good to end on a really awesome goal—especially for Kristina to end her last game.”
In addition to Berqquist’s goal, sophomore Devan Kennifer completed a hat trick with her last shot, pulling Harvard within one point in the fourth period. Kennifer was named to the Eastern Championship All-Tournament Second Team after scoring five goals on the weekend.
Sophomore Shannon Purcell and Smith scored two apiece as the Terrapins and Harvard went back and forth, tying the game three times during the match. While Maryland led, 8-6, going into the half, Entenman’s four saves in her first collegiate start as goalie helped the Crimson stay in contention.
“In the Bucknell and Maryland [games], we could have won those games, we should have won those games,” Molnar said. “We just didn’t.”
NO. 19 BUCKNELL 12, HARVARD 10
Saturday’s match was just as tight for Harvard, as the team faced No. 19 Bucknell for the third time this season. The Bison won the first matchup in late February, 9-7, while the Crimson, known for its impressive overtime play, grabbed a 13-12 overtime victory in early March.
“We’re really good at overtime, but we need to push through to get to overtime,” Smith said. “It obviously is better to beat them before the overtime decision, but I would have felt confident [that] if we had gone into overtime, the score would have been different.”
This rubber match began with a splash as Molnar opened the scoring for Harvard 1:31 into the game, followed by a goal from Bucknell 21 seconds later.
“There are things that we did wrong, but for the most part, we all played a really good game,” Smith said. “Especially at the start of the Bucknell game, we were still rolling off of that energy [from Michigan], but it wasn’t enough apparently.”
The Crimson trailed, 10-8, with seven minutes left on the clock before the Bison went on the attack, netting a goal less than a minute later. After Harvard pulled within two, sophomore Monica Zdrojewski brought the deficit to one midway through the period, but Bucknell had one goal left in it, ultimately taking the game, 12-10.
NO. 7 MICHIGAN 18, HARVARD 10
The weekend began with the toughest game for Harvard, as the squad faced the tournament’s top seed, No. 7 Michigan, for the first time this year.
“That was the best we had ever played them—we scored 10 goals,” Molnar said. “I don’t think many teams have, especially in our conference.”
The first period ended tied at three, but as the next eight minutes played out, the Crimson’s defense began to fall apart, while the Wolverines’ offense took control, scoring nine goals to Harvard’s three.
“The third and fourth quarters were good water polo, water polo worth watching,” Molnar said. “It was the second quarter that killed the game for us.”
The Crimson tallied one more goal in the third period and three more in the fourth, but even with sophomore goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy’s six saves, it was not enough to keep Michigan from taking the victory, 18-10.
“I’d say we had some moments of brilliance, and moments when any normal team would have thought it was fine, but our team knew we could do better than we did,” Smith said. “[Overall it was] a very strong weekend and season that will hopefully build for something better next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As high-school seniors finish up their springs, the Harvard softball team found itself in a similar situation—like these 12th-graders, the team showed up, but the outcome didn’t matter too much.
After clinching a playoff berth on Saturday at home against Dartmouth (14-27, 11-9 Ivy), the Crimson (25-20, 17-3) played two contests in Hanover yesterday in games that had little consequence for either team.
In the first game, the Crimson took the lead in the third inning and never looked back, winning by the score of 7-1.
The nightcap looked to be just the opposite—after falling behind early, Harvard couldn’t plate more than a run for most of the game. But following a number of late-game lead changes, the team held on for the win, 6-5, and completed the doubleheader and weekend sweeps.
“It was a great day,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “We came out strong, we came out with good energy, we came out to build on how we were playing at the end of the year.”
HARVARD 6, DARTMOUTH 5 (8 innings)
For the first six innings, the game was stable. The Big Green jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, and Harvard scored only one run through the sixth.
But from the seventh onward, bats for both teams came alive.
After struggling at the plate for most of the game, the Crimson put four on the board in the top of the seventh to take what looked to be a game-deciding lead change. Sophomore Whitney Shaw hit a two-out two-run home run to give Harvard its first lead of the day.
“I think their pitcher did a good job of spotting her pitches, and we weren’t making some good decisions,” Allard said. “But once we settled in and adjusted to her, we started to get some hits.”
But Dartmouth, whose bats had been equally quiet since a productive first frame, pushed two across the plate in the bottom half on a single and an error from co-captain and pitcher Margaux Black to force the game into extra innings. Both runs came with two outs.
In the first extra inning, the Crimson added another run to take a 6-5 lead. After blowing the save in the seventh, Black held on in her second chance, and Harvard managed to maintain its second lead of the game for the win.
Sophomore Rachel Brown—the staff’s No. 1 starter—settled down after giving up three runs in the first. She pitched three scoreless innings after a rough start before Black came in for the fifth.
“It’s kind of tough when you’re throwing no-hitters all the time and usually striking out batters,” Black said. “[Brown] had a tough first inning, but she really settled in and found her pitches.”
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 1
Even coming off of a doubleheader which clinched the division, the Crimson’s performance waned little in a first-game blowout victory over Dartmouth.
The lineup looked different than it has during other games this season, but many of the team’s regulars still started and contributed.
Junior Ellen Macadam, in the leadoff spot, reached base four times, going 3-for-4 with a home run. Shaw went 2-for-3 with an RBI and two runs batting third.
Harvard blew the game open in the third and fourth innings, leading by six going into the bottom half of the fourth. A three-run home run from senior Jennifer Francis in the top of the third—her fifth of the year—proved to be enough offense in the first game of the afternoon.
The Crimson chased Big Green starter Hillary Barker with two outs in the fifth. She was charged with seven runs in the game, all earned despite two Dartmouth errors.
Sophomore Julia Moore—making her 12th start of the year—pitched a complete game for Harvard, throwing five scoreless innings before giving up a home run to Big Green catcher Leigha Clarkson in the sixth. She allowed five hits and two walks to go with four strikeouts.
“I thought we had a great performance today and a very good start in the first game from Julia Moore,” Allard said. “We wanted to have a fresh arm throw Game 3 [of the weekend series].”
With the win, Moore improved to 5-4 to end the regular season.
“It was awesome, to come down to Dartmouth [and] to beat them,” Black said. “Awesome, awesome feeling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The prominent University of Virginia lacrosse program suffered a tremendous shock today, after a player on the men’s team was implicated in the death of a female Cavalier player.
The New York Times reported that 22-year old George Huguely was arrested and charged with murder on Monday morning after former girlfriend Yeardley Love was found dead in her off-campus apartment at 2:15 a.m.
According to the Times, Love showed signs of physical trauma, which led to suspicion of Huguely.
The tragedy places two programs in turmoil that had been enjoying stellar campaigns in 2010. The top-ranked men’s team will be very competitive in the upcoming NCAA Championships in Baltimore, Md., and the women’s program does not lag far behind, ranked in the top five nationally.
Although sentencing still lies ahead for Huguely, who is currently being held in a regional jail, the incident continues to raise scrutiny for top men’s lacrosse programs with the Duke scandal still fresh in the public consciousness.
According to ESPN, Huguely attended the same preparatory school in Maryland as the Duke players who were charged with sexual assault in 2006. Those charges were later dropped.

Apparently, even potential serious danger can't force Cantarigians to deviate from their busy schedules. Earlier this afternoon, a fire alarm went off in the Holyoke center, drawing at least three firetrucks to the scene but did not motivate any sort of rush to evacuate.
One FlyBy correspondent, who was inside the Holyoke Center Au Bon Pain during the alarm, noted that the employees were pushing everyone to leave the building but the patrons could not be bothered to do so. One woman reportedly even continued to demand the coffee she had ordered.
FlyBy will post later with any updates we receive.

"The Wetu, a traditional Wampanoag home erected in Harvard Yard as a commemoration of the 360th anniversary of the Harvard Charter, has been vandalized and misused," Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds informed undergraduates in an e-mail sent yesterday. While most undergraduates agree that the Wetu damage disrespects those involved in its construction and, more generally, Native American students at Harvard, many are left wondering what exactly happened.
In order to set the record straight, we at FlyBy contacted Tiffany L. Smalley ’11, the president of Native Americans at Harvard College.
"The damage was not substantial, and most of it has been repaired," said Smalley. "The hearth—a decorative circle of rocks in the center of the Wetu—was scattered, holes were punched through the bark on the side of the Wetu, and a quahog shell donated by visiting artists disappeared," she added.
The damage was discovered on Saturday afternoon by Thomas S. Miller '11 and Tia M. Ray '12, according to Smalley.
The damaged materials belong to the Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe and are on loan to Harvard, said Smalley, adding that "the Wetu was originally scheduled to be deconstructed today, but we are hoping to extend the timeframe—it's obviously not going down today."
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 8, 2010
An earlier version of the May 3 FlyBy post "Wetu in the Yard Suffers Damage" incorrectly stated that the damage was discovered by Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribal Historic Preservation Officer Bettina Washington. In fact, the damage was found by Thomas S. Miller '11 and Tia M. Ray '12, according to Tiffany L. Smalley ’11, the president of Native Americans at Harvard College.
