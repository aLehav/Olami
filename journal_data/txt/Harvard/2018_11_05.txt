After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Since “Titans” premiered three weeks ago on the new DC Universe streaming service, its weekly episode releases have primarily served to ease the shock of the show’s world. By depicting mature themes, gory violence, and intense swearing, the show quickly sent a message during the first three episodes that the heroes Robin, Starfire, Beast Boy, and Raven aren’t the same characters that many viewers grew up with. Fortunately, the plot’s complexity makes up for the nostalgia for characters’ lost innocence, and this week’s episode continues to execute the intricacy solidly.
After last week’s focus on little-known heroes Hawk (Alan Ritchson) and Dove (Minka Kelly), Episode Three of “Titans,” called “Origins,” comes to refocus on the beloved main cast of characters and fill in some gaps in both Robin’s (Brenton Thwaites) and Raven’s (Teagan Croft) backstory. Robin looks for Starfire (Anna Diop) and Raven after Starfire goes on a quest to rescue Raven from the family who kidnapped her. Over the course of the episode, flashbacks to when Robin was adopted by Batman as a child reveal how closely his familial crisis parallels Raven’s. Beast Boy (Ryan Potter) and Starfire make their return this episode after their absence last week, although Beast Boy spends some of his time playing video games in an arcade.
This episode highlights the strengths of “Titans.” As per usual, the plot is what really drives the show, as well as the engaging and easy-to-watch action sequences and drama. The action scenes have almost always been one of the show’s more shocking surprises. The choreography in “Titans” is better than that of any other superhero show currently on the air, rising almost to the level of a blockbuster film’s. The gory moments of each fight scene — at one point in this episode, Starfire stabs a man with a fork — will probably never end, but the absurdity is fun to watch and keeps the show from falling flat. In a way, the over-the-top violence makes the show even more unique, in a manner reminiscent of the “Kingsman” series.
The thing with “Titans” is that there are very few other comparable superhero or teen shows on the are that are simultaneously absurd and engaging. But while its choreography thrives, its CGI wilts into comical mediocrity, and its clichéed dialogue distracts from the relatively well-structured drama. Given the many conflicting strengths and weaknesses, it’s hard to pin down exactly what this show will become. Hopefully, those strengths are enough to make up for what it lacks.
Viewers of the show who yearn for the team’s unification can look forward to a promising continuation as the characters increasingly cross paths with each other and Raven’s past has now been well established. Hopefully, the show will deliver on finally unifying the team, a long-awaited climax of the show’s long build-up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Slang makes them cool. Slang makes me hood,” 16-year-old Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) says about the stark difference between her and her prep-schoolmates. She grapples with her two identities: non-confrontational private school Starr, and Garden Heights Starr. In “The Hate U Give,” the cinematography, sound, and dialogue help flip the stereotypical narrative. The warm red and orange tones, loud colors, and slang of Garden Heights contrasts with the cold-feeling, sterile-white tone, and constrictions of Starr’s rich prep school. A visible tension underlines the film as Starr steps into a world where Black Lives Matter protests become excuses to get out of class. Both of Starr’s worlds come crashing down when her childhood friend is fatally shot by a white policeman. Starr struggles with whether or not to speak out about what happened, and what the effect will be on her community, her family, and her identity as a black woman.
The film’s strength lies in its ability to contrast the normalcy of the Carters’ family — established early on with the parents kissing at the dinner table while the kids act grossed out, and the younger brother peeing on the toilet seat and refusing to clean it up — with the horror of the situation they are thrust into. Even the scene leading up to the fateful shooting shows two teenagers shyly flirting, joking about Harry Potter references, bumping Tupac, and finally sharing a sweet kiss. This playful innocence makes the next scene all the more cruel, when Khalil (Algee Smith) is shot by a policeman as Starr witnesses helplessly, after the cop pulls him over for simply neglecting to use a turn signal and mistakes Khalil’s hairbrush as a gun. The sheer normality of the prior scene contrasted with the brutality displayed in the next shows just how a single, close-minded judgement about an everyday situation can affect someone’s life in the worst way possible.
While films such as “Patriots Day” or “Me Before You” tend to unintentionally glamorize real-life tragedies, “The Hate U Give” focuses on an unromantic depiction of grieving. Director George Tillman Jr. shows Starr as she wakes up screaming, vomits repeatedly, and suffers horrible guilt and anxiety while being forced to cope with her trauma. Everyday realities such as going to school, eating breakfast, and playing basketball with friends suddenly feel impossible to Starr and to the audience, as Starr is dragged into a world where the trivialities of teenagedom no longer seem like naivetés, but rather insults to Khalil’s memory. It is a reminder of how many people grapple with their trauma completely alone, not wanting to burden anyone with it yet incapable of living with it themselves. Those watching share in Starr’s guilt — how many have complained about their own trivialities and turned their back on these issues? How many have stood by and watched, rather than stepped up as an ally?
The cast imbues the Carters with an empathy that makes their story all the more potent. Starr’s guttural sobs are enough to bring anyone to tears. The rage of her father, Maverick (Russell Hornsby), radiates off the screen as he is shoved against a glass window by two policemen, as is the sheer terror of Starr’s mother, Lisa (Regina Hall), when she sees that one of her children is about to be seriously harmed, and she has no power to stop it.
The film treats hypocrisy, conflicts within the black community, and issues of white privilege with a feeling of grace and ease that begs the question, “How can people not think this way?” The script grapples with even the infamous “I don’t see color” statement maturely, as Starr immediately counters, “If you don’t see my blackness, you don’t see me.” Tillman Jr. weaves these topics into the story naturally, successfully veering past the preachy into the truthful. It’s as if these opinions were sheer common sense. At a pivotal point in the film and in the development of their relationship, Starr tells her father that he “set a good example of what a man should be.” Not as just a black man, but as a man. These poignant moments in the film touch people’s empathy and continuously bring them back to the notion of just how alike they are. People must continue to ask themselves, however, how they are then capable of treating each other with such hate. There is a drastic need for films like “The Hate U Give” to continuously remind everyone of how much more power their similarities have to unite them than their differences have to divide them.

Sometimes, in the face of so much propaganda from the White House and its allies, it can be self-defeating to address their narratives on their own terms. To repudiate each falsehood is also to repeat it for a new audience; identifying each dehumanizing detail is to legitimize it as simply one “side” in a partisan argument.
In order to see the depths of the corruption and evil that the “migrant caravan” episode has revealed in the Republican Party, you have to instead start at the beginning.
At the beginning, you have a choice.
You see several thousand people, mostly families walking thousands of miles through Central America, many intending to seek asylum in the United States. This is a dangerous journey. The group wades through rivers. Children collapse from exhaustion. You might ask why anyone would do this, and the answer, of course, is that the very prospect of being allowed to live in America, away from the violence and poverty that characterize their lives at home, makes it all worth it.
Your choice is that you can react to these images either as a partisan or as a human being. If you choose the latter, whether you believe that other people have God-given rights or simply that their well-being matters at all, you could not help but feel compassion, not fear. The appropriate question is “How do we help these poor, desperate human beings?,” not “How do we stop them from getting anywhere near me?”
How could anyone feel fear, from their sofas in Minnesota, at the sight of unarmed families a thousand miles from Brownsville — whose numbers, roughly 7,000, could not fill a quarter of Harvard Stadium?
The answer is obvious: Because a handful of very powerful people saw a potential for political gain.
As we learned after last month’s attempted bombings of center-left political figures, the Trump-Fox-Gab Reality Machine takes as its inputs not facts to be spun favorably into arguments but rather television images to be transformed into unhinged hatred — with George Soros as the semi-fictionalized Emmanuel Goldstein of our Two Minutes Hate. With scary music, misleading captions, and a right-wing base all too willing to believe the president’s claims of threats and conspiracies, these human beings looking for a better life become an invading force of gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists.
Missing in this account, of course, is that many in the caravan plan to apply, legally, for asylum at the border. And why Middle Eastern terrorists would choose as their way of entering the country to fly to Honduras and walk 1,000 miles with international media attention on them is unclear. One explanation is that the universes of these conspiracy theories are not populated by actual people who think and feel but rather by faceless foreign enemies who came into existence hell-bent on destroying America.
In a particularly stomach-churning moment, Trump even winkingly professed ignorance as to whether Soros himself is funding the caravan — the very theory that motivated Robert Gregory Bowers to kill 11 Jews at a synagogue last weekend.
Right-wing conspiracies are nothing new. Opportunists weaponized Vince Foster’s suicide in the 1990s, and a certain reality television star even accused Barack Obama of faking his own American citizenship. But, to paraphrase soon-to-be-Senator Mitt Romney, never has this ugly imagination been married to real power.
But the marriage took place, and in a move without precedent (except, arguably, the entire War in Iraq), the president has deployed tens of thousands of active-duty troops in an expensive and nakedly political act of desperation. This deployment has disrupted hundreds of thousands of Americans’ lives, swamping cities at the border with helicopters and creating images straight out of an apocalyptic B-movie.
Never mind that the Army itself reports a very different image of the migrant caravan, writing in a report that the “most likely scenario” is that the caravan will continue to shrink as it moves north. (Its worst effect, in this scenario, is that smugglers exploit Trump’s focus on the caravan). But the point is not security; the point is making Trump look like a very big boy, and he is reveling in the good television it has produced to that effect. If you have any doubt of the operation’s political motivations, note that this is not the first caravan but merely the first to approach the border during an election season. Further, the caravan is scheduled to arrive at the border in 45 days at the earliest — one day before the deployment is scheduled to end!
The absurdity of the Trumpian nightmare-theater does demand our attention. After all, it represents a horrifying torrent of dehumanizing lies from the most powerful man on earth and another step in eroding the norms of American governance. But we must also take a moment, every now and then, and look at the facts on the ground outside of their immediate political context.
We are not fundamentally Republicans or Democrats. We are human beings. And under normal circumstances, when we see other human beings in pain, we experience empathy. We try to help. That should have been the story of the migrant caravan.
The warped, hateful picture we see instead speaks to how deep those human beings can be buried under ideologies of hatred. That, not the brown faces on your screen, should terrify you.

The Harvard Kennedy School recently released a diversity report showing that, despite recent attempts at reform, it remains predominantly white and male. Recently, the school has demonstrated a desire to improve the diversity of its student body, hiring Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Robbin Chapman earlier this year and implementing bias training for senior administration. However, despite these efforts, the school’s recent diversity report reveals that the school has made little progress in diversifying its student body and staff. As we have opined in the past, these revelations continue to be both unsurprising and disappointing.
The recent report revealed marginal increases in the diversity of some demographic groups enrolled in the Masters of Public Policy program, the largest one offered by the Kennedy School. The percentage of African-American students increased from four percent in 2015 to seven percent in 2018. The percentage of Hispanic and Latinx students made up seven percent of the student body in both 2015 and 2018.
While the percentage of Asian-American students increased from seven percent in 2017 to 17 percent in 2018, the taskforce was unable to explain the jump. We believe that the Kennedy School must work towards understanding which strategies are most effective at recruiting students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. It should also strive to expand its aid program in order to attract students from low-income backgrounds.
The mission of the Kennedy School is to “improve public policy and public leadership across the United States and around the world.” However, the Kennedy School must consider that the nature of its curriculum and programs might prioritize topics of study that are most conducive to its current demographic makeup, which may only serve to reinforce the status quo. A revamped curriculum focusing more on international politics and underserved communities would create a space that is more supportive for a more diverse student body. Perhaps by considering these factors, the Kennedy School can begin to mitigate the discomfort felt by many students of color in the classroom and retain more of them.
Furthermore, the report showed that the faculty has not diversified either, with 79 percent of professors identifying as white, only one professor identifying as Hispanic/Latinx, and only two professors identifying as African-American. These numbers are not an improvement from the previous report. The Kennedy School should work in order to diversify its staff, which could contribute towards recruiting and retaining more students of color. Students who see their identities reflected in their professors and curricula are more likely to thrive at the Kennedy School.
Considering that two years ago, more than 40 Harvard alumni won seats in the 115th Congress, it is imperative that Harvard recognizes the influence that it wields over our future leaders and is held accountable for the compositions of its classrooms. We urge the Kennedy School to actively work towards on attracting students and staff who reflect the nation’s demographics. If this recent diversity report is any indication, their current efforts are not doing enough, if anything at all.

On Nov. 6, Massachusetts voters will take to the polls to decide one of the most salient civil rights questions of the 21st century: whether or not to protect the rights and safety of the state’s transgender residents in public spaces. While the question will be decided on a statewide election ballot, its ramifications have the potential to stretch far beyond the boundaries of the Bay State. In order to protect the civil rights of transgender and nonbinary individuals on Harvard’s campus, in Massachusetts, and across the country, it is vital that students and Massachusetts residents show up on election day and vote “Yes” on ballot Question 3.
Until recently, protections for trans and nonbinary residents were settled law in Massachusetts. The state legislature first prohibited discrimination against individuals on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations in 2016, passing a bill protecting trans and nonbinary individuals’ access to spaces including public bathrooms, locker rooms, hotels, and restaurants. The bill, which passed with almost 90 percent support in the state senate and over 75 percent support in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, was signed into law by Republican Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 that July. The 2018 statewide ballot referendum Question 3 has put upholding or repealing this piece of civil rights legislation in the hands of the residents of the Commonwealth.
The efforts to challenge and repeal these protections through popular vote have not been motivated by Massachusetts residents at large, but rather by the calculated efforts of a Judeo-Christian organization called the Massachusetts Family Institute and the allied initiative “Keep MA Safe.” Keep MA Safe, which receives funding from MFI as well as other private donors, has centered its opposition to the anti-discrimination law around unfounded and irresponsible claims that the legislation allows people (namely sex offenders) to enter bathrooms and changing rooms in order to attack women and children on the pretense of gender identity. Assault and harassment, regardless of the spaces they occur in, are illegal in the state of Massachusetts and the anti-discrimination law has been endorsed by the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association and the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence.
The Keep MA Safe website employs tactics of bias and misinformation online and in video attempting to convince Massachusetts residents to vote against civil rights protections based on gender identity. The website attempts to scare voters using “Examples of Privacy Violations,” more accurately described as unrelated news reports on men and women peeking over bathroom stalls or in dressing rooms which in no way are connected to, nor are shown to have been impacted by, anti-discrimination laws like that which Massachusetts has adopted. Freedom Massachusetts, the primary organization advocating for the continuation of prohibitions against discrimination towards transgender people, argues that this law has not and will not affect the safety and privacy of Massachusetts residents, including in restrooms and locker rooms. The organization lists not only the aforementioned Police Association and Coalition Against Sexual Assault, but numerous other public safety and women’s advocacy groups as supporters of the Yes on 3 campaign.
The efforts that placed this crucial anti-discrimination legislation on the ballot this November were not born out of concerns for the safety of women and children, but rather out of prejudice towards transgender and nonbinary individuals, whose civil rights are under attack not only in the state of Massachusetts but across the United States. The National Center for Transgender Equality reports that “more than one in four trans people has faced a bias-driven assault, and rates are higher for trans women and trans people of color” and the Human Rights Campaign has recorded 22 deaths due to fatal violence of transgender people in 2018 so far, the most recent being the death of Ciara Minaj Carter Frazier on Oct. 3. Rather than take steps to end discrimination and violence against trans and nonbinary people, the Trump administration has made this discrimination its agenda, plotting to define gender based on genitalia at birth and exclude trans and nonbinary individuals from civil rights protections.
The state of Massachusetts has been a leader in progressing the rights of BGLTQ Americans for decades, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in a wide range of public and private areas in 1989, prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in areas including housing, employment, and union practices in 2012, and prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in public accommodations in 2016. When Massachusetts votes on equality, the nation watches. Often, it follows. The state is also home to over 100 colleges and universities — Harvard being one of its most prominent — housing transgender and nonbinary students from across the country and world. The rights and safety of these students, not all of whom are necessarily registered or eligible to vote in the state they spend the majority of their year, are left to be decided by the majority of Massachusetts voters. In order to protect the civil rights and safety of their transgender and nonbinary friends and neighbors, it is imperative that registered students and residents of Massachusetts vote “Yes” on ballot Question 3 this November.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on proposed changes to the wording of the College’s language requirement as detailed in the Harvard student handbook at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
Former Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris proposed the change at last month’s meeting. The new wording would eliminate the “written component” of the requirement, allowing students to instead use languages such as American Sign Language and Ancient Greek to fulfill that demand.
The proposed change would also allow students who fail to place out of the language requirement using their first set of Harvard placement test scores to retake the placement exam again after their first semester of language study. If a student wishes to take a placement exam in a language that is not offered at Harvard, the new wording in the handbook would allow the Office of Undergraduate Education to seek qualified examiners at other institutions.
The Faculty Council — the highest governing body of FAS — voted to approve the proposed changes at their last meeting, though their vote is purely advisory.
The Faculty will also hear Tuesday from FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke about a proposal to add two additional class start times to the new course schedule, which administrators implemented this semester. Under the new proposal, instructors who teach two-hour classes starting at 12 p.m. or 3 p.m. would be able to delay their course start times by 45 minutes.
The proposal is meant to address one complication inherent in the new schedule — limited time for lunch. This semester, 141 courses take place between 12 to 2:45 p.m., exactly overlaping with Harvard University Dining Services lunch hours. HUDS recently increased its open hours by 30 minutes in an attempt to give students more time to eat.
“This minor adjustment, in combination with the expanded dining hall hours, will quickly alleviate the major issue with the new schedule raised by students and faculty,” Burke wrote in a memo to the Council on Oct. 4.
Burke wrote he hopes to implement the new changes in the spring semester. One hundred and nine courses are currently scheduled to take place in the 12 to 2:45 p.m. class slot in the spring.
The Council voted unanimously to support the proposal at its last meeting. The Council’s vote is nonbinding, though, and the Faculty will likely vote on the schedule change at its next monthly meeting in December.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, Comparative Literature Professor Jeffrey Schnapp will give a presentation on Curricle, a new platform meant to allow FAS members to navigate course selection and the curriculum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the last day of the high-stakes and high-profile Harvard admissions trial, "the wolf of racial bias" returned to the courtroom.
Lawyers for both Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing the University over its admissions process, approached the wood-paneled witness stand one after the other Friday to deliver impassioned closing statements and rebuttals that stretched for hours. Summing up what transpired during the three-week-long trial — ranging from battles over data to administrators’ repeated denials of wrongdoing to emotional and personal testimony from students — was a tall order. But the attorneys did their best.
Harvard’s lead lawyer William F. Lee ’72 took things back to the beginning. On the trial’s first day, SFFA attorney Adam K. Mortara had declared that Harvard had “let the wolf of racial bias” through its front door.
“On this we agree. The wolf of racial bias is at Harvard’s door and at the door of this courthouse,” Lee said Friday. “That wolf comes in the form of SFFA and its experts... It is those who would drastically reduce the number of African-American and Hispanic students on our university and college campuses today.”
The trial kicked off Oct. 15 in Courtroom 17 of the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in downtown Boston. Its launch came almost exactly four years after SFFA filed suit against the University in Nov. 2014 alleging that Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
The trial saw 15 days of extensive quibbling over every twist and quirk of the Harvard admissions process, as well as secret-spilling that revealed in unprecedented detail how the College evaluates applicants. But it did not decide the veracity of SFFA’s charges. Judge Allison D. Burroughs will make that ruling on her own, without a jury; she is not expected to offer a final verdict for several months.
Friday’s proceedings drew massive public interest. Onlookers — including parents, locals, and a bevy of undergraduates, many of them donning Harvard gear — packed Courtroom 17 and spilled over into two overflow rooms. Surveying the large crowd, Burroughs urged lawyers to speak clearly into the microphone.
“You have a cast of thousands hearing what you have to say this morning,” she said.
SFFA lawyer John M. Hughes spoke first, delivering a fiery oration that lasted over an hour. He appeared to grow emotionally invested in his own words, often slamming his fist on the table in front of him.
Hughes reiterated SFFA’s long-standing stance that Harvard admissions officers, driven by entrenched tendencies toward “bias” and “stereotyping,” engage in intentional discrimination against Asian-American applicants. He said that, though College employees are “well-meaning people,” they wind up treating Harvard hopefuls of Asian heritage as monolithic “model minorities.”
“Harvard suggests Asian Americans are a group of one-dimensional academic superstars,” Hughes said.
Then it was Harvard’s turn.
University lawyers Lee and Seth P. Waxman ’73 gave Harvard’s closing statement together. The duo leaned heavily on student testimony and on the work of David E. Card, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley whom Harvard paid to analyze its admissions data ahead of the trial. Card found that the College does not discriminate in its admissions process.
Lee noted that, while eight Harvard students and alumni took the witness stand to testify in support of the University in the third week of the trial, none of the students whom SFFA claims to represent showed their faces in Courtroom 17. SFFA originally filed suit on behalf of several Asian-American students who allege they were unfairly rejected by Harvard; these students have chosen to remain anonymous throughout the lawsuit and trial.
Lee thanked the eight Harvard students for their testimony, which he described as “powerful.” Each of the eight drew on personal experience — including tales of childhood bullying and fears of Harvard’s whiteness — to argue in favor of race-conscious admissions and against a race-blind process.
"We’ve heard from the students themselves. We've heard from the students who are living diversity every day," Lee said. "Although much progress has been made, there is much to be done."
The lawyers finished speaking around 2:30 p.m., marking a relatively early end for a trial whose proceedings often lasted until close to 5 p.m. But the case is far from over.
Experts have said that, regardless of how Burroughs rules, the disappointed party is likely to appeal — and that a cascading series of appeals could bring the suit before the Supreme Court. The newly conservative court is more likely to side with SFFA than with Harvard, analysts have said. If it does, it could mean the end of affirmative action in the United States.
Over the past three weeks, five current and former high-up Harvard administrators called to serve as witnesses did their best to avert that outcome.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 was up first. He spent most of his four-day testimony defending his legacy as dean — a position he has held for over 30 years. Asked at one point whether the admissions office condones “stereotyping” of Asian-American applicants, Fitzsimmons answered without hesitation.
“We do not endorse — we abhor — stereotypical comments,” he said. “This is not a part of our process. This is not who I am and not who we are.”
Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, Harvard’s director of admissions, took questions from Harvard and SFFA lawyers on two separate occasions. During her first court appearance, McGrath confidently asserted Harvard has never issued written rules detailing how admissions officers may consider race when evaluating candidates.
That didn’t turn out to be entirely true: Harvard added a section to its application “reading procedures” for the Class of 2023 that expressly forbids staffers from using race to calculate high schoolers’ personal scores. McGrath returned to the stand Thursday to face grilling over how and when administrators made that decision.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana was the next top administrator to testify. On the sixth day of the trial — pressed by SFFA lawyer Mortara — Khurana repeatedly insisted that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian Americans. When Mortara followed up by asking whether Khurana believes the socioeconomic makeup of the College’s wealthy student body should more closely match national demographics, the dean replied “I don’t.”
Soon afterward, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith stepped up to defend the work of his namesake “Smith Committee,” formed in 2017 to research race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action. The committee concluded that "Harvard could not both achieve its diversity interests and achieve other equally important educational outcomes, such as academic excellence” — a finding Smith stuck to on the witness stand.
Former University President Drew G. Faust was the final Harvard administrator called to the witness stand in Courtroom 17. Faust spent most of her time on the witness stand Thursday explaining and defending diversity initiatives she pursued as president. She particularly noted that the number of Asian-American students and faculty at Harvard increased during her tenure.
The eleventh day of the trial, though, belonged to the eight student witnesses.
The students, all of whom are non-white, said the elimination of race-conscious admissions would drive down the number of students of color who matriculate at Harvard each year. On a campus where minority enrollees already feel isolated and alone, this decrease would be nothing less than a disaster, the students said.
“Race-blind admissions is an act of erasure,” student witness Sarah F. Cole ’16 said in court. “To not see my race is to not see me.”
At the close of the trial Friday, Harvard lawyers appeared confident that — for now, at least — Cole and other students of color do not have to worry. Basking in an unseasonably warm 70-degree afternoon, Lee and Waxman held forth outside the courtroom for several minutes after the trial ended, facing television cameras and an eager press corps.
Lee admitted it is possible the case goes before the nation’s highest court.
“SFFA wants to eliminate a thousand African Americans and Hispanics from Harvard’s campus,” Lee said. “If that’s going to happen, it’s going to be a decision of some significance by a court of some significance.”
He paused briefly.
“But that would be a big change in the law, it would be a big change for universities like Harvard — and personally, I think it would be a disaster for the country,” he said.
When asked whether, should Burroughs rule for SFFA, Harvard will appeal, Lee laughed.
“I would say yeah,” he said.
“There is no doubt about it,” Waxman added.
William S. Consovoy, an SFFA lawyer, gave a similar answer during his own, separate press conference Friday afternoon. When a reporter asked if SFFA plans to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, Consovoy answered rapid-fire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scheduled felling of a century-old tree on the campus of Harvard's Divinity School is pitting administrators against students in a fight to save the red oak from death-by renovation.
The Divinity School insists that planned construction to update its Andover Hall necessitates the removal of the tree. Administrators including the school's dean and his top advisors have said there are simply no other options.
Some students, though, say cutting down the tree amounts to a sacrilegious act of violence — and they are determined to keep fighting for the oak.
Divinity School enrollee Jesse Bercowetz, who said he identifies as a pagan, said he believes the tree is like an elder family member. Cutting it down is an act of murder.
“I question an architectural team and administration who cannot figure out another solution,” Bercowetz said.
Throughout the months of September and October, students and administrators engaged in a continuous — and at times contentious — back-and-forth over the fate of the oak, participating in several meetings and coffee shop office hours.
Like Bercowetz, some students say they are concerned by both the ethical and spiritual ramifications of the tree's felling. Others take issue with the manner in which administrators have handled the decision-making process, calling it one-sided.
Divinity School enrollee Shane H. Brodie said in an interview he feels that students and Divinity School administrators are not at all on the same page.
“What’s very hurtful in this situation and the decisions that are coming down about the tree is that I had assumed we had the same values,” Brodie said.
Brodie also questioned whether administrators ever really planned to take student input into account. He noted that the Divinity School released its final decision to cut down the tree well ahead of the December deadline by which its meetings with students are slated to conclude.
“It’s not that they’re bad people,” he said. “But I feel like they are using some of the worst aspects of institutional power to bulldoze the situation.”
Divinity School top brass maintain, however, that they have been clear about the decision-making process. School officials sought alternatives to the tree's removal in response to student feedback, they said. No alternatives were feasible.
“I know some are not happy with where we are, but we really have been very transparent with the process,” said Ralph DeFlorio, the Divinity School director of operations.
DeFlorio, along with Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton and Senior Advisor to the Dean Patricia M. Byrne, all highlighted the University's commitment to the environment and to fostering a multi-faith space. The trio said the school plans to replace the canopy lost by the tree and will engage in discussions on how to best process and mourn its removal, making sure to carefully weigh all the different religions and beliefs at play.
“We’re all deeply sad about this, there is no one happy about the fact that the tree is going to have to come down,” Hempton said. “We want to do the right thing for people to give proper expression to that sadness.”
The health of the tree marks another a bone of contention between students and administrators. Byrne said Divinity School staffers consulted a tree specialist about the health of the tree and its possible relocation, only to be told the oak is already declining irreversibly and probably wouldn't survive a move.
“If we weren’t doing the renovation, we would probably be looking at the health of this tree anyway,” Byrne said.
Students like Brodie and Bercowetz don't buy it. Both said they want to hear a second and third opinion on the tree's health before giving it up for dead.
No one explicitly mentioned the oak during a public community forum held at the Divinity School Friday. But the issue surfaced nonetheless; a petition pasted outside the room listed student concerns about the tree's removal.
Administrators tacked a response from the dean alongside it. In his message, Hempton thanked students and invited them to keep discussing the matter. But he denied the accuracy of their complaints.
Construction on Andover Hall is set to begin sometime in Summer 2019 and is slated to wrap up in Spring 2021.

This election day — in addition to casting a vote for the governorship or the Senate — Massachusetts voters will tackle three questions at the bottom of their ballots. These questions touch on issues including nurse-to-patient ratios, the use of money in politics, and the legality of discrimination against transgender individuals.
The Crimson breaks down what you need to know about each question below.
The first question asks voters’ opinion of a law that would limit the number of patients that can be assigned to a given nurse in Massachusetts hospitals and certain other healthcare facilities. The exact number would vary according to hospital size and the demand seen by that facility.
The law's supporters say it will improve patient safety and the quality of care. The bill would likely push Massachusetts hospitals to hire more nurses, and detractors say it could increase financial pressure on some healthcare organizations. The question has proved controversial — nurses and nurse groups across the state are split on the issue.
A “yes” vote would limit the number of patients per nurse. A “no” vote would maintain current laws, which place no limits on the number of patients per nurse.
The second question asks about an initiative meant to limit the role of money in politics. If adopted, Question 2 would establish a commision of 15 volunteers from across the state and task it with advocating for a United States Constitutional amendment to overturn the landmark 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling.
The Citizens United case set the precedent that corporations are entitled to the same rights as people in the United States. In addition to pushing to cancel that ruling, the hypothetical commission would also seek to regulate campaign contributions and expenditures made by corporations. The proposal enjoys widespread and bipartisan support from Massachusetts politicians including Republican Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 and Democratic Senator Elizabeth A. Warren. Recent polling has indicated that a majority of Massachusetts voters favor the idea.
A “yes” vote would establish a commission and task it with advocating to overturn Citizens United in addition to pushing for a limit on corporate political spending. A “no” vote would not establish such a commission.
While Questions 1 and 2 both refer to possible future developments, Question 3 deals with a 2016 law that already exists. That law bans discrimination on the basis of gender in places of "public accomodation, resort, or amusement" in Massachussetts. A “yes” vote would keep that law as-is, while a "no" vote would rescind it.
If kept, the current law adds gender identity to a longer-standing list of prohibited grounds for discrimination including race, skin color, religious creed, national origin, sex, disability, and ancestry. In traditionally progressive Massachusetts, Question 3 has garnered tremendous public support.
A “yes” vote would keep the current law banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity. A “no” vote would repeal this law.

Seeking to combat drug misuse and abuse, Harvard University Health Services has rolled out a new Consumer Drug Take-Back program that provides a place for people to dispose of unused or expired medications.
The dropbox, located in the HUHS pharmacy in the Smith Campus Center, accepts “unused or expired prescription medication, unused or expired over-the-counter medication, and pet medication,” according to a label pasted on its top.
The program is not accepting “illegal medications,” needles, inhalers, liquids, or aerosols.
The new health initiative, which HUHS launched this September, allows patients to dispose of drugs usually left behind in medicine cabinets before they can be taken and misused, possibly by children.
Representatives for HUHS declined to comment on the new program. But health experts across Harvard’s schools said the program represents a small step towards fighting addiction and drug abuse.
Michael L. Barnett, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the program offers a way for patients to discard unused medications, meaning it minimizes the risk that others misuse the drugs.
“Many patients don’t complete their opioid prescriptions,” Barnett said. “So what that means is that [in] medicine cabinets across the city, across the country, there is a large supply of opioids that are basically just waiting to be taken.”
Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School Mark P. Eisenberg wrote in an email that unused medication can pose a danger to other members of a household.
“It is true that some meds are taken from parents’ medicine cabinets by kids or grandkids” Eisenberg wrote.
According to the HUHS announcement for the program, 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. New users obtain 77 percent of the opioid prescription medications they take from a friend or relative.
Additionally, 62 percent of teens who admit to using medication for recreational or other non-medical reasons say they grab the drugs from medicine cabinets in their homes.
HUHS’s announcement of the program also addresses the negative environmental impact of improperly disposed-of drugs. Eighty percent of 139 streams sampled from 1999-2000 contained at least one pharmaceutical, according to the Consumer Drug Take-Back site.
“There has traditionally been no safe way to dispose of them,” Eisenberg wrote about prescription drugs. “It is not great for the water supply to flush them.”
According to Barnett, programs like the CDTB form part of a national response to the opioid epidemic and provide a way to responsibly address the threat posed by unused medications.
But Eisenberg also acknowledged the long-term impact and limitations of drug take-back programs on the opioid crisis.
“Every little bit helps but it is a drop in the bucket regarding turning around the crisis” Eisenberg said of the program. “It’s much more important to combat stigma and ensure everyone has access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder.”

An estimated 18,000 faculty and staff across the University will take a sexual assault prevention training module starting Monday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an email last week.
All benefits-eligible faculty and staff must complete the 45-minute program — designed to remind Harvard’s employees about University policy and resources — by Dec. 17.
Garber and Lapp said in May that the University would mandate faculty and staff training around sexual assault prevention and response in fall 2018. Their announcement came on the heels of a year that saw the #MeToo movement hit Harvard in a big way; 18 women stepped forward to accuse prominent Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment stretching back decades in early spring and the University in March barred star Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. from setting foot in his lab while it investigated allegations of sexual harassment against him.
Central administrators and the leaders of Harvard’s individual schools have worked across the past two years to implement the 2016 recommendations of a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention that urged mandatory trainings for students, faculty, and staff.
Administrators debuted a similar sexual assault prevention training module for undergraduates in 2016. Though the module was not originally mandatory, 100 percent of students completed the training this fall after administrators tied program completion to course registration.
In their email to faculty and staff last week, Garber and Lapp wrote it is important to review information about sexual assault prevention and response.
“Recent events across society continue to underscore the observation that sexual and gender-based harassment remains a deeply ingrained problem,” Garber and Lapp wrote. “For our community to truly thrive, its members must feel comfortable coming forward to report harassment. That aspiration will only be realized if we all have a firm understanding of the University’s relevant policies and available resources.”
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said the faculty and staff training module — like the student training module — details definitions of what constitutes sexual harassment, outlines University Title IX policy, and lists resources available on campus.
The faculty and staff training module, though, presents additional information about the role of a “responsible employee” at Harvard.
“If they receive a disclosure that falls under the sexual- and gender-based harassment policy, then they must share that information with a Title IX coordinator,” Merhill said. The module also explains what Title IX coordinators do with that information.
Merhill also said scenarios presented in the faculty and staff training module are meant to represent experiences those categories of Harvard affiliates are likely to undergo.
Administrators will monitor faculty and staff members' progress toward completing the module via the Harvard Training Portal. The training will only be considered successfully completed if faculty and staff receive a score of 80 percent or higher on an assessment given at the end of module.
“By establishing a common baseline of training to all faculty and staff, we will continue to expand our knowledge and understanding, and strengthen our commitment to the wellbeing of every member of our community,” Garber and Lapp wrote.
Asked whether administrators could effectively enforce completion of the training — particularly given the fact that many faculty are tenured and have total job security — Merhill said administrators “watch that data very closely" and will “make efforts to ensure that all of those individuals in fact do complete the training.”
She added Garber and Lapp have informed staff that it is “the expectation and the Corporation’s expectation that all benefits-eligible employees will complete this training.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crowd of a few hundred gathered in Sanders Theatre Sunday afternoon to attend this year's iteration of Harvard’s annual TEDx event, “What if I’m Wrong?”
Seven speakers — hailing from a variety of professions — spent around four hours urging audience members to question their assumptions about the world around them.
Presenters included forensic sketch artist Gil Zamora, ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson, and University of Texas undergraduate Sofia Babool. The remainder — largely Boston-area academics — came from a wide range of fields including psychology, engineering, anthropology, and sociology.
The Harvard Breakers, a campus breakdancing group, headlined a brief intermission that kept most audience members glued to their seats.
During her presentation, Ellen J. Langer, a Harvard professor of psychology, discussed the concept of mind-body unity, telling audience members that their mindset can induce tangible changes in their physiology.
“Wherever we put the body, we necessarily put the mind,” Langer said. “We need to stop confusing the stability of our mindsets with the stability of the underlying phenomenon and recognize that we don’t know for sure.”
Paralleling Langer’s challenge to common beliefs about human psychology, Pawan Dhingra, professor of American Studies at Amherst College, offered an unusual way to think about social phenomena. He encouraged the audience to use what he called the “sociological imagination,” a framework for understanding the relationship between cultural behavior and society.
“We should see our behaviors formed less by individual agency and more by economic and political forces that have historical groundings and great magnitude,” Dhingra said.“We need to move past moral and essential judgements of what we see.”
“So much of the behavior is a product of social institutions ...If we want kids to not engage in violence as a means for self-protection, then we have to ask why do we have a criminal justice system that might not be treating everybody equitably. We’re not trying to excuse any behaviors; we’re trying to explain them,” Dhingra added.
In his talk, Iverson, who served as the final ringmaster of the now-defunct Ringling Bros Circus, discussed the false certainty some people feel about their future.
“We have it fixed in our minds that we have to finish what we started,” Iverson said. “We insist on the familiar because it promises us security. Let me break your heart: no matter what any insurance salesman ever tells you, there is no security. There’s always a risk.”
“Give yourself permission to not be so certain,” he added. “We’re literally ordained by nature to shift, change, recreate our entire reality if need be, or as we see fit.”
In an interview with the Harvard-based TEDx organizing team, Co-Vice President Lion Lee ’21 said the desire to hear from a broad range of speakers motivated their decision to choose this year’s theme.
“We wanted to choose something that wasn't speaker-restricted, so that you could have a broad variety of people to come talk at the event,” Lee said.
Kim Hoang, a graduate student at Northeastern who attended the TEDx event, said her curiosity was piqued by the title.
“Well I first saw it on Facebook … the title was really interesting to me, like “What if I’m Wrong?” because I’m sure that we discover the possibility and uncertainty and things like that,” Hoang said. “I’m also learning about this in my university, so this was a really good chance for me to come here to listen to the professors and experts.”
Sofia de la Morena ’22 agreed with Hoang.
“I just like how they're forcing you to rethink everything you take for granted and take assumptions a lot of people think are true and make a twist on it,” de la Morena said. “I think it's interesting how they play with the way we think.”

For the eighth year running, Harvard students dedicated a week to discussing sex.
Hosted by the student organization Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College or SHEATH, the program known as “Sex Week” featured workshops on topics ranging from sexual health to gender identity and relationships.
Coinciding with Freshman Family Weekend this year, Sex Week aims to stimulate dialogue and awareness surrounding stigmatized topics of sex and sexuality.
SHEATH organized 13 events throughout the week including “Hit Me Baby One More Time: BDSM in the Dorm Room,” “Sexual Fetishes A-Z,” and “One is Not Enough: Open Relationships, Non-Monogamy and Polyamory.” The workshops featured speakers, sex-toy demonstrations, and raffles.
“People ask us why we may want to host an event on BDSM, anal sex, or orgasms. These are legitimate expressions of human sexuality that students may have questions about and so we have a duty to provide that education during Sex Week,” SHEATH Co-President Lita D. Peña ’19 wrote in an emailed statement.
Most of these workshops took place in classrooms and lecture halls across the University. While many drew overflowing crowds, most attendees declined to comment.
Jovanni J. Candia ’20, who attended Sex Week events for the first time this year, said he thinks Sex Week is a good idea.
“These classes are actually a really interesting way for everyone to get proper sexual education,” Candia said. “A lot of people have these sheltered views and they’ll think it’s a really negative thing.”
Candia added that he believes Sex Week helps destigmatize discussing sex on campus.
“Just the fact that it’s out in the open and people know that ‘hey, there’s a whole class about it and there’s a full class full of people just to hear someone talk about sex’ kind of gives a better viewpoint for the whole student body, even the people who didn’t come,” Candia said.
Michal Goderez, a Good Vibrations employee who spoke at “Hit Me Baby One More Time,” said they think events like Sex Week are important to ensure students receive appropriate sexual education.
“I’m so excited this is happening at universities for freshman and sophomores, people who need this information,” Goderez said. “Obviously it would be great if they had this information by the beginning of high school, but wherever we can get it, the better.”
Peña wrote that Sex Week aims to show that sex is not something to be ashamed of. When asked what she thought was the highlight of the week, Peña recalled a moment with Laurie Mintz, the speaker at "Becoming Cliterate: Why Orgasm Equality Matters — And How to Get It.” Peña said that Mintz found the “orgasm inequality gap” in the room was similar to those seen in studies of the general population.
“[Mintz] turns to the audience and essentially responds, ‘Harvard students! They're just like us!’” Peña wrote. “It reaffirmed to me that we may be brilliant in the classroom, but we still need and deserve a comprehensive education in the bedroom, and so I'm proud of the work that Sex Week does.”

Harvard Yard bustled with parents, siblings, and extended family members on Friday and Saturday as relatives of freshmen converged on Cambridge for the College’s First-Year Family Weekend.
The Harvard Dean of Students Office organized the annual event, inviting parents to participate in a range of activities. Smiling family members stopped by classrooms, museum open houses, historical tours, faculty lectures, religious group events, and a tailgate luncheon. During meal hours, Annenberg Hall — the freshman dining hall — overflowed with parents proudly sporting "P’22" caps and crimson-colored sweatshirts.
Though Kosta Sakenis and Renata Sakeniene, parens of Simas Sakenis '22, said they enjoyed several College-sponsored events, the pair said the real value of their weekend came in seeing how their son lived on a day-to-day basis.
“I wouldn't say [there was] much surprise, because our son was already telling a lot,” Kostas Sakenis said. “It was more to see [it] with our own eyes, and to feel the atmosphere, and to experience what does it mean, being here in this environment?”
Jacqueline E. Zoeller ’22 said she was also excited to show her parents her new life at Harvard.
“This is the first time I've seen them in person since Move-In Day,” Zoeller said, “It was so odd just to be like, ‘Wow, my life is so different from when I last saw you.’”
Polina N. Whitehouse ’22, meanwhile, said she was eager to show her parents her newly clean bedroom, the result of hours of frenetic activity before the weekend rolled around.
“I was particularly excited to show them the actual visible floor, which had not been in existence for multiple weeks,” Whitehouse said.
“I was impressed by the amount of crap on the floor,” Mark Whitehouse countered, referring to the common room. “I don’t know if you can use that word in The Crimson.”
Kirsten M. Anderson ’90, mother of Kieran L. Anderson ’22, said the College now seems to put more emphasis on supporting students than it did when she was an undergraduate.
“The only thing that strikes me as different, I think, is the expansion of the student-centeredness...which I think is really good,” she said.
Gina Burke, the College’s interim coordinator of parent programs, wrote in an emailed statement that First-Year Family Weekend gives families an opportunity to “spend quality time” with students in their new environment at Harvard.
“For students, we hope having their families in town provided a boost of support and connection to home, especially after being away from each other for several months,” Burke wrote. “For those whose families were not able to attend, we hope students were able to connect with the larger Harvard community through special events like faculty dinners, meeting up with a host family, or gatherings in their entryway.”
One of the divisions of the Dean of Students Office hosted a student-faculty dinner on Friday for freshmen whose parents could not come to campus due to “financial hardships, immigration policies, and/or other significant personal circumstances.”
Reflecting on her time with her family, Caroline M. Kremer ’22 said, “I was just excited to show my parents what everyday life is like here.”
Kremer gave her family a tour of the newly reopened Smith Campus Center, adding she enjoyed “just showing off, like ‘We get to go here.’”

Though recent changes to the way the College funds student groups left the Undergraduate Council with more money than ever before, the overhauled funding structure has also sparked newfound disagreements within the body about when it should step in to fund student events.
For three consecutive weeks now, the UC’s Finance Committee has not imposed any across-the-board cuts to its grants to student groups. The lack of cuts comes just one semester after the Council had to consistently diminish its grants by over 25 percent each week.
The rosy financial picture is likely a result of the Council budget, which is 34 percent higher this year than last. That increase has also allowed the Council to allocate more funding to every one of its committees.
Yet at multiple meetings this fall, the Council voted against allocating money for events that it claims are not their responsibility to fund.
At Sunday’s meeting, despite opposition by numerous representatives, the Council allocated $10,000 to buttress funding for a campus-wide party in Annenberg — the freshman dining hall — on Nov. 16, the evening before the Harvard-Yale football game.
While opposition to two other prospective programs in recent weeks — funding student dinners and advising meetings — appeared to be case-specific, the debate about whether to lend a hand to those other groups will likely remain an ongoing dispute, according to multiple representatives.
The changes to the Council’s budget came as a result of a 150 percent increase in the student activities fee — an optional sum undergraduates pay as part of enrollment costs — and accompanying changes to the way the UC, College Events Board, House Committees, and the Intramural Sports Council receive funding. While House Committees previously fell under the auspices of the Council, they now apply for money independently to a funding board composed of students and administrators.
UC Finance Committee chair Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 said these changes mean the Council no longer has an obligation to fund events for which any of the above groups should be responsible.
“It was my understanding, that this year, with the new funding structure, CEB was supposed to have the financial ability to plan, run, and fund their own events, and the UC would have the money to fund our own initiatives,” he said. “The [CEB] supposedly should get the money from the administration to fund their events on their own.”
Other representatives said the Council’s overarching mission — to serve the student body — should compel them to act in certain instances, especially if other groups, such as the CEB, feel financially constrained. Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20 argued that, because the UC and the other three groups ultimately draw from the same “pot of money,” they should not see themselves as clashing bodies.
“One of the goals of the UC is to fund inclusive social life,” she said. “Ultimately, if they’re funding something that’s going to be for the entire student body, it’s in the interest of the UC to fund that.”
At its Oct. 8 meeting, the Council narrowly voted down legislation to help the Lowell House Committee fund its annual party, “Glowell.” At the time, representatives raised similar concerns about funding house parties, which many called the domain of House Committees. Some said it could be the start of a slippery slope that leads the UC to fund more and more events.
Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said Sunday that he continues to harbor reservations about helping the CEB and House Committees fund their own events, but ultimately voted for the legislation at Sunday’s meeting because CEB leaders agreed to name the UC as co-hosts. The legislation ultimately passed, with 24 in favor, 8 against, and 2 abstaining.
“If it had been purely a CEB event where the UC was giving a grant to help them do an event of their own, I would have been against it for the reasons Gevin mentioned,” Boucher said.
He added that the new funding scheme should give each of the four groups financial independence. In reality, though, “growing pains” associated with the new system — as well as some groups exceeding their financial means — has prevented that from happening, he said.
“If each group is advocating for the amount they believe they need for the entire year, theoretically, there shouldn’t need to be any requesting of funding from the UC from either CEB, IMs or the HoCos,” Boucher said. “What we’ve seen is that that’s not the case.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Student Labor Action Movement held a silent protest during a series of speeches delivered by top Harvard administrators Friday, urging them to boycott seven Marriott Hotels in Boston whose workers have been striking for over a month.
The protesters hoisted a sign that read “Check out of Marriott” in hopes of forcing administrators to take a position on whether the school will patronize Marriott hotels in Boston.
SLAM members unfurled their banner from the top balcony in Sanders Theatre during a First-Year Family Weekend event that featured administrative luminaries including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
“Our eventual goal is to have Harvard eventually take a stand on the strike while it’s still going on,” said Saul A. Glist ’22, a member of SLAM who coordinated the protest.
The students’ protest comes as a strike at seven Marriott-operated hotels in Boston enters its fifth week — and amid a nationwide walkout at 23 Marriott-affiliated hotels in seven cities across the United States. Unite Here Local 26, the union representing the Boston hotel workers, is seeking higher wages, increased job security, and more comprehensive workplace sexual harassment protections in its ongoing negotiations with Marriott.
This is not the first time Unite Here Local 26 has earned Harvard students' support. In fall 2016, SLAM backed Harvard University Dining Services workers — who are also represented by Local 26 — during the workers' historic 22-day strike that rocked campus.
Though SLAM’s Friday demonstration was short-lived — Sanders staffers escorted the students out after about three minutes — the protest marked just one of bouts of student activism meant to convince University officials to signal their support for the striking workers.
SLAM members said they have reached out to University administrators including O’Dair and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay over the past two weeks. Students hoped to schedule meetings with the officials and to persuade them to sign a “One Job Should be Enough” pledge promising they will not eat, sleep, or meet at any of hotels whose workers are on strike. The group has also urged student organizations not to hold meetings at the hotels; and SLAM members participated in another protest Thursday.
University administrators, however, have declined to sign SLAM’s pledges.
“Harvard supports fair labor management practices and it respects the legal process that calls for labor issues to be resolved between a union and an employer,” University spokesperson Jonathan Swain wrote in an emailed statement Sunday. “As such, the University is not taking a position on the current labor dispute between Unite Here Local 26 and Marriott International.”
SLAM protesters said University administrators’ decision not to sign the pledges in part motivated their Friday demonstration.
“This was one of the more visible ways that we could get [Bacow] to see that Harvard students are invested in the strike,” said Ria Modak ’22, one of the students who unveiled the banner Friday.
She said she felt the protest was successful because it may make it easier for SLAM to get face time with administrators.
SLAM has already succeeded in getting at least one Harvard-affiliated group to cancel an event slated to take place in a Marriott-operated hotel. Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business relocated its Intercollegiate Business Convention from the Sheraton Boston Hotel, whose workers are currently on strike, to the Science Center on Harvard's campus.
IBC Co-Chair Charlotte E. Kim ’20 said holding the event at the hotel would have been “very wrong and “very hypocritical to our mission,” though changing the venue at the last minute created significant logistical and financial challenges for the group.
IBC invited two of the striking workers to speak at the conference. Their speeches “brought a lot of the audience members to tears,” Kim said.
SLAM has not just focused its efforts on Harvard’s campus, though. Group members rode the T into Boston Thursday to join the picket line of striking Marriott hotel workers in Copley Square before marching towards another striking hotel while chanting, “One job should be enough.”
The workers are “striking from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. everyday,” Glist said. “And the more people that we bring, the less time they’re on their feet.”
Some members of other Harvard unions — including SEIU and the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers, which is currently engaged in collective bargaining with the University — joined SLAM on the picket line.
Some participants, from Harvard and other Boston-area schools, said they chose to join the protest because they felt a responsibility as students to support the strike and labor movements.
“Showing solidarity for other members of the union that represents workers on our own campuses was an important reason in this, too,” said Jesse L. Ryan, a student organizer from Tufts University who attended the protest.
Glist said he was happy with how the protest went.
“Our goal was to be in solidarity with workers, and let them take a break, and bring different people together, and we were very successful with that,” he said. “The numbers were large and visible, and we got a lot of attention.”
Union workers on the picket line said they were thankful for the student support.
“We are very grateful young people take our struggle seriously. They show a lot of courage,” said Henrique G. Fernandes, a picket captain and board member of Unite Here Local 26.
Local 26 spokesperson Nicki Morris said she agrees.
“We appreciate the students coming out to support,” she said. “It’s definitely encouraging to know the students in Boston along with the greater Boston community support us in the strike, and are standing up for workers in their community.”
In an emailed statement, a Marriott International spokesperson wrote the company is a “competitive employer that pays significantly above the minimum wage in most markets and provides generous benefits" and that “we remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach a fair contract for all parties."
Though SLAM members ended Thursday’s protest by shouting “We’ll be back,” Glist and Modak said the group has not yet planned any definite future events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the blink of an eye, junior Kieran Tuntivate raced past the finish line, inching out the Tigers’ Conor Lundy for a first-place finish at the Ivy League Heptagonal Cross Country Championship. The annual Ivy League Championships took place at Princeton’s West Windsor Fields on Oct. 27. With gray skies and a recent rainstorm leaving the course muddy and perilous for all the runners, the Ancient Eight nevertheless had its teams line up for the momentous race.
With of time of 24:30.2 in the 8,000 meter race and an average mile pace of 4:55.7, Tuntivate became the first men’s champion since Maksim Korolev ’14 won in 2013. In addition to his spectacular finish, sophomore Hugo Milner also found himself in the top three finishers with a time of 24:32.3, slotting himself within a pack of four Princeton runners.
After taking a season off last year and travelling to Thailand to both train and compete, Tuntivate returned this season ready to help Harvard break past its competition. As a freshman, he logged times of 25:38, 26:04, and 27:10.4, the latter of which placed him 77th in the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in 2015. His sophomore season, Tuntivate placed 18th at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, running a time of 24:16.8. Overall, his best finish of the season was at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet with a 10th-place finish, and his fastest time of came at the Paul Short Meet where he ran an astounding 24:13.3.
This year, Tuntivate led Harvard to a second place finish in the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship, the best finish the men's team has seen since 1976. With the NCAA Northeast Regional and National Championship meets coming on Nov. 9 and 17, Harvard should feel confident, yet with room to improve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Harvard’s final home games of the season, the Crimson celebrated the leaders of the team on Senior Night, but the team was unable to come away with victories against Ancient Eight opponents Yale and Brown.
BROWN 3, HARVARD 2
Saturday night’s bout saw Harvard (10-11, 5-7 Ivy) and Brown (10-12, 3-9) trade blows in a five-game, nail-biting match. As the Crimson defeated Brown 3-2 in a similarly close match in early October, the Bears’ victory evened the season series at 1-1.
The hosts were able to take the first game in routine fashion, pulling away midway through and winning 25-18. Gridlock ensued in the second game, as neither team was able to pull away from the other. After tying the game at 23-23, two errors from Harvard gave the game to Brown, tying up the match score at one apiece.
The third game saw the same trends continue, as both squads matched each other point for point. Brown was not able to capitalize on three consecutive game points, allowing Harvard to tie it up at 24 points each. The back and forth play continued until the final kill from freshman right side attacker Jaimie Rao, who finished off the game at 30-28.
Sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry led the match with 15 kills, closely followed by co-captain Christina Cornelius with 13. They have been two of Harvard’s top attackers this year, and on the season are the top two in kills for the Crimson.
With their backs against a wall, the Bears were able to survive another tight game in the fourth. After an error that gave Harvard a match point, Brown managed to convert three consecutive points, finishing the game with a service ace that sent the match into a final fifth game.
After four tense games that saw the score tied 41 times, Harvard failed to keep up with the Bears in the decisive final game. Brown came out of the break fast, getting off to a five point lead and holding its lead to finish off the match just short of the three-hour mark.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
In Friday night’s contest against Yale (17-4, 11-1), Harvard came out of the gate with high energy, matching Yale point for point in the first before errors and strong defense allowed the Bulldogs to pull away with the first game, 25-18.
“I think Yale’s defense is very good, their ball control too, so we usually serve very aggressively to take them out of system,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We couldn’t get them out of system, so they had three options every time.”
The Crimson controlled the blocking battle, recording 16 blocks to Yale’s eight. Cornelius again had a strong performance, leading the way with six blocks.
Yale came out quickly in the second game, forcing errors that allowed the visitors to gain a 10-4 lead early on. Harvard’s defense was able to hold the Bulldogs to a .156 hitting percentage in the second, but it was not enough to fight back. Despite seeing their lead fall to two points, Yale recovered and finished off the game, 25-17.
Harvard’s woes can be attributed to the fact that a day prior the Crimson lost one of its starting players, freshman setter Bella Almanza, to injury.
“That happened quickly yesterday, so we didn’t have a whole lot of time to prepare, so it's a big effect, it’s like [losing] the quarterback,” Weiss said. “The other two stepped up to the plate, but one of those two is injured as well.”
In a win or go home scenario, Harvard was able to hang with the Bulldogs for most of the game, each team trading the lead throughout the set until the score read 17-17. With a quick momentum shift Yale was able to tally three quick points, forcing a timeout for the Crimson. Yale was able to close out the game quickly after the timeout, 25-20, completing the three game sweep.
Getting Almanza back from injury will be key as Harvard tries to put this weekend behind them and close out its conference schedule.
“We will rally, hopefully we will get her back on the court on Monday and keep moving forward,” Weiss said.
Harvard will end its regular season on the road next week when it faces Ivy League foes Princeton (17-6, 10-2) and Penn (5-18, 2-10).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first season for the Crimson, freshman Henry Marshall has attained single-handed glory.
Marshall began his collegiate sailing career in the New England Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association’s Singlehanded Championships on Sept. 15, where he bested 19 other sailors to take home first-place honors. More importantly, the victory earned him a ticket to Singlehanded Nationals on Nov. 3.
The National Championship, spanning this past weekend, was hosted by Grand Valley State University, which organized the event on Lake Michigan.
Posting top-five finishes in every race but one on the weekend, Marshall clinched the title before the last race even began. He ended his commanding weekend with an impressive 40 points, holding a sizable lead over Leo Bucher, a freshman from St. Mary’s College of Maryland who recorded 71 points.
Marshall kicked off the first day of the competition on a tear, earning a top-five finish in each of the eight races. His three first-place finishes on the day propelled him to the top spot on the leaderboard, with a comfortable margin of 15 points between himself Bucher.
The second day produced spottier wind patterns. However, the weather was no match for Marshall, who continued his dominance over the rest of the field by not giving up his position atop the pool of competitors.
Marshall is no stranger to first-place finishes. In 2016, he won the Laser Radial Youth World Championship, taking home the gold among a field of 58 international competitors. Leading up to the regatta, he took time off from school and trained with U.S. Olympic Laser Radial sailor Paige Railey at the United States sailing headquarters in Brazil.
Currently a member of the United States’ Olympic Development Program, Marshall is looking to continue his success representing the Crimson and the United States in the future.
“There's a lot to look forward to in the spring,” Marshall said. “There are two national titles on the line and we're going to do our best to win again.”
In international racing, Marshall is preparing to begin his training for the 2019 Pan American Games qualifiers, another step towards achieving his ultimate goal of sailing for the United States in the Olympic Games.
Marshall’s immediate impact as a new member of Harvard’s sailing team came as a result of his rigorous preparation going into his first-year season.
“I’ve had a pretty heavy training load right through the summer leading into my season,” the freshman said. “My coaches and I worked hard to put together a schedule that we thought would put us in the best position possible come November, and I think we achieved that.”
However, his immediate impact was not limited to his accomplishments on the water.
“His work ethic is unparalleled both on the water and in training” said freshman skipper Frankie Doyle, Marshall’s high school classmate and current teammate. “Everything that has happened with his success has come from his hard work, and I think he has really motivated the people around him as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday afternoon, a shot from the point caused a mad scramble in front of the Princeton net. Bodies were flying everywhere when finally Harvard sophomore forward Becca Gilmore slid behind the Tigers’ goaltender and tucked the loose puck into the net.
This play late in the third period knotted the game at 2-2, which allowed the Crimson (1-3-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) to earn a tie against Princeton (3-2-1, 3-0-1) following a scoreless overtime period. The team salvaged a point this weekend after falling to Quinnipiac (3-5-2, 3-1-0) on Friday in Hamden, Conn.
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 2
“We regrouped Saturday morning and we talked about being more relentless and having urgency,” Gilmore said. “Nothing changes, just urgency and we knew what we needed to do.”
The team certainly brought that urgency on Saturday, but it was the Tigers who jumped out to a quick start in the first period by capitalizing on a Harvard penalty. Sophomore forward Sharon Franklin put her side ahead on the power play off the assist from her fellow sophomore forward Sarah Verbeek.
This lead would last until the second period. After 13 minutes, freshman forward Dominique Petrie converted a penalty shot, the squad’s first since 2011, to draw the Crimson level.
An early goal in the third period from Princeton forced Harvard into another comeback effort. After applying pressure, the team got its breakthrough with Gilmore’s goal before having to pull its goaltender for an extra skater.
“It was not the prettiest goal,” Gilmore said. “My two linemates put a lot of pressure and a screen on the goalie and I was able to just sneak behind and bury it.… It was a good, gritty play by all five players on the ice.”
The five-minute overtime period featured a handful of shots from the Crimson, as it played with confidence, riding the momentum from its late equalizer. However, none of those efforts found a way past sophomore goaltender Rachel McQuigge.
Despite not pulling out the victory, the team’s two goals were certainly an improvement from the shutout the day before. The change is not so much due to an altered style, but more just a focus on working hard and being willing to do the dirty work to finish chances.
“I think it’s just getting more shots to the net and getting more bodies in front of the net,” said captain and forward Kate Hallett. “Screening those goaltenders, and capitalizing on rebound opportunities [are really important].”
QUINNIPIAC 1, HARVARD 0
Friday night’s game was a very different affair in terms of the score sheet. Nothing could separate the sides through two periods at the People’s United Center.
Freshman goaltender Lindsay Reed played a big part in keeping things level. She accumulated 25 saves on the night to help her team stay in the game. After a save, Reed dove back towards her own net and tipped the a shot wide with her outstretched arms to prevent a Bobcat player from tapping in the rebound.
A power play goal from junior defender Kenzie Prater broke the deadlock in the third period. The game ended 1-0 after a late flurry from the Crimson fell short.
The lackluster offensive showing was led by Petrie, captain forward Lexie Laing, and junior forward Kat Hughes. The trio finished with five, three, and three shots respectively on the night.
On the other side of the ice, six Quinnipiac players totaled at least three shots apiece. Junior defender Kati Tabin had a team high four shots out of the total 26.
This weekend was a continuation of the slow start Harvard has had. The team has only notched seven goals in its first five games, with three of those coming in the opening win against Dartmouth. If it hopes to turn things around, the goal scoring will certainly have to increase.
“We have a lot of talent on this team,” Gilmore said. “All four lines can put the puck in the net and we just need to do it consistently. I don’t think that’s based on the other team. I think that’s our power, our grit, to dig deep and get one in.”
The Crimson has almost two weeks before its next contest against Holy Cross. The break will afford the group an opportunity to build up chemistry and make adjustments from this first stretch of games.
“We have a lot of work,” Gilmore said. “This is not where we wanted to be at the end of five games now… As a team we need to regroup and reflect on what went well, what went bad, and how we get better… The next two weeks will be huge in that aspect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was no better way for the Harvard field hockey team to end its 2018 regular season.
Prior to the noon start to the matchup between No. 6 Harvard (16-1, 7-0 Ivy) and Columbia (8-9, 2-5), fans and families filed into the bleachers to support the seniors playing in their last regular season home game.
“Coming into the game I was obviously a little upset but just proud to be a part of such an amazing season and such an amazing team,” said senior back Olivia Allin, who scored a goal in her final regular season outing.
Backs Allin and Brianna Bolon, midfielders Victoria Boylett and Emily Duarte, captain and forward Kathleen Young, and goalkeeper Libby Manela were the seniors honored prior to the start of the game.
“The senior class has been amazing. They took a chance on this program five years ago, when we were in a whole different ball game than we are in now,” head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden remarked. “They made this program what it is today by winning the Ivy League championships twice.”
Following the emotional senior day ceremony, the Crimson set its sights on the Lions, looking to continue its dominance over the Ivy League.
The final match of the season, although against a Columbia team that only won two games in the Ancient Eight this season, was just as important for Harvard as any other. The squad looked to claim the Ivy League title outright for the second time in three years by going undefeated in conference play. Furthermore, the team planned on riding its record-setting 12 game win streak into the NCAA tournament, which begins this coming weekend.
And dominate it did. The Crimson played up to its defensive standard on Saturday, keeping the visitors out of the scoring column for the seventh time this season. The shutout marked the end of a regular season homestand in which Harvard did not allow a single goal.
On the offensive side, the Crimson put on a stellar performance. The scoring began early as Allin opened the floodgates in the tenth minute on a penalty corner sequence. In the same half, freshman midfield Rachel Greenwood, assisted by junior forward Maddie Earle, laid out to extend to the ball and put one past the keeper. To round off first half scoring, Earle earned herself a goal shortly after picking up an assist, as a shot by sophomore midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen deflected off of her stick and into the net.
In the second half, goals by sophomore forward Natalie Sicher and Young sealed the fate of the game and the conference.
Sophomore midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen put one in between the legs of the keeper and into the back of the net in the 68th minute to round off the Crimson’s six goals, guaranteeing the squad sole possession of the Ivy League trophy following the final whistle.
Up next for the Crimson is the NCAA tournament, to which Harvard has an automatic bid after clinching the Ivy League. Currently ranked sixth in the nation, the Crimson is set to take on Penn State on Friday at 2:30 p.m.
In 2018, the Nittany Lions went 12-5 with a 6-2 record in the Big Ten. The team had a recent three-game winning streak before losing its regular season finale, 3-2, against Iowa. Penn State is led by freshman Anna Simon with 12 goals. Senior Moira Putsch paces the team with 29 points. Jenny Rizzo is the team’s primary goalkeeper and has held opposing offenses to 1.32 goals per game.
“We know we have the potential to do very well if we play our game and play for each other and that's going to be our goal going into the NCAAs” said Young, who is excited to enter the national playoffs with a talented roster.
Weighing into the decision of the team’s rank in the playoff was its undefeated stint in the Ancient Eight as well as its current 13-game win streak in which they defeated ranked teams such as No. 18 Maine, No. 24 Boston University, and No. 3 Princeton.
“We put ourselves in the best position to do damage,” van Herwaarden said. “We’re capable of competing with the best teams in this country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (3-12, 1-5 Ivy) dropped a close game to a strong Columbia (10-4-1, 5-1) squad on Saturday by a score of 2-1. For the third game in a row, the Crimson was faced with less than ideal weather. The Crimson played in fairly windy conditions on its Senior Night after enduring hail and rain in Hanover, N.H., and cancelling a game against Northeastern due to lightning.
This is the fourth season in a row in which the Columbia has had ten or more wins in a season. The Lions are now in the running for the Ivy League title. They can win if first-place Princeton loses or ties against Yale in its final game of the Ivy League next weekend and if Columbia defeats fourth-place Cornell.
Within minutes of the opening whistle, Lions senior Dylan Mott scored a goal that quickly changed the momentum of the game. The goal-scoring play started when sophomore defender Blake Willis threw the ball in on the left side of the field to freshman midfielder Sebastian Gunbeyi. Gunbeyi collected the ball near the end line and sent a left-footed cross to Mott who was left alone in the box. Mott sent the ball into the net, right underneath the crossbar.
Harvard responded by going on the offensive. In the 33rd minute the Crimson scored a tying goal on a penalty kick. Senior forward Cesar Farias Jr. scored his third goal of the season by firing a shot past Columbia senior goalkeeper Dylan Castanheira.
“I thought throughout the game, especially in the second half we started to dominate possession and I think we went on our front foot a little bit, which was obviously great to see,” said Harvard junior midfielder Taner Dogan. “The result was not what we wanted and we kind of lacked creating those clear cut chances in the final third and being clinical with our finishing, but we definitely had some positive takeaways from it. I think the last couple games kind of put together some stretches of domination on the ball and everything. But obviously the next step is to translate that to goals and results.”
The next goal did not occur until the second half. In the 51st minute of the game, the Lions earned a corner kick. Willis’ kick sailed into the box where Mott and freshman midfielder Andrew Stevens were waiting to get a head on it. Mott was given credit for the game-winning goal.
The action did not end there, though. There were several more attempts from both sides before the final whistle was blown.
Minutes after Columbia’s second goal, the Lions used their momentum to generate another possible goal-scoring opportunity. Junior John Denis created a 2-on-1 opportunity near the Harvard goal that was stopped by a foul on Harvard sophomore Fernando Docters just outside of the box. Denis took the kick, but the shot went wide right of the goal.
In the final minutes of the game, the Crimson had several attempts to tie the score up. One of them occurred in the final seconds of the game. Harvard drew a corner kick that was floated into the box, but the kick was saved by Castanheira before any Harvard player could get a piece of it.
Overall, the Crimson had eight shots, half on goal. Six of the eight shots were attempts from first-years. Harvard sophomore goalie Matt Freese recorded three saves in the match. Freese leads the Ivy League in saves per game with an average of 5.25.
“The younger players in the group have been a very important part of the team this year,” sophomore midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso said. “They provide a lot of quality going forward and looking ahead we can see that this program has a bright future.”
Currently, the Crimson sits in last place — however, with help from the teams at the top of the Ivy League standings, Harvard could finish the season in fifth. The Crimson would have to beat seventh-place Penn and both Yale and Brown would have to lose to Princeton and Dartmouth, respectively.
“With the seniors and everybody involved we definitely want to finish out on a high,” Dogan said. “I think if we can go and play the way we have been playing in terms of calmness on the ball and willingness to play and combine that with creating a little more clear-cut chances in the final third...we are definitely in a good position to get results and finish our season on a positive.”

After the high-profile and high-stakes Harvard admissions trial released a slew of well-kept secrets detailing how the College evaluates applicants, the mystery surrounding our admissions files has finally begun to unfurl.
If you're anything like me, you have a lot of questions — questions like, What does my admissions file say? What score did admissions officers give me for my extracurriculars? My personal traits? Do I have "humor and grit," like my mother says I do?
These questions don’t have to go unanswered. Under a federal law known as the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, students have the right to schedule an appointment to view their admissions file in person. Harvard doesn’t exactly publicize this process, so I've decided to share my experience to help satisfy your curiosity. Here are the steps I took to view my file.
Note: I accessed my admissions file in December 2017. Inquire about any changes to this process at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar's Office.
1. Fill out the Admissions File Viewing Request Form.
This form can be accessed here. I encourage you to complete this form early as the office can take up to 45 days to schedule your appointment. Keep in mind: if you waived the right to view your recommendation letters when you applied to Harvard, you cannot ask to view them now.
2. Send the file in an email to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Office.
Attach the file to an email to fileviewing@fas.harvard.edu. I recommend stating within the body of the email that you are making a "FERPA access request." You may also ask for access to all documents held by the Harvard University Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, including “without limitation a complete copy of any admissions records kept in my name in any and all university offices, including the Undergraduate Admission Workcard and all associated content (including without limitation the qualitative and quantitative assessments of any 'readers,' demographics data, interview records); any e-mails, notes, memoranda, video, audio, or other documentary material maintained by the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid.”
3. Come to your appointment with a pen and paper.
Once you get to the admissions office, you'll have 30 minutes max to review your file. There's a possibility the FAS Registrar Office will not permit you to take photographs of your admissions file (though at least one student got away with it). But you will be allowed to take notes on your admissions file.
Curious about the weird numbers and markings you see? Documents unearthed during the lawsuit can tell you what they mean. Check out The Crimson's explainer of the admissions process to learn more.

Some may encourage you to access your file while others may stress not to. Ultimately, the decision and responsibility is up to you. As for me, viewing my admissions file definitely helped quell some of my uncertainty about whether I belonged on campus.
Overall, though, I don't think I learned much.
