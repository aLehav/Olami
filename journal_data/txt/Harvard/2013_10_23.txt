After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
If you haven’t seen the admissions office’s newest recruitment video, then you need to. Set to the ridiculously optimistic Ellie Goulding song "Anything Could Happen," the video will fill you with a rush of pride for fair Harvard, a rush that will last approximately until you remember the 300 pages of reading you have to get through by tomorrow. However, if you are an overenthusiastic high school student, the video is perfectly designed to spawn pangs of desire, crazed posts on College Confidential, and furious rewrites of that optional essay on the Common App supplement. Mission accomplished, I guess.
 
  But "Anything Could Happen" could just be the start. Ellie Goulding has quite the repertoire of upbeat, sonically happy songs that could make even the dullest admissions information seem like the most exciting thing in the world. Here are Flyby’s ideas for what the admissions office should work on next.
 
"Starry Eyed"This video would be centered on the glories of Annenberg. Students are most definitely starry eyed at their first view of the gothic wood paneling and stained glass—the word “Hogwarts” gets dropped at least 50 times a minute during Opening Days. And every minute after that.
 
"I Need Your Love"Moving past the beauty of Annenberg, the next video in the series would be specifically directed at everyone’s favorite HUDS offerings: red-spiced chicken, honey butter, clam chowder, veritaffles, and Sunday Sundaes. When everything’s wrong, you make it right, HUDS.
 
"Lights"The background music to a video about housing. Specifically about how your roommate keeps the lights on all night while you are trying to sleep. Could be extended to deal with walk-throughs, not de-bunking, and communal hall showers.
 
"Halcyon"If you come to Harvard, you can learn what a halcyon is. Sponsored by the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
 
"Your Biggest Mistake"Canaday. Taking CS 50 graded. Concentrating in biomedical engineering. Touching John Harvard’s foot, ever. Thinking a 10 a.m. class “wasn’t that early”. Renting a microfridge from HSA. Hooking up with your blockmate. And ever thinking that Harvard needed an admissions video to get tens of thousands of kids to apply here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I want to tell you about two of my heroes and why they should work together.
Sam G. Greenberg ’14, one of the authors of Monday’s op-ed about Cambridge City Council candidate Logan Leslie, is a passionate advocate for the homeless. He’s spent years pouring his heart and soul into the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, fighting for a new youth shelter, and leading the Philips Brooks House Association. I can’t think of anyone who knows or cares more about our city’s less fortunate.
My second hero is Logan Leslie. He enlisted for the United States Army the day he turned 17, and he spent eight years risking his life in the Special Forces. Now, at 27, he attends Harvard on the GI Bill, drills for the National Guard each month, works another job every weekend, supports a wife and daughter, expects a newborn sometime this week, and struggles to pay rent for his West Cambridge home.
How are these admirable individuals related? Sam is my roommate, Logan is my boss, and they both want to make their city a better place.
The first thing I noticed about Logan is that he isn’t your stereotypical politician. Though raised a conservative, he quickly lost any attachment to partisanship. As Logan explained to me, when you spend nearly a decade in a war zone, the regular social divisions—politics, class, race, sexual orientation—become irrelevant. What matters is that you listen.
I serve as Logan Leslie’s campaign manager not because he’s an expert on homelessness, crime, or city politics. I work for him because he’s an expert at listening to others, and he’s dedicated to representing the interests of all Cambridge’s residents—including students, homeowners, and the homeless.
For Logan, homelessness is embarrassing—it’s embarrassing that we don’t do enough as a community to end it. Logan’s language might not be the most gentle, but he is open to adopting any solution that would solve our city’s most pressing problems.
Immediately after Monday’s op-ed, for instance, Logan contacted Sam to ask how he could refine his platform and language in regard to homelessness. He asked about potential mental health solutions and permanent supportive housing, he pledged to form a city-sanctioned task force on homelessness, and he invited Sam to serve as its student chair.
Think what could be accomplished if Councilor Leslie and Greenberg sat at a table with students and residents to develop innovative solutions to our city’s problems. There has never been a Harvard College student on the Council, so we can only imagine.
I also take issue with the op-ed’s suggestion that students don’t deserve to vote in this election because the Harvard administration doesn’t pay local taxes. Logan is not running to represent the interests of Faust, the Harvard Management Corporation, et al; he is running to represent us, the students—a markedly different group.
Additionally, the authors claim that we aren’t “entitled” to vote in Cambridge because we don’t pay property taxes ourselves. So, if you follow the op-ed’s logic, no Harvard student should vote in this election.
But as a student, what’s my alternative? Voting in Texas, a place where I spend less than a month each year, where I also don’t pay property taxes, and where I can’t even get married? If not, when do I earn the coveted privilege of voting in Cambridge? After five years? A decade? A few grand in taxes? Proof of literacy?
The notion that I shouldn’t vote in the place I call home is disheartening, arbitrary, and, as one commenter noted, darkly reminiscent of our country’s antebellum tax and property voting requirements. We live in Cambridge, and we live in a nation where voting in one’s place of residency is a right—not a privilege earned after a citizen is deemed worthy.
Just as Cambridge homeowners are profoundly impacted by Harvard’s decisions, the recent stabbings only steps from our homes remind us that we live here too. Twenty percent of Cambridge’s residents are students, and 11 percent representation on the City Council seems like a fair request. (And hardly radical: Berkeley has already adopted a student City Council district.)
The Harvard student body seems to agree. One thousand College students were already registered to vote in Cambridge at the beginning of the year, and our campaign registered nearly 550 more in only a few weeks.
So, as a card-carrying homosexual liberal Democrat, I will vote for Logan Leslie on November 5, confident that he will fight to eliminate the town vs. gown divide and create a productive two-way conversation between students and our city’s other proud residents.
More importantly, I know that he will listen to all of us.
Eric M. Cervini ’14 is a history concentrator in Lowell House. He is the campaign manager for Cambridge City Council candidate Logan Leslie ’16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Consider a school where students only pass or fail. After a semester ends, the material-masters complain they’ll appear equal to the barely-passers when they apply for jobs. So the professors turn grades into A through D, and F (with pluses and minuses for extra acuity). They figure this will also motivate harder work and give students more useful information about strengths and weaknesses. Now, the low scorers complain they’re missing opportunities because a D replaces a P. The professors, wanting them to succeed or maybe frustrated with low, mark-influenced ratings, boost the average GPA so the distribution ranges from B-minus to A.
To me, this scenario captures three main purposes of the grading system. First, grades offer discrimination. They let interested parties—employers, admissions offices, scholarship committees—evaluate competence and distinguish candidates. They also offer motivation. Those who could previously drift through class and earn the same mark as top students now lose the safety net of ambiguity. Finally, grades offer self-evaluation. They allow students to judge their capacity and mastery in a certain field.  This example also captures the emergence of grade inflation—it appears to make people better off. The professors are happy with higher course ratings, and the students are happy with higher marks and more opportunities because of them.
But consider the students from schools that don’t inflate grades and the employers they’re approaching. When the average GPA at Harvard is a 3.45, compared to a 3.31 at Wellesley, 3.28 at Princeton, or 2.99 at Iowa State, many employers will judge the same grade from different schools incorrectly, since they reflect different degrees of mastery. You might only need to be in the 80th percentile to get a 3.8 at Harvard, but in the 90th at Wellesley. Students from non-inflating schools may fare worse during recruitment since they appear less competent, and employers may fare worse since they’re more likely to hire less qualified applicants.
You might argue that grades are absolute; the fact that most “grade-inflating” schools are selective, private universities shows that higher averages are due to harder working or more intelligent students. Even if it’s true, we’d need to standardize curricula across colleges to measure it, so any GPA would reflect a quantified level of mastery. This task is just impractical.
On the other hand, when grades are comparative, they offer clear information: how does this student perform in relation to others? And since curricula aren’t standardized, the most informative comparison comes from within a school—how does this student, given that he goes to Harvard, perform relative to his peers? Right now, employers see higher average GPAs at selective schools. They assume that the students are more competent, too, since a selective school accepted them. So they’re counting reputation for twice its worth. If colleges normalized GPAs, all students in the 75th percentile of their class would have the same GPA, and employers would more accurately identify those with true proficiency. So we wouldn’t unfairly double-dip the prestige chip.
In addition to decreasing equality and removing transparency from recruitment, grade inflation dampens motivation. Too many students at Harvard pick courses because course evaluations deem them an easy A. And once these students enroll, few besides the internally driven have any encouragement to learn once they have studied enough to get an A. Grade inflation allows students to achieve high grades through minimal effort and offers little incentive to exert more than that minimal amount.
But the hardest part of addressing grade inflation is convincing people who receive it that they’re worse off. After all, grade inflation works—research shows that it creates more post-graduate opportunities. I can say only this: Job placement alone is a superficial indicator of success, especially if the reasons for placement arise from ignorance about grading standards. I think more informative statistics would capture mid-career success and employer satisfaction; yes, you landed an opportunity, but were you able to meet the expectations that your transcript created? Grade inflation leads to job placement for possibly less qualified applicants, and I imagine they’d do better by pursuing a job for which they have an actual advantage, for which their expertise isn’t exaggerated on paper. And if grades were normalized across colleges, they’d be more likely to land that job, too.
Grade inflation belies the purpose of grades. It crams a 0-4.0 bracket into a 3.0-4.0 one, making it harder to discriminate between similar candidates from the same school (and can we please not try to maintain precision by introducing the A-+ and the A--?). It disadvantages candidates from non-grade-inflating schools and tempers motivation to learn beyond a now easier-to-achieve A, impeding the very learning that college propounds. In his 2012 Wellesley High School commencement speech, author David McCullough, Jr. noted that we have “come to love accolades more than genuine achievement” for cheap self-affirmation and career-leverage. The prevalence of grade inflation embodies this mentality, where schools pump helium into grades for students happier to take career-boosting marks than earn accurate indicators of competence. Colleges aren’t showing students what it’s like to fail, so they aren’t teaching them what it’s like to truly succeed.
We at Harvard shouldn’t condone this culture of grade inflation because it’s one we’re the superficial beneficiaries of (and if you chose Harvard over Princeton because of its grade-inflation, please reflect on what you’re trying to do here). We should endorse a system that actualizes the purpose of grades and aims of education. So let’s follow in the steps of places like Princeton and Wellesley. Let’s deflate this culture so our successes aren’t artificially elevated by accolades that come from without, but grounded by the talent we have from within.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recruiting season has come to Harvard, and while the rest of us are worrying about our midterms and papers, the Class of 2014 has begun the lengthy process of job searching. Many current seniors will go on to work for tech firms or investment banks, but if the last few years are any indicator, an equally substantial portion of them will apply to and take positions with Teach For America—a controversial program that aims to send highly-qualified college graduates to teach in high-need school districts for periods of two years. The program is not without its faults, but imperfection is no cause for condemnation. TFA is a worthwhile institution not only because it improves education for students across the country, but also because it is uniquely positioned to work toward positive change in our country’s educational system.
In America’s current educational system, students from top schools have little incentive to pursue careers as teachers. American teachers are expected to perform a very difficult job for relatively low salaries and are less valued culturally than most of their counterparts around the world. In most American school districts, hiring decisions are based upon seniority—which means that there is little job security for young, aspiring teachers. Looking for a place to begin a career, American college graduates see teaching as a low-paying option with little stability.
There are doubtless high-achieving students who choose teaching over more lucrative options, but the vast majority appears to do otherwise: Most students enrolled in four-year teaching programs graduated in the bottom half of their high school classes. This is certainly not to say that students who don’t graduate at the top of their classes cannot be fine educators. But equally certain is that there is something backward about a system of incentives that that fails to attract our top students to a profession so crucial to the nation’s future as teaching.
Teaching accreditation programs also seem to be doing a poor job of educating their students. In countries with world-renowned education systems like Finland, teaching programs appear to be much more rigorous and much more competitive. These countries also pay their teachers respectable salaries. Until America affords its teachers greater pay and respect, we simply cannot expect large numbers of highly qualified individuals to enter the profession.
Teach for America is valuable because it provides at least a temporary solution to America’s educational problems. By providing a secure and alluring temporary teaching position, it puts graduates from top schools into high-need schools across the country. Former corps members and their students largely attest to the program’s value, and may TFA members continue to teach or advocate for education reform. A recent study suggests that students learn math better from TFA teachers than from first-year teachers coming from traditional teacher-training programs.
The program is not without its problems, but critics should focus on improving the program rather than on calling for its dissolution. Some critics allege that the program does not provide enough training or support to new teachers, who often feel overwhelmed on the job. TFA should address this problem and be more meticulous about helping its recruits throughout their employment. The temporary nature of the position also makes it appear like a “quick fix” to a much larger problem—TFA should focus some energy on long-term problems like low teacher pay and dubious education programs, and on encouraging even more of its recruits to stay in the profession.
In an ideal world, teaching would attract enough highly qualified and motivated students that TFA would no longer serve a purpose. But that is not the world we live in. Until then, TFA should be seen as a positive force in improving the education of high-need students across the country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, I got an email from a recruiter. An associate of Teach For America, citing a minor leadership role in a student organization as evidence that I “have distinguished [myself] as a leader here on Harvard’s campus,” asked me to meet with Harvard’s TFA representative on campus. Dropping phrases like “race and class,” “equal opportunities,” and “educational injustice,” the recruiter promised that I could have a significant impact on a classroom in an underserved community.
I have thought for many years about teaching high school history. But I stopped replying to this email after a few exchanges.
I am not interested in TFA.
For one, I am far from ready to enter a classroom on my own. Indeed, in my experience Harvard students have increasingly acknowledged that TFA drastically underprepares its recruits for the reality of teaching. But more importantly, TFA is not only sending young, idealistic, and inexperienced college grads into schools in neighborhoods different from where they’re from—it’s also working to destroy the American public education system. As a hopeful future teacher, that is not something I could ever conscionably put my name behind.
Princeton alumna Wendy Kopp originally founded TFA with the mission of filling teacher shortages in U.S. public schools. The program, which helps young college grads find placements teaching in public schools after they graduate from college, combines the persistence of a five-person recruiting team with the cache of a competitive on-campus-interview process. It has quickly become one of the most popular destinations for Harvard seniors after graduation.
Clearly, some Harvard students still believe that TFA’s model of recruiting young idealists, throwing them into five weeks of intensive training, and then placing them into schools in neighborhoods very unlike the ones they came from is truly the answer to everything from income inequality to underfunded public school systems. Perhaps they even think that teaching is such an unattractive profession that bright college graduates should be bribed with a feel-good resume booster to fill the vast shortage of competent teachers in the United States.
But it has become increasingly clear to anyone who thinks critically about teaching that there’s something off with TFA’s model. After all, TFA alumni repeatedly describe their stints in the American public education system as some of the hardest two years of their lives. Doesn’t it bother you to imagine undertrained 22-year-olds standing in front of an crowded classroom and struggling through every class period? Indeed, most of the critiques of TFA in The Crimson have focused on students’ unpreparedness to teach.
However, unpreparedness pales in comparison to the much larger problem with TFA: It undermines the American public education system from the very foundation by urging the replacement of experienced career teachers with a neoliberal model of interchangeable educators and standardized testing. If TFA intended to place students in schools with insufficient numbers of teachers, it has strayed far from its original goal. As an essay by Chicago teacher Kenzo Shibata asked last summer, “Teach For America wanted to help stem a teacher shortage. Why then are thousands of experienced educators being replaced by hundreds of new college graduates?” Journalist James Cersonsky notes that veteran teachers and schools alike may suffer from this type of reform: “Districts pay thousands in fees to TFA for each corps member in addition to their salaries—at the expense of the existing teacher workforce. Chicago, for example, is closing 48 schools and laying off 850 teachers and staff while welcoming 350 corps members.”
Chicago is not the first city where Teach For America has tried to replace veteran teachers with new recruits. Two years ago, The Crimson quoted the president of the Boston Teachers’ Union as saying, “Teach For America claims that it does not come in and take positions from incumbent members. That is a lie. They are doing it in Boston…Their arrogance is appalling.” Cersonsky and blogger EduSchyster have meticulously documented TFA’s connections to dozens of charter schools as well as education reform advocacy organizations that focus on standardized testing and privatization instead of grassroots community involvement and student voices. In doing so, TFA is working directly against the interests of teachers, students, and communities alike. Neoliberal school reform is the true “educational injustice” here.
Happily, Chicago does provide a model of truly community-driven and progressive education advocacy. Last summer, the Chicago Teachers’ Union organized with parents and students to advocate for quality public education including smaller class sizes, more staff like school nurses, less standardized testing, and progressive taxation structures for school funding.
I don’t mean to vilify students who’ve chosen to recruit for TFA—I’m sure they have only the best intentions of helping underserved students—but I would like to call on my classmates and current TFA corps members to reconsider their decision to be part of this program. TFA has positioned itself as an ethical alternative to Wall Street for college seniors looking for a short-term commitment. We should all have questions about how much we can actually help to fix structural problems with just a month of training and a few years of work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York Times columnist Gail Collins argued in a lecture on Tuesday evening that the Civil Rights movement, the advent of the birth control pill in the 1960s, and the economic slump of the 1970s were crucial in shifting American society’s views on women.
The lecture, titled after her recent book “When Everything Changed,” was this year’s Maurine and Robert Rothschild Lecture, and was given before a packed audience in the Radcliffe Institute’s Knafel Center. Many of Collins’s remarks, interspersed with humor, drew laughter from the audience.
Collins said that the Civil Rights movement’s transformative effects on American society allowed other movements to follow in its wake.
“The country had been so extraordinarily unjust to such a large chunk of its population for such a prolonged period of time, [that] once [people] digested that, I think the country became very sensitive to issues of fairness,” Collins said.
Collins also said that before the advent of the birth control pill, long preparation times for professions such as law and medicine made them seem prohibitive to women.
“After birth control pills became widely available, applications by women to law schools and medical schools went through the roof,” she said.
Collins also noted that in order for families to maintain the type of lifestyle that became popular after World War II, women had to enter the workforce because one salary could no longer support that lifestyle given the tough economic conditions of the 1970s.
“It’s important because when women work, it’s a matter of course [that] they are powerful and taken seriously. In this country you are not taken seriously unless you have an economic role,” Collins said. “It was the great mistake the suffragists made that they thought if you had the vote, that’s all you needed.”
Collins also said that the general shift in America’s attitudes toward women also affected men.
“It created a world in which men and women marched forward in partnership, sharing responsibilities, both ready to jump in each other’s roles when need be,” she said.
Nancy F. Cott, who introduced Collins and serves as director of the Schlesinger Library, said that she thought Collins’s popularity and ability to educate audiences made her an excellent speaker for the event.
Alice X. Wang ’14, a co-chair of the Harvard Women’s Leadership Conference who attended the event, said that while she has examined issues of implicit discrimination against women in the workplace, she was surprised by some of the information presented by Collins.
 “I didn’t realize that it was only a few decades ago that women weren’t even allowed to work in most professions,” she said. “It was amazing to hear about the transformation that happened so recently.”

Over three years before the next presidential election, panelists at the JFK Jr. Forum said the race is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s to lose because no other Democrats are as popular as she is and the Republican Party is not unified.
The panel—entitled “It’s Never Too Early: Election 2016”—was moderated by C.M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the Institute of Politics, and included four panelists: CNN Political Contributor Paul Begala, CNBC Political Analyst Robert Costa, former Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Democratic National Committee Karen Finney, and Institute of Politics fellow Ana Navarro.
The panelists suggested that many of the 2016 presidential candidates would be politicians who had run for the office before.
“Running for president is like having sex. You don’t do it once and then stop,” Begala said.
Despite Clinton’s loss in the 2008 Democratic primary, the panelists unanimously agreed that she is the candidate facing the most favorable political landscape. Begala said that Clinton has unprecedented early support and said that he had “worn out [his] knees” begging her to run for office.
Finney said she thinks that Clinton does not yet know if she will actually run for president. Furthermore, Finney said that Clinton’s age will factor into the politician’s decision.
Begala said that one obstacle Clinton might face is that Democrats tend to want someone “new and fresh.” He said it can be difficult to go from a younger candidate to an older candidate.
Despite Clinton’s formidable support, Costa said that Republicans do not see her as unbeatable.
“Republicans sense an opportunity to beat her because of the generational divide,” Costa said.
Panelists also pointed to Vice President Joe Biden as a potentially strong Democratic candidate.
“He’s like the holy spirit, he shows up everywhere,” Navarro said.
Panelists said that prospects are far less clear on the Republican side.
Navarro said that several Republicans have been “hot for 15 minutes,” but that no one yet has shown the ability to sustain momentum and break away from the pack.
Navarro pointed to controversial Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who was very vocal during the recent government shutdown, as an example of a hot Republican of the moment.
“Cruz is going to out-conservative everyone,” said Costa.
Panelists also singled out New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as a potentially strong Republican presidential candidate.
Although Jeb Bush may be one of the most talented candidates, panelists said his family name could be a huge political liability.
“Maybe he could change his name to something more appealing, like Kardashian,” said Begala.
Also noted among potential Republican hopefuls was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
Paul, Finney said, “has been changing his behavior,” an indicator that he “wants it.” The Senator once known for fringe issues has recently been focusing on more mainstream projects like promoting farming. Paul, Begala said, could also fill an important void for anti-war Republican voters.
 Marco Rubio, 2012 candidates like Rick Santorum and Rick Perry, and several mid-western governors were also mentioned as potential contenders.

An unexpected letter from University President Drew G. Faust explaining why Harvard will not divest from fossil fuel companies has catalyzed discussion and provoked direct responses, including one from Seattle Mayor Michael P. McGinn.
Last Thursday, McGinn published an open letter to Faust titled “Let’s End This Crisis” expressing disagreement with her explanation of why Harvard will not divest.
“We're the first generation to see the effects of climate change, and the last generation who can do anything about it,” McGinn wrote. “To refuse to use every tool at our disposal in this fight—to embrace inaction—is to endorse a trajectory that will lead to suffering, privation, and calamity. We owe it to those who our institutions and investments serve and will serve in the future to do everything we can to prevent this crisis.”
Faust’s Oct. 3 letter detailed nearly half a dozen reasons why she does not think divestment is appropriate, including concerns that it would politicize the University’s $33 billion endowment, distract from other sustainability efforts, appear hypocritical given the University’s dependence on oil, eliminate Harvard’s power as a voting shareholder, and hurt investment returns without significantly impacting oil companies.
McGinn wrote that, like Faust, he must consider his institution’s interest in people like pensioned city employees who protect those who rely on its investment. Still, he added that fossil fuel investments are likely to become increasingly risky and “have negative impacts for investors as well as society.”
Seattle, along with a handful of other major U.S. cities, has already stopped investing its pension funds in fossil fuel companies.
In addition to questioning Faust’s financial concerns, McGinn challenged her resolution to “favor engagement over withdrawal.”
“You argue that engagement with fossil fuel companies will yield greater benefits than divestment,” he wrote. “These companies, with their corrosive influence on politics, funding of climate-deniers, and abhorrent human rights records, will ‘engage’ on climate change, while continuing to extract fossil fuels that we cannot burn if we wish to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”
McGinn’s letter is not the only public response to engage the national media. The Nation, a liberal political magazine, published a blog post criticizing Faust’s claim that Harvard maintains political neutrality by not investing in fossil fuels.
“Faust absolutely took a side,” wrote author and activist Tim M. DeChristopher, who is a Harvard Divinity School student. “I strongly suspect that time will show that she chose the wrong side of history.”
The Nation also published an open letter to Faust from three members of Divest Harvard, a student group advocating for fossil fuel divestment.
Hannah M. Borowsky ’15, a Divest Harvard member who did not write the letter but serves as the group’s faculty outreach chair, said that public statements by prominent figures will advance the divestment movement.
“It was really exciting to read [McGinn’s] letter,” said Borowsky, who is also a Crimson editorial editor. “I think it’s really important that other leaders address Drew Faust’s statement.”
As their movement grows, activists point to the historical precedence of past divestment movements.
In his letter, McGinn referenced the 1990 announcement by former University President Derek C. Bok that the University would divest from tobacco companies.
“Harvard has done this before,” McGinn wrote.
Borowsky said that today’s divestment movement parallels those that preceded other decisions to divest, particularly the removal of funds from some companies that did business in apartheid South Africa.
“The apartheid divestment movement was huge,” Borowsky said. “It lasted for a decade.”
She added that today’s support for divestment from fossil fuels is growing even faster.
“I think it’s something that young people are really latching on to,” she said.

Two chaplains discussed the intersection between faith and relationships with audience members during a panel entitled “Love, Sex, and Faith” on Tuesday night.
The panel, which was sponsored by the Harvard Chaplains, was one event of many being held during Harvard’s annual Sex Week, a seven-day period during which various organizations host panels, lectures, events, and discussions pertaining to questions of sex and sexuality.
As the evening progressed, the event became more of an open conversation between audience members and the panel, which included Christopher D. Stedman, an assistant Humanist chaplain at Memorial Church, and Emily J. Garcia, a Kellogg Fellow at the Episcopal Chaplaincy at Harvard.
The conversation centered around the ways in which faith and relationships relate to each other in everyday life.
Meghan E. Magee ’15, an organizer of Harvard’s Sex Week, said that the discussion played into Sex Week’s larger goal of bringing topics of sex and sexuality to the forefront of college life.
“I think it is important to have safe spaces for conversations about sex, sexuality, and relationships whether they relate to faith or something else,” said Magee.
“I love that there is a week dedicated to education and dialogue about sexuality,” Stedman said. “I think this dialogue is very important because too often we avoid conversations about religion/non-religion, about sexuality, and about their intersections....There is a lot to gain by normalizing these conversations rather than allowing them to remain taboo.”
He added that part of his goal as a chaplain was to “help facilitate a space where students can ask questions, particularly difficult ones.”
Garcia said that she hoped to bring her unique experience as someone who has transitioned between faiths to the conversation.
“Belief in God has always been the first place from which I made my decisions,” she said. “The biggest change came when I converted from the Evangelical to the Episcopal Church, because my views of physical intimacy changed.”
Stedman echoed the importance of bringing a personal experience to the discussion of the issues of faith and relationships.
“As a humanist I try to approach all relationships with an understanding that every human being contains both amazing potential and real shortcomings, and I try to employ reason and compassion in equal measure in all of my relationships,” he said.
Both panelists said that they hoped that audience members could gain a new level of understanding from engaging in difficult, and sometimes uncomfortable, conversations.
“I hope people learn that this discussion of faith and relationships is a useful and interesting conversation to have with religious communities and friends,” Garcia said.
In general, panelists said that the importance of Sex Week and its role in campus life cannot be overlooked.
“Sex week is so valuable because it is essential that people are able to have open conversations about sexuality at all points of life, but perhaps especially in a college environment,” Stedman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton professor emeritus E. Perry Link ’66, who specializes in the history of China, visited a Harvard freshman seminar focused on Chinese rebellions Tuesday, where he spoke to students about the country’s history and politics.
The seminar, titled “Rebels with a Cause” and taught by Rowena X. He, focuses on the Beijing happenings of June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army of China opened fire against students protesting in Tiananmen Square and neighboring areas.
Link, who was living in Beijing at the time of the events, was banned from re-entering China in 1996 because of his critical stances toward the Communist Party. During the two-hour seminar, he responded to questions that students fielded about his thoughts on the Tiananmen incident, his visions regarding the future of China, and his experience being blacklisted.
Before the session, the students in the seminar read Link’s book “Evening Chats in Beijing,” published in 1993. The book explores modern Chinese society through the lens of everyday life in the nation.
In a room dusty with chalk, Link stood before a table of approximately 12 students, several from mainland China, in the second floor of Sever Hall. Professors from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Business School also attended the seminar, which meets once a week.
“The legitimacy of the [Communist] Party hit bottom with the Tiananmen massacre, when the PLA opened fire on the Chinese people,” Link said. “What can be more delegitimizing than that?”
Link proposed an interpretation of the subsequent history of China as a direct response of the Chinese Communist Party to those events in Tiananmen Square.
“What could the party do? Nationalism was one of the big answers. The other was money,” Link said. “Go for it, make money. Shut up about politics and religion.”
Recalling his experiences at Princeton after June 1989, Link discussed the political struggles that happened within the university itself. According to Link, Princeton received a large sum of money from an alumnus with the goal that it should be used to bring in political refugees from China.
“Princeton in the early 90s got a reputation for being a hotbed of counter-revolutionary activity,” Link said. “Some wealthy Princeton alums who worked at Morgan Stanley didn’t like this...They brought pressure on the administration to start doing more friendly things toward China.”
When asked by several students in the seminar about his personal hopes for the future of China, Link said that he would like to see the country democratize and that he is confident this might happen in the long run.
“If you want to see a Chinese version of democracy, it is a great thing to just look at Taiwan,” Link said. “I don't like an authoritarian government’s argument that you can’t bring democracy to a certain place because that place’s culture is different.”
Link concluded the session by remarking that being banned from China hurts him most because of the impact the blacklisting has had on fellow scholars in the field.
“It isn’t that bad to be on the blacklist. The most unpleasant part is that my example gets viewed with fear by other people in the field, and they self-censor,” Link said. “I am used by the Chinese government as their tool to inducing self-censorship in other scholars.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services has decided to stop serving Barilla pasta in Harvard dining halls after Barilla’s chairman Guido Barilla told an Italian radio station that his company would never feature a gay family in its advertising.
“Our family is a traditional family,” Barilla told the host. “I would not do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect toward homosexuals—who have the right to do whatever they want without disturbing others—but because I don’t agree with them and I think we want to talk to traditional families.”
Barilla also expressed indifference toward the effect of his remarks on gay consumers. “If gays like our pasta and our advertising, they will eat our pasta; if they don’t like that, they will eat someone else’s pasta,” he said.
The interview sparked a torrent of protest on social media and resulted in a flurry of online petitions urging consumers to boycott Barilla.
For HUDS, the decision to make the switch was an easy one. HUDS is now purchasing Ultragrain pasta instead of Barilla, the world’s leading pasta manufacturer.
“When the media shared the comments that were made, we felt like it was the right thing to do,” explained Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications. “We found out what pastas were available from our vendor, did a quick test to see what could be substituted, and made the switch.”
When HUDS decided to switch providers, Harvard community members had already begun to consider Barilla’s remarks.
Avik Chatterjee ’02, a BGLTQ tutor in Dunster House, read about the controversy one morning in the Huffington Post. Later that day, he noticed Barilla pasta in the dining hall.
“I mentioned it to some students in the house,” Chatterjee said. “Students did seem to think it wasn’t fair for Barilla pasta to be served in the dining halls. One student wanted to draft a letter to the [Queer Students and Allies] to talk about a meeting to discuss what could be done.”
A little over a week later, Chatterjee noticed that Barilla signage had disappeared from the dining hall. When he inquired about it, Dunster dining hall manager Maureen Russ told him that HUDS was finishing up what was left of Barilla and switching to a different brand.
“They knew about the news story. They got a directive from the head of HUDS saying they were going to change over,” said Chatterjee. “They also said they had not really heard much about it from students, which means that HUDS made the change independent of student pressure.”
Students expressed appreciation for the gesture, but noted that there is still much left to be done to achieve equality.
“Structural opposition to the representation of diverse sexualities in advertising is a problem,” said QSA cultural diversity chair Kirin Gupta ’16. “There are bigger problems, but I think HUDS’ decision is a powerful statement in solidarity with the LBGT community, which is wonderful.”
In a Facebook apology the day after the interview, Barilla said he respects gay marriage, but continued to defend his marketing strategy. “Barilla in its advertising has always chosen to represent the family because this is the symbol of hospitality and affection for everyone,” he wrote.
 Facing continuing criticism, Barilla released a video apology on the company website, pledging to meet with groups “that best represent the evolution of the family, including those who have been offended by my words.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wednesday’s launch of the Emily Dickinson Archive, a Harvard-led open-access website compiling hundreds of images of the poet’s surviving manuscripts, was supposed to be a celebration of successful scholarly collaboration. But a public dispute with Amherst College over control of and credit for the project has clouded the once-heralded launch.
The Boston Globe first reported on Sunday that Amherst officials are unhappy with the way the Harvard officials leading the archive proceeded with the project, which brings together hundreds of previously undigitized Dickinson poems from Harvard’s collection with more than 500 of Amherst’s already digitized Dickinson manuscripts.
Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning wrote in an email Tuesday that the project was collaborative.
“Harvard made it a point to reach out to all of these institutions and organizations, including Amherst College, in an effort to bring together manuscripts from multiple libraries and archives, which makes this new site a powerful tool for students, scholars and readers,” he wrote. 
Yet when reached by phone Tuesday, involved officials said that the project, which also engaged a handful of other collaborators in the region and across the country, has been riddled with disagreements since even before its inception.
For half a century, Harvard and Amherst have disagreed about whether Amherst is the legitimate owner of some of its 850 Dickinson manuscripts.
And in Fall 2011, when Harvard approached Amherst about contributing its collections to a planned Harvard digital archive, a new dispute ensued—this time over whether the digital archive should be open-access. According to Michael Kelly, Head of Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College, Harvard had initially envisioned a subscription site in which scholars would be required to pay to view Dickinson’s manuscripts, but Amherst would not agree to contribute its documents unless the digital archive was fully accessible to the public.
“Our initial objection was that we would be happy to collaborate with Harvard on a digital Dickinson project, but only if it was completely free and open-access,” Kelly said. “But they had to wait until they got some funding for the project.” 
As the project progressed, involved officials said, Harvard sometimes proved to be unwilling to cede control of the project to Amherst or bend to the suggestions of the archive’s advisory board.
According to Kelly, the two colleges also disagreed about what types of Dickinson manuscripts warranted inclusion in the archive. While Harvard officials wanted to include only full poems in the archive, Amherst hoped to include manuscripts ranging from lengthy poems to scraps of Dickinson’s notes. While a compromise was reached—the archive will for now include just poems and later include other manuscripts—Kelly said he believes this staggering to be “an unnecessary limitation.”
Kelly also said Amherst officials “didn’t have much input” in the design of the site.
“It was not a full collaboration,” Kelly said. “We gave them our manuscripts, and they put them up in the way that they had already decided to put them up.”
According to Martha Nell Smith, a University of Maryland professor who helped advise the project, Harvard decided against the advisory board’s urging to encode a collection of all versions of Dickinson’s known poetry into the site, as opposed to just encoding the original manuscripts. 
“That’s the only time I can remember them basically saying, ‘No, we’re not going to take your advice,’ and that’s their prerogative,” said Smith, who added that she believes Harvard considered everything the advisory board suggested. 
Smith also confirmed that at least one member of the advisory board resigned, though she declined to comment on the reason.
Leslie A. Morris, a Harvard librarian in charge of the project who also convened the advisory board, declined to elaborate on Manning’s comment on the dispute.
Elisa New, a Harvard English professor who is not involved in the archive, said that based on her limited knowledge of the dispute, she senses that the tensions are “about credit and attribution.”
“I doubt, myself, that Harvard meant to disrespect Amherst, but I’m not a party to this,” New said.
Despite the recent strife, scholars from both Amherst and Harvard alike expressed optimism about the archive’s launch.
“I myself feel incredibly happy that this level of openness is where we’ve gotten to,” New said. “If we can provide digital access to scholars and learners all over the world, I am delighted that we can do that.” 
For his part, Kelly found a silver lining in the dispute.
“Dickinson always generates interest and controversy, and as usual, it’s generally blown out of proportion,” Kelly said. “If this makes people pay more attention to Dickinson, and if this little bit of controversy makes people look at this Harvard Dickinson website who may not have done so before, that’s only a good thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in program history, the Harvard men’s cross country team has earned a top-30 ranking in the USTFCCCA NCAA Division I coaches’ poll. The Crimson is coming off perhaps its best showing of the season at the elite Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, where the squad took 13th place (out of 35) in a competition of the nation’s best teams. The performance earned Harvard the No. 21 spot in the national rankings.
“It’s a good testament to the hard work and dedication that our student-athletes have put into their training and preparation,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “I know how much thought goes into the rankings, since I used to do them.”
The USTFCCCA coaches’ poll began in 1998. Harvard’s best-ever finish at the NCAA Championships came in 1968, when the squad took ninth place. Though a few individuals on the men’s team have qualified for nationals in recent years, including current co-captains Maksim Korolev and James Leakos, the Crimson men’s team has not earned a bid since 1979.
The Harvard women’s team qualified for the national championships last season, and just missed out on a spot in the top 30 of the coaches’ poll. The Crimson received 15 votes, two shy of the 17 votes that were awarded to 30th-place Mississippi.
In two weeks, Harvard will compete at Princeton in the most important meet of its season, the Heptagonal Championships. Columbia and Princeton, ranked 10th and 15th, respectively in the most recent poll, are expected to duke it out with the Crimson for the men’s title, while 11th-ranked Dartmouth is the favorite on the women’s side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team posted a strong showing against its Ivy League rivals as it continued its fall season at the ITA Northeast Regional in New Haven.
The tournament, which was held Oct. 17-22 at Yale’s Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center, featured representatives from all eight Ivy programs, as well as other northeastern schools, in both singles and doubles draws.
At the ITA Northeast Regional, the Crimson got another look at its Ivy opponents, whom it first faced at the Ivy Plus Invitational in September.
In September, Harvard had several players win their respective singles and doubles flights. This time, the Crimson had some successes, but was also reminded that there is a lot of work to do before the spring season rolls around.
“[The tournament] was very encouraging, and also very sobering,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “The encouraging part is that we know we have guys who can compete with everyone. But our lower level [players are] not consistent enough. All of the guys can hit great shots, but our job as coaches will be to improve our performance and make it more consistent.”
Junior Denis Nguyen, who was seeded second in the tournament, performed strongly in making it all the way to the finals, but lost to Columbia’s Winston Lin, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1. Lin was the first seed in the tournament, and entered the season ranked 54th nationally in singles.
“Denis played a terrific match,” Fish said.  “It was the first time that anybody came close to Lin this week. He was just cruising through all his other matches. So it was definitely some good tennis, and Denis went down fighting.”
Other Crimson players also had success in singles at the tournament, as six Harvard players advanced to the round of 16. Freshman Andrew Ball, who had to qualify for the tournament, then beat players from St. John’s, Penn, and Dartmouth to advance to the round of 16.
There, he faced classmate Sebastian Beltrame, whom he took down, 6-1, 6-0, to advance to the quarterfinals. But Ball lost to Cornell’s Sam Fleck in the quarters.
Overall, the Crimson freshmen had a very strong tournament, including freshman Brian Yeung, who had a 2-1 record, and lost in three sets to the Lions’ Dragos Ignat in the fourth round.
“Having three freshmen make the round of 16 was really impressive,” junior Alex Steinroeder said. “They’ve been doing a great job so far.”
In other singles action, sophomore Nicky Hu made it to the third round before losing to the Big Red’s Chris Vrabel, 6-3, 7-5. Juniors Shaun Chaudhuri and Steinroeder both made it to the round of 16 before falling to opponents from Cornell and Dartmouth, respectively.
In doubles, Harvard also placed two teams into the quarterfinal round. The tandem of Nguyen and senior co-captain Casey MacMaster, ranked 20th in the nation and seeded second in the tournament, rolled into the quarterfinal round, but were upset by the Big Green’s Cameron Ghorbani and Brendan Tannenbaum.
But the pleasant surprise of the tournament came from the new duo of Hu and Yeung, who advanced all the way to the semifinals. The team cruised past a Bulldog duo and a team from Marist College before meeting the No. 1 seed—Columbia’s Max Schnur and Ashok Narayana. Hu and Yeung soundly defeated them, 8-2, before losing to a Big Red team in the quarters.
Steinroeder and sophomore Kelvin Lam, last year’s No. 3 team, beat a St. Bonaventure squad before losing to Cornell’s Quoc-Daniel Nguyen and Jason Luu, 8-4.
The Crimson was satisfied with its performance, but will still tinker with its doubles pairings before the spring season.
“Brian and Nicky Hu played well, and Casey and Denis are established,” Fish said. “We’ll continue to be open to how to put together the next teams after that…. We don’t want to finalize it yet, but will keep doing work and see what gives us the potential to be as strong in doubles as we were last year.”
The tournament also exposed how strong the Ivy League is this season and the challenge Harvard will face in trying to capture its third-straight crown.
“Our guys are all so close and playing great tennis, but there are no illusions about how strong our league is,” Fish said. “It’s a dose of reality to see how good some other teams are getting. That’s a really important motivator for our team…Our guys will have to continue to want to meet a challenge every day.”

With over 100 competitors playing at the Murr Center this weekend, two Harvard rookies impressed with strong performances as the women’s tennis team had seven players compete in the USTA/ITA Northeast Regional Championships that were held at Harvard from Oct. 17-22.
Strong performances from freshmen Monica Lin and Spencer Liang, as well as from sophomore Amy He led the Crimson squad, but the weekend would belong to Columbia, as Lions’ players won both the singles and doubles tournament.
Monica Lin had the most impressive performance of the weekend for Harvard, entering the tournament as the 17th seed in the singles tournament before making it to the quarterfinals. Lin started her tournament play by beating sophomore Sarah Bowen of Hofstra in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1.
In the next round, Lin faced the tournament’s ninth seed in Brown sophomore Hannah Camhi. A back-and-forth first set wound up going to a tiebreaker, but from that point on, it would be all Lin. The freshman rolled off seven straight points to win the tiebreaker before winning the second set in convincing fashion, 6-3.
The biggest win of the weekend for any Crimson player came next as Lin beat Boston University sophomore Lauren Davis, the fifth seed, in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. The Harvard freshman then played a close match against conference opponent and fellow freshman Jacqueline Crawford of Dartmouth, falling 7-6 (3), 6-4.
“I think Monica did really well making it into the quarterfinals this weekend,” Liang said. “We are all very proud of the way she came out and fought this weekend.”
Not to be outdone, Liang and He played their way to the round of sixteen in the singles draw and made it to the quarterfinals of the doubles draw.  In the singles tournament, Liang defeated St. John’s freshman Anna Morozova by a score of 6-1, 6-0 after a first-round bye.
Liang then made quick work of senior Ryann Young of Cornell with a 6-2, 6-3 win. In the next round, higher-seeded Yale junior Annie Sullivan proved too much for the Harvard freshman, as she beat Liang in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.
He started singles play with a three-set win over Penn freshman Luba Vazhenina, 6-1, 2-6, 6-2. In the next round, He faced higher-seeded senior Vanessa Petrini of Rutgers, but came away victorious by a score of 6-4, 7-5.
The next round brought another higher-seeded senior for He to face, but this time it was the overall No. 2 seed. Bianca Sanon of Columbia. Sanon showed why she was a top seed, winning in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, over the Crimson sophomore.
On the doubles side, Liang and He entered the tournament as the 11th seed and barely escaped a first round upset at the hands of the St. John’s pairing of Morozova and senior Yanita Arnaudova, winning 8-7 on a tiebreaker.
After the early scare, He and Liang showed why they were the 11th seed, taking care of business against sophomores Gina Li and Mariam Zein of Rutgers by a score of 8-4.  The pair from Harvard then faced the eighth-seeded Yale tandem of sophomore Ree Ree Li and freshman Sherry Li, and knocked off the rival Bulldogs, 8-3.
“The match against Yale was very special,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “It is always very exciting to play one of our Ivy rivals. Spencer and Amy fought tooth and nail and really played a solid match from start to finish.”
The quarterfinals brought with it an even bigger challenge for He and Liang, as they played Sanon and sophomore Kanika Vaidya from Columbia, the top seed of the doubles tournament. The Lions’ pair went on to win by a tally of 8-3 to advance to the semifinals.
In a dominating weekend for Columbia, Vaidya and Sanon played teammates Tina Jiang and Crystal Leung in the doubles final, falling 8-7. This would not be the only trip to the finals for Vaidya and Sanon however, as the doubles partners wound up playing each other for the singles title with Vaidya winning 7-6, 7-6.
Though the Crimson had nowhere near the success of the Lions this past weekend, Harvard, a team with only two upperclassman on the roster, certainly showed glimpses of a bright future at the USTA/ITA Regional Championships.
“Overall, the team competed very hard at regionals,” Green said. “It was a very tough tournament, and a very strong tournament, and I feel that we played really well using the momentum from our tournament in New York last weekend and are showing a lot of improvement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stage was set Tuesday night at the Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium for a game of international merit, as the Harvard men’s lacrosse team took on Team England for a fall exhibition game.
England entered the contest ranked fifth in the world, according to the Federation of International Lacrosse, but the Crimson did not let that intimidate its play. Harvard was able to put the English national team away handily, picking up a 19-6 victory.
The Crimson was in control from the start of the game, as it surged ahead to a 6-2 lead at the end of the first quarter, with England’s two goals coming off of Harvard’s missed coverage. By halftime, England trailed by double digits, as the Crimson took a 14-3 lead just seconds before the break on a goal by senior attacker Carl Zimmerman, which he scored while falling to the ground.
“We jumped out really early, and got a big lead on them,” senior co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “We could have gotten less competitive at that point and pulled off a little bit, but we kept scoring goals and made sure we played four complete quarters.”
The Crimson dominated possession throughout the game, which kept England from running an effective offense.
“We did really well at face-offs today…and had a ton of offensive possessions,” Petrucci said. “Team England really didn’t have the ball for very long, which took a lot of pressure off of our defense.”
After a weekend in which Harvard split a pair of fall ball games against Army and St. John’s, the team was able to focus on bouncing back this week against a competitive English team.
“Those scrimmages saw some good [things], but there were a lot of things that we needed to improve on,” freshman midfielder Austin Williams said. “I think we saw that improvement today. We need to remember who we are, and what our strengths are as we continue with the rest of our season and into the spring.”
Transitioning from playing collegiate opponents to an international challenge against Team England brought a different level of competition to the Crimson that was welcome after last week’s exhibition game.
“Their style of play is a little different in the way they dodge, and the way they like to move the ball around,” Williams said. “It’s still lacrosse, but it’s the English style, I guess. It’s a great feeling to be able to win against an international team.”
Above all, competing with the best in the world has given Harvard a step in the right direction toward the ultimate goal of a successful spring season.
“We are going to continue to work hard and improve both individually and collectively as a team all winter, and make sure we keep the progress this fall going,” Petrucci said.  “England is a very gritty and hard-nosed team, but at the end of the day we outmatched them in skill and athleticism.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard men’s soccer team kept Boston College off the board for more than half of the game, the Crimson defense was ultimately its own worst enemy.
Harvard (3-7-2, 2-1 Ivy) fell to the Eagles (6-5-2, 3-4-1 ACC) at Newton Campus Lacrosse and Soccer Field Tuesday afternoon, in a tight game that was ultimately decided by a Crimson own goal.
In the 74th minute, co-captain goalkeeper Brett Conrad failed to adjust after coming out of the goal to defend and let the ball roll into the net, making the final score 3-2 in favor of Boston College.
“In the second half, I thought I should have done a better job with focusing the team,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We were focusing on really competing from the beginning right through to the end [of the game], but [the second half] didn’t have the same quality that we’ve had throughout the year.”
Late in the first half, Harvard found itself with a comfortable, 2-0 lead over the Eagles with back-to-back set piece goals within two minutes of each other.
Junior midfielder David Barna managed to find the back of the net after a throw-in was headed into the box by senior Kevin Harrington.
Less than two minutes later in the 34th minute, sophomore midfielder Michael Klain found junior defender Tyler Evans, who fired it off a Boston College defender to extend the Crimson’s lead to 2-0.
“I thought we came out with a good mentality today,” senior defender Ross Friedman said. “In the first half, we were pretty dangerous for the other team and really finished the chances we had.”
While Boston College attempted seven shots in the first half, none of them made it to the back of the net. However, the Eagles converted three of four shot attempts in the second half.
“We really tried to emphasize composure after the first half, since we were up, 2-0,” freshman forward Ashi Geberkidane said. “We all played really well, but there were some silly mistakes, and we paid dearly for them.”
Geberkidane was injured in the first five minutes of the second half, and Harvard was forced to rearrange its lineup to make up for the loss of the rookie standout. Geberkidane was recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Week and has scored three goals in his first collegiate season.
Boston College also refocused its game after halftime.
“[The Eagles] made changes in the game that were trying to throw us off in the second half,” Friedman said. “They brought a different energy than what we saw in the first half, and made some substitutions to bring in stronger players. Part of what they were trying to do was to make sure we weren’t tracking their passes and getting a hold of the ball.”
In the 55th minute, Boston College’s junior midfielder Brendan Hayes took advantage of a cross from sophomore midfielder Derrick Boateng to put the Eagles on the scoreboard.
Hayes scored again after a run on the left side by freshman Zeiko Lewis—three minutes before Harvard’s own goal—to tie the game at 2-2.
“They scored all of their goals on transition where we would get caught up higher when we moved the ball, and they were very fast up top,” Friedman said. “This is something that we analyzed once the game was over, in terms of what we did well and what we didn’t do well. If they’re only scoring one way, then it’s easily fixable and we can identify that.”
Both Boston College goals came from fast breaks up the left side, with Harvard unable to catch up.
“Generally, our problem was a player being open during transitions,” Lehrer said. “We’re at a good place as far as the mentality and work, but I think we just haven’t put that last part together in the last half.”
Despite multiple attempts to bring the ball back to Boston College’s side of the field in the last 15 minutes, only one of these attempts actually resulted in a shot on goal. Freshman midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu’s shot was saved by Eagles’ sophomore goalie Alex Kapp, his only save of the game. Conrad totaled two saves on the Crimson side.
“This team doesn’t constantly get results yet, but they always make improvements and have a great attitude,” Lehrer said. “If we can make that jump, we would be a much more dynamic team, and can compete with the better teams in the conference and in the country.”

Don't worry Harvard Law Class of 2014, there's still hope that you can take that non-profit or government job after all.
Even with those law school loans piling up, you may not have to sell your soul to the giant law firms—just your Hot Wheels collection. Just like this student, who is apparently trying to sell 240 die cast cars from his childhood on eBay in order to pay off the debts from his legal education, you, too, can find a way to make it work.
So, HLS students, if that $52,350 price tag is getting you down and you want to take that $42,424 salary public interest job instead of the law firm position that pays four times as much, don't worry. All you'll have to do is sell your childhood memories.

We all know—some of us a little too proudly—that Harvard ranks among the best colleges for just about everything, minus HUDS tater tots. Recently, Harvard was on top as #1 yet again—this time, in  an online ranking of the top 100 social media colleges.
This comes at little surprise, given that Harvard is the birthplace of Facebook and awkward social norms. But what exactly do these rankings mean?
The site doing the ranking, Student Advisor, claims that “these innovative schools use social media to give students insight into their culture, personality and DNA.” Um, ok. I didn’t really know that Facebook had gene testing, but as long as we’re first, I guess I have no problem with it.
A look through the other schools that rank among the top ten shows that the survey seems really to be based on the connectivity of students and the prevalence of official university accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.
Stanford is a close second due to the fact that it “uses social media data to study tourism rates of the world’s natural areas,” which is great for everyone who happens to be looking into visiting rural Palo Alto.
And Yale broke into the top five due to their new Tumblr blog and ramp-up of Facebook and Twitter, most likely due to an overly-defensive PR strategy in the aftermath of the actions of a certain famed feces-spreader (and no, it wasn't their bulldog).
But did we deserve to win? In my opinion, certainly. I don’t visit the Class of 2017 Facebook group often, but when I do, I see posts about lost phones, half-brags about trips to Djibouti, and wars with MIT. The fact that we even have the term “Facebook celebrities” is indicative of the honor, however dubious, we place on those who have established themselves online. At other places, like my high school, these people would be called “weird”. Kudos to you, Harvard.
So tweet on, my classmates, and I’ll see you online sometime.
Five nights a week, college campuses are largely silent. Between homework and extracurricular commitments, there’s barely enough time for sleep—let alone for socializing. But when the clock strikes 10 on Friday night, the week's cares and worries seem to dissolve into the contents of Solo cups as students everywhere prepare for some much-needed relief.
Heels are donned. Flasks are filled. Urgent texts fly from room to room in an attempt to ascertain the “best” destinations of the night. Freshman males wait wistfully at the entrances of certain fraternities.
For better or for worse, dreary campuses come alive on nights like these. The studious atmosphere maintained throughout the week is temporarily exchanged for the bustling sights and sounds of pounding music and open bars.
“At the end of the week after all the craziness, people definitely need some kind of release to not be in their rooms studying again, alone by themselves. And I also think that it’s a good chance to see people that you might not be able to see a lot during the week.” says Bianca M. Nfonoyim, a junior at Harvard University.
The anticipation, though exhilarating, can often bring disappointment."People go [out] to get drunk...as a stress reliever from the whole week, I guess,” says Kimberly I. Scoppetta, a sophomore at Tufts University.
Although many students party exclusively for enjoyment or to relieve stress, others feel compelled to fulfill a stereotype of college life.
“The social life at Georgetown has a heavy influence on drinking, with many students embodying the ‘play hard, work hard’ attitude that our school likes to think it's known for. Most freshmen roam the streets of Georgetown searching for pity from upperclassmen in the form of liquor,” says Sarah N. Williams, a freshman at Georgetown University.
Some students feel that parties are the only social activity present on campus. “Unless you’re a partier and a drinker, there isn’t much for you to do,” notes Scoppetta of Tufts.
Parties may be the among the most visible forms of recreation, but they are by no means the only way to engage with the social side of college life.
“Students can also go to shows and performances. They show movies during the weekends and there’s usually some kind of musical group or performer that comes during the weekend,” says Nancy L. Wu, a sophomore at Dartmouth University.
