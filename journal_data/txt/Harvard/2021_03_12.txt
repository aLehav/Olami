After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard envisions its proposed Enterprise Research Campus in Allston as a global hub for innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship: The same principles must guide all stages of its development. As Harvard designs this new campus, it is sketching the blueprints for what environmentally sustainable, equitable development can look like in the 21st century.
Even though we could use Harvard’s help better understanding what purpose the ECR will fill in the context of the greater University (without using words that end in “-ation”), we do know quite a lot about the ERC’s development plan: According to the publicized plans, the ERC would stretch six acres and include a hotel, conference center, and two acres of green space.
Harvard’s chosen developer, Tishman Speyer, affirmed that sustainability will be at the heart of the project — the company shares Harvard’s goal to be fossil-fuel-free by 2050 and says it will design the ERC’s layout to maximize energy efficiency. Tishman Speyer has also committed to maintaining diversity and inclusion at all stages of development, referencing the intention to create opportunities for minority investors and reserve or subsidize a portion of the site’s retail for small, local, and/or minority-and-women-owned businesses.
Just a few years ago, plans prioritizing these aims might have seemed far-fetched or futuristic. Now, in an age of heightened awareness surrounding the persistent realities of racial injustice, neighborhood gentrification, gender disparities, and climate change, plans with this level of attentiveness are the only appropriate path.
While we are generally cautious of Harvard expanding into new neighborhoods, we cannot overlook the fact that University already owns this land, and developing it thoughtfully as opposed to just sitting on it will generate more tax revenue for local governments and more opportunities for Allston residents. In the spirit of innovation, we see this research campus as hopefully setting a precedent for what responsible development can look like.
We're excited by the prospect of green space, given its well-proven benefits for mental and physical health, carbon capture, and climate change mitigation. We hope such space is maximized: In short, more trees make us more pleased.
While we believe that the guiding principles of affordability and accessibility in the development plans seem admirable, along with local residents, we too would like more specifics on their implementation: Tishman Speyer promises that the campus will exceed the requirement that 13 percent of housing units meet an affordability standard — but by how much?
Having become all too acquainted with the perils of separation this past year, we love the idea of a new space designed for community engagement — but everyone must be able to access it. We echo the calls of community members for the ECR to be unequivocally safe and accessible for all residents, irrespective of age, income level, or disability.
Moving forward, community engagement will continue to be integral at every step of development. The more diverse and representative the voices collaborating to shape this development’s future, the more confident we can be that the ERC will meet the aspirations set for it, leaving no person or group behind.
Lastly, perhaps most notably absent from the development plans thus far and where we see the greatest room for progress is Harvard’s acknowledgment of the Indigenous land on which the buildings will be housed. Land acknowledgments should be more of a common practice at Harvard and are one of several crucial ways that the University can recognize the legacy of settler colonialism and express gratitude for the Indigenous people who have stewarded the land for hundreds of generations. This development is an opportunity to pave the way for Harvard’s campus, in general, to be more aware of the original inhabitants and caretakers of the University’s land. Going forward, new developments should be made in consultation with nearby Indigenous populations, whom the University should treat as an integral stakeholder.
Overall, Tishman Speyer’s statements and layouts are promising indicators of a thoughtful, progressive approach to the development’s design. Of course, the project’s auspicious start should breed ambition, rather than complacency. It is critical that the ERC’s planners do not stay satisfied with its early attempts at ethical stewardship, and rather continue to leave no stone unturned in making sure that this development will serve all members of the community.
New developments ought to groundbreaking — both literally and figuratively. This means that all decisions must be filtered through the lenses of equity and environmental sustainability. We are excited to see Harvard prioritizing this approach with the new campus, but will be holding our breath until these promises are made concrete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The typical admonishment from almost every elder to his 18-year-old college grandchild is the same: “Take advantage of these four years; it’s the last time you’ll be free to pursue what you love.” Yet at Harvard, students are severely limited in their ability to do just that.
For many Harvard students, four years pass without ever being able to experiment with something new, potentially missing the opportunity to find a lifelong passion. From poetry to painting to creative writing to cooking to public speaking, students are itching to explore new terrains, without the grades, competitiveness, and narrow curricular scope of the Harvard classroom.
For centuries, Harvard has viewed its highly structured and rigorous courses as the primary stage for instruction and learning. Yet for many students, this system leaves much to be desired.
Many classes — either because they require sleepless nights of studying, turn out to be duds halfway through the semester, or are simply required courses that are unappealing to students in the first place — just don’t give students a feeling of deep fulfillment and joy. Of course, college isn’t supposed to be all fun and games. But to supplement the rigor and pain of the classroom, Harvard needs to help students pursue their passions outside of it.
So what should be done?
A potential solution could center on low-stakes workshops and discussions catered to various broad subject areas, such as music, photography, and cooking: an instructor and perhaps a dozen students meeting once a week in the evening to learn and explore.
Literally hundreds of thousands of Harvard alumni with countless unique skills could contribute as instructors. Professors with expertise in arenas sometimes far from their focus of research could also offer to teach. To give just one example, Comparative Literature professor John T. Hamilton was a rock music star before entering academia.
That is nothing to say of the wealth of talent on Harvard’s campus beyond just among faculty members. Might dining hall managers and chefs, many of whom have extensive backgrounds in the food industry, be willing to hold cooking workshops for students, and be compensated accordingly?
And if skills in certain areas of interest can’t be found among those already in Harvard’s orbit, the College could contract with experts in the Boston area to hold campus workshops.
The atmosphere of these workshops and discussions would be completely different from a typical Harvard class. Every student would be there for the sake of learning, not for grades or pre-med requirements.
The proposal would help bring about a fundamental shift at the College: Skills developed outside of the classroom would begin to be seen as equally important as those developed inside.
On top of helping students explore new pursuits, it would give them the opportunity to interact with these world-class professors, globe-trotting alumni, and talented staff members in a more relaxed and informal setting, fostering conversation and most importantly, a sense of fulfillment for both parties.
Currently, enrollment in art and photography classes at the College is usually capped at just 10 to 15 students, and many require an application to weed out beginners. For students concerned about their GPA, perhaps for a future graduate school application, taking one of these classes out of purely intellectual interest can seem risky.
And for those just looking for a taste of a subject, most of these art and visual studies courses are just too narrowly focused and have overly burdensome workloads. In contrast, low-stakes workshops and discussions could have broader and potentially even fluid parameters of exploration.
There may already be models on campus for this proposal. Prior to the pandemic, multiple Houses regularly held workshops for students, whether woodworking classes in Mather House, wine tasting in Winthrop, or pottery in Cabot.
Yet these programs are either not available to the wider student body or are prohibitively expensive (up to $100 for Mather’s class).
The College's lack of focus on helping students find new hobbies and talents stands in stark contrast to its boundless professional programming. For those who want to learn how to conduct themselves in a job interview, the Office of Career Services has countless resources and appointment slots, pretty much anything one could hope for.
Yet when it comes to an institutionalized system for learning outside of the classroom, the College is currently nowhere to be found. Well, what are they waiting for?

The typical law school class begins with the professor asking, “What are the facts of the case?” Professors require us to include specific citations in our papers — down to the precise paragraph. In law journals, we spend hours verifying footnotes and locating the most authoritative sources. We are trained to scrutinize facts, to avoid overclaiming, and to call out lazy academic work when we see it.
Having internalized these lessons for three years, we were shocked to read an article titled “Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War,” released by one of our very own professors. In the article, Harvard Law School Japanese legal studies professor Mark J. Ramseyer writes about so-called “comfort women”: civilians who were forcibly mobilized into “comfort stations” of the Japanese imperial military to perform sexual services for soldiers under conditions akin to sexual slavery. He claims that the “contracts” between comfort women and comfort stations reflect “straightforward game theoretic logic,” a premise refuted by leading economists. From this, he concludes that comfort women were effectively consenting “prostitutes.” Referring to one Japanese “prostitute” in particular, he goes so far as to say that “even at age 10, she knew what the job entailed.”
The article elicited sharp criticism from scholars, activists, politicians, and students alike. The response made resoundingly clear what the peer-reviewed journal failed to address: Professor Ramseyer’s contractual theory operates in a vacuum, with no acknowledgment of the reality faced by impoverished young women who were colonial subjects. The article disregards facts established by survivor testimonies, investigations by international organizations, and decades of academic literature while relying on questionable and misleading citations. These supposed “contracts” would be void for reasons of legal incapacity, duress, fraud, or unconscionability.
We, too, could not sit idly by, especially given the deafening silence from an institution whose motto is “Veritas” — truth. We felt compelled to combat the neo-nationalist discourse that inappropriately frames this issue as a diplomatic dispute. To ensure the care and thoroughness that this issue deserves, we spoke to scholars and practitioners within the University and beyond — historians, law and economics professors, and feminist scholars. We also reached out to Ramseyer to verify his citations and underlying sources. Unfortunately, none of the documents we received from him alleviated our concerns regarding the article’s failure to meet basic standards of academic integrity.
Comfort stations were far from, as the article claims, the “military analogue to the private brothels in Japan and Korea.” For one, many girls were forcibly mobilized through deception or abduction — practices that were illegal then under customary international law as they are now. And unlike Ramseyer’s suggestion that the military was uninvolved with this coercive mobilization, the Japanese government has recognized in the historic Kono Statement that its military was involved in the transport of women and the establishment of these stations.
These women also faced grotesque physical and sexual violence — something the article entirely fails to mention. Some were forced to have sex with 60 to 70 men per day. They suffered burns, bruises, bayonet stabs, and broken bones. Escape was not a realistic option. They were closely surveilled and had nowhere else to go in overseas combat zones. Based on remaining official records not destroyed by the Japanese government — plus testimonies by survivors from Korea, China, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and other countries formerly under Japanese occupation — the United Nations categorized the operation as a crime against humanity.
Ramseyer neither addresses these established findings nor engages with the abundant scholarship in this field. He says he is unable to speak or read Korean. For interested English-speaking readers, we encourage you to read collections of testimonies and the comprehensive compilation of resources by concerned economists.
In addition to glaring analytical and factual deficiencies, the article suffers from major methodological flaws. To begin with, the citations fail to support the argument. While Ramseyer freely refers to “the contracts used by the comfort stations themselves,” he fails to present even one such “sample” contract involving Korean women.
In other instances in the article, he relies on unverified sources to support spurious conclusions. A subsection misleadingly titled “prostitute savings'' ends with a block quote from the memoirs of a survivor, Mun Ok-ju, to imply that comfort women were able to amass enough money to live “flamboyantly.” Even putting aside the problem with directly lifting an English translation of unknown origin, the citation directs readers to a blog post that is curiously attributed to the “Korea Institute of History,” an entity that only seems to exist as an email address: asdfgh34567@gmail.com. Properly researching Ms. Moon’s story would have alerted Professor Ramseyer to the fact that she never received the tips she deposited and a subsequent lawsuit to recover her and other survivors’ savings was dismissed.
In discussing the public outcry against the article, Lee Yong-soo, a survivor and activist, said that the article is a “blessing in disguise” for creating the opportunity to rebut pernicious denialism. It is crucial not only to have credible, trustworthy sources of information but also to challenge falsehoods that hide behind a facade of credibility. Even as its publication has been delayed for further investigation, the article has received support from those who deny the experiences of comfort women. Academic freedom comes with responsibility and professionalism, especially for those who have the weight of authority as a professor at Harvard Law School.
As students, we expect our professors to do better.

Public health and disinformation experts offered reasons for and solutions to a surge in vaccine hesitancy and health misinformation in society at a Harvard School of Public Health virtual event Thursday.
The event, which is part of HSPH’s Public Health Storyteller series, was moderated by Nat Gyenes, the founding director of Meedan’s Digital Health Lab, a research group focusing on access to healthcare information. Gyenes posed questions to Heidi J. Larson ’79, an anthropology and decision science professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, HSPH professors Marcia C. Castro and Kasisomayajula “Vish” Viswanath, and Joan M. Donovan, the research director at the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.
In her opening, Gyenes said it is important to reduce stigma in conversations about health misinformation.
“We’ve all heard health misinformation or vaccine rumors referred to as outlandish, but we really want to start by phrasing that it isn’t an ‘us and them’ issue — it’s something that affects everyone,” Gyenes said.
Larson, who authored a 2020 book on the surge of vaccine hesitancy in society, attributed a spike in debates over vaccine safety to increased access to information as well as the growing number of available vaccines for different conditions.
She urged people who support vaccines to listen to and respect individuals who hold a different viewpoint.
“They may be saying something you totally disagree with, but I think it’s really important to listen to people’s concerns,” Larson said. “The conversation has become so polarized that it’s not helpful.”
Larson expressed her distaste for policies aimed at “preventing hesitancy” over the Covid-19 vaccines, saying she believes some hesitancy is a “responsible” reaction to a new medical treatment.
Speakers at the event also discussed the source of reservations about the coronavirus vaccines.
Castro, an HSPH professor who co-directs the Brazil Studies program at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, said vaccine misinformation in Brazil spreads rapidly on the popular messaging app WhatsApp because of the difficulty of fact-checking messages.
Larson and Viswanath, the other HSPH professor at the event, raised concerns that Black people have historically faced and continue to face day-to-day structural racism in the healthcare system, eroding trust in the Covid-19 vaccine.
Viswanath said health care providers should work to increase access to the vaccine among minority groups that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus.
“It is a system's failure that we have not provided the access that is absolutely necessary,” Viswanath said.
Donovan, Shorenstein Center's research director, said social networking sites should be subject to public interest obligations to help combat misinformation, just as radio stations are required to occasionally report on local matters including the weather.
“They don’t want to do that. We had to make a law for that, and we got to make some regulations that encourage those kinds of public interest obligations in our timelines and social media feeds,” Donovan said.
Combating health misinformation, Gyenes said, requires activism across different fields. To that end, she highlighted the diverse academic backgrounds of the panelists.
“We have a demographer, an anthropologist and disinformation researcher, a communications researcher in this conversation,” Gyenes said. “Hopefully we can build off of one another and we can really try to strengthen and improve our responses to health information and equity.”

Some cancers may originate from a harmful mutation several decades before a diagnosis is made, with the cancerous cells multiplying in number over the years without the patient’s knowledge, a new study published this month by Harvard researchers suggests.
Researchers at Harvard University, Boston Children’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the European Bioinformatics Institute studied the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, a type of blood cancer or leukemia caused by a single change in a DNA nucleotide, one of the building blocks of DNA.
The peer-reviewed study — published March 4 in Cell Stem Cell — suggests that cancer development is more gradual than scientists had expected. Utilizing cutting-edge techniques, the researchers calculated that the MPN mutation first occurred at around age nine in a 34-year-old cancer patient and age 19 in a 63-year-old patient. Thus, what doctors had previously believed to be adult leukemia was, in fact, childhood cancer.
Sahand Hormoz, the corresponding author of the paper and an assistant professor of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School, said traditional diagnostic techniques for cancer do not detect these mutations early enough.
“For the first 10, 15 years, the number of cancer cells [are] very small, on the order of 10 to 100 cells out of 100,000 stem cells,” Hormoz said. “Certainly, none of our routine diagnostic tests would have picked that up.”
Doctors typically do not administer most diagnostic tests for cancer until symptoms, such as fatigue or pain, develop. Mammograms, pap smears, and colonoscopies in routine checkups may find cancer before an individual begins to feel ill, but at that point, the cancer may have been developing for years, according to Hormoz.
“For a while now, the scientific community has qualitatively understood that certain cancers could form in the human body long before the cancer manifests itself as a tangible disease, potentially years in advance,” Maximilian Nguyen, a graduate student at Princeton and a member of the research team, wrote in an emailed statement. “But up until now, we have not had access to the technology and methods that could put an actual number on it.”
Using a new technique, the team of researchers traced the lineage history of cancerous cells, much like comparing related species, such as humans and chimpanzees, to find a common ancestor. Coupled with information regarding the cancer’s replication rate, the scientists determined the age at which the mutation manifested.
Tracing the cells’ history required amplifying enough DNA in a culture outside of the body to be able to study. The team used a slow procedure favored for its accuracy to promote a single cancerous cell to exponentially divide, producing many genetically identical cells. It took “closer to three months” for Hormoz and his team to amplify enough DNA to study, he said. Bulk sequencing was then performed to read and analyze the DNA.
Hormoz noted that these are “not cheap procedures.” Twenty years ago, whole-genome sequencing cost around $1 billion per cell. Though this price “has come down significantly,” sequencing the genome of one cell remains a costly $1,000, he said.
Ann Mullally, another member of the research team and a physician-scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, stressed the importance of better understanding MPN and other cancers before focusing on intervention and diagnostic techniques.
“There are people who will develop this mutation, but will not go on to develop the disease,” Mullally said. “Right now, we don’t really have a good way to understand, or we don’t really know, what are the predictors.” Therefore, “before we start doing widespread testing on people” and “labeling them with potential diagnoses, we need to have a good understanding of what we're going to do with that information.”
The study's authors also addressed the impact their work may have on cancer research and health care.
“We now have the means to follow the evolution of the cancer in patients at the level of the precision of individual cells, which I think will lead to new biology down the road,” Nguyen wrote. “Clinically, I think it potentially impacts physicians by more clearly outlining the time window they have to provide early detection, prevention, and intervention for their patients.”
Hormoz said the study opens the door to future research that could develop early intervention techniques for cancer.
“[The study] raises the possibility that you can go and intervene and treat these patients before you ever have overt cancer,” he said. “That’s where the ultimate dream is.”

Two Harvard College students launched a website last month that provides information on states’ Covid-19 vaccine programs in an effort to demystify the process, which has left many Americans confused.
In early February, Catherine H. Yeo ’22-23 and Eric Z. Lin ’22 created the website — COVID Vaccines Info Guide — which helps users find a summary of their state’s vaccine eligibility status, offers resources to book a vaccine appointment, and allows them to subscribe for email updates.
Yeo said she and Lin decided to create the platform to aid the general public.
“Getting a vaccine shouldn’t be about disparity and information access,” she said. “Everyone should have it, so really simply putting all that information in one centralized location was important to us.”
The U.S. approved the first Covid-19 vaccine on December 11 of last year. Since then, each state has crafted their own policies for distribution, making the process of receiving a vaccine confusing to many, per Lin. To understand some states’ policies, Lin said he had to peruse “PDFs of like 50 pages of legislation.”
“We saw these websites as a way to gather information,” Lin said of states’ websites. “But obviously they’re so confusing to users.”
Since the coronavirus outbreak reached the U.S. roughly one year ago, the nation has recorded over 29 million positive cases and has administered over 98.2 million vaccines. President Joe Biden said in a speech Thursday night that he has directed states to ensure all adults are eligible for the vaccine by May 1, with a goal of safe small gatherings by July 4.
To maintain the website’s accuracy, Yeo and Lin, both of whom concentrate in Computer Science at the College, said they wrote code to receive alerts when states update their policies on their websites. They also crowdsource from grassroots sources, for example, by asking users to fill out a form with information on their region’s vaccine program.
The website has already amassed thousands of users, per Lin, who said its reach extends beyond those individuals. One user whose family owns a chain of coffee shops in New York City used the website to book vaccine appointments for all of their employees, Lin said.
Yeo, who has previously contributed to Datamatch, the popular College matchmaking website, said the vaccine information website offered an opportunity for her to create technology that helps people.
“I’m really excited about building tools to democratize access, especially access to information and education,” Yeo said.
The website currently provides information on vaccine programs in all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Guam, and the pair hopes to soon roll out information on international programs.
Until then, it will continue to provide critical public health information to Americans, including Yeo herself. Yeo said she used the website to help her grandmother secure the Covid-19 vaccine after a vaccine site suddenly canceled her appointment, sending her family into a panic.
“I ended up booking her a slot through a resource found on our own site, even though I’m physically very far away from where my grandma is right now,” Yeo said. “From my own story and a lot of other success stories we’ve heard from our users, this can really be a helpful resource.”

Harvard Medical School researchers developed a strategy that uses machine learning to recommend drugs as candidates for clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease, according to an article published in the journal Nature Communications last month.
A team of researchers from the Medical School’s Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology and Massachusetts General Hospital created the new method, known as Drug Repurposing In Alzheimer’s Disease. DRIAD uses gene expression data obtained from tissues affected by Alzheimer’s and drug signatures used to evaluate the progression of disease.
The research team hypothesized that if a drug signature can effectively predict disease progression, the drug can be used to alter disease progression, according to Clemens B. Hug, a research associate at the Medical School and the co-first author of the article.
One of the paper’s authors, Mark W. Albers, an assistant professor of neurology at HMS, said DRIAD was built based on data from 1,500 patients experiencing Alzheimer’s disease at different stages.
With this data, the team used machine learning techniques to develop a precise statistical analysis.
“There might be some hidden patterns in the data that traditional correlations can’t reveal,” said Artem Sokolov, an HMS instructor and director of informatics and modeling.
Sokolov said there are millions of potential drugs that have been generated and thousands that have been FDA-approved.
“There is no possible way to evaluate all of them in the clinical trial," Sokolov said. "And our hope is that DRIAD can help bubble certain drugs up to the top by saying ‘the genes that these drugs perturb tend to be associated with Alzheimer’s.’”
The group added the drugs to human brain cells in culture and looked for the genes that changed in response to each drug, according to Albers. Those genes were then fed into DRIAD to see if they aligned well with disease progression.
After applying DRIAD to current drugs, the results revealed that top-performing drugs target Janus kinase proteins, which promote pro-inflammatory signals.
“The idea is that stopping these inflammatory signals can help patients to reduce the symptoms,” Hug said.
Still, the only way to determine the effectiveness of those drugs in treating Alzheimer’s is through clinical trials, according to Sokolov.
Albers said one of the drugs — baricitinib — will be the focus of a Massachusetts General Hospital clinical trial this summer.
Sokolov cited an emerging view that Alzheimer’s is not simply one disease, but rather a presentation of multiple conditions that cause neuronal death, such as inflammation or metabolic disruptions.
“It's naive to think that there would be a single drug that can cure all possible underlying causes,” Sokolov said. “The future steps for our project is to begin untangling some of these mechanisms to try to understand why the neurons are dying, but also try to match up specific treatments for specific causes.”
The research created a website where the public can test out DRIAD themselves by inputting gene sets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Federal lawmakers and immigration reform activists discussed the Biden administration's progress toward enacting its immigration agenda in a Thursday webinar organized by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center For Public Leadership.
The event, moderated by VICE News correspondent Paola Ramos, featured U.S. Representatives Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) and Linda T. Sánchez (D-Calif.), and focused on the administration’s successes and challenges on immigration issues thus far.
Ramos opened the webinar — held at the half-way point of the administration’s “First 100 Days” — by asking panelists to reflect on the administration’s most important immigration-related action to date.
“I think the most significant thing is that the Biden administration has made every effort to stop mistreating people and stop abusing people, which is what we saw during the Trump administration: grave abuses of human rights,” Castro said.
Castro cited President Joe Biden's reversal of both Migrant Protection Protocols, a government program that permitted immigration officials to return asylum-seekers to Mexico as their claims were adjudicated in court, and former President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, which led to a family separation crisis at the border.
White House Director of Political Strategy and Outreach Emmy Ruiz, an event panelist, said a significant roadblock to the administration’s immigration reform agenda has been the situation it inherited from Trump, who “dismantled” structures and agencies related to immigration and reduced their “literal manpower," per Ruiz.
“President Biden is singularly focused on not just reestablishing the protocols, the structures that are necessary to respond to these humanitarian challenges we’re rebuilding, but not only that, reenvisioning as to what is possible and making sure that we’re upholding American values in how we’re treating one another,” she said.
Sánchez compared the current political situation to 2009, when former President Barack Obama took over from former President George W. Bush.
“It’s very cyclical — we see Republican administrations really tear down institutions and underfund certain things, and disinvest in certain programs, and then when the administration changes to a Democratic one, there’s that having to rebuild everything,” Sánchez said. “We have expectations, but we have to recognize everything is not going to happen overnight.”
Sánchez also criticized the Trump administration for “fear mongering” and “scapegoating” immigrants, actions she deemed “nonsensical” — especially in light of their contributions to U.S. society since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“They’re the workers that made sure we had food on our grocery store shelves when we went to get food during the pandemic. They took care of Covid patients in hospitals and held their hands when they took their last breaths,” Sánchez said. “You cannot fundamentally call immigrants essential workers on one hand, and on the other hand, say they’re here to damage this country.”
Ruiz said the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed earlier Thursday afternoon, represented a key step toward economic relief for undocumented immigrants in the U.S.
“It’s going to cut child poverty in half,” Ruiz said. “This is going to provide immediate relief. Americans will begin to feel this over the weekend.”
Sánchez said she believes the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 — a bill she introduced in the U.S. House “to provide an earned path to citizenship, to address the root causes of migration and responsibly manage the southern border, and to reform the immigrant visa system” — represents an important next step in immigration reform.
“It will try to address the root causes that push people north, that caused people to flee,” Sánchez said, citing issues like poverty, hunger, corruption, and violence. “That’s never been attempted in any immigration bill.”
In an interview with The Crimson following the event, Sánchez said Democratic control in the House, Senate, and White House could enable true reform.
“The American public wants to see our broken immigration system fixed. A Democratic majority in the House and the Senate can get that done, and we have a president and an administration that wants to see that done,” she said. “If everybody rose in the same direction, we can accomplish this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several academics and advocates influential in criminal justice reform gathered Thursday for a conversation on the influence of misdemeanors on America’s criminal justice system — the topic of a new documentary premised on a Harvard Law School professor's book.
Published in December 2018, HLS professor Alexandra Natapoff’s book, “Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps the Innocent and Makes America More Unequal,” investigates the close relationship between misdemeanors and systemic injustices within the American criminal justice system. The book inspired a documentary produced by Brave New Films titled “Racially Charged: America’s Misdemeanor Problem," which the Law School screened virtually in advance of the panel discussion.
“For too long, misdemeanors have been ignored,” the book’s description reads. “But they are crucial to understanding our punitive criminal system and our widening economic and racial divides.”
On Thursday afternoon, the Law School hosted a screening of the 30-minute film, after which Natapoff joined a panel comprised of several contributors influential in the film-making process in addition to academics and political figures who are challenging the current model of America’s criminal justice system.
During the discussion, Natapoff said she believes the country is in a special moment to reckon with racial injustice.
“We are in an extraordinary national — indeed an international — conversation about the American criminal system, about structural racism, about police violence against Black people and against Black men in particular, and about how the misdemeanor system is making all of this worse,” Natapoff said.
Rachael Rollins, the District Attorney of Massachusetts’ Suffolk County — who Natapoff said has “influenced so much of the conversation around progressive prosecution” — said during the conversation that watching the documentary made her oscillate between “profound sorrow and rage,” citing the criminal justice system's treatment of Black people.
“Our community is tired of being murdered by the government that our taxes pay for, and then told to please relax and keep it down when it comes to our First Amendment right to protest,” Rollins said.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor of Criminal Justice Sandra Susan Smith, another panelist, said she believes the film masterfully depicted the “juxtaposition of the past and the present.”
“While talking about the more recent misdemeanors, you also told stories about Black folks who’ve experienced very similar kinds of harms 100 years ago,” Smith said. “There are different offenses that people are getting caught under, but the offenses are doing the same thing.”
Robert Greenwald, the founder of Brave New Films and the director of “Racially Charged,” said the documentay — and his production studio more broadly — aims to humanize societal issues and inspire viewers to become agents of change.
“Bear in mind that this is a tool so that everybody can do something in terms of educating, helping, inspiring,” Greenwald said. “What we try to do is put a face on policy and connect the dots, which makes it a face that helps us understand the systemic issues.”
Director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Justice Division Udi Ofer said understanding issues regarding misdemeanors is just one aspect to diagnosing injustice within America’s criminal justice system, which has roots in "broken windows" and zero tolerance policing.
“I think this film is amazing,” Ofer said. “But I don’t think we can talk about misdemeanors without also talking about broken windows policing, and the related policing strategies that have been implemented in the past four decades that have deliberately and proactively led to an increase in the number of misdemeanor arrests in the United States.”
Chris Lollie, a musician arrested on a misdemeanor charge who was featured in the documentary, said the film demonstrates that “even though we live in this millennia now, nothing’s really changed.”
“We just put Band-Aids over things and they rip off so easily,” Lollie said. “Making sure the conversation is always being had is definitely something we need to do, and this film does a great job at showing the history and the future, or the present of where we’re at right now.
“Hopefully, the future can be a big change,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bernard Lown, whose life’s work spanned from pivotal breakthroughs in medicine to humanitarian efforts against nuclear war that won him the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize, died at age 99.
Lown died Feb. 16 of complications from congestive heart failure, according to his son Fredric Lown, after a decades-long academic career serving as a professor of cardiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and a physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Lown is survived by his three children, Fredric, Anne, and Naomi. His wife, Lousie Lown, died in 2019.
“He was a force of nature,” said longtime colleague Joseph D. Brain, a professor of environmental physiology at HSPH.
Born in Lithuania in 1921, Lown immigrated to Maine with his family in 1935. He graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor’s degree in Zoology in 1942, and received his MD from Johns Hopkins University in 1945. He then went on to pursue a cardiology fellowship at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which became his home as a physician.
At a young age, Lown gained notoriety for his work in cardiology, which focused mainly on sudden cardiac death.
In 1951, Lown and his colleague Samuel A. Levine discovered that sitting up or walking after a heart attack leads to significantly better outcomes for patients than bed rest, which was the convention at the time. Without Lown’s co-invention of the modern defibrillator a decade later, surgeons would not have had a dependable way to restart a patient’s heart after surgery.
In 1965, Lown opened one of the first coronary care units, which are devoted to the care of patients who have suffered heart attacks, at Brigham Hospital. According to Marshall A. Wolf ’58, former director of the Brigham’s medical residency programs, Lown’s unit brought mortality down by a third — “a huge reduction.” With this success, Lown’s CCU became a model for other hospitals.
Lown did “less to the patient and more for the patient,” according to Goodarz Danaei, a professor of cardiovascular health at HSPH.
This approach was one he passed down to his medical students.
Wolf said Lown taught prospective physicians “not just to provide technical care” but to “really care about [patients] as human beings.”
Lown also believed it was important to encourage young physicians to be involved in social activism.
In a 1990 discussion at Harvard Medical School, Lown told future doctors they had a responsibility to be vigilant of nuclear war.
“We doctors have an enormous responsibility to heal humankind,” Lown said. “I believe that each of you has the capability to prevent nuclear war by not being afraid of social involvement.”
Brain said Lown saw the threat of nuclear war as “not just an isolated political problem,” but instead, “something that would affect his patients and patients and people all over the world.”
In 1980, against the backdrop of the Cold War, Lown and Soviet cardiologist Evgeni Chazov founded the group International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
“This was the greatest political issue of our time, because it didn’t just mean the death of an individual, but the death of multitudes,” Lown said at the first IPPNW World Congress in 1981. “Why would doctors not get involved?”
In his 2008 memoir “Prescription for Survival,” Lown wrote, “I risked credibility and even retribution when I joined forces with a perceived enemy to contain the unparalleled terror of nuclear war. The enemy became a friend, and together we launched a global movement.”
This movement earned the IPPNW the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize, which Lown and Chazov accepted on the group's behalf.
Using the Nobel Prize money, Lown created SATELLIFE in 1987, which deployed satellites to facilitate medical communication to health professionals in developing countries.
Fredric Lown said his father deeply believed “no one geographic area could be successful at the expense of others.” This vision formed the basis for the Lown Scholars program, which his son said was his main focus in the last years of his life.
Lown established the Bernard Lown Cardiovascular Scholars Program at HSPH in 2008. The program trains physicians who live and work in developing countries, and Danaei — the faculty director of the Lown Scholars Program — said Lown predicated the entire program upon the betterment of healthcare across the globe.
Lown was “always impatient” to tackle global challenges, and “there were always things that he wanted to achieve,” according to Brain.
“Even at age 99, rather than resting on his laurels, he was thinking of what should be done and what could be done,” Brain said.
Despite his constant efforts to identify and confront the world’s biggest challenges, Lown expressed optimism in his “Prescription For Survival.”
“Great as the present danger is, far greater is the opportunity,” Lown wrote. “While science and technology have catapulted us to the brink of extinction, the same ingenuity has brought humankind to the frontier of an age of abundance.”
CORRECTION: March 15, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated the title of Lown's book “Prescription For Survival.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 and Associate Dean of Students for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro discussed virtual Housing Day and the Dean of Students Office’s commitment to anti-racism in an interview earlier this month.
Housing Day — a spirited annual event in which freshmen learn of their assignment to one of the twelve upperclassmen houses — will be held virtually for the second consecutive year on March 12, roughly one year after Harvard first sent students home due to the coronavirus crisis.
“I will say I don’t think anyone anticipated we would be doing two virtual Housing Days, so I just want to acknowledge that that is a strange and unusual thing,” Brandt said.
“I do want to really commend the [House Committees],” she added. “I think they’ve been doing fabulous work and being creative and thinking through different ways to welcome what will be the newest members of their community.”
In a typical year, House Committees commemorate Housing Day by planning house-wide socials and house-themed music videos to drum up pride for their respective houses. In light of the remote semester, House Committees have shifted to hosting virtual programming, including house-themed trivia and Zoom escape rooms.
Brandt added the Dean of Students Office incorporated student feedback from last year into planning this year’s Housing Day.
“We are adjusting timing to make sure that we’re able to really work with students who are both here and those who are learning remotely,” she explained. “We consulted with the First-Year Experience office around scheduling, and we’ve been working to identify the main components of Housing Day.”
In the interview, DSO administrators also reflected on the progress of the goals set by their office at the beginning of the school year. This year’s goals include greater solicitation and implementation of student feedback, a commitment to anti-racism, and better support of student development during remote semesters.
Mauro highlighted efforts taken on by the DSO to evolve into “an actively anti-racist organization,” including a plan to develop an anti-racist training curriculum for DSO staff members and to implement an “inclusive excellence framework” to analyze hiring and promotion trends.
“We recognize the importance of self-awareness,” Mauro said. “We really wanted to take some time to make sure we understand, at baseline, what does anti-racism mean? How can we become more self-aware? What are barriers that we have as an organization to becoming anti-racist?”
Mauro added she intends for the anti-racist training curriculum to become “foundational” for staff working in Harvard’s residential life.
“There’s a real great intentionality in developing and training, particularly for staff across residential life as well and involving folks who are working in residence life at the end of this pilot to then retool that training program as foundational for folks who come into residence life in the future,” she said.

The Association on American Indian Affairs sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in February alleging Harvard is in violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and “has caused continuing physical, emotional and spiritual trauma to Native Nations and their citizens.”
The letter accused Harvard and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of several legal and ethical missteps in its handling of Native American human remains and cultural objects, including failing to consult with Native American tribal nations when completing inventories of those collections, as NAGPRA mandates.
Congress passed NAGPRA in 1990 to require any institutions that receive federal funding to inventory the remains of Native American people and their funerary objects, in consultation with any tribes that have “a possible cultural or geographical affiliation,” to notify the public of the possession of the items, and to transfer the items to the tribes.
According to the letter, Harvard has not always consulted the tribes with possible affiliations to the human remains and cultural objects in the University's collections. Only around 3 percent of the remains in Harvard’s possession have no associated geographical information, the letter reads.
“That means 96.75% of the Ancestors in your collections have information that will absolutely allow Tribal consultation and repatriation to take place,” it reads.
AAIA chief executive and attorney Shannon O’Loughlin, who is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, said Harvard's lack of consultation with the tribes has allowed the University to classify the remains and objects in its collection as “culturally unidentifiable,” meaning that under NAGPRA, tribes wishing to claim those items must go through additional steps and may be required to submit evidence.
O’Loughlin also alleged that thanks to a NAGPRA provision, by failing to affiliate the remains and objects with a tribe, Harvard can choose to repatriate only human remains upon a tribe’s request, but not associated funerary and sacred objects.
“By their own failure to comply with NAGPRA, they have been allowed to even keep those funerary objects that should have been returned if they would have completed the inventories properly to begin with,” she said.
O’Loughlin said the organization decided to write the letter after Bacow announced in January that the Peabody Museum had found in its collections the remains of 15 individuals who may have been enslaved. Bacow apologized on behalf of Harvard and pledged to improve the University’s practices around the handling of human remains in its collections.
“Harvard is claiming to want to decolonize its collections,” O’Loughlin said. “And what it’s chosen to do is really to continue the colonization process — it’s chosen to continue the harm that the theft originally incurred and continue to carry it forward.”
The letter also includes a list of demands: that Harvard hire a Native American NAGPRA expert to develop a plan for affiliating remains and objects currently marked as “culturally unidentifiable;” that it repatriate funerary items it chose to keep when returning some human remains it classified as “culturally unidentifiable;” that it make public its process for evaluating NAGPRA claims; that it declare a research moratorium on Native American remains and objects in its collections; and that it remove a search tool from the Peabody Museum’s website that displayed photos of some Native American funerary objects.
In a written statement responding to the AAIA letter, Peabody Museum Director Jane Pickering wrote that “since 1990, the Museum has developed a comprehensive program to administer NAGPRA requests, and the Museum recognizes that the return of a human being to a tribal nation not only is required by the law but also is a moral act.”
“To treat all individuals with care and dignity takes time, respect, and sensitivity, and the Museum, and its NAGPRA Advisory Committee, welcomes engagement with AAIA and others in advancing this important work,” she added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed that Bacow had received the letter. AAIA Program Director Colleen R. Medicine said the Association had “received no official response from Harvard.”
The University’s alleged failure to consult with tribes during its inventory process, which it completed in 2000, could incur civil penalties, according to O’Loughlin.
“If you think about almost 7,000 ancestors that they failed to consult about, depending on how the Secretary of Interior wanted to count that as civil penalties, each one of those could be counted as a potential civil penalty violation, and charged a fine which is then compounded every day that that hasn’t happened,” she said.
Robert J. Miller, a law professor at Arizona State University specializing in Federal Indian Law and a citizen of the Eastern Shawnee tribe of Oklahoma, said he thought the letter might signal an impending lawsuit.
“It looks like a demand letter before the filing of a lawsuit is how I would take it,” he said. “I wrote some of those, I responded to some of them.”
O’Loughlin declined to comment on the possibility of AAIA suing the University.
Keanu V. Gorman ’22, a co-president of Natives at Harvard College and a citizen of the Navajo Nation, said Harvard’s handling of Native American remains and objects has implications beyond the law itself.
They said the existence of the search tool, while legal, violates some tribes’ spiritual practices, which is why their own tribe has worked to repatriate objects displayed in museums.
“As a part of our culture, we wanted those items repatriated, because they weren’t supposed to be even viewed outside of any ceremonial context,” Gorman said. “It could mean very detrimental effects, spiritually.”
Gorman said that consulting more actively with Native American tribes could help Harvard better understand the legal and moral implications of holding Native American remains and objects in its collections.
“I hate the excuse that a lot of museums and museum staff make, in which they say, ‘This can’t be identified to a specific culture,’ when in reality a lot of these cultures can identify those items themselves,” they said.
Natives at Harvard College co-president Anna Kate E. Cannon ’21, a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, said Harvard’s resources and the time since it completed its inventory should have allowed the University to consult tribal nations more thoroughly.
“You’ve had so many years and so many funds, dedicated to literally just following the law and working with Native communities to give them back what is rightfully theirs,” said Cannon, a former Crimson Magazine editor. “And you’re just not doing it.”
“There’s a joke — at what point does it become archaeology and not grave robbing? And my opinion is that it is always grave robbing,” she added.
Although AAIA has been planning an effort to pressure institutions to correct alleged NAGPRA violations for several years, O’Loughlin said, the association was prompted to write to Bacow because of how briefly Harvard's president mentioned NAGPRA in his letter announcing the discovery of the remains of potentially enslaved people in the Peabody’s collections.
In a January email to University affiliates, Bacow had written that the efforts of a new steering committee on human remains in the University collections would “be informed by our existing efforts to care for one of the largest collections of American Indian remains in the country, as well as our implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.”
AAIA will send similar requests for NAGPRA compliance to other institutions in coming weeks, O’Loughlin said, adding that a thorough reexamination of the requested collections could be beneficial to the institutions too.
“When institutions do work with Native nations for repatriation purposes, they finally discover what it is they’ve had in their collections all along,” she said. “That communication, that consultation that Harvard has not done, really allows for education to occur — it allows the institution to actually fulfill its mission of educating the public about that culture.”
For Harvard, Cannon said she believes “compliance with NAGPRA is literally just the baseline.”
Through “active collaboration” with Native American tribal nations, she said, the University should investigate how it can more responsibly represent the items in its collections.
“How can you display things from our past, our present, and our future while still being respectful, and in ways that present us not as figures of the past, but as people who are still here, and still persevere, and still have vibrant, thriving cultures?”

In 2000, Harvard submitted the sole bid to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority to claim 48-acres of dormant land in Allston. After securing the large tract of land for the lofty sum of $151,751,636, Harvard officially owned more property in Allston than it did in Cambridge.
Twenty-one years later, Harvard envisions big plans for its Allston property, including an Enterprise Research Campus, the Allston Multimodal Project, and a new stop on the Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line. Here is a brief synopsis of steps the University and the developers had to take to get these projects approved with the city of Boston.
Harvard undergoes two different planning processes for new developments on University-owned land: the institution master plan and the permitting process.
The institution master plan is specifically designed for developments that would serve the University’s “academic or athletic or support facilities,” according to Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
There is a separate “permitting process” for projects like the ERC, in which Harvard has hired external firm Tishman Speyer, to develop University-owned land into “commercial, residential, and other non-institutional” space. In the case of the ERC project, Tishman Speyer received approval from the BPDA to develop lab and office space, residential areas, and a hotel and conference center.
Governing both these processes is Article 80 of the Boston Zoning Code, which outlines “procedures for small projects and large projects and how they need to be reviewed,” per Autler.
Though the review process for smaller developments is “straightforward,” larger institutional projects or projects with external developers begin “long before” any official construction plans are filed, he added.
Nupoor Monani, a senior institutional planner at the BPDA, said the ERC process, for instance, began with the University filing documents in 2018 to establish a planned development area.
“That [PDA filing] describes, very broadly, the contours of the development — how big is it, how many square feet, what uses will it have, and what benefits will it provide to the community,” Monani said.
Prior to the 2018 filing, committees at Harvard mulled a possible “enterprise research zone.” Alex Krieger, professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and former co-chair of the Allston Work Team, said in an interview that Harvard's idea for the ERC came about when the University realized it had acquired more land than was needed for academic purposes.
“Harvard had acquired much more land than they would ever need for their academic purposes, for university purposes,” Krieger said. “And, therefore, there’s an opportunity to delegate to sort of a plan for some of that space to become partners with industry and so forth.”
Once a project is proposed, the BPDA’s role is to facilitate planning and conduct “development review,” per Monani.
In its planning capacity, the BPDA takes on the traditional role of an urban planner to consider how the city is changing project-by-project and to define parameters for new developments through zoning codes and other guidelines, according to Monani.
Monani added that, acting as a development reviewer, the BPDA ensures a developer goes through the review process and “seeks input from all different stakeholders.”
For a large project like the ERC, soliciting input from stakeholders comes after the developer files a letter of intent for their project and the BPDA forms an impact advisory group, per Autler.
Autler added that the resident-led Harvard-Allston Task Force takes on the role of the impact advisory group in Harvard developments.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association and member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said he believes the group has considerable sway over project plans.
“We have a much more integrated, complex community review process that could really make life difficult for Harvard, if we were ignored,” he said.
After extensive public input and review of planning documents, Monani said the project goes to the BPDA’s board of governors to seek approval.
The length of the board approval process is largely determined by the complexity of the proposed project. For Harvard’s Enterprise Research campus, the approval process spanned “two-and-a-half or three years,” per Monani.
Though the planning and review process does not end following approval, Monani added that it represents “another important milestone in the Article 80 review process.”
Once the project is approved by the Board, all the agreed-upon measures from the review process are consolidated into legal documents.
“The stage post-Board approval is really codifying those things and making sure that the language is right, and we’re sort of capturing the intent of the review process or the decisions made,” Monani said.
