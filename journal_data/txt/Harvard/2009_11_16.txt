After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the intimate black vacuum of the Loeb Experimental Theater, an all-white catwalk begins at a delicate white backdrop, subtly slanting downward across the space to nearly cut the room diagonally. The audience sits along either side in small bleacher clusters, the noticeably comfortable space between their seats an appreciated—and probably intentional—detail. After all, it could not have been lost on director Matthew C. Stone ’11 that British playwright Martin Crimp’s “Attempts on Her Life” is not a play that makes anyone feel like being close.
As soon as audience members walk into this latest Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Company production, each is confronted with the vulnerability of a young woman (Jessica Napier ’11) self-consciously stripped to her plain, black skivvies in the middle of the stage. Everyone suddenly becomes an accomplice, mutually guilty of his invasion into the presumably fictitious reality created by the girl on the pedestal; All are at least partially responsible for her furrowed brow and the arms she has arranged protectively across her front as she shivers from the violation. The entire show is uncomfortable in its emotional, if not spatial, proximity—its intensity dull and ever-present, though not entirely unbearable. “We need to feel what we’re seeing is real,” shouts a male character in scene five (“The Camera Loves You”) at a different but similarly exposed incarnation of this original female character. “It isn’t just acting, it’s far more exacting than acting... We’re talking reality.”
The initial discomfort caused and expressed by Napier cracks the divide between the reality of the audience’s pre-show chatterings and that of the play’s. Stone ties a knot around this introductory tension between voyeuristic guilt and pleasure. He engages the audience in his challenge to untangle the thread which he proceeds to reveal in glimpses throughout the show’s “17 Scenarios for Theatre,” the play’s subtitle. However, this strand proves to be so complexly woven through and around itself that its fragments suggest a continuity but no sense that understanding is entirely possible; ultimately the viewer must tease out as much temporal logic as possible and then swiftly slice the remaining Gordian mess into decidedly more manageable, but also severely limited, strands. In these clips, molded around the existence of “Anne,” contradictions in personality and humanity surface. Through them arises the theme of life’s consistency, existent despite the reminder that “consistency” does not necessarily lend a piece a point.
Even less of a coherent universe was provided in Crimp’s original script. There is no plot, no intended them, no designated setting or designated speakers—just lines of dialogue with dashes to signal a change of voice, or ellipses to suggest a pause. Without dictated sexes or any guidelines for gathering an “appropriately” composed cast, though, long narrative passages (indicated as belonging to a single speaker in the script) can be manipulated and divided at the director’s discretion, just as all non-lingual elements must be. It’s a daunting challenge, but one that Stone accepts in his third directorial endeavor to wonderfully creative and moving effect. Since its first performance in 1997 at the Royal Court Theatre, “Attempts on Her Life” has left audiences feeling disoriented; who is this Anne—or Anny or Anushka—that everyone is discussing? This confusion is much less prominent an issue in Stone’s version.
His four female players alternate as the lead role (the three males play more static supporting characters, filling roles as “anyman”), but each has her own personality—a strain of Anne’s personality—that is carried along with her physical representation throughout the show.
Napier is sexy but painfully conflicted internally; the basic vulnerability she established at the very beginning lingers throughout the show. As the voiceless artist, writhing in blood, chocolate, and saliva during scene 11 (“Untitled (100 Words)”), her body contorts, suggesting an inner beast yearning to escape. As Anne, moments of anger cause her eyes to glaze over and her mouth to froth. Such strong displays of emotion capitalize on the fuzzy space between internal and external theatrical reality.
Similarly, the three other female characters play roles consistent in their appearances as Anne throughout the show. Ella Gibson ’13 pierces the show with a stern cool that permeates her part as the pessimistic narrator in scene three (“Faith in Ourselves”); as the disparaging art critic in “Untitled”; as the skeptical interrogator in scene 15 (“The Statement”); and as the seemingly sweet but aggressively homophobic, racist young mother in scene 10 (“Kinda Funny”). Rebecca Feinberg ’13 elicits sympathy as Anne, the lonely cigarette stealer, while Margaret Kerr ’13 captures Anne in “The Camera Loves You” not in a dynamic display of violent agency, but in its complete absence.
As in all aspects of this primarily bare play, Stone has couched the palpable void in details that are brutally suited to the mood of the play. Props are minimal—table, black cube, coffee, or scotch. Spotlights focus on specific narrators. The technological longing, imbued in tracks by Panda Bear, Thom Yorke (with and without Radiohead), capture the melting, quiet terror of a modern generation; videos unveil landscapes and devastation upon the backdrop during “Faith in Ourselves,” and then, scenes later, the sleek curves of a new model vehicle in “The New Anny.” “What fascinates me is her use of textures,” offers one art critic during “Untitled.” “I think there’s a great sensitivity here in the juxtaposition of materials.” The entire performance presents a similarly impressive layering and contrasts of sparseness and chaotic engagements; in scene 14 (“Girl Next Door”) the movement of all seven players and their various intonations are in unison, yet they trip up the rhythm of the play by seeming to trip over each other in the small space. Still, stutters and stammers—both vocal and technical—are forgivable in the context of the play’s various moves to crack the fourth wall.
“Strangely—.”
“Strangely,” as Sterle shouts through the megaphone again in the aptly named scene 12 (“Strangely!”), the lights dim on Napier at the close of the show, leaving her sprawled on the floor in the dark as in the first scenario. Now, however, we have at least some understanding as to the immediate cause. It’s a full circle orchestrated by Stone that capitalizes on the necessarily absent center of a continuous loop, and though the action has come to a close, its ideas continue to linger—unlike the show itself, which closes on Nov. 21.
“Attempts on Her Life”...
“It’s illuminating. It’s dark. It’s highly personal and at the same time raises vital questions about the world we’re living in.” And it’s a production not to be missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday was a night of firsts for guests of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In an all-French program, acclaimed Italian conductor, Fabio Luisi, and French pianistic upstart, Lise de la Salle, made their BSO debuts. While the concert did not feature the careful artistic consideration the BSO lends to its usual program of heavier masterworks, Luisi and de la Salle substituted a delightful helping of flair for the conventional dose of substance—a move that was quite appropriate for the lighter musical fare these particular pieces offered.
The evening opened with Swiss-French composer Arthur Honegger’s symphonic poem “Pastorale d’été.” Though this work does not promise much in the way of dynamic variety or musical progression, Luisi did what he could with a compositionally-constrained piece. Honegger, one of six composers loosely identified as leaders of the musical avant-garde movement in the 1920s, employed languid horns and murmuring strings to capture the flavor of first light in a pastoral setting.
Alternating horn and flute solos were tonally layered upon high woodwind accompaniment, providing colorful interludes between the serene string passages. In a slight lull, the ensemble reached a plateau halfway through and wandered a little too much under Luisi’s distinctly European conducting, with more reserved gestures as its stylistic marker. The absence of the BSO’s regular concertmaster may also have contributed to a rather half-hearted string ensemble.
Twenty one-year-old prodigy Lise de la Salle picked up the slack with her delivery of Camille Saint-Saen’s popular “Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor.” The solo piano passage that opens the piece—whose lack of a conventional orchestral prologue or a customarily slow second movement deviates significantly from the standard concerto structure—calls a Bach organ fantasy to mind. Sweeping broken arpeggios paired with a vibrant treatment of melody distinguished de la Salle’s delivery, though an enthusiastic orchestral accompaniment sometimes overpowered piano chords that were already slightly lacking in fullness.
The second movement, a humorous scherzando with embellishments crisp enough to make Mendelssohn—the master of this so-called fairy music—proud, benefited from a feathery orchestral texture and methodically precise fingerwork on de la Salle’s part. A syncopated waltz transitioned into a breakneck Presto in the third movement. Soloist and ensemble approached the closing tarantella with a startling recklessness that Luisi impressively translated into exhilaration.
The orchestra again took center stage for the program’s finale, a performance of the 1947 version of Igor Stravinsky’s burlesque in four movements, “Petrushka.” Petrushka, which was first performed by Diaghlilev’s Ballet Russes in 1911, provides a delightful contrast to the composer’s later, seminal work Le Sacru du Printemps (“The Rite of Spring”). Petrushka’s plot line of musical puppets cavorting on a fairground cannot begin to compete with Stravinsky’s story of a maiden who is chosen to dance herself to death for the fertility of the earth in “The Rite of Spring,” nor does it presume to. Put simply, Petrushka doesn’t want you to take it too seriously, nor does Luisi approach its execution as such.
Holding nothing back, Luisi moved to all corners of the podium as he gestured for biting brass punches to give way to penetrating piccolo runs and rumbling timpani rolls, all of which punctuated violin parts frenetic enough to break a few strings along the way. The brass section was assertive and bold, but never shrill in its approach, inserting sarcastic staccatos in the most traditionally irreverent of places. Luisi urged the ensemble to a pleasantly deafening climax, raising questions as to why the BSO doesn’t program entertaining pieces like these more often.
Luisi and de la Salle’s debuts with the BSO speak to the orchestra’s enduring ability to attract exciting talent, as well as its willingness to forsake substance-laden masterpieces for works whose value lies in pure virtuosity and amusement. Mahler symphonies and Tchaikovsky concertos are unquestionably more epic in scale and impact than any of the pieces programmed on Saturday, but a little bit of fun—especially in the tradition-heavy Symphony Hall—never hurt anyone.

The minimalist stage—black floor, black walls, white screen—suddenly lit up in Technicolor, transforming the Harvard Dance Center into a club. This riveting opening formed a suitably entertaining and vibrant preface to iDance, a fun, fast-paced and well-executed performance that showcased the talents of two Harvard dance groups.
iDance was a collaboration between the Mainly Jazz Company (co-directed by Crystal Chang ’10 and Iris Odstrcil ’10) and TAPS (directed by Caitlin D. Driscoll ’11). The show’s program alternated between pieces by the two groups, with a finale performed by both. While the two troupes featured well-thought out pieces, Mainly Jazz was often more imaginative in its dances, performing stories as well as movement. TAPS’ arrangements were technically sound, but at times creatively restrained.
One of the most innovative numbers of the evening was Mainly Jazz’s  “Music Box,” choreographed by Chang. Jennifer M. Batel ’12, Natalie A. Cameron ’11, and Odstrcil transformed themselves into Coppelia-esque wind-up toys, delicately moving about the stage with the precision of mechanical instruments. The plucked strings of the folk music—a piece by Yann Tiersen, best known for creating the soundtrack for “Amélie”—resonated as the dancers replied in stiff, precise arm movements that still managed to remain lyrical.
Ola S. Canty ’11 choreographed a powerful, hip-hop inspired dance to “Wrong,” by Depeche Mode, interrupting the sequence of dances that focused mainly on fluid, sensual movement for something much more muscular. Canty, Batel, Wanxin Cheng ’13, Callie A. Kolbe (Tufts ’10), and Tiffany E. Wen ’11 rose from the floor, dressed in white hoodies that partially obscured their faces. They proceeded to create a bold, monochromatic image of vertical motion. Their strong arm movements and fluid torsos, which at times evoked military orders, expressed the power and self-assuredness capable when one possesses full control over one’s own body.
Amid a few less exciting TAPS numbers, Driscoll’s vision of “Seven Seas of Rhye,” by Queen, stood out for its lightheartedness. Dancers lined up, silhouetted by the glowing blue background of the lighted screen. Then the dancers—Driscoll, Jennifer N. Kurdyla ’11, Rachel N. Moda ’13, Elisa M. Orr ’10 (who is also a Crimson designer), Elena M. Pepe ’13, and H. Zane B. Wruble ’11 (who is also a Crimson magazine editor)—turned and sashayed forwards, dressed as sailors. Their footwork was fast and precise, broken up by salutes and spiraling upper body movements that gave the dance more narrative flow. During the middle of the piece, they paused to run into the wings and returned as pirates brandishing gleaming scimitars. The dancers were obviously having fun, and their infectious energy lit up the room.
While “Seven Seas of Rhye” was loud and boisterous, Driscoll’s choreography to The Cordettes’ “Mr. Sandman” was an excellent example of the beauty of slower, exacting, and quieter tap-dancing. Driscoll, Kurdyla, and Wruble performed tight tap rhythms that counterbalanced the choreography’s whimsical use of gestures such as yawning, stretching, and falling asleep. The three dancers precisely and calmly complemented the mellow song with their footwork, infusing the piece with effervescence without being overbearing.
The performance’s most evocative moments remained those which showcased the talents of individual dancers; large group dances were often slightly out of sync and less elegant than smaller, more intimate pairs of dancers. However, the cameo performance by the Harvard Irish College Dancers “Corcairdhearg,” simply entitled “Rhythm of Ireland,” remained buoyant and well-arranged in spite of its large size. A small group of dancers bounced up and down effortlessly, moving only their legs in a fluid, precise line dance. Then, the rest of the company unexpectedly entered, tapping out a pulsing rhythm in an impressive and elegant footwork sequence that complemented the delicate, quick movements of the dancers.
Culminating in a collective number performed to the JXL remix of “A Little Less Conversation,”  iDance featured a consistently high standard of dancing. The most engaging pieces seemed to be those where the choreographer had a clear aesthetic vision of the dance formations from beginning to end, whereas the less memorable dances did not always effectively use movement to create a spatial narrative. Though Mainly Jazz achieved this ambitious comprehensiveness more consistently than TAPS, iDance admirably showcased the talents of both groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting at Uno the other night with a table full of people, it struck me at some point that I was out of place. Not because I lack table manners or was dressed inappropriately—but because I was the only one without an iPhone or BlackBerry.
Given the demographic that makes up the primary readership of this newspaper, you can probably identify with my friends who use smartphones. At any given college function, it seems as if the number of people with BlackBerries or iPhones outnumber the number of those without. A busy and overscheduled lifestyle is par for the course in this country in general—and students here, whose mantra can be summed up “I’ll sleep when I die,” are particularly prone to the lifestyle that the smartphone represents.
To be fair, owning a BlackBerry or an iPhone does not automatically destroy the spontaneity in one’s life. In many cases, it can actually be very useful. Imagine a busy painting. It is full of detail and inordinately cluttered; the number of elements it tries to encompass exceeds the limits of the frame. Much like a busy painting, a busy life is full of details with little prioritization and structure. Scheduling one’s time allows one to overcome this busyness by imposing order on chaos and applying priorities and scales of importance. Since being busy is generally a function of poor planning, the BlackBerry or iPhone allows one to organize one’s life in such a way as to accommodate basic things like meals, exercise, and rest.
Yet the extent to which students rely on their Blackberry or iPhone is often excessive. Most people who own one are constantly checking the latest e-mail in class, in the elevator, at dinner. Ironically, in many cases a smartphone can contribute to stress rather than allay it; the perception that one might be missing out if new messages aren’t checked every few minutes begins to take hold. And overscheduling can even damage relationships—when dinner with one’s significant other becomes just another task to be completed in a busy day, all genuineness and passion disappears.
Managing the work-life balance is clearly difficult. Thankfully, we have an exemplary model. No one would argue with the fact that the President of the United States is a “busy” man. Multiple daily meetings and briefings, speeches, and engagements seem to leave the president with no time to do anything but work—but not so. In August of this year, the president and his family enjoyed a summer vacation at Martha’s Vineyard. In addition to this scheduled activity, the president schedules basketball games with advisors and close friends as well as dinners with his wife. To be fair, unlike President Obama, students don’t have a double-digit staff to handle their daily affairs. However, students also don’t have the ultimate responsibility that the president carries and can afford to work and play in a balanced way. All it takes is some adjustment to one’s activities in order to leave time for relationships and self.
I’m not advocating smashing your BlackBerries and iPhones upon the completion of this article, but it is worth reflecting on how much of your life depends on the technology. Consider whether you are addicted to your BlackBerry. Think about your mental health and whether a gadget will exacerbate your stress in Harvard’s already tense environment. The BlackBerry or iPhone can be a useful tool when coordinating events with friends and can definitely increase productivity. Even I may consider acquiring one sooner or later. But if I ever feel like it’s becoming more of a crutch than an aid, I’ll stick to my good old Samsung Gravity.

The strength of the two frontrunners in the 2009 Undergraduate Council presidential election ensures that Harvard students get capable leadership no matter who wins. But the dedicated approach and remarkable track record of one ticket ultimately sets it apart.
Johnny F. Bowman ’11 and his running mate Eric N. Hysen ’11 share much of the strong policy platform of George J. J. Hayward ’11, who is a Crimson editorial editor, and Felix M. Zhang ’11. Yet we have more faith in Hayward’s ability to deliver on his promises.
Both tickets recognize that J-term and the future of students’ winter break experience, for example, is an issue of pressing importance for the student community. Bowman and Hysen have promised to speak to student groups and work to create a positive J-term experience for students over the new winter break; Hayward and Zhang take this idea a step further, calling for a “January Experience Partnership,” through which student groups will propose plans for their J-terms with the UC as spokesman.
Both campaigns also rightly prioritize student group activities, with Hayward-Zhang examining cost efficiency in groups’ events and Bowman-Hysen pushing for an interactive room reservation website and greater focus on room availabilities.
In these and many other initiatives, the goals of these two campaigns are fairly similar, and the student community will have capable, ambitious advocates at the UC helm regardless of which team wins. That said, when it comes to execution, Hayward and Zhang are the right choice.
We are all used to presidential candidates making promises—UC campaign platforms of years past read like a litany of initiatives that never came to be. Yet Hayward follows through.
George Hayward has worked tirelessly as a UC representative since his sophomore year, and his results speak to the capabilities he would bring to the UC presidency. Many students are familiar with his efforts last year to bring better cell-phone reception to the Quad—an initiative that required Hayward to reach out to student groups and marshal student concerns into a campaign that produced tangible, immediate results.
The successful phone campaign is just one of several drives that Hayward has led as a UC representative—the ATM in the Quad that Hayward was instrumental in obtaining also speaks to his advocacy efforts, as does his active presence in the campaign to reverse the administration’s planned late-night shuttle service cuts. His approach and commitment to execution will be exciting to watch when enhanced by the leverage that comes with the UC president’s position and complemented by Zhang’s leadership experience on the UC and in student groups. Hayward has represented his Quad constituents in an exemplary fashion, and this results-oriented approach can now expand to the student community as a whole.
Though Bowman and Hysen are well qualified and would likely serve the students well as leaders of the 29th UC Council, their track record leaves us less confident in their ability to deliver if elected. Bowman’s past involvement with the Student Labor Action Movement has demonstrated his desire to bring about change within the Harvard community, but this work has often included polarizing activism on the behalf of workers rather than students. While Bowman might be able to serve ably as the Harvard student body’s primary advocate, we are not yet convinced.
Bowman and Hysen are a strong ticket with plans that should remain in consideration regardless of whether they are elected. But Hayward’s ability to mobilize students and see initiatives through to fruition will bring energy to the UC leadership, and, hopefully, this focus on students will shift the culture of the UC, ending the perception of the body as a distant organization out of touch with student concerns. Based on past success and the promise for more in the future, we are excited to see what improvements Hayward-Zhang will bring to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At my high school’s graduation ceremony, the headmaster used to introduce the valedictorian with a string of academic accomplishments, the most shocking of which was always how many A-pluses that top student had received during the past four years. A-pluses were the “white whale” of the grading system, achievable only through a seemingly untraceable elixir of grinding work, teacher-schmoozing ability, and luck. At Harvard, an A—our highest grade—doesn’t yield that degree of respect, probably because there is a perception that we achieve quite a lot of them: In 2007, over half of Harvard grades were As or A-minuses, as reported by former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71.
That Harvard has a grade inflation problem is news to no one. What is surprising, though, is that this issue has persisted despite its acknowledgment by students, professors, and the media. This may be because the obvious solution—grade deflation—is both unpalatable and difficult to implement. Instead, a more positive way to combat grade inflation and reward students for exemplary academic work would be to raise the grading scale to include A-pluses.
Grade deflation is tricky to execute because it is by nature a negative academic move. In 2004, Princeton officially implemented a grade-deflation policy intending that As would make up only 35 percent of the grades given out in each department. However, five years later in the 2008-2009 academic year, As still made up 39.7 percent of all grades—and even this relatively high number was considered a major accomplishment. This situation reflects complications that grade deflation encounters at the individual level. Even if a grade-deflation policy were announced, high-achieving Harvard students would expect the same grades from before the policy shift. This expectation would inevitably fail and lead to disappointment throughout the student body. Lowering students’ grades would also meet reluctance from course leaders, who (for the most part) want students to feel they have succeeded. Students, teaching fellows, professors, and administrators do not want such a confrontation, so grade deflation is a hard decision even in the best of times.
Given this reality, the idea of As should be welcomed as a positive and easier path. The central issue with the glut of As and A-minuses currently awarded by the college is not that they make students’ GPAs too high, but that they make their GPAs too similar. Grades lose meaning when everyone gets the same ones, whether they are As or Cs. Extending the GPA scale higher to 4.3 would differentiate grades a substantial amount and accomplish much of what grade deflation would.
Additionally—on a more idealistic note—introducing A-pluses in the grading system would properly reward top students for their exemplary work. Right now, both a 98 percent and 93 average still merit the same letter grade, though achieving the former is markedly harder and reflects a much deeper understanding of the course material. It is unfair for students to be penalized for being a few points below the A cutoff and yet not be rewarded for being above this cutoff, and we already tacitly acknowledge this by having the full range of Bs.
Of course, there is always the risk that TFs and professors would simply use this opportunity to move the grading scale up and give out more A-pluses and As. Instituting A-pluses will be ineffective if it is not accompanied by grading discipline on the part of course leaders. However, this effort, to actually preserve the way they grade, seems easier than any other method of grade differentiation. In any case, something must be done, because, eight years after The Boston Globe declared our grading system the “laughingstock of the Ivy League,” we haven’t progressed very far. The point of grades should be to emphasize relative, not absolute, achievement. To this end, if it is easier to create A-pluses than it is to emphasize B-minuses, then that seems like the logical step.

It’s easy to make fun of my home state of New Jersey. Yes, the turnpike is a blight, Jon Bon Jovi can’t sing, there really are mafiosos and too many strip malls, and we aren’t the friendliest people in the world. Before New Jersey went to the polls to elect a governor a couple weeks ago, a whole new smear made its way through political circles: that New Jersey is impossibly corrupt and that the fix is in for the Democrats. As with most conservative voter-fraud scares, this charge had more to do with race-baiting and delegitimizing potentially unfavorable election results than with securing the sanctity of the voting booth.
It’s true that there’s a very powerful Democratic machine in Camden and Newark, and soon-to-be-former Governor Jon Corzine milked urban New Jersey for all it was worth. But helping voters get to the polls, sending out operatives to knock on doors, and readying lawyers to make sure polling places operate smoothly—these machine tactics help you win an election, but they are not fraudulent, and both sides employ them when they can.
Conservative kvetchers usually have a more serious bogeyman in mind: voters using dead people’s names, campaign workers coercing or bribing people into voting for their man—that sort of thing. But their evidence is almost always mere innuendo. Consider The Wall Street Journal’s John Fund, who leads a cottage industry of voter-fraud hyperventilators. The day before the election, Fund laughably tried to tie ACORN, that all-purpose conservative bugaboo, to anticipated wrong-doings in New Jersey: “Philly operatives associated in the past with ACORN may now be advising their Jersey cousins,” he warned. In other words, black people—and, furthermore, black people voting.
The conservative scare tactics always confuse voter-registration fraud, which is as harmless as illegitimately filling out a registration form, with voter fraud: when illegitimate people actually vote. Take poor Uremia Rojas, who told Fund that “a man with a clipboard knocked on my door and had me sign something so I could vote by mail. I was skeptical but signed and got a ballot. I never really wanted one.” I understand it can be distressing to possess a ballot that you don’t really want to fill out, but here’s a suggestion: Throw the ballot away!
The conservative pursuit of voter fraud has a long and sordid history. The Bush Justice Department sent its U.S. attorneys out hunting for it, but they turned up nothing—a few dozen cases of mistakes and misunderstandings, a few small-time conspiracies in local elections, but no evidence of corruption in federal or state elections. This, of course, wasn’t what the Bush administration wanted to hear, so they fired U.S. attorneys who they thought weren’t being aggressive enough.
Despite this pathetic record, fears of voter fraud have served to justify restrictive laws and tactics that end up disqualifying eligible voters. Six swing states, using flawed and possibly illegal criteria, purged “tens of thousands” of eligible voters from their rolls in the run-up to the 2008 election. Some states passed laws to restrict voter registration drives; the threat of some prankster signing up as “Mickey Mouse” is just that terrifying! And others require extensive photo identification from in-person voters, which serves not to reduce fraud (in-person voter fraud is extremely rare) but to exclude eligible voters who don’t have the right forms of identification. Naturally, it is a feature of these requirements, not a bug, that poor, inner-city minorities (read: Democrats) are those least likely to have things like driver’s licenses and passports.
There’s a really simple remedy to voter fraud, insofar as it even exists, and that is universal voter registration. You can’t pretend to be eligible to vote if everyone’s automatically registered. This is one area among many in which the U.S. lags behind other advanced democracies. Of course, Republicans dread the possibility that we might catch up; an influx of young, poor, and minority voters would cost them many an election.
Sure, it will benefit Democrats to universalize voter registration, and self-interest is a much more powerful motivator than respect for rights. But the Democrats would clearly have the latter on their side as well, if they had the gall to bring the issue up. When the government takes a right away, or makes it harder to exercise, that’s a much more serious offense than an individual’s abuse of her prerogative. So, ignore conservatives’ crocodile tears over voter fraud; New Jersey may be home to money-laundering mayors and kidney-selling rabbis, but it’s not, you know, Afghanistan.

In 2006 Michael E. Porter co-authored a text that would establish an intellectual framework informing the health care reform debate. Now the Harvard Business School professor will take a more active role in strategizing health care reform.
Porter signed on last week as a senior advisor to Medfusion, a leading provider of strategies for patient-to-provider communication.
Porter will join a management team  working to maximize this communication and to develop an improved health care system in the midst of a national debate. Porter called himself a “thought partner” to Medfusion, emphasizing that he will have a limited time commitment to the company, in an e-mailed statement.
Buck Goldstein, Chairman of the Board and University Entrepreneur in Residence for Medfusion praised the choice of Porter. “There’s probably no one in the world that combines as deep a knowledge of corporate strategy and health care reform.”
Medfusion connects doctors and patients electronically through a patient portal, Goldstein said.
“[Porter] and our company are clearly in agreement about the criticality of an electronic interface between patients and doctors,” Goldstein said.
“I am hoping that my work with Medfusion will help the company focus more and more attention on the patient outcome side of value improvement,” Porter said via e-mail, “My work shows that the best way to control health care costs is actually to improve patient outcomes, which reduces the need for expensive treatment.”
Porter serves as an adviser to a wide array of industries and governments. His clients range from the U.S. Executive Branch, to national leaders in Singapore and Rwanda, to the Boston Red Sox.
Since 2001 the competitive strategy expert has focused much attention on the healthcare system. Three years ago he co-authored “Redefining Health Care” with Elizabeth O. Teisberg, and his research underlies health care delivery curriculum at Harvard and other universities.
“An ideal health care system is one designed to deliver the maximum value for patients, measured by the health outcomes achieved per dollar spent,” Porter said.
“This will require restructuring how care is delivered to, among other things, improve patient engagement and education, and measure patient outcomes over time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Latina women from Harvard, local universities, and the surrounding community, in addition to others interested in issues facing Latinas, convened Saturday to discuss common concerns and learn skills for professional advancement at Latinas Unidas’ third annual day-long conference.
The gathering, newly dubbed the Latina Empowerment and Development (LEAD) Conference, brought together around 70 to 80 participants to meet others with similar interests and hear speeches from successful Latina women in a variety of fields.
The conference included panel discussions on topics such as “Checking the Box—What Does it Mean to be Latina?” and “Speak Up! Negotiation Strategies for Working Latinas,” as well as small-group workshops featuring Latina professionals in fields such as media, health, and politics.
“In general, the Latina community at large in the U.S. is facing a lot of adversity,” said Bianca M. Caban ’09, who organized the first conference in 2007. “It’s really important at Harvard for Latina women to see what other Latina professional women are achieving and to have them as role models.”
Becky H. Martinez ’11, the president of Latinas Unidas, said that one goal of the conference was to help Latina women at Harvard and in the local community focus on their strengths rather than the difficulties they face.
Panelist Alba E. Alvarez reinforced this point as she spoke about her life experiences, including being the only woman out of the 110 real estate agents at the company where she worked.
“I didn’t have any obstacles; the only obstacles are the ones we create,” said Alvarez. “Make your own road map of what you want.”
“It was good to hear about attitudes that Latinos, especially women, share. We need to be able to identify and market these attributes, as well as realize how they hinder us,” said Gloria J. Medina, a junior at Wellesley College.
Diana Sorensen, dean of arts and humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, addressed the group as the conference’s keynote speaker.
“Harvard has a lot of work to do to make underrepresented minorities advance beyond the fields we expect them to be in,” Sorensen said. “I’d love to see Latinas in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. We still tend to have underrepresented minorities in fields that have to do with their ethnicities.”
A native of Argentina, Sorensen talked about the important cultural traditions that Latinas bring to the U.S.
“We bring yeast to the social body, or bread, that is always getting cooked by each generation, and it’s our turn now to add richness,” she said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally endorsed U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano in the U.S. Senate race at the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston on Friday morning.
Capuano seeks to fill the Senate seat vacated by the death of the late Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 in August. This endorsement from the nation’s first female Speaker of the House is an important advantage in the race against opponent Attorney General Martha Coakley who, if elected, would be the eighteenth woman to serve in Congress and the state’s first female U.S. Senator.
Coakley’s campaign has looked to Massachusett’s women in politics, soliciting endorsements from Massachusetts Senate President Therese Murray and US Representative Niki Tsongas. Although Pelosi strongly supports the increased participation of women in government, her public support of Capuano is not necessarily surprising.
“Capuano is a colleague of Pelosi’s and they have worked together for a number of years in Congress, especially in dealing with health care,” said Eric M. Hanzich ’11, political director for the Harvard College Democrats. “Once that was passed, it seemed like a logical step for her to support him.”
The other Democratic candidates in the U.S. Senate race, Alan A. Khazei ’83 and Harvard Business School alumnus Stephen G. Pagliuca, must now determine how to recover from this endorsement.
“The way that you allocate money and the kind of organization that you build is very important,” said Hanzich. “Pagliuca is definitely helped by the amount of money that he has in the campaign.”
“Coakley, as attorney general, benefits from that political machinery,” Hanzich said, adding, “Khazei can find a lot of support from the students here at Harvard. He tries to inspire people through public service and that primary message resonates strongly within the Harvard community.”
Pelosi’s endorsement may also have implications for Republican candidates and members of the GOP.
“I think that it’s an opportunity for Republican candidates to distinguish themselves because there are many people who are unhappy with Washington and disaffected with Pelosi’s leadership,” said Colin J. Motley ’10, president of the Harvard Republican Club.
The primary election will be held on Tuesday, December 8. The special election to replace Kennedy in the US Senate will be on January 19, 2010.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In order for Arab nations to move forward in the modern world, countries in the region must work to reform their education systems, foreign relationships, and the structure of their governments, according to Rima Khalaf, a former United Nations assistant secretary-general and the keynote speaker at last weekend’s third annual Harvard Arab Weekend Conference.
While Khalaf lauded the increase in primary and secondary schools over the past 40 years, she said that the region continues to struggle with literacy.
“Arabs make about five percent of the world population but produce one percent of the books published,” she said.
Khalaf said that the Arab world still has a long way to go in terms of political and economic reforms.
While she said these challenges may impede Arab students from wanting to return to their countries, she encouraged them to serve as leaders and champion reforms within the region.
“I was debating whether or not I should [go back],” said molecular and cellular biology postdoctoral fellow Tala H. Fakhouri. “That encouraged me to go back.”
Graduate School of Design student Mais S. Al Azab said that she appreciated having an Arab voice represented at Harvard, and she called Khalaf’s speech  “fair to the heritage of the Arab cultures.”
Josh N. Weiss, associate director of Harvard’s Global Negotiation Project, agreed that Khalaf brought “balance” and an “important perspective” in her speech.
Khalaf’s speech was preceded by an introductory address by Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns and a welcome address by World Bank senior health policy specialist Sameh El-Saharty.
The Harvard Arab Weekend is a student-led conference organized by several Harvard Arab groups that brings together students and professionals to discuss issues facing the Arab world and increase Arab awareness at Harvard.
Fakhouri said she hoped that future Harvard Arab Weekends would draw more non-Arab students to help foster a better understanding of the Arab world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Brian T. Ru ’11—campaign manager of the Hayward-Zhang bid for leadership of the Undergraduate Council—strolled around the Quad Sunday morning on his iPhone, he said his interview with The Crimson wouldn’t have been possible without the leadership initiatives of George J.J. Hayward ’11.
Improved cell phone service in the Quad and the continuation of late-night shuttles shape the ticket’s proven track record in the area of student advocacy, according to the campaign’s supporters.
“We are a campaign that is driven by results,” said Ru, adding that he backed Hayward on the basis of the candidate’s persistence and efficiency in achieving tangible changes for his classmates.
Hayward and Felix M. Zhang ’11 “really have the pulse of the student groups” and they “can channel that into a concrete change,” said Senan Ebrahim ’12, chair of the UC Student Life Committee.
“There is not much convincing to do once you show someone what [they have] done,” Ru said.
GIVING RESULTS
Hayward’s supporters said his commitment to result-driven leadership and improving student life on campus qualify him to lead the UC.
“I have always known who George Hayward was and knew the work he was doing because he was always out there and always giving results,” Zhang said.
While Zhang acknowledged that “there are a lot of students that say that the UC doesn’t matter,” he noted that many Quad residents were better off as a result of Hayward’s advocacy on the UC.
In response to the College administration’s proposal to cut late night shuttle services to the Quad last spring, Hayward said he immediately solicited students’ input.
After sending out e-mail surveys and inviting classmates to call him with their concerns, Hayward said he received hundreds of replies that he compiled into a 75-page document and sent to House Masters.
“George Hayward, above all candidates, is the type of leader who will support student initiatives,” said Mallika Khandelwal ’11, chair of the UC Student Initiatives Committee. “His record points in that direction.”
In addition to highlighting Hayward’s immediate responsiveness to the needs of Quad residents, Hayward’s backers emphasized his persistence.
“He’s the type of person that will ask a question and he will ask it again and again and he will be persistent to the point of annoyance,” Khandelwal said. “He is not the type of person to say ‘I tried and it didn’t work—good effort George’ and pat himself on the back.”
APPROACHING THE ADMINISTRATION
Beyond improving undergraduate life through the UC, supporters say Hayward’s approach has been effective in drawing the attention of the College administration to student issues.
Hayward noted that when he attempted to address the problem of cell phone coverage in the Quad, he initially faced the administration’s skepticism, which at one point, questioned the necessity of cell phones at all.
But because he was able to make “clear the issue was a security problem,” Hayward said he was able to successfully enact a cell phone service tower in the Quad for AT&T—one of the most popular service carriers on campus.
“George Hayward is an innovative thinker,” Ebrahim said, noting that Hayward’s plan to improve cell phone service  in the Quad was a “solution no one else would have thought of.”
But staffers note that Hayward’s successes are not limited to the Quad, as the candidate plans to extend his advocacy across campus.
Specifically, Ru pointed to Hayward’s proposal to subsidize the cost of hiring a Harvard University Police Department officer at large-scale student events, currently a requirement when groups host more than 100 students.
Ru said that this change would provide a compromise between the administration and students regarding safety and the associated financial costs.
“It is a major concern for us and evidence of outside of the box thinking,” Hayward said. “We can protest all we want, but we have to offer new solutions, new ways to pitch to the administration in order to get things done.”
AN OUTSIDER’S PERSPECTIVE
Hayward’s running mate Zhang said he had significant outside experience that would complement Hayward’s work within the UC system.
While Hayward has had a notable presence on the UC, he has only led committees consisting of nine to 15 students.
“It is a challenge to mobilize upwards of 50 people effectively,” Ebrahim said.
Zhang said that his experience as a student group leader of larger organizations may mitigate concerns about Hayward’s ability to manage an organization the size of the UC.
In addition to his heavy involvement in the Chinese Students Association as vice president, Zhang also has experience working as a member of the Veritas Financial Group.
“He adds very valuable insight into what organizations have to go through to organize events,” Ru said, noting Zhang’s ability to handle publicity, funding and support for large events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council presidential candidate John F. Bowman ’11 and his running mate, Eric N. Hysen ’11, stand outside the Science Center in front of a neon green poster. With last year’s pop hits blaring from a boom box, Hysen engages passersby as Bowman breaks into a little dance.
The duo’s colossal poster—spanning four-by-eight feet—is hard to miss. Its shade of high-lighter green may be unusual for a political campaign, but, for these candidates, the poster’s color supposedly symbolizes their vision of change and fresh approach.
In addition, the candidates themselves may not be the stereotypical pair to make a bid for the helm of the UC. Supporters say that Bowman, who dons a green parka and jeans while campaigning, and Hysen, who sports a Mather sweatshirt over a polo, seem more relatable than the typical candidates.
The combination of their unique backgrounds and quirky personalities lend Bowman and Hysen an original angle on Harvard’s most pressing issues, particularly in the context of a financial downturn.
Although Bowman isn’t the “traditional politico”—according to Amanda Lu ’11, who handles student group outreach for the campaign—Bowman and Hysen have garnered the support of both the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club. As of last night, the South Asian Men’s Collective, the Environmental Action Committee, and the Alaska Klub—which has endorsed the winning ticket for the past six years—had also endorsed the Bowman-Hysen ticket.
THE ACTIVIST AND THE INSIDER
Bowman, a sociology concentrator in Pforzheimer House, and Hysen, a computer science concentrator living in Mather, say their individual experiences have informed both the way they’re running their campaign and the platform they’ve outlined to the student body.
Though Bowman has been a UC member only starting this academic year, he cites his experiences in activism as an asset to the ticket.
Bowman was first exposed to labor activism two years ago during the Hollywood writers’ strike. After subsequently joining the Student Labor Action Movement on campus, he helped organize demonstrations against Harvard’s layoffs. Bowman spent the last two summers in Los Angeles and Mexico City, where he assisted housekeepers and steelworkers, respectively, as they sought to unionize.
As the chair of the UC’s Budget Cuts Task Force, Bowman says that he has extensively studied the university’s endowment.
“Johnny taught me a lot of what I know about budget cuts,” said current UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10, who will not endorse any ticket.
After seeing the direct effects of budget cuts on student life, Bowman says he switched his focus in the UC, and is now a member of both the UC’s Student Life and Finance Committees.
“The notion that ‘if you’re not actively pushing for something on a daily a basis, then it doesn’t happen’ is something that wakes me up in the morning and keeps me going,” said Bowman, reflecting on his activism.
Hysen, on the other hand, is a veteran member of the UC. Having served since his freshman year, he says he rewrote the UC’s constitution last year and currently chairs the Rules Committee.
“Bowman brings outside leadership to the UC, and Eric Hysen has this inside leadership,” said Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, the campaign’s field director.
MONEY ON THE MIND
The candidates say the most pressing issues facing the undergraduate community are the repercussions of budget cuts, so they’ve highlighted several cost-neutral solutions in their platform.
This is where the duo says their slogan—“Real Leadership, New Solutions”—ceases being a gimmick and takes on practicality. Bowman and Hysen’s “New Solutions” comprise a range of ideas that will improve the lives of students without breaking the bank, they say.
“One of the biggest distinctions about this ticket is that they have a lot of cost-neutral ideas,” Flores said.
Drawing on Eric’s computer science savvy, Bowman and Hysen have proposed online initiatives, including adding an events calendar to the Web and a study guide database.
“[These] can be accomplished this year, but cost nothing, which is right now exactly what we need,” Bowman said.
Bringing back hot breakfast may also be a no-cost project. After conferring with Harvard University Dining Services, Bowman and Hysen say they found that hot breakfast could be offered in one House per neighborhood at no cost, though students would potentially have to sacrifice lunch at that House.
Last semester, students raised concerns with the College administration about the lack of transparency and student input that went into the first round of budget cuts. During this time, Bowman conceived of the “Idea Bank”—the online service in which members of the College community can suggest cost-cutting ideas. Both candidates say they’d like to see greater transparency on budget cuts, which they say would foster a more democratic process.
A MATCH BUILT ON ‘BROMANCE’
While canvassing in front of the Science Center, Bowman is in his element—relaxed as he speaks to undergrads he’s never met before. A member of the Spee and a resident of Pfoho’s Belltower—which has garnered a reputation for the parties it has hosted—Bowman said that he thinks that  his sociable nature would help draw in supporters.
And as for the comparably soft-spoken Hysen, he has an unassuming demeanor, which supporters say belies his intellect. He said he would work well as Bowman’s right-hand man, as he “can do a lot of the support work that’s not the glamorous stuff.”
“It was kind of like a bromance from the start,” Lu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert G.B. Long ’11 and David R. Johnson ’11 have been dreaming of taking the helm of the Undergraduate Council to steer it towards a brighter future—for all of two weeks.
“We got the sense that the student body was dissatisfied, and only a combination of Long-Johnson could please it,” said Long, UC presidential candidate, in an interview with The Crimson on Friday.
Describing the current UC as “masturbatory,” an arena where “would-be Senators can grand stand,” Long alluded to the two central foundations of the campaign: an expression of humor on a campus criticized for its sober, pre-professional seriousness, and also a genuine—albeit satirical—critique of the student government’s shortcomings.
Last Monday, Long and Johnson—roommates and social studies concentrators—kicked off the campaign season with their enthusiastic cadre of thirteen staffers. The group has certainly aroused interest on campus with their none-too-thinly veiled, innuendo-heavy slogans, entertaining Web presence, and unconventional campaign tactics.
“This is the most serious thing I’ve ever done,” Long said. “It’s the most serious thing Harvard students will see at their time here.”
SEXUAL HEALING?
Current UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said she disagreed with the ticket’s claims at seriousness, characterizing the pair as a “very friendly joke ticket” that—unlike some outsider tickets in the past—has not used its platform simply as a sounding board for hostility or belligerence towards the UC.
As seen in past UC elections, a variety of reasons motivate joke tickets to run, despite slim chances of victory, according to Flores. She speculated that Long and Johnson may have been compelled to run in light of their close friendship with UC vice-presidential contender Eric N. Hysen ’11, who lives in an adjacent suite in Mather.
Flores said she has “no sense” of the pair’s actual plans if elected, adding that she thinks they are “enjoying the public attention from their name formation.”
But Long failed to acknowledge the phallic reference latent in the ticket’s name. The only pun that could possibly lie in the name’s reading, he said, is “long johns [underwear] on.” On that note, the pair took off their pants during a recent On Harvard Time interview to proudly showcase their tight undergarments.
“I can see it,” Long said. “Long underwear is funny. But if people want to joke about long johns, they can do it on their own time.”
Humor is undoubtedly a defining element of the ticket. The home page of the campaign’s Web site features Long and Johnson’s faces superimposed over the bodies of UC presidential candidate Johnny F. Bowman ’11 and partner Hysen—but Long denied any connection, calling the similarities “eerie.”
The campaign’s three policy planks are “Liberating the Student Body,” ”Penetrating the Real Issues,” and “Going Deep Inside Budget Cuts.” Long said that the ticket’s two priorities are “Revolution and then J-Term,” the latter bolstered by proposals such as sponsorship of student- and faculty-initiated “mini-courses” and promotion of expanded housing opportunities for arts groups.
Upon receiving a mandate by the UC, Long and Johnson added a disclaimer to the platform page of their site, warning readers that a significant portion of their proposals are a “derivative” of Bowman and Hysen’s platform, and that Long and Johnson “believe our use of it to be fair as parody.”
According to the pair’s site, the Harvard Chess Club and the Harvard Armenian Society have declined to extend their endorsements. These same two groups are listed under a section named, “Groups we will abolish, if elected.”
A JOKE GONE TOO FAR?
The Long-Johnson ticket may not exactly cater to individuals desiring serious UC leadership, but many undergraduates said they embrace the light-heartedness and quirky enthusiasm that the pair offers to this year’s election season.
“I think they have a lot of heart and passion,” said Matthew G. Yung ’13, as he passed by a campaign rally outside the Science Center. “In terms of substance—well, it’s the UC. [But] if you have heart, you have my respect.”
Luke L. Sperduto ’11, friend and supporter of the ticket, also lauded the campaign’s energy and comedic value.
“I like the sentiment,” Sperduto said, standing in front of an eight-foot long sign of the ticket’s name. “I think that the UC takes itself way too seriously.”
While the jokes may have amused many students, the blatant sexual innuendos have turned off some voters. A member of the Radcliffe Union of Students—a feminist group on campus—expressed her concerns over the RUS e-mail list regarding the campaign’s use of the phrase “Long-Johnson never takes no for an answer.”
The individual, who requested to remain unidentified to avoid controversey, had been offended by the phrase’s implications of sexual assault or sex without consent, according to RUS President Diane J. Choi ’10. Long promptly apologized on behalf of the ticket for any possible offense, stating that the slogan “wasn’t supposed to sound like it’s about rape.”
Choi said that RUS’ concern focused on that one statement and that the group was not offended by the campaign’s other suggestive slogans, including, “Change is hard...so hard” or “Long-Johnson: It’s in your hands!”
“With humor, you often walk a fine line between being offensive and being funny,” Choi said. “But when you know that something is not serious, you give it more leeway than if you know they are actually serious about what they are saying.”
SOME HINTS OF LEGITIMACY
Although many students on campus view the Long-Johnson pair as a “joke ticket,” the candidates said they were serious about their efforts and offered a firm critique of the UC’s efficacy.
On Tuesday, campaign manager Michael J. Pankratz ’11 released a statement criticizing a recent Crimson article stating that the ticket was “taking the race less seriously.” Though Pankratz—a Crimson editor—recognized the “unorthodox” strategies of the campaign, he defended them as integral to distinguishing Long-Johnson from the other tickets.
Pankratz said that the campaign decided not to participate in the presidential debates—which some feel would have increased the ticket’s credibility—as a deliberate effort to highlight the forum’s failure to stimulate original dialogue and to showcase differences amongst the tickets.
In interviews with The Crimson, the campaign’s staffers said that the UC needs to prioritize realistic goals—a recognition that serves as a key difference between Long-Johnson and the other campaigns. Campaign members said they view the election as an opportunity to change students’ perception of the UC on campus and thereby increase its popularity and effectiveness.
And presentation can make all the difference, it seems. On Friday afternoon, Long called Johnson to organize their campaign efforts outside the Science Center, and his order was quick.
“Do you want to come at two and rally the people?” Long asked. “Do you have your shirt? Good. Don’t spill anything on it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economic experts pondered whether a different and more accurate economic health measurement system than GDP would have prevented the current global financial crisis during a panel at the Center for European Studies last Friday.
Harvard economics and philosophy Professor Amartya Sen and Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris economics professor Jean-Paul Fitoussi discussed their research on alternative ways of measuring the success of a society as part of a panel discussion organized by Center for European Studies visiting scholar Éloi Laurent.
Sen and Fitoussi were both members of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, a 20-person committee called together by French President Nicholas Sarkozy at the beginning of 2008 to determine a better technique to gauge the economic health of a nation.
The two economists presented the commission’s belief that their criteria of looking at income and consumption, happiness, objective measures of freedom, and freedom for well-being would provide a more accurate examination than GDP.
While higher GDP numbers are generally perceived to mean a country is more economically successful, Fitoussi, who joined the discussion through a video conference call, said that socially harmful activities can also lead to an artificial increase in a country’s GDP. For example, he said an increase in road traffic would drive up oil consumption and lead to larger GDP numbers that “obviously misrepresents the social wellbeing.”
While Sen said that these criteria would better measure economic success than GDP, they are not a “substitute for detailed analysis of social and economic conditions.”
He added that the lack of better indicators was not a valid excuse for not predicting the economic crisis.
“This was all evident with existing statistics,” Sen said. “That excuse—that we didn’t have the proper indicators—isn’t sufficient.”
European studies Professor Peter A. Hall and sociology Professor Michèle Lamont joined Fitoussi and Sen in presenting their work on the role of “the collective imaginary”—a group of people who form a perceived community—on “successful societies,” as Hall said.
Laurent said that the discourse between Sen, Fitoussi, Hall, and Lamont was even more “intellectually energetic” than he had expected.
“This was one of the best conferences in the now five years I’ve attended Harvard events,” said Jan Zilinsky ’09, a former Crimson editorial editor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update appended at 4:35 a.m.
With voting for the Undergraduate Council Presidential Elections opening at noon today, internal UC opinion remains divided between the two major tickets, Johnny F. Bowman ’11 with running mate Eric N. Hysen ’11, and rivals George J.J. Hayward ’11 with Felix M. Zhang ’11.
While more representatives have openly declared their support for Bowman-Hysen, Hayward-Zhang supporters claim the ticket has more backing from experienced members.
Currently 14 UC representatives have signed on to Bowman-Hysen’s official campaign staff, including Finance Committee Chair Amanda Lu ’11 and Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11. Only one UC representative, Education Committee Chair Kwang Y. “Joseph” Kim ’12, has joined the campaign staff for the Hayward-Zhang ticket.
UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said support within the UC this year is more “unbalanced” than in the past.
When Flores ran with current Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 against the other major UC ticket Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10 and Alneada D. Biggers ’10, Council opinion was evenly split between the two campaigns, which she said contributed to the tense, sometimes acrimonious political atmosphere that characterized last year’s elections.
“I think the Bowman-Hysen campaign did a very good job of contacting UC representatives very early on,” said UC member and Bowman-Hysen supporter Jade A. Clark ’11, when asked about internal Council support. “They do have an advantage in that they have a lot of the freshmen.”
Flores agreed, noting that campaigns with more freshmen supporters have  fared better in the past because of higher voting rates among first year students.
But some Council veterans said it would be inaccurate to judge Council opinion based on raw numbers, pointing out that many Bowman-Hysen supporters were UC members with relatively little understanding of UC history, such as freshmen or first-time representatives.
Support for the two UC tickets within the UC’s Executive Board, for example, is divided almost evenly, they said.
“The majority of experienced Council members are supporting the Hayward-Zhang ticket,” said Student Initiatives Committee Chair Mallika Khandelwal ’11, who is also a Hayward-Zhang supporter, though she is not on their campaign staff.
Both tickets continued to net endorsements from student groups over the weekend. Bowman and Hysen received the support of the Queer Students and Allies, the South Asian Men’s Collective, and the Alaska Klub.
Hayward and Zhang received an endorsement from The Harvard Crimson last night, in addition to endorsements from Perspective Magazine and cultural groups such as the Harvard Korean Association.
Outsider ticket Robert G.B. Long ’11 and David R. Johnson ’11 also received their first endorsement over the weekend from the Harvard Outing Club.

Update:
Following this article’s publication on thecrimson.com slightly after 2 a.m., Kim and Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12 contacted The Crimson to endorse the Hayward-Zhang ticket, emphasizing what they said was the pairing’s strong record of advocacy.
“I do support Hayward-Zhang,” Ebrahim said. “Their convincing brand of advocacy has brought me on board...[Hayward] is by far the most effective advocate I’ve seen on my time on the UC.”
Of the five committee chairs on the UC, three have now endorsed Hayward-Zhang. Kim has gone back and forth as a member of the ticket’s campaign staff, explaining that though he said he maintains his support for the pair, “the point of the UC isn’t the election—the point of the UC is actually doing advocacy work and working on our projects...officially signing on to a staff list takes away from actual mission of the UC.”
Kim has already expressed his intention to be re-added to the staff list and said that this will occur later this morning.
“The reason why I’m signing on right now is that I really feel that the only way I can actively campaign for George is being on the staff list,” Kim said.
Both Ebrahim and Kim agreed with Flores that the race is less charged within the Council than last year’s, which Ebrahim said makes the exact pulse of UC reps’ support “difficult to sense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Coca-Cola Company offered the American Academy of Family Physicians a six-figure grant through the AAFP’s new Consumer Alliance program, but a Harvard School of Public Health professor has called for the group to return the money.
In an open letter to the AAFP last week, HSPH Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition Walter C. Willett offered the Academy use of the School of Public Health’s “Nutrition Source” Web site, encouraging them to link to HSPH’s content rather than using the Coca-Cola funds.
The grant has been earmarked for the creation of nutritional education content on beverage choices for FamilyDoctor.org, the AAFP’s health resource Web site.
“[This corporate partnership] is horrible, because really what Coca-Cola’s buying is silence,” said Willett, who chairs the HSPH Department of Nutrition, in an interview Friday.
AAFP’s partnership with Coca-Cola has generated significant criticism. Many physicians and nutritionists have publicly demanded that the AAFP return the grant, and some members have resigned from the organization in protest.
Douglas E. Henley, CEO and executive vice president of the AAFP, said on Friday that the organization intends to separate funding sources from the content they support, adding, “There’s a thick, rigid firewall between the two” Henley said. He emphasized that the web content would be based on peer-reviewed literature, summarized by internal AAFP staff and outside medical experts.
“We certainly intend to point to the literature that links sugared beverages to other health conditions like obesity, dental care, and diabetes,” he said.
Henley said he appreciated Willett’s letter, but the AAFP has no plans to return Coca-Cola’s grant.
“Hold us accountable for the unbiased content we intend to develop, rather than just rushing to judgment on the partnership,” he said.
The Nutrition Source, created without industry funding, is maintained by HSPH faculty members, a dietician, and a science writer. A section entitled “Choosing Healthy Beverages” offers advice on controlling sugared beverage consumption.
Willett has publicly advocated against the distribution of high-calorie, high-sugar soft drinks in schools for years.
“Sugared beverages are at the top of the list [of threats to national health], along with smoking,” he said.
HSPH Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition Meir J. Stampfer was unaware of Willet’s letter, but co-signed an anti-Consumer Alliance letter addressed to Henley from the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
“It’s clear that [Coca-Cola’s] intention is to influence the marketing for sugared beverage products,” Stampfer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than a week after she oversaw passage of an historic health care bill in the House of Representatives, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.) described the difficulties of building consensus behind the controversial legislation to a packed forum at the Institute of Politics last Friday.
The event, a sit-down discussion between Pelosi and Center for Public Leadership Director David R. Gergen on leadership in a time of reform, was the most popular event at the IOP this year, according to Forum Committee Chair Christopher J. Hollyday ’11. More than 2,100 students and local residents entered a lottery for just 700 seats in the forum, Hollyday said.
Pelosi’s talk focused mostly on the process of shaping the health care bill and securing its passage in the House.
She emphasized her optimism that a final bill would eventually pass the Senate and reach President Obama’s desk.
“It’s pretty humbling, because this is the biggest initiative any of us in Congress will ever be a part of,” Pelosi said.
When the floor was opened for audience questions, Pelosi was repeatedly asked about the issue of abortion and the Stupak Amendment, an addition to the House health care bill that forbids the use of federal money to pay for abortion.
While she said that she had concerns about the amendment herself, Pelosi also emphasized that the central issue to health care reform needed to be affordable care for all, not abortion.
“There are some who do not support health care reform, who want to use this issue to eclipse all the other wonderful things that are in our bill,” she said.
Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in the history of American government, also discussed the importance of encouraging women to enter politics and spoke about the upcoming decision on increasing troop deployment to Afghanistan.
Students said they had mixed reactions to Pelosi’s talk.
“I think, specifically, the petition for her to come to Harvard this semester was important because it really shows the extent to which these leaders of our country now see the students on this campus as the next generation,” said
Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, who interned in Pelosi’s DC office this summer.
Ryan A. Hanley ’12 said he was disappointed with Pelosi’s response to his question concerning the possiblity of repealing the national Defense of Marriage Act.
The Defense of Marriage Act bans the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions.
“She had a lot to say, but it was kind of evasive and not really to the point,” Hanley said.
Caleb L. Weatherl ’10, who is also a current Crimson Editorial Editor, expressed disappointment that students had not posed tougher questions to the Speaker.
“I think it might have been more interesting had more people who don’t necessarily agree with her political views asked questions of her,” said Weatherl, who is also a former President of the Harvard Republican Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As time was running out in the first half of Saturday’s title-deciding game, Harvard football was down but not out. With 27 seconds on the clock, the Crimson received the ball after a Penn field goal made the score 17-0.
Harvard didn’t have great field position—a return from sophomore Matthew Hanson had put the team on its own 34—but the expected play would have been a long bomb to at least make a push for the endzone.
Instead, the Crimson knelt and let the clock run out—a play-it-safe strategy that continued even into the fourth quarter, when it became a two-score game.
With just under 10 minutes remaining in the game, Harvard was faced with a 4th-and-2 situation on its own 28. Rather than go for it, Crimson coach Tim Murphy called for his punt unit.
“We really felt like, law of averages, we were going to force a turnover in the weather, really being very aggressive on defense,” Murphy said. “I didn’t want to put us in a position with nine or 10 minutes left to panic.”
Harvard also didn’t take many risks with its play-calling, sticking mainly to runs up the middle from its tailback tandem of junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales to move the ball up the field, a strategy that wasn’t as successful as it had been throughout the season.
“Their coverage was pretty good,” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “Their rush was good, and they didn’t allow anything deep, so it was hard to get a big play.”
With Penn maintaining a stranglehold on the line of scrimmage, though, it was only when the Crimson did go to its riskier plays—long balls to junior wideouts Chris Lorditch and Marco Iannuzzi—that it put itself in position to score.
“I really felt like we had enough time, if we could get a turnover or some field position,” Murphy said. “And if we had cashed it in on the last one, onsides kick, we had a shot—but we just didn’t quite pull it off.”
BACK ON TOP
With Saturday’s win, Penn broke a six-season Ivy title drought—and in the process put a serious damper on the Crimson’s chances for a three-peat.
Now 6-0 in the Ivy League, the Quakers have clinched at least a share of the conference title, the team’s first since 2003. Penn finished third a year ago, one win behind co-champs Harvard and Brown.
The Crimson’s championship was only possible last year because the Quakers handed the Bears their only loss on the season—and if the matchup between Harvard and Penn had gone differently, the Quakers could have worn the Ivy crown a season earlier.
Then-junior Ryan Barnes picked off Penn quarterback Keiffer Garton in the endzone with 10 seconds remaining to preserve the 24-21 win—and his team’s title chances—while sending a rapidly-improving Quaker team to a disappointing finish.
“I’m more happy for our seniors,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “They played Harvard tough last year, and we came up a little short. This year, they were determined…I couldn’t be happier for them.”
Now heading into the last week of the season, the Quakers are in the driver’s seat. Penn is alone atop the Ancient Eight standings, and the Crimson needs to beat Yale and have the Quakers lose to a struggling Cornell team to claim a share of the title.
Though a crown is still possible, Harvard’s reign as Ivy champions is likely over. The team has secured at least a share of second place and will record its ninth consecutive winning season.
“It was the kind of game that we anticipated—hard-fought,” Bagnoli said. “We had to play for 60 minutes against a program that we have the ultimate respect for—with the job that Harvard has done, in terms of their consistency over the last five years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two undefeated teams. It was the No. 1 offense in the Ivy League against the No. 1 defense in the FCS. With stakes that high, Harvard coach Tim Murphy put it perfectly heading into the weekend:
“Something’s got to give.”
At least for the first half of Saturday’s contest between Crimson football and Penn, it was the No. 1 offense that broke down.
Having relied all season on its senior offensive line—featuring future NFL draft pick James Williams, as well as classmates Ben Sessions, Alex Spisak, and John Paris—Harvard could not hold up to the stifling Quaker defense that ranks first in the FCS in nearly every defensive category.
“I don’t think there’s any question that we felt that we would have to control the line of scrimmage to win this football game, and that was going to be a challenge,” Murphy said. “Their defense was as advertised. I thought in the second half we did a better job running the football…In the first half, we never got any momentum. We never got into any rhythm offensively and never got any field position, and that obviously put our back against the wall.”
“We knew this wasn’t going to be a track meet with the quality of both defenses and the weather conditions,” Murphy added. “We knew you had to make the very most of all your opportunities because you weren’t going to get as many. You weren’t going to get as many plays, you weren’t going to get as many drives, and you weren’t going to get as many red-zone chances.”
Penn held the Crimson to just 57 total yards in the first half, knocking Harvard quarterback junior Collier Winters back for 16 yards lost and forcing a fumble.
The Crimson couldn’t even manage a red-zone attack in the first half hour of play.
“I think the best thing they do, especially on a wet day when it’s harder to notice the speed difference, but they just don’t allow a whole lot of big plays,” Winters said. “So you just kind of have to chip away at them, but when you have the fumbles and penalties, it’s hard to do that.”
Junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales—used to picking up significant gains through the broad alleys opened up by their line—were held to just 26 net rushing yards in the first half.
“You want to make them play from behind against our defense,” Bagnoli said.
And though Harvard was able to get things going in the second half—finishing the game nearly even in terms of total yardage (250 total offensive yards to the Quakers’ 263)—it proved too little too late, as the Crimson faced a gaping 17-point deficit heading into the last two quarters.
“We were confident,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “There’s no reason for us not to be confident. Our kids were ready to play. We’re peaking at the right time.”
Saturday’s showdown between the opposing lines reached its apex late in the fourth quarter, when Harvard found itself on the Quaker half-yard line. The Crimson opted for the quarterback sneak, but Winters was unable to punch it in.
“The snap was fine, the three front D-linemen just kind of submarined our guys, and we didn’t really get a push, so I tried to take it around the edge,” Winters said.
“Our kids have been really resilient, and our defense has been stingy when they’ve had to be stingy,” Bagnoli said. “They came up with some huge plays, and there’s probably none bigger than stopping them on the six-inch line. We’ve been riding the backs of the defense the majority of the year. It was no different today.”
The play seemed a fitting end to a battle that had been hyped up for weeks. But in the end, something had to give, and Penn came out victorious.
“It’s been a long time coming,” said Penn tri-captain Chris Wynn, who laid the goal-line hit on Winters. “Best feeling of my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Revenge is sweet.
It’s even sweeter when it comes with a trophy.
In a game that was postponed for 24 hours due to Saturday’s heavy rain, the Harvard men’s soccer team clinched the Ivy League title yesterday, defeating Penn, 1-0, on Ohiri Field.
A year ago, the Quakers were the ones celebrating in the final conference game of the year. On that day, the Crimson dominated the match but gave up a soft overtime goal to hand the championship to Penn.
While the Quakers may have been out of the running for the crown this year, the game didn’t mean any less to Harvard. Win, and the Crimson was guaranteed sole possession of the title. Anything else wouldn’t cut it.
Adding to the excitement surrounding the match was the fact that it came on Senior Day—a chance for the Crimson to celebrate what might be the greatest recruiting class in the history of Harvard soccer.
But in the biggest game of the season, an unlikely pair of underclassmen came up with the heroics.
With the score knotted at zero in the 68th minute, sophomore Tim Linden—who had entered the game just two minutes earlier—found himself with space on the left. Linden curled in a cross towards the back post that flew over the heads of the Penn back line.
The ball fell to freshman defender Richard Smith—still in the box from a corner a few seconds earlier—who directed his first-time shot towards the right side of the goal. Despite getting his hands on it, Quakers’ freshman keeper Garon Smith was unable to stop the ball from trickling into the net.
It was Richard Smith’s first goal of his Crimson career, and it couldn’t have come on a bigger stage.
“He was just there at the right time, and sort of stuck his foot out,” co-captain Andre Akpan said.
Smith has combined with senior Kwaku Nyamekye in the center of Harvard’s defense, helping to anchor a unit that has been one of the nation’s best this season.
The two massive defenders made their work look very easy in a first half in which the Crimson dictated the play.
The field was still soaked from the previous day’s downpour, but that didn’t stop Harvard from creating chances right from the start.
In the ninth minute, a long cross from sophomore defender Baba Omosegbon found senior midfielder Desmond Mitchell at the back post.
Mitchell headed back across goal to freshman striker Brian Rogers, whose header forced Garon Smith to make a good save to his right.
Later in the half, Garon Smith made another fine save to stop Crimson senior midfielder Adam Rousmaniere’s shot from a tight angle.
“In the first half, our guys played almost some of our best stuff—they moved the ball, they connected,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “This is almost the best that we’ve played in a month.”
But despite its dominance, the Crimson couldn’t find a goal and went into the break tied. And after controlling the match’s first 45 minutes, Harvard was suddenly thrust into the back seat.
In the 50th minute, Penn hit the crossbar. Seven minutes later, the Quakers again came inches away from taking the lead.
Sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms made a spectacular save, and Nyamekye followed with a last-ditch block on the rebound, to keep the score level.
“I thought [Nyamekye] was very, very good in the second half,” Clark said. “He really fought and worked for us.”
Harvard, led by co-captain Brian Grimm, soon regained its foothold. In the 60th minute, Grimm took possession of the ball in midfield before firing just wide. A minute later, he tried his luck again from afar but shot straight at the keeper.
After the Crimson finally broke the deadlock with Richard Smith’s 68th-minute goal, the team looked determined not to let the lead slip away.
Harvard remained on the attack for the remainder of the game, although it never managed to score a second goal. A couple of scrambles around the Penn box following Crimson set pieces would be the closest either team would come.
With the win, Harvard’s five seniors—Akpan, Grimm, Mitchell, Nyamekye, and Rousmaniere—claimed their second Ivy title.
“After winning that first year, it’s always the goal to win another one,” Grimm said. “It took a little longer than I hoped, but you couldn’t ask for a better end.”
“We had a phenomenal class and kind of changed the face of the program for the last three years,” Akpan said. “Hopefully we set the tone for years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trailed by a throng of ecstatic teammates, co-captain Jeremy Lin leapt and ran up the wall at the near end of Lavietes Pavilion. It was an appropriate celebration for Harvard’s superhero, who had just come up huge in the clutch yet again.
The star guard nailed a 30-foot desperation shot as the buzzer sounded, ending a three-overtime thriller and giving his team an 87-85 win over William & Mary in the home opener for the Crimson (2-0).
“That was a prayer—God just guided it into the hoop, that’s the best way I can describe it,” Lin said.
Guard Quinn McDowell had a game-high 23 points for the Tribe (0-2), which trailed much of the contest before rallying from 13 points down to force overtime.
Neither team could maintain a lead for the first two extra five-minute periods, but it looked like William & Mary had finally grabbed the advantage for good, when guard Sean McCurdy banked in a layup with four seconds to play, putting the Tribe up, 85-84.
Everyone in the building knew who would end up with the ball.
Taking the inbound pass with time ticking away, Lin sprinted down the floor and was bumped near the half-court line. Unfazed, he took a couple more steps inside the marker and ran into a Tribe defender, who sent him tumbling to the ground—but not before Lin let fly with one of the biggest and most improbable shots of his career.
He likely would have been granted three foul shots if the long try had not gone in, but the outcome suited Lin just fine.
“I had free throws coming up, but I’m just glad I didn’t even have to worry about that,” Lin said. “We’ll take that at this point.”
Though he led his team with 19 points and nine assists, Lin didn’t do it alone. His fellow stalwart in the backcourt, sophomore Oliver McNally, had 17 points, including a three-pointer on his team’s first possession in the third overtime.
But in a matchup dominated by the play of guards, the Crimson frontcourt came through in the end.
“[Senior] Pat [Magnarelli] and [sophomore] Keith [Wright], those two guys in particular, were the difference for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Wright and Magnarelli combined for 24 points and 14 rebounds, much of which came after regulation ended.
In only his second game since an injury prematurely brought his season to a close two years ago, Magnarelli played 23 minutes and had a key dunk and block in the first overtime.
“I felt pretty good out there, just trying to get back to my sophomore year,” the senior forward said.
But a sore spot came with less than 20 seconds to play, when Magnarelli snagged a key rebound of a William & Mary three-pointer and was subsequently fouled. He had a chance to extend the Crimson advantage to three, but both of his free throws rimmed out, allowing the Tribe a chance to take back the lead.
“The only way that Pat could have capped it...would have been to make those two free throws,” Amaker said. “Other than that, he was absolutely outstanding.”
As a part of the Crimson’s efforts to move to a smaller, three-guard lineup, the sophomore center Wright didn’t play most of the second half, and his absence was noticeable.
“We have a bad habit of not running any offense, just stalling for twenty seconds,” Magnarelli said. “In the second overtime, we got the ball down low to Keith, and he got two or three quick buckets.”
Wright rose to the occasion when he reentered the game.
He opened up the third overtime with a help-side block of a layup attempt, and a minute later spun and banked in a shot in the post to give Harvard the lead.
“I thought he ran with it and did the best we’ve seen him play,” Amaker said.
Crimson defensive lapses had allowed the Tribe to claw its way back from a 13-point deficit during regulation. William & Mary had 18 attempts at the line in the second half and seized a 14-2 advantage in second-chance points.
But the Crimson ultimately took the win, and relished in  the drama of its victory.
“In the past, we’ve lost these types of games in overtime—tough games where it’s back-and-forth the whole game,” Lin said. “I think just being able to pull through was huge for our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—Catching his breath in front of his own basket, guard Jeremy Lin clapped his hands once, twice, three times. The Harvard co-captain needed no words in urging his teammates to get back on defense while silencing an enemy crowd of over 3000. He let his game do all the talking. Lin had a game-high 24 points—including a dunk that sparked an 18-3 run midway through the second half—to lead the Crimson (1-0) past Holy Cross 87-77 at the Hart Center Friday night.
“It’s always special to have a chance to open up the season with a victory, to win a game on the road...I was really proud of our guys,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Crusaders (0-1) were powered by junior forward Andrew Keister’s team-leading 22 points and eight rebounds, but their first-year coach Sean Kearney had his debut spoiled.
“We were pretty much toe-to-toe most of the night…all of a sudden we’re down nine or ten after being tied, and we never really recovered from that,” Kearney said.
As was the case in the Crimson’s win over Holy Cross a year ago, Lin—who had all but three of his points in the second half—proved to be the difference.
“As always—I sound like a broken record—Jeremy Lin was sensational,” Amaker said.
With 11 minutes to go and the local rivals knotted at 49, the backcourt star faked a shot and weaved his way into the lane. His two-handed jam in traffic broke the tie and was followed on the other end with a block by senior Pat Magnarelli. The oft-injured forward, playing in his first game in nearly one and a half years, had a solid night on both ends of the floor, leading his team with six rebounds.
The next Harvard offensive possession ended with a three-pointer from freshman Dee Giger in the right corner, and the sharp-shooting rookie would return the next time down the floor to drill another crucial triple, this one from the opposite side.
“It all started going in to [sophomore center Keith Wright] and then passed it back out, and the first one got things rolling,” Giger said.
A Crusader turnover then left Lin all alone with the ball, and he punctuated the break-away with another slam—one-handed, no less—to complete a 10-0 Crimson run. Holy Cross guard Andrew Beinert brought the bleeding to an end with a jumper, but the damage was done, as the visitors would lead the rest of the way. The Harvard advantage would stretch as far as 15 points. The Crusaders were able to cut the deficit into single digits with less than three minutes to go, but Harvard took time off the clock and shot well from the free throw line to seal the final outcome.
The Crimson had come into the contest playing the role of the underdog, as Holy Cross had been picked to finish first in the conference by the preseason voters of the Patriot League. But Amaker took advantage of his depth early, and the reserves responded in a big way.
“When we came in, we were ready to go…every time we subbed in, we took a step forward,” said Giger, who had 13 points, second in team scoring only to Lin.
Fellow freshman Kyle Casey also made a nice showing coming off the bench. The rookie showcased his athleticism, finishing strong inside for 12 points and collecting five rebounds and two blocks.
The two teams were even for much of the first half before the Crusaders went on a 13-2 run to take a 30-25 lead with under four minutes left.
Lin, who also had seven assists, would score his first two points of the game on a tough lay-up a minute later. Freshman point guard Brandyn Curry followed with a gorgeous touch pass to Wright for a wide-open lay in, setting off a nine-point Crimson spurt to take a 34-30 lead into halftime.
Holy Cross managed to grab a slim three-point lead on a Keister layup inside five minutes into the second frame, but a three-pointer by sophomore guard Oliver McNally caromed up off the rim and into the net to tie things up. The Crimson shot 52 percent from the field and took 35 foul shots, most of which came in the second half. McNally contributed 11 points on six-for-six shooting at the line, and 10 of Lin’s points came on free throws.
“I think we put them on the line too much with our fouling, but I think especially Lin puts a lot of pressure on you with his driving,” Kearney said. “That really was a significant part of the outcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing last season with only a handful of healthy players sitting on his bench, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker made up for lost time on Friday night in the Crimson’s 87-77 win against Holy Cross, going to his reserves early and often.
Just six minutes into the first half, 11 Crimson players had seen the court, and by the end of the frame, 10 players had put points on the board.
“I thought one of the biggest reasons for our victory was having fresh bodies and everybody contributing,” Amaker said. “We talked about that coming into this game—that we wanted to utilize a lot of bodies and rotate players in and keep people fresh.”
When it was all said and done, the Harvard bench combined for 36 points compared to the 19 points put up by the Crusader bench.
“I think that they were able a little bit more, especially in the first half, to keep fresh bodies coming at us,” said Holy Cross coach Sean Kearney.
Less than three minutes into the game, freshmen Kyle Casey and Christian Webster and sophomore Andrew Van Nest made their first appearances in Harvard uniforms.
By the 13:46 mark, freshmen Brandyn Curry and Dee Giger and senior Pat Magnarelli had checked in. Giger, along with Casey, led the way for the Harvard bench—the pair finished with 13 and 12 points, respectively.
“Come off the bench, start the game, it really doesn’t matter to me,” Casey said. “The biggest thing is that after the game we got the win.”
SENDING A MESSAGE
Crimson fans no longer have to rely on YouTube slam-dunk contest videos as proof of forward Kyle Casey’s athleticism. The Harvard freshman has finally stepped onto the hardwood—and appears to be as advertised.
The 6’7 forward with a 38-inch vertical entered Friday’s game with 17:03 remaining in the first half and immediately made his presence felt.
On his first offensive possession, Casey set a hard screen for co-captain Jeremy Lin on the wing. Lin fed Casey the ball as he rolled to the basket, and the freshman exploded to the hoop, scoring and drawing a foul.
On the defensive end, Casey demonstrated his vertical leap, swatting away a ball that floated above the rim.
“He jumps out the gym,” Lin said.
Unfortunately for Casey, the ball was on its descent and he was whistled for goaltending.
“I mean it’s good to send the message, ‘It’s going be a grind it out game, nothing easy, nothing easy around the rim especially,’” Casey said.
In addition to his two cleanly blocked shots, Casey finished with 12 points and five rebounds.
“Kyle is going to have, we think, a very good career here and, I think you saw some of the reasons why we feel that way,” Amaker said. “He’s active, he’s athletic, and he’s aggressive.”
With that said, Casey fell victim to a number of rookie mistakes. On top of his goaltend, Casey was responsible for a three-second violation and found himself in foul trouble.
“I was disappointed with a couple of the silly fouls he made, but that’s typical of a freshman,” Amaker said.
FASHIONABLY LATE
Despite finishing with typically impressive offensive numbers of 24 points and seven assists, it took some time for Jeremy Lin to get things going.
Facing double teams on the perimeter throughout the fist half, Lin’s first shot attempt did not come until 12 minutes had ticked away—Harvard star connected on his first basket with 2:40 remaining in the first period.
For most teams, it’s a bad sign when the leading scorer struggles to get shots. But the Crimson kept the score tight throughout the period and took the lead heading into the break following a five-point surge by Lin to close out the half.
A large part of Harvard’s first-half success was conditional upon Lin’s ability to distract opposing defenses and facilitate his team’s offense.
“He’s going to be a magnet [for defenses], and we’ve talked to him a lot about making the play, not necessarily trying to make the shot,” Amaker said. “He’s a playmaker for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his inspirational locker room speech in “Any Given Sunday,” Al Pacino’s character Tony D’Amato, coach of the fictional Miami Sharks, states, “The inches we need are everywhere around us.”
For the Harvard football team, the inches it needed were right in front of it on Saturday against Penn (7-2, 6-0 Ivy), but they ultimately proved too elusive for the Crimson (6-3, 5-1 Ivy) in a 17-7 loss.
In what—in all likelihood—served as the Ivy League championship game, Harvard faced a 4th-and-1 well inside the one-yard line with 2:49 left in the final quarter.
Junior quarterback Collier Winters took the snap and tried to run up the middle, but a wave of Quaker defenders plugged the hole. Winters changed course and wrapped around to the outside, but Penn cornerback Chris Wynn was waiting. Wynn hit Winters, and Winters hit the ground, arm and ball outstretched. The referees conferred and marked Winters down just inches shy of the endzone.
The play effectively ended the Crimson’s comeback attempt, as well as its aspirations for a third-straight Ivy League title, giving the Quakers the Ancient Eight crown for the first time since 2003.
“It took me a minute to believe it,” Wynn said. “I looked for a flag or something. It’s a hard thing to describe. It’s been a long time coming...Best feeling of my life.”
In the days leading up to the game, the contest was hyped as a matchup between Harvard’s Ivy-best offense and Penn’s top-ranked defense. But the Quakers showed the most offensive prowess early on, scoring on their first possession, when Penn quarterback Kyle Olson hit receiver Marcus Lawrence on a screen pass. Lawrence found himself with an open field in front of him and took full advantage, sauntering into the endzone for a 51-yard touchdown reception.
“The ball came out like a wet fish,” Olson said. “I was thinking, ‘Oh no, it’s going to hit the ground.’ He caught it...and he just broke away. Marcus is one of the fastest guys on the team, and he really showed it.”
The teams held each other scoreless for the rest of the first quarter, but Penn struck again in the opening minutes of the second. The Quakers blocked a punt by senior Thomas Hull, giving them excellent field position on the Harvard 29-yard line. Olson worked his way up the field, eventually running the ball in himself from the one to give Penn a 14-0 lead.
The Quakers tacked on three more points with a field goal in the last minute of the half to head into the locker room on top, 17-0—a margin made more daunting by heavy rain that soaked up the field throughout the game.
“A score is like 10 points instead of seven points in a weather game with really outstanding defenses,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “There’s no question that at halftime our back was to the wall.”
But the Crimson defense rallied in the second half, holding Penn scoreless and giving its offense a chance to make a comeback.
“We didn’t do too much different, we just executed better,” said Harvard captain and defensive lineman Carl Ehrlich. “We came out in the first series, and they made a couple big plays on us. We played on our heels a little bit. The second half, we got ready in the locker room, we got focused.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, it could not take advantage of its newfound defensive stinginess, stymieing its own offensive momentum with costly turnovers.
On Harvard’s first possession of the second half, junior wideout Adam Chrissis fumbled the ball away at the Penn 38. After a quick Quakers three-and-out, the Crimson commited another turnover—this time a fumble by rookie running back Treavor Scales.
“It hurts the drive every time you get a penalty or a turnover—especially against a good defense,” Winters said. “It’s hard to make it back up.”
Hard as it was, the Crimson tried.
With 2:58 left in the third quarter, Harvard finally broke through against the Penn defense when Winters launched a deep ball that landed in junior receiver Chris Lorditch’s hand for a 45-yard touchdown to make it a 17-7 Quakers lead.
But the Crimson’s comeback trail ended there. Harvard failed to generate any offensive opportunities throughout the fourth quarter, until Winters drove the ball down the field late in the frame, only to fall short by a matter of inches.
“Our kids I thought played extremely hard,” Murphy said. “I’m really proud of their effort, but Penn made more plays than we did, and they made a few less mistakes, and, as I said, they deserved to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The saying goes that once a player scores a first goal, the rest will follow. This was true when Harvard first visited Boston College on Sept 18, losing 4-1 to a team efficient in scoring. But on Friday night, as the Crimson (9-6-1) again arrived at the No. 7 Eagle’s (15-3-2) home turf, only one goal came. But that’s all BC would need to assure the 1-0 victory.
In the first round of the NCAA playoffs, the second appearance in two years, Harvard again fell to a ranked opponent. But the Crimson can rest assured that it held off a team that outshot it 20-1 until the 46th minute.
Only 32 seconds into the second half, Eagles junior Amy Caldwell took the ball off of a pass from teammate Victoria DiMartino and sent it behind Harvard senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann. Fortunately for Boston College, Caldwell scored the only goal of the game.
“We lost to a great team, that’s the way it goes, but not because we didn’t put in everything we had—every ounce we had,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said.
Prior to that, Harvard’s defense provided an impenetrable wall. Behind the defense, Mann was there with ten saves, proving once again why she is third in program history for career saves with 280.
“They had the offensive lead on us, but our defense held strong and made it known that it would take a lot to get by us,” Mann said.
Boston College coach Alison Kulik also emphasized the strength of Harvard’s defense and Mann, who only allowed one goal out of 20 shots. Kulik’s goalkeeper, Jillian Mastroianni, had zero saves.
“Harvard began dropping back with numbers, and we didn’t do a good job penetrating early,” Kulik said.
As the rest of the second half developed, the Crimson had trouble finding a way to get the ball into the net, or even take a shot. Melanie Baskind had the only attempt for the Crimson.
Despite the defeat, the team walked away with not just disappointment but also pride.
“Going into it, we had nothing to lose,” senior co-captaing Lizzie Nichols said. “In terms of the game itself, you have to be absolutely plugged in at every second of the game.”
For seniors Mann, Nichols, Christina Hagner, and Kelli Okuji, this final score marked the end of a long process starting from their freshman year, when the team had just lost another coach, to winning an Ivy League championship in their last year.
“The spring during my freshman year, for a period of time we didn’t have coaches, and we just worked harder than any other team we’ve ever been on and just made an unspoken pact that this was not how the next three years were going to go,” Nichols said.
Leone especially understood the importance of the senior class, his first Harvard group to graduate.
“They were the four cornerstones of this whole team, and they are going to be definitely missed for a long time,” he said.
From the changes and perseverance of their first years, the seniors aimed to emphasize resilience and togetherness throughout this past season.
“That is what has brought us to this success: facing adversity and not backing down, pushing forward and not settling,” Nichols said.
Friday’s game illustrated this ability to bounce back, especially after a disappointing 1-5-1 pre-season.
“More than a result, I wanted to see the measuring stick of how we improved, and I think we showed that,” Leone said. “We were fitter, we were crisper in how we played, and it was a good soccer game.”
In addition to individual improvement, Harvard was able to halt Boston College’s notorious attack through experience.
“We’re more played in,” Leone explained of the Crimson’s ability to hold the Eagles to one goal. “We’ve been in a lot of tough battles. I can’t even believe some of the things we have done this year.”
Continuing to push forward in tough battles, Harvard hopes to have the same success next year, now that both the sophomores and freshmen have never been without an Ivy League championship during their college career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell and Dartmouth weren’t ready for an underclassmen onslaught Saturday.
While their teammates were at Blodgett in an intra-squad scrimmage, the freshmen and sophomores of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving teams were in Ithaca, N.Y., defeating the Big Red, 166-129, and the Big Green, 203-92.
“We’ve always prided ourselves on the depth on our team,” junior Katherine Pickard said. “So it was awesome.”
Freshman Brittany Powell made a statement early in winning the one-meter and three-meter diving events. Typically, the diving events are held at the same time as the swimming events, but the Cornell pool didn’t have a separate diving well.
This meant that the diving events preceded both the men’s and women’s swimming events and that Powell and the other divers performed in front of their swimming teammates.
“Brittany’s a wonderful diver,” said junior Christine Kaufman, the lone upperclassman at the meet.
According to Pickard, the team elected to send Kaufman as a leader for the young Crimson squad. The junior made a statement of her own with her victories in the 200- and 500-yard freestyle.
“[Christine] was kind of our captain for the meet,” said Harvard assistant coach Matt Davidson. “She set the tempo for the girls…The biggest part of our success was Christine’s Kaufman—her swimming and her leadership. She set the tempo in and out of the pool. She’s absolutely unbelievable.”
Following Kaufman in the 200 freestyle were freshmen Christine Hughes and Camille Hendrix. The event was not the team’s only sweep of the day, as freshman Mackenzie Luick and sophomores Helen Pitchik and Alicia Lightbourne repeated the feat in the 100 breaststroke, and freshman Ellie Johnson, sophomore Monica Burgos, and freshman Kelly Robinson swept the top spots in the 50 freestyle.
Meanwhile, sophomores Catherine Zagroba and Meghan Leddy took first and second in the 1,000 freestyle, a feat matched by Hendrix and Johnson in the 100 free.
“That was a very high energy race,” Leddy said. “I could see Catherine out the hole. I couldn’t see the Cornell girl until my teammates were pointing. It was definitely a painful way to see it, but it got the atmosphere going. Honestly just seeing everyone cheering helped because I was in the lane next to the wall.”
“In the 1000, she touched the girl from Cornell by a tenth of a second,” said Harvard assistant coach Matt Davidson.
“That’s a ten-minute and 26-second race, and she was tough enough to put her head down and get it done. It was the first individual event. It set the tone. It speaks to her toughness and versatility,” he added.
Leddy also took first in the 200 backstroke.
“Meghan is our top 200 backstroker,” Davidson said. “But her times are very strong in her distance events. Meghan would be the top distance swimmer for a lot of schools.”
“We need backstrokers, so Meghan swims backstroke,” Davidson later added.
But while the backstroke may be the go-to event for Leddy for most of the season, Davidson says he was most impressed by her finish in the thousand Saturday.
Davidson was acting as the head coach for the day, with the Crimson’s regular skipper, Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92, nursing her new baby.
As for the team’s upperclassmen, they were competing against each other in an intra-squad match.
“They went very fast,” Kaufman said. “It was important to our coach that our whole team got up and raced. The whole team was fast this weekend.”
The full team will join forces next weekend at the Harvard Invitational
“We’re going to push each other in practice to race in the Invitational next weekend,” Hughes said. “I’m looking forward to having my first meet with the whole team. It’s nice to have upperclassmen there too.”

As of tonight, The Crimson officially endorses Hayward-Zhang for the ’09-’10 UC President and Vice-President. Although the policy platforms of the Bowman-Hysen and Hayward-Zhang tickets are very similar, we believe George J.J. Hayward ’11, a Crimson editorial writer, and Felix M. Zhang ’11 have a track record that proves they will implement their proposals. Hayward’s accomplishments include obtaining cell phone service for AT&T users in the Quad, erecting ATMs in the Quad and the MAC, and persuading administrators not to reduce the shuttle schedule. When he ran for UC Representative, Hayward promised such results—and he delivered. As UC President, he ostensibly will do for the entire student body what he has done for his current constituents. More after the jump.
Notably, Hayward frequently polls students and delivers their messages to administrators in order to inject a student voice into whatever decisions they make. We are hopeful that he will change the culture of the UC by appealing to a broader base of students and involving voices other than the 51 UC Representatives when trying to bring about change. With further budget cuts looming and time ticking on problems like the lack of social space around campus, it is essential for the UC to respond to students’ desires and make a tangible difference. We are confident that Hayward and Zhang are the best option to make all students’ hopes a reality.

Budget cuts have taken a toll on one of the most storied Harvard traditions: The Game.
Due to cuts within the Harvard Athletic Ticket Office, undergraduate tickets to this weekend’s Harvard-Yale Game are only available across the river at the Murr Center. No easy dash to Memorial Hall like last year. Sure, you can get a friend to pick one up for you if you make a copy of your Harvard ID, but your friends probably don't want to walk over there either.
And as if making the trek across the river wasn’t enough, you also have to pay $15 for a ticket. Those were definitely free last year.
While you’re out and about, don’t forget to make a trip to the Holyoke Center to buy a $40 bus ticket to New Haven from the Harvard Box Office. School spirit sure isn’t cheap.
Here’s a recap of all the details you need to get yourself into the Yale Bowl:
Undergraduate Ticket to The Game: $15 at the Athletic Ticket Office in the Murr Center, open Monday - Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Bus Ticket to New Haven: $40 at the Harvard Box Office in the Holyoke Center, open Tuesday - Sunday, noon to 6 p.m.
