BEST PICTURE
The Big Short
Bridge of Spies
Brooklyn
Mad Max: Fury Road
The Martian
The Revenant
Room
Spotlight

Who should win: “Room”
"Room" is a heartbreaking, beautifully crafted film carried by two stellar performances from Brie Larsen and Jacob Tremblay.  For a low-budget adaptation of a novel featuring largely unknown actors, with a scope as unassuming as its title would suggest (the pervasive sense of claustrophobia is as integral to "Room" as the boundless natural landscape is to the leading contender for Best Picture, "The Revenant"), it did much better than could have ever been expected.  Unfortunately, it’s probably too quiet a film to win the Academy’s self-fulfilling box-office imprimatur.
Who will win: “The Revenant”
Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu is on a roll: He won Best Director and Best Picture for "Birdman" last year, and he's likely to do it again with his newest film, a period piece starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the Canadian/Argentinian wilderness, a whole lot of gruesomeness, and a bear.

DIRECTING
Adam McKay, The Big Short
George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road
Alejandro G. Iñárritu, The Revenant
Lenny Abrahamson, Room
Tom McCarthy, Spotlight

Who should win: “Spotlight”
Director Tom McCarthy created a decidedly unglamorous newsroom drama featuring spectacular ensemble acting.  Serious actors and difficult subject matter are arguably even more difficult to wrangle with than a simulated bear.
Who will win: “The Revenant”
Iñárritu will most likely go two for two, winning both Best Director and Best Picture again this year for "The Revenant," which required filming in extraordinarily difficult conditions.

ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE
Bryan Cranston, Trumbo
Matt Damon, The Martian
Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant
Michael Fassbender, Steve Jobs
Eddie Redmayne, The Danish Girl

Who should win among the nominees: Michael Fassbender, "Steve Jobs"
On the whole, this category was weak this year, but Michael Fassbender stands out. Though an unlikely choice to play the American icon, he was able to deliver a nuanced performance.
Who should really win: Jason Tremblay, "Room"
Nine-year-old Tremblay delivered a mature and poignant performance in a very challenging role.  Unlike all of the actual nominees, he did not have to contend with the type of showy "challenge" that has characterized Oscar-winning leading roles in recent years (e.g., "portraying an icon," "acting in space," "gender identity crisis," "fighting a bear/fighting frozen rivers/eating liver/eating bone marrow/crawling inside horse carcasses/being eaten by maggots"). His flawless performance rested on his own talent, as well as the considerable skill of director Lenny Abrahamson, who had the courage and/or wisdom to keep the kid on screen for the entire film. Latest word is that Abrahamson is lobbying for a “special Oscar” for Tremblay, who already won the Critics’ Choice Best Young Actor Award.
Who will win: Leonardo DiCaprio, "The Revenant"
It's finally happening—after a lifetime making large-budget films, DiCaprio will actually win an Academy Award. One wonders why it has taken so long and whether there might be a good reason for it. One is told to be quiet.

ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE
Cate Blanchett, Carol
Brie Larson, Room
Jennifer Lawrence, Joy
Charlotte Rampling, 45 Years
Saoirse Ronan, Brooklyn

Who should win: Brie Larson, "Room"
Larson delivers a stunningly unaffected performance as a young woman imprisoned in a shed for seven years by a kidnapper who habitually rapes her, a young woman whose only solace is the five-year-old son her rapist fathered. Her son, kept out of sight in a tiny nook when her kidnapper returns each night, compels Larson’s character to imagine and narrate an alternate version of reality, to attempt to mitigate the existential terrors of their total vulnerability and dependence, and to construct and enact daily routines for surviving “life” within an 8 by 10 box.  Relatively unknown before this release, Larson and co-star Jason Tremblay surpass what seems humanly possible in the difficult roles they take on with apparent ease, in contrast to the finely delivered but predictable performances of every other best actress and actor nominee this year.
Who will win: Brie Larson, "Room"
Although she is and has been in competition with such high-profile former Oscar winners as Cate Blanchett and Jennifer Lawrence, Larson has already taken home the SAG Award, BAFTA, and Golden Globe for her performance in "Room." She seems poised to add an Oscar to her collection.

ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE
Christian Bale, The Big Short
Tom Hardy, The Revenant
Mark Ruffalo, Spotlight
Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies
Sylvester Stallone, Creed

Who should win: Mark Rylance, “Bridge of Spies”
The British stage actor is perfection in his first major Hollywood film, playing a captured English-born Soviet spy facing judgment in the United States. In this understated role, the intelligence of each purposefully confined look the literally confined Rylance delivers goes far beyond or beneath the Cold War character part he plays. The brief “standing man” narrative Rylance performs (a gem equal to any in the Joel and Ethan Coen script anthology) deserves, were such possible, an Oscar of its own. It is the season for what may be the last (and certainly the best) incarnation of Rocky Balboa to be crowned, but there is not one false note in every glance and word with which a perfectly circumspect Rylance graces this overtly heartstrings-pulling period piece.
Who will win: Sylvester Stallone, “Creed”
Rocky returns.
Again.
To be sure, his portrayal of an older Rocky faced with the task of training his former rival's son in "Creed" is the performance of Sylvester Stallone's career.  He rises to the challenge of the film's heavy dramatic material and manages to be equal parts deadpan, drop-dead funny and truly moving. His performance does not come close to Rylance's, but at the end of a career as one of Hollywood’s biggest and most reliable box office stars, who seems as unpretentious in life as he does on screen, Stallone is not only an “industry” but an individually liked favorite.

ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE
Jennifer Jason Leigh, The Hateful Eight
Rooney Mara, Carol
Rachel McAdams, Spotlight
Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl
Kate Winslet, Steve Jobs

Who should win: Rooney Mara, “Carol”
While Cate Blanchett’s glamorous character got most of the press (her fur coat alone clocking more print space than many films this year), it is Rooney Mara who delivers the more surprisingly nuanced, enigmatic performance in the film. She is also in the wrong category: Her role is at least as hefty as Blanchett's, and she should be up for Best Actress, which she won for "Carol" at the Cannes Film Festival.
Who will win: Alicia Vikander, “The Danish Girl”
The newly crowned Hollywood "Swedeheart" is another actress in a leading role incorrectly nominated for the "supporting" category. In "The Danish Girl," she plays the wife of one of the first transgender women, Lili Elbe (Eddie Redmayne)—but Vikander’s character, who believed and supported Elbe throughout her unprecedented transformation, was unfortunately more interesting than her performance.

DOCUMENTARY FEATURE
Amy
Cartel Land
The Look of Silence
What Happened, Miss Simone?
Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom

What should win: “The Look of Silence”
Combining visual artistry and lyricism unusual in a documentary with the horrifying story of the Indonesian genocide, "The Look of Silence" is a nonfiction work of art.
What will win: “Amy”
Coming off a win for Best Documentary at the BAFTAs, this telling of the singer's tragic life is poised to take the win on Sunday.

WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY)
The Big Short
Brooklyn
Carol
The Martian
Room

Who should win: “Room”
The performances in "Room" (including those of the supporting actors) could not have been flawless without a script to match.  It is perfectly, almost impossibly honest from beginning to end.
Who will win: “The Big Short”
Though the film is likely to be shut out of the other awards it is nominated for, Adam McKay and Charles Randolph of “The Big Short” may well take home the Oscar for adapting Michael Lewis' book.  The script features unusual direct addresses to the camera, explaining now household—but still incomprehensible—financial terms such as swaps and derivatives.

WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY)
Bridge of Spies
Ex Machina
Inside Out
Spotlight
Straight Outta Compton

Who should win: “Bridge of Spies”
Two words: Coen Bros.
Who will win:  “Spotlight”
Josh Singer (who wrote some of “The West Wing"—that's a tip-off if ever there was one) and director Tom McCarthy will likely win with this ensemble piece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing to archrival Yale on Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team (11-16, 3-8 Ivy League) wraps up its final road trip of the year in Providence against the Brown Bears (8-17, 3-8). Staff Writer David Freed picks three things to watch as Harvard tries to secure its third straight weekend split.
1. Which Zena Will Show Up — Junior forward Zena Edosomwan’s campaign to average a double-double took a big hit Friday night. Edosomwan played his worst game of the season in the loss, picking up two quick fouls in the first half and looking lost on offense when he returned, desperately hunting a shot that was not there. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker took Edosomwan out at the 13-minute mark and never put him back in, a benching that had Edosomwan clearly distraught after the contest. Before throwing up a goose egg in New Haven, his previous season low in points was six—in the opening game against MIT.
On Saturday, Edosomwan should have his hands full inside with Brown senior center Cedric Kuakamensah. The last time out against the Bears, the junior had 13 points and six rebounds in 18 minutes, struggling for most of the game with foul trouble. With Harvard missing starting freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy (concussion), the Crimson will need more production from its leading scorer.
2. Filling In For T-Mac — Without its starting point guard, the Harvard offense looked lost for most of its contest against Yale. Junior Corbin Miller had just one turnover in 35 minutes but did not generate any offense off the dribble, leaving seniors Agunwa Okolie and Patrick Steeves (27 combined points) as the only playmakers on the floor for the Crimson. Freshman shooting guard Corey Johnson was locked down without his partner in crime, taking his only two threes of the game in the closing minutes with the outcome already decided. However, Amaker has very little depth at the point guard position after early-season injuries to junior Matt Fraschilla and senior Siyani Chambers, so expect Miller to play heavy minutes again. Whether he can generate offense off the dribble—something he has struggled to do all season—will be a crucial factor deciding if Harvard can pull out the win.
3. Okolie Brothers — In the midst of disappointing seasons for both teams, the play of the Okolie brothers has been a bright spot. Amaker routinely singles out the elder Okolie, Harvard’s best perimeter defender, for his effort and persistency. With Edosomwan and captain Evan Cummins struggling down the stretch, Okolie has carried the offense at times. Given his minimal role in the offense last year, that has been—to say the least—a surprise.
Down in Providence, his younger brother Obi has shouldered a larger and larger load for Mike Martin’s team. The younger Okolie gets to the line a lot more than his Harvard counterpart and shoots more aggressively despite being a bit smaller. He has had 14 or more points in each of Brown’s last five games, including a season-high 23 in a narrow loss in Philadelphia last weekend. Last time out, Amaker had Okolie on Brown guard Tavon Blackmon but in the second matchup, he may rely on the elder Okolie to shut down the his kid brother.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Freshman guard Corey Johnson willed the Harvard men’s basketball team to a 61-52 workman-like victory over Brown on Saturday in Providence. The first-year sniper, who set the program record for three-pointers by a freshman earlier this year, finished the night with 24 points and an Amaker-record six triples. A week after classmate Tommy McCarthy lifted the Crimson to a weekend split with Columbia and Cornell, Johnson was the star freshman on the floor for the Crimson.
With the win, Harvard (12-16, 4-8 Ivy League) continued its run of dominance against the Bears (8-18, 3-9), defeating the Bears for the 14th consecutive time.
“It was a gutsy effort by our kids,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “For both teams, on the second night in particular for us being on the road and for them, you can see shots are short and it’s hard.”
The Crimson showed no ill effects from Friday’s nine-point loss to Yale. The starters opened the game on a 23-9 run and entered halftime with a seven-point lead despite turning the ball over eight times. Brown did not get closer than seven in the second half and did not lead all evening.
Harvard maintained the lead all night with tough defense, holding Brown to just 31 percent shooting. It needed every stop, because while Johnson made nearly half his shots, the rest of the team shot just 39 percent.
Senior forward forward Agunwa Okolie—the only other Harvard player to finish in double figures—led the defensive charge, scratching and clawing for every line in a packed stat sheet. Squaring off against his younger brother, Obi, the Ajax, Ont. native finished with 19 rebounds, the most by a Crimson player in the Amaker era.
“I’m so proud of him,” Amaker said. “He’s earned everything that has come his way with how he’s played this year and tonight was a gutsy effort for us.”
Harvard capitalized on hustle points to pull away from the Bears. The team held a 49-34 edge on the glass, finished with 14 second chance points, and dove on the floor for every loose ball. Less than 24 hours after collecting just two offensive rebounds against Yale, the Crimson finished with 15. During one 65-second stretch in the second half, Okolie collected four rebounds (three offensive) before classmate Patrick Steeves pushed the lead to 15 with a layup.
The senior played everywhere from the post to the perimeter Saturday night, spending most of the evening guarding Bears junior guard Tavon Blackmon, who torched the Crimson for 19 points and six assists two weekends ago in Cambridge.
“When we execute on offense and on defense, helping each other out and rotations and stuff and rebounding, that’s huge for us,” Johnson said.
Brown senior All-Ivy forward Cedric Kuakumensah was held in check, finishing the game 7-for-16 from the field, with most of the damage coming once the result was no longer in question. Kuakumensah was successful at getting Harvard’s starting frontcourt in foul trouble, but the hosts only converted 13 of their 23 free throws.
Junior forward Zena Edosomwan and captain Evan Cummins combined for only 12 minutes in the second half, as both picked up their fourth personal fouls before the under-eight media timeout and did not return. It was the second night in a row that Edosomwan, the Crimson’s leading scorer and rebounder, was held in check.
Brown coach Mike Martin once again made Harvard earn its victory at the line down the stretch. In the teams’ first meeting, The Crimson went 24-of-34 from the line. On Saturday, the Bears began fouling with 3:18 to play, but Harvard was once again up to the test.
Brown turnovers, coupled with the team’s inability to score and seven Crimson free throw makes allowed Harvard to leave Providence with the W. The exclamation point came on an Okolie dunk with under a minute to go that pushed the lead to ten and brought the entire bench to its feet.
“It’s all about moving,” Okolie said. “We need to move the ball, set screens, slips, post up, so we work on that in practice. We are very versatile and it worked out for us tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CANTON, N.Y. — “The whole group has to be better.”
So said a visibly frustrated Ted Donato ’91 Friday night, emphasizing the need for his side to “play with an intensity that’s necessary this time of year” following a 2-1 loss at Clarkson in the penultimate game of the regular season.
One night later, the skipper got what he was after.
Appearing completely rejuvenated, the No. 12/12 Harvard men’s hockey team stormed out of the gates at Appleton Arena, generating a whopping 17 shots on goal in the opening frame against No. 19/- St. Lawrence. Over the course of 60 minutes, the Crimson’s shooting pace inevitably waned, but its energy level never did, as Harvard rode two power-play goals to a tightly contested 4-1 victory over the Saints to lock up the third seed in the ECAC tournament.
With four minutes to go in regulation and the Crimson (16-9-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) clinging onto a 2-1 edge, freshman Ryan Donato delivered the dagger. Manning the point on Harvard’s fourth power play of the night, the rookie received a feed from junior Alexander Kerfoot a few feet inside the blue line and flung a slapshot through traffic past sophomore goaltender Kyle Hayton to double Harvard’s lead.
The freshman’s conversion, which was followed by a Clay Anderson empty-netter, was one of two power-play goals on the night for the Crimson. Freshman Lewis Zerter-Gossage opened the scoring with a back-door strike 4:48 into the contest with just one second remaining on Harvard’s first man advantage. Now having scored six times in its last five games, the Crimson’s power play unit ranks first in the country with a conversion rate just under 30 percent.
“I’m not upset with the way we played,” St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel said. “We just let a good team take advantage of the areas of the game where they’re really good.”
Despite playing most of the game from behind, the Saints (17-13-4, 11-8-3) matched Harvard shot-for-shot, creating constant havoc in front of sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen and actually edging out the visitors with 18 shots on goal in the first period.
St. Lawrence finally saw its efforts pay off late in the second. Shortly after sophomore blue-liner Nolan Gluchowski instilled life into the Senior Night crowd by ringing the iron from the point, top-line freshman Jacob Pritchard tipped a Gavin Bayreuther shot past Madsen to cut a 2-0 deficit in half.
Still on the comeback trail, the Saints appeared to suffer a major setback midway through the third after junior Woody Hudson was given a five-minute major and a game misconduct for hitting junior Luke Esposito from behind. But down a man, St. Lawrence generated its best scoring opportunity of the night.
Three minutes into the major penalty, Anderson hooked Saints captain Brian Ward on a shorthanded break, prompting the referees to award St. Lawrence with a potential game-tying penalty shot.
Remaining primarily on his forehand, Ward skated in on Madsen, moving from right to left as he inched closer. Upon reaching point-blank range, the captain attempted to drift left and push the puck past Madsen’s right blocker, but the sophomore held his ground, coming up with the biggest of his 38 saves on the night, which tied a career-high. 
“I thought Merrick was excellent,” Ted Donato said. “Not only was he making the saves, but he looked comfortable in there. This building is so tight that there’s really no escape for a goalie—you’re going to get it from all sorts of different angles. But I thought he was huge.”
“Not very often Hayton gets outplayed, but I thought he did tonight,” Carvel said.
Despite the missed opportunity, the Saints would complete the kill. Then moments later, penalties assessed to Harvard’s Adam Baughman and Colin Blackwell put the hosts on a minute-long 5-on-3 with 6:56 remaining. But Madsen stood tall yet again, and a hook against St. Lawrence’s Mike Marnell on the tail end of the Blackwell penalty set up Ryan Donato’s power-play strike that put the game away.
A high school center turned left winger, Ryan Donato drew from his Dexter roots a bit when the Crimson was at full strength on Saturday, taking over the centering duties on the third line with junior centers Sean Malone and Tyler Moy both out nursing lower body injuries.
“It took me a little bit at the beginning just to adjust to playing center,” Ryan Donato said. “Obviously I played it in high school, but it’s a different speed and everything like that. But once I got the hang of it, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Maybe it’s something I’ll look at in the future too.”
The team expects to have both Malone and Moy back in the lineup two weeks from now when Harvard kicks off the postseason with a best-of-three quarterfinal series at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Meanwhile, with a second-period strike just inside the blue line, co-captain Jimmy Vesey pulled into a tie with Quinnipiac’s Sam Anas as the ECAC’s top goal-scorer with 21 on the season. The shot, which Vesey claimed Hayton probably never saw, proved to be the game-winner, helping the Crimson secure the third seed in the upcoming conference tournament.
“We set out to get home ice and finish as high as we could, and that goal has been achieved,” Ted Donato said. “But more importantly, we now have a chance to rest, regroup, take a deep breath. This is a group that wants to make a run here, and certainly tonight was a good test for us.”
“We wanted to go out and play against a good hockey team in a tough environment, in a competitive environment, and play well,” he added. “And I think that’s exactly what we did.”
