After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The slasher-horror movie “Child’s Play” was released 30 years ago on Nov. 9, spawning a massive franchise with films such as “Child’s Play 2,” “Bride of Chucky,” “Seed of Chucky,” “Cult of Chucky,” and an anticipated 2019 reboot of the original film. “Child’s Play” follows the murderous exploits of Chucky, a doll possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). Pursued by detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) and mortally wounded, Ray transfers his soul into a doll via a voodoo ritual to escape death. When Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) buys the doll as a birthday present for her son, Andy (Alex Vincent), Chucky’s violent appetites slowly reveal themselves. “Child’s Play” is fast-paced, witty, and creepy as hell. With a villain so perfectly suited to the slasher genre, it’s easy to see why he’s stuck around.
Chucky’s a great villain because he can create suspense without saying anything, doing anything, or even being onscreen. In this way “Child’s Play” is a little reminiscent of “Jaws,” the influential 1975 thriller about a man-eating great white shark. According to one commonly circulated story about the shooting process, the crew was experiencing technical difficulties with the mechanical shark at the time of shooting, so several scenes had to be shot with the shark offscreen, and this inadvertently resulted in a better, more suspenseful film. As it happens, this story could be apocryphal. The takeaway is unchanged — sometimes implied action is scarier than the real thing. Ever since, implied action has become a staple of the horror genre, with films like “Poltergeist” and “Paranormal Activity” featuring invisible spirits that really like rearranging furniture between camera cuts.
The reason that Chucky is so scary, though, is that while the doll is nearly always onscreen, he’s not always moving. Sure, he murders and moves around plenty when we’re not looking. But the viewer is treated to close-up after close-up of Chucky’s motionless, glassy blue eyes, with the implication that Chucky is listening, processing the situation, and plotting his next kill. This is an ingenious horror device, a kind of step-up from implied action: A lethal threat is in plain sight — maybe held in Andy’s arms or sitting out of focus on the edge of the frame — but nobody’s doing anything about it.
About halfway through “Child’s Play,” Chucky still hasn’t moved onscreen and one starts to worry that maybe the special effects budget wasn’t cutting it. This could end up like “Cloverfield,” a monster movie with a monster so conspicuously absent onscreen as to be less suspenseful than frankly annoying.
Thankfully, it doesn’t. When an increasingly unhinged Karen becomes suspicious of Chucky, she turns on her fireplace, grabs the doll and threatens to burn him in if he doesn’t talk. Chucky comes alive, bashing and biting Karen with the strength of a grown man trapped in a doll’s body and unleashing a stream of horrifying expletives in a guttural man-voice hilariously unlike his programmed speech-box dialogue (“Hi, I’m Chucky, and I’m your friend to the end. Hidey-ho!”).
The quality of the special effects here is almost a relief. When compared to, say, “Annabelle,” which also features a murderous doll, Chucky stacks up well. The doll in “Annabelle” barely moves, and when it does, it’s in stops and starts. Every possible jump-scare is milked. It’s one of those big-studio horror films that feels like it was written with focus group feedback. There’s so much uncertainty around Annabelle’s plans and abilities, so many fake-outs and easy scares, that it makes the film sort of boring.
By contrast, the latter half of “Child’s Play” is just good-old slasher fare. Chucky’s pursuing a clear goal. It’s refreshing to see a horror movie commit to its villain. He’s well-animated and moves freely from kill to kill, cursing like a sailor, getting shot, stabbed, beaten, burned, and more and more pissed off.

With her knack for storytelling, 16-year-old Astrid Ericsson (Alba August) woos a married older man, Reinhold Blomberg (Henrik Rafaelsen). Many years later, this same author, now Mrs. Astrid Lindgren, becomes famous for “Pippi Longstocking.” In between these events, Mr. Blomberg gets her pregnant, she secretly gives birth in Denmark, and she returns for little Lars, despite the protests of her devoutly Christian family. The story is surprisingly scandalous for its setting of 1926 Sweden: It’s not the biopic one expects of a beloved children’s author. So why tell this story? What does Astrid’s coming-of-age have to do with “Pippi Longstocking”?
Directed by Pernille Fischer Christensen, “Becoming Astrid” (in Swedish, “Unga Astrid”) casts its protagonist as a bold, feminist, compassionate girl — so compassionate, in fact, that she repeatedly sacrifices her freedom for someone she loves. She breaks rules, acts boldly, and cares deeply. The subtext, therefore, is this: Astrid, like Pippi, is a woke, wild role model. Hers is a tale of nuanced empowerment, befitting the classics she contributes to children’s literature.
Panoramic cinematography spotlights this theme of liberation, panning over the beautiful Swedish countryside in expressions of openness and possibility. It is here that Astrid first yearns for freedom: She cuts her hair short and tosses her freshly-bobbed head in the breeze, smiling broadly as she bikes down a long dirt road. She is on her way to meet him. The cinematography whisks us away with her, feeling light and free.
But while this scene is liberating, it foreshadows hard times to come: Although Astrid is bold with her hair style (which her mother says is a “one-way ticket to hell”), it’s Mr. Blomberg who thinks that bobs are in and inspired her to cut it in the first place. Although she’s the one who seduces him, he’s the one who covers up the scandal by keeping Lars, their baby, in Denmark. Mr. Blomberg is a dark, brooding man, in contrast to Astrid’s flaxen bob and big smile. The man-child couple is repulsive. Though they are in love, they are always in conflict, and as much freedom as he gives Astrid, he takes away. Rules of gender and religion are simply too strict to allow for their relationship.
The script is full of gendered confrontations — perhaps a bit heavy-handed, but nonetheless central to the story. From the beginning, Astrid confronts her mother, Hanna Johnsson (Maria Bonnevie), about gender disparities. For example, her brother Gunnar’s curfew is later than hers. Later, these fights are about whether she and her illegitimate child are welcome in the home. “Aren’t you my mother?” Astrid cries. “Isn’t he your grandson?” Astrid nearly abandons baby Lars, for he lives with a foster mother, Marie (Trine Dyrholm), in Denmark for the first two years of his life. But when Marie gets sick, Astrid reclaims her baby boy and wins him over with stories. For example, she tells Lars about a land where children drink soda all the time and sleep with their feet on the pillows. He warms up to this idea and asks to sleep in her bed. Though Astrid is young and inexperienced, she easily adapts to her maternal role via her narrative capabilities, in a poignant choice by the filmmaker.
And so storytelling bookends Astrid’s own story: Long ago Mr. Blomberg fell in love with her for her words, and now she uses bedtime tales to gain her shy son’s trust. Viewers should not interpret this movie as fitting for small children, though. Scenes of childbirth, abandonment, depression, and grief make it a far less whimsical film than its protagonist might suggest.
Its only weak point, in fact, is this dubious integration of child-and-adult worlds. Clearly Astrid and Pippi are both spunky, and clearly Astrid is a gifted writer. But the frame narrative is odd: The movie opens with an elderly Astrid sitting at her desk, opening fan mail from children. A fourth-grade class has sent her a cassette of voice recordings, and when she puts it in her cassette player, the voice-overs begin: “Thank you for all your stories,” the class says. Then one child asks, “How can you write so well about being a child when you haven’t been one for so long?” It is this question that launches the flashback into Astrid’s 16-year-old life.
But the voice-overs persist throughout the film, and the farther we get from that opening scene, the more random they sound. For example, just before Astrid reclaims Lars, we hear a voiceover of a child observing, “The children in your books can overcome almost anything.” Perhaps that’s a valuable thesis about how Astrid’s life shaped her work, but viewers can interpret that on their own, without being pulled from the story by recalling the frame narrative. The small child’s voice has little place in the very adult scene of whether or not to reclaim a fostered son.
Altogether, the story is surprising and uplifting. It is a Bildungsroman of a talented writer finding liberation from the social and religious expectations of the time, acting always out of love. Pippi appeals to children for her compassion and pluck — and “Becoming Astrid” enchants its viewers in the same way.

“She acted as any reasonable, gorgeous person would under the circumstances,” is just one of the many justifications that could be used to defend breathtaking Ayoola’s bad habit of taking her boyfriends’ breaths away — literally. Set in Lagos, Nigeria, Oyinkan Braithwaite’s debut novel, “My Sister, The Serial Killer” tells the story of beautiful serial killer Ayoola through the eyes of her protective older sister Korede as she struggles to keep her sister’s murderous habit in check. Korede’s clever commentary introduces an interesting twist on the predictable and often sexist femme fatale trope, but remains restricted by the conventions of the genre it attempts to parody as Korede attempts to protect her work-crush Tade from Ayoola. The frustrations caused by Braithwaite’s adherence to noir stereotypes are mildly alleviated by the novel’s surprise ending, which helps elucidate the complex relationship between Ayoola and Korede and distracts from some of the novel’s flat characterization of its protagonists.
The highlight of the novel is truly Korede’s interior monologue — an expert combination of contemporary references and wit which Braithwaite effectively utilizes to create a connection between the reader and Korede. Korede claims “the resemblance is there—we share the same mouth, the same eyes—but Ayoola resembles a Bratz doll and I resemble a voodoo figurine” to describe the juxtaposition between Ayoola and herself — a distinction that would be clear to any reader who grew up with the famous doll collection. In another passage, Korede sarcastically notes that she “would be more at ease if the Joker were to smile at me” as she attempts to avoid the feigned smile of a nosy colleague.  Braithwaite’s references to Bratz, the Joker, or Snapchat manage to accomplish what many authors today try, but ultimately fail to do: relate to today’s youth. These references develop organically throughout the novel often in a humorous manner, allowing Korede’s narrative to read more like a chat between friends than a lifeless imitation of it based off a Google search on millennial trends. This is further underscored by the short-length of each chapter — each managing to pack a punch while understanding how younger readers consume media.
While Braithwaite masterfully crafts relatable prose, her insistence on sticking to the conventions of the femme fatale trope at times detracts, rather than adds, from the satire in her novel.  Korede and Ayoola are a manifestation of the virgin-whore dichotomy often present in the noir genre, and Braithwaite plays with this dichotomy to reveal society’s ugly obsession with beauty, light skin, and privilege. Yet, as Ayoola functions within these archetypes, she fails to evolve beyond them and introduce a new twist to the genre. The flatness in the character inevitably seeps into the plotline which becomes increasingly unbelievable and frustrating, particularly in Ayoola’s main character trait — her beauty — causing every single character around her to act in increasingly outrages ways.
Korede diverges from the virgin archetype, not just in the way she serves as an accomplice to murder, but also in the ways her social status allows her to receive some of the benefits of a system which privileges her sister over her. For example, Koete refers to her father’s underage Asian “mistress” in racially derogatory terms and repeatedly looks down upon the cleaning staff of the hospital in which she works. Yet, these instances are unfortunately often glossed over and never properly addressed by Braithwaite, compared to some of Korede’s other more obvious character flaws (like being an accomplice to murder). These minor flaws, however, raise major implications for the novel: Just how innocent is Korede compared to her sister?
The novel’s twist ending, which provides some background to the intricate relationship between Korede and Ayoola, helps alleviate some of the problems surrounding the under-characterization of the protagonists and gives relief to an increasingly suffocating plot. The issue of Korede’s innocence remains an important question throughout the novel, yet Korede and her treatment of those she considers below her do not fully implicate her and her role as accomplice to murder. Despite this, “My Sister, The Serial Killer” is a strong debut by Braithwaite, an author who understands her audience and writes evocative, but relatable prose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re often told that home is meant to be a safe, warm, comforting place that we can always return to for unconditional love. Quotes like “There’s no place like home” or “Home is where the heart is” reinforce this notion. Mix in the idea of holiday joy and you get the popular conception of going home for the holidays being an accepting, cheerful experience filled with unconditional love from family and others close to your heart.
Now, the holidays may not be ideal for most people, and I’m sure most of us have had our fair share of drama with extended family, cramped living situations, hectic travel schedules, and awkward dinner table politics. But the holidays can be an especially complicated time for BGLTQ people: for those who aren’t welcome home; for those who are just tolerated at home; for those who are physically welcome home but not emotionally or spiritually; for those who feel distant from their support systems when they’re home; for those who feel distant from their home communities even when they’re home; and for those whose holiday traditions intersect with religions or belief systems that do not affirm them.
The holidays can be incredibly isolating when you don’t feel the unconditional love and warmth that you’re expected to feel, particularly from those who are supposed to love you most in the world.
For me, the holidays are a season of mixed messages. I’ll receive gifts in the mail from relatives who love me dearly but shudder at the thought of two women kissing. I’ll spend Christmas Eve at church, surrounded by people who’ve known me and helped raise me since I was in preschool, yet are convinced that all homosexuals are destined for hell if they don’t turn away from their sinful lifestyle. I’ll enjoy my favorite meal with my family that hasn’t dined together in over a year, but hear concerned commentary at the dinner table about our society’s downfall due to the “gay agenda” and its destruction of “family values.” Years of living at home and coming home for the holidays still have not fully prepared me for the cognitive dissonance of “I love you, but….” It still shocks and hurts me every time.
The problem with this conditional love lies in the difference between tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance is for the things we don’t love or like but choose to put up with. We might tolerate having to get up early for morning classes. We might tolerate strangers’ rude behavior. But we don’t just tolerate those we love; we accept them completely, including all that makes them who they are. Family and close friends must go beyond the bare minimum of tolerance; they must fully accept us in order to love us.
My sexuality is a beautiful, integral part of me: If you only tolerate my sexuality, then you only tolerate me. My sexuality is not a hurdle that must be overcome. It is not an undesirable add-on that others can begrudgingly tolerate to get to the parts of me they actually like. You cannot love me without also loving my whole being, including my sexuality. “I love you” is hollow if I must change myself to be worthy of that love.
To any BGLTQ person who’s struggling with a complicated or unaccepting home this holiday season, I want to reaffirm that you matter and that you’re deserving of unconditional love. I’m sorry if you’re not getting that love from your family and home communities, but that doesn’t make you any less deserving of it.
While your holiday experience may not be ideal, there are some adjustments you can make that can hopefully make it go more smoothly. When interacting with people who aren’t actively trying to hurt you but still hold unaccepting views, try setting expectations from the get-go of what you need and make it clear that certain behaviors are detrimental to you. For example, I’ve requested in advance that certain harmful phrases — such as framing my sexual orientation as a choice — not be said in front of me. Even if I haven’t changed anyone’s mind on the issue, at the very least I won’t have to be reminded that they hold these opinions or be forced to address them.
Pick your battles. There will be plenty of moments where I’ll hold my tongue and set aside the more “controversial” parts of me to keep the peace. It’s not fair and not how it should be, but reopening the wound by voicing concerns and getting into arguments might be more painful. You have not failed or conceded your values if you choose to stay silent.
When possible, look for or build support systems. Have a friend, even if they’re virtual, that you can vent to when someone says something hurtful. Set aside time to hang out with affirming people so that you have a space to decompress and feel fully seen and welcomed. If you don’t have these support systems available to you, plan alone time away from your family doing something relaxing and affirming.
Above all, do whatever you need to do to affirm your self-worth. These next few months may be difficult, through no fault of your own. Whatever happens, remember that you are valid, you are whole, and you are deserving of unconditional love, even if it doesn’t feel that way in the moment.
I’m wishing you the very best this holiday season, and I hope you experience unconditional love and warmth in some aspect of your life.

The Dean of Students Office and Leverett House administrators are investigating “deeply disturbing and offensive images” that were found drawn on a whiteboard in McKinlock Hall. The drawings included racist comments as well as depictions of two faces, one of which was labeled “Black” and the other of which was labeled “Other blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, Jews.” They also included terms such as “caravan,” “globalists,” and “Soros” — a reference to billionaire George Soros, who has recently been the object of a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that he funded the caravan of Central Americans immigrants heading towards the United States.
We unequivocally condemn the drawings and comments made on the Leverett white board. They are clear examples of racist and hateful speech that should not occur on this campus. Furthermore, we admonish the individuals responsible for these drawings who acted with horrifying disregard for their peers.
In response to the Leverett drawings, House staff brought the matter to the attention of HUPD and offered support to the residents of Leverett House. We applaud this, and we call on Leverett and other House administrators to continue offering support to students in this and other incidents of blatant hate speech on campus. Furthermore, we expect that HUPD will investigate this incident thoroughly and finish its investigation promptly.
Yet, these drawings and their consequences cannot be considered in isolation. The drawings in Leverett seem to be part of a pattern plaguing university campuses. In 2015, pieces of black tape were placed over the portraits of black professors at Harvard Law School in an act of vandalism that the Harvard University Police Department investigated as a hate crime. Recently, at Yale, flyers appeared with a symbol for a “White Student’s [sic] Union of Yale”; they also quoted slavery advocate John Calhoun when he said “In looking back, I see nothing to regret, and little to correct.” Last month, some Dartmouth students found racial slurs written on their doors.
The prevalence of these acts demonstrates an underlying problem that must be addressed. Harvard students must work to identify the aspects of our culture that allow such acts to occur and collectively work to correct and overcome them. In particular, Harvard students and University administrators should work towards achieving a campus-wide understanding of how such comments may affect students on campus, particularly those from marginalized groups.
Simultaneously, students must work to prevent such behavior from arising in the future. Racism and hate speech have no place on this campus. It’s time for Harvard students and administration to take action to show that.

We may not all be math concentrators, but many of us have probably encountered this problem at least once: If a group of men attempt to enter a party and get denied entry, how many women must be added to their group in order to be let in? Please round your answer to the nearest tenth.
In layman's term, this disconcerting phenomenon is referred to as the “ratio,” or the ratio of guys to girls at any given party. I remember my first time learning about the ratio. My friends and I were sitting on the brick steps outside of a frat house, dejected from failing to enter yet another MIT party. We were quite a large group of mostly males with a few lone females.
“I knew this was going to happen,” sighed one of my friends.
“If we want to get in, we need to either bring fewer people or bring more girls to compensate.” I was puzzled. “We do have girls in our group. What does the number have to do with anything?”
“Well, they want to keep their ratio,” my friend explained. “They can’t just have a bunch of guys in there.”
At the time, I accepted this as basic party logic that my 18 years of sheltered living had failed to teach me. However, the more I thought about it, the more I grew to realize that the need to maintain a ratio actually reveals an underlying motive for many partygoers: namely, hooking up.
Of course, hooking up is certainly not a crime, and parties are a perfect place for a one-night fling that you can regret in the morning and stash away in your memories. The issue lies in the fact that not every person wants to hook up, but everyone has to play into the culture if they want to be included. Women are seen not as individuals wanting to have a good time but as potential equalizers for male-dominated spaces in order for straight men to find people to take home.
As for boys, they have to endure the irrational logic of women entering parties or getting drinks for free while they have to pay up. As a female, I theoretically benefit from this socially constructed system; I enjoy easier entry to crowded frat parties and free benefits, right? In reality, the only thing I’m left with is a sickening realization of why my gender grants me these privileges.
In fact, the notion behind guy/girl ratios inadvertently fuels an even larger issue. With 31.2 percent of Harvard female seniors reporting graduating as sexual assault survivors in 2015, there is undoubtedly a toxic undertone to party activity and social life on campus that is not nearly as discussed as it should be. Why is it that the presence of alcohol and deafening pop music makes people assume that the world is their oyster for satisfying their drunken urges? Rather than a misguided perspective that shames victims for getting intoxicated, my criticism toward party culture is against the entitlement it brings unto assaulters who view substances as an opportunity to coerce victims. To put it simply, no one should be afraid to go out at night within their own campus.
Although it can be argued that a gender ratio is maintained to ensure everyone is comfortable in a new setting, I find it quite antiquated that party hosts assume that people can only get along with members of their own gender. As we approach the end of 2018, let us leave behind the restrictions that gender norms unnecessarily enforce. Gender ratios aren’t fair to anyone: Boys are not happy with having to pay for entry, and girls don’t enjoy a role in maintaining a misogynistic system.
To all “exclusive” parties out there, I have a proposition for you. For one night, consider letting in any group, regardless of their gender ratio. The night probably won’t go that differently. It’s time we stopped regarding women as hookup currency.

The League of American Bicyclists recently awarded Harvard a gold-level “Bicycle Friendly University” award in recognition of the University’s different initiatives focused on bicycle safety and access.
The annual awards, which the League announced earlier this month, are intended to commend institutions with “outstanding support of bicycling to ensure healthy, accessible and eco-friendly transportation and recreation for students and staff,” according to the League’s press release.
The League evaluates universities along the categories of “engineering, education, encouragement, enforcement, and evaluation and planning,” said Amelia Neptune, Director of the Bicycle Friendly America Program at the League of American Bicyclists.
Among programs that stood out to the League was Harvard’s Bling-Your-Bike event, for which the University provided lights and reflectors for bikes. Neptune said the event was even featured on the League’s blog.
The League also considers universities’ accessibility to cyclists in terms of resources such as bike parking and storage, bike lanes, and bike safety education, Neptune said.
Ben A. Hammer, Associate Director of Harvard’s CommuterChoice program, said CommuterChoice is among these resources. The program offers a number of services designed to promote bike access and safety, including a unique reimbursement system called the Bike Benefit Program.
“We offer reimbursement to benefit eligible faculty and staff for eligible bike expenses, including repairs, storage, maintenance, and, there’s a fourth one in there, basically bike expenses that will allow you to commute safely to campus,” Hammer said.
Neptune said she was particularly impressed with this initiative when evaluating Harvard’s efforts to encourage biking.
“That’s something Harvard has done for years,” Neptune said of Harvard’s reimbursement of bike expenses. “We were really impressed to see that they continued that incentive.”
Hammer also mentioned that the CommuterChoice program distributes about three hundred discounted bike helmets every year at Harvard’s Campus Service Center.
Commenting on Harvard’s accessibility as a student cyclist, Jack W. Deschler ’19 said, “I think that Harvard is about as bicycle-friendly as it can be given the fact that it’s in a city like Cambridge.”
Deschler specifically pointed to Harvard’s infrastructure to support cyclists. “Basically anywhere you need to go, there’s a place to lock your bike,” he said. “Which I think is probably the most important thing living in a city, so that’s really good.”
Deschler also said that biking in a city can be inherently challenging and dangerous, but safety is improving.
“I think Cambridge has gotten better even in the time that I’ve been here,” Deschler said. “They put in a two-way bike lane on Brattle Street last year that’s separated by cars, which I think has made a lot of routes that I bike significantly safer.”
Deschler also highlighted the Undergraduate Council’s recent initiative to subsidize bicycles and scooters for students in the Quad and Harvard University Police Department’s Bicycle Registration program as examples of Harvard’s efforts to encourage biking on campus.
Harvard is among seven universities—including University of Kentucky, University of Washington, Seattle, and Dickinson College—to receive the gold-level award this year. Harvard previously received the gold level award in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the weeks since the U.S. Department of Education rolled out a long-awaited proposal to overhaul Title IX regulations for colleges, student groups across Harvard’s campus have launched an effort to oppose them.
The proposed regulations released Nov. 16 provide a new framework for interpreting Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law that guides universities’ approach to handling sexual assault. It could force Harvard to reshape its policies surrounding allegations of sexual misconduct. In a statement released alongside the proposal, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said the proposed rules will make Title IX proceedings at colleges nationwide fairer and more transparent.
Faced with this shift, some students at the College, Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Law School say they are determined to make their criticisms heard by the Department of Education before the proposals become federal regulations. Organizers from groups at these schools have called the new measures “harmful” and say they “contradict” their intended purpose.
If they are adopted in their current form, the new rules would represent a significant change from the status quo. They mandate schools allow complainants and respondents in Title IX proceedings to question each other in a live hearing, narrow the standard for sexual harassment, and exclude behavior occurring outside a school “program or activity” — a change some experts say may shield off-campus behavior from investigators’ consideration.
The draft text released earlier this month is not yet binding, though. Before federal regulations are officially changed to reflect the DeVos policies, the Department of Education will field public comments for 60 days. After that period comes to a close, federal officials must wait roughly three months before changing regulations.
In the meantime, student advocacy groups have picked up their pens to seize the opportunity presented by the notice-and-comment period.
College anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better began soliciting signatures on an open letter to the Department of Education almost immediately after the new proposed regulations were publicly released.
The letter, written in concert with national anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, charges that the “proposed changes to Title IX would deter survivors from initiating Title IX processes, leaving them without recourse in a hostile environment.”
“We are very concerned that Secretary DeVos and the administration systematically ignored the input of survivors while developing the proposed rules,” the group’s letter reads.
As of Tuesday evening, the open letter had garnered over 375 signatures from Harvard affiliates, as well as affiliates of dozens of other institutions across the nation.
“One thing that we’re still waiting on is a response from Harvard. A number of our peer institutions have issued some kind of response to the rules and regulations,” Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, said.
“It’s important for Harvard students to know how the administration plans to respond, whether it plans to submit a comment — as many other schools have already committed to doing — and how it plans to handle cases that may be ongoing when the proposed rules are finalized,” she added.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email the University is still reviewing the 144-page federal release.
“Harvard's top priority remains ensuring the safety and wellbeing of every member of our community, supported through thoughtful and fair policies and procedures,” he wrote. “We are reviewing the proposed Title IX regulations from the U.S. Department of Education, and are in the process of understanding how, if they were to be adopted, they may affect our current policies and practices.”
Goldberg said Our Harvard Can Do Better plans to deliver its open letter next week, and the group will organize comment writing opportunities on campus over the course of the 60-day notice-and-comment period.
Students from the Kennedy School and Law School have circulated the letter and say they plan to hold comment writing sessions as well.
Emily M. Ausubel, a co-chair of the Gender Policy Union at the Kennedy School, said these sessions will be a fitting time to utilize skills HKS students develop in their classes.
“It's actually a really great opportunity for Kennedy School students to get involved in giving feedback to our government and using the skills that we’ve learned in our courses and outside of courses to present concise and compelling and well-researched, evidence-informed arguments about why these changes are harmful and what we would like to see instead,” Ausubel said.
Ausubel emphasized that the negative effects of these policy changes would be disproportionately felt by graduate students who live outside campus boundaries. With the Title IX changes, any inappropriate behavior outside of a school “program or activity” will be excluded from consideration by investigators.
“The majority of scenarios in which Kennedy school students and other graduate students are experiencing harassment and cases of assault are off-campus,” Ausubel said. “But that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t affect our lives on campus and that the school shouldn’t have a responsibility of supporting students who are being harassed or assaulted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard senior Mitchell B. Polonsky ’19 has been named one of this year’s twelve George J. Mitchell Scholarship recipients, after being chosen from a record pool of 370 applicants.
Sponsored by the non-profit U.S.-Ireland Alliance, the Mitchell Scholarship gives twelve U.S. citizens the opportunity to complete one year of graduate study in Ireland. The program identifies “future American leaders… on the basis of academic distinction, leadership, and service,” according to a Nov. 17 announcement on its website.
“I’m extremely, extremely, extremely grateful and surprised that I was selected,” Polonsky said. “I would encourage anyone interested in studying in Ireland to apply. They really, I think, are looking for good people, not just good students.”
Polonsky will use the scholarship to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in Theater Directing at the Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art at Trinity College Dublin starting next fall, according to a press release. During his time at Harvard, Polonsky directed over a dozen “site-specific” productions, which are staged outside of traditional theater venues.
In an interview, Polonsky said he looks forward to studying in Ireland and finding “new spaces to make come alive.”
“I’m really interested in looking at some of the growing political tensions in Ireland, especially post-Brexit,” Polonsky said. “I would love to do some site-specific performance piece near or relating to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There are so many incredible historical architectural sites in Dublin that I would love to create theater in and around.”
Polonsky is currently pursuing a joint concentration in English and Theater, Dance, and Media at the College. His first site-specific production — which he directed during his sophomore year — was a rendition of “The Room” by Harold Pinter in the basement of Adams House.
“At first, it was difficult to get spaces to direct, which is how I started doing site-specific work,” Polonsky said. “But for me, it’s always been about finding ways that performance can create or alter a sense of community.”
Driven by a newfound passion for site-specific work, Polonsky continued to push the boundaries of theatrical spaces. In 2016, he helped found The Goat Exchange, an experimental Harvard ensemble centered on the idea that “theater is a fundamental social service.” Working with the Exchange, Polonsky directed “Cabaret” in the Queen’s Head Pub in 2017 and “Antigone” in Harvard Stadium for an audience of 6,000 in April 2018.
For Polonsky, staging theater performances in non-traditional locations is one way of making arts culture less exclusive and more approachable for the general public. “We were really interested in creating theatrical experiences that felt not only accessible but truly welcoming to the broader Harvard and even Cambridge and Allston communities beyond,” Polonsky said. “It was really an attempt to create theater that brings together a full cross-section of our community.”
A resident of Quincy House, Polonsky said he first learned about the Mitchell Scholarship from Lowell A. Brower, a Quincy fellowship tutor. Written applications were due in September. After a round of semi-finalist Skype interviews in October, Polonsky traveled to Washington D.C. with other finalists for in-person candidate interviews on Nov. 16 and 17.
Polonsky found out about his status as a scholarship recipient while waiting in the airport, just a few hours after his interview.
“In general, I think the Mitchell Scholarship process is a little bit more casual than some of the other fellowships,” he said. “They really try to make an effort to make it a personal experience.”
After his year of study in Dublin, Polonsky said he hopes to pursue a career as an international theater director.
“Ideally, I’d love to continue The Goat Exchange and make it an international touring ensemble that develops new work and site-specific work and brings it around the world,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has concluded its Title IX investigation into sexual harassment allegations brought against Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., who must now wait for administrators to determine how — if at all — they will punish him.
As part of their probe, investigators compiled a final report that summarizes the charges against Fryer and makes recommendations regarding what sanctions, if any, administrators should level against him. These can range from reprimand to dismissal, per University procedures.
Fryer’s spokesperson Harry W. Clark confirmed Harvard had concluded its investigation and is currently deciding whether to sanction the professor in an interview Tuesday. Clark said it is his and Fryer’s understanding that the school will make its final decision within the next few weeks.
Clark said he believes it is “inappropriate” to comment further while Harvard ponders whether to punish Fryer.
A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment Tuesday on the status of the investigation into Fryer.
The report is the result of a months-long Harvard-led inquiry into allegations Fryer verbally sexually harassed female staffers in the lab he heads. Fryer is facing at least two Title IX complaints that at least two separate women filed against the professor; the report covers at least one of these complaints. The Crimson first reported the existence of the Harvard complaints and investigation in May, as well as the fact that Fryer is also facing a state-level investigation led by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
Attorneys for one complainant wrote in a statement in May that Fryer had committed “egregious” acts of verbal sexual harassment against their client, a charge Fryer denied in an interview with The Crimson. The attorneys also said Fryer “objectified and sexualized” female staffers in his lab, which Fryer also denied.
Both Fryer and the complainant likely have copies of the final report, per publicly available Office for Dispute Resolution procedures. ODR is the University body that conducts investigations into allegations of sexual and gender-based harassment in accordance with Harvard’s Title IX policy.
The delivery of a final report to administrators means both Fryer and complainants have reviewed and responded to a draft report, according to a flowchart of the University’s investigative procedures. The procedures also require that the University offer the professor and the complainants the opportunity to appeal a final version of the report if they believe a procedural error occurred or if they can produce new information “that was not available at the time of the investigation and may change the outcome of the decision.”
Because Fryer is a Faculty member, ODR has sent its report to either Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay or to a person she has designated to receive the report in her stead. Gay will then make a decision as to whether disciplinary action is needed, consulting with FAS senior management and the Office of the General Counsel as needed.
Action taken by Gay or her designated appointee could range from a “verbal warning up to and including termination,” according to FAS’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment policies. Only the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — can vote to remove a professor’s tenure.
During the course of the ODR investigation, Harvard implemented several interim measures against Fryer. The University forbade him from entering EdLabs — the think tank he founded in 2008 to examine the economics of racial inequality — and appointed an interim executive director to take his place in the lab. Harvard also required that Fryer copy interim executive director Susan E. Cook on all emails sent to EdLabs staff.
Cook is currently listed as “Executive Director (FAS FCOR EdLabs Staff) in an internal Harvard directory, though her listed address is not in the Massachusetts Avenue building that houses EdLabs.
Whether or not administrators decide to sanction Fryer, he will not be on campus next semester — he will instead be taking a spring semester leave, according to the Economics Department website.

Harvard Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. has been named a fellow of the Econometric Society, collecting a second prestigious award in as many months — and as he faces University and state-level investigations into allegations he sexually harassed female subordinates.
Fryer is one of 22 newly minted fellows the Society announced Nov. 8, receiving a position that University of Michigan professor and 2004 Fellow John Bound dubbed “one of the top honors in economics” in an email to The Crimson. Honorees, who serve in the role for life, advise the Society’s Executive Committee on matters of governance.
Candidates for the fellowship must either be nominated by at least three current Fellows or chosen by the nominating committee to see their names appear on the ballot. The Society’s members then vote on candidates each fall.
The Econometric Society did not respond to a request for comment on Fryer's award. The Society also did not respond to a question asking whether it is aware of the allegations against the professor.
The Society — which was founded in 1930 “for the advancement of economic theory in its relation to statistics and mathematics,” according to its website — is not the only group to honor Fryer since the investigations into his behavior launched earlier this year.
In October, Fryer was elected to the 2019 Executive Committee of the American Economic Association. Days later, the current Committee wrote in a statement they were previously unaware of the allegations against a newly elected member. Though it did not name Fryer, the statement almost certainly referred to him.
Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution — which handles allegations of sexual and gender-based harassment in accordance with the University’s Title IX policy — and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination have launched separate investigations into Fryer based on complaints filed by at least two women. The Crimson first reported the existence of the allegations and investigations in May 2018.
Lawyers for one of the complainants alleged in a statement at the time that Fryer had “objectified and sexualized” female staffers in his lab. The attorneys also alleged that he had committed “egregious” acts of verbal sexual harassment targeting their client.
In a May interview with The Crimson, Fryer repeatedly denied any misconduct. He declined to comment for this story through his spokesperson Harry W. Clark, who said he believes it is “inappropriate” to comment on the investigation while the University is still determining whether it will sanction Fryer.
Harvard’s Economics department posted individual announcements Nov. 8 congratulating Fryer and Gita Gopinath — the other University professor elected as a fellow this year — on their election. Department of Economics Chair Jeremy C. Stein did not respond to a request for comment on the award, the allegations, or the congratulatory announcement.
In his email, Bound noted that Fryer has already won the second-highest honor in the field of economics: the John Bates Clark Medal, awarded by the American Economics Association each year to an American economist under the age of 40.
“Election is surely one of the top honors in economics (though the Clark prize which Fryer also won would [beat] being elected a fellow), though the election is tilted toward econometricians and theorists,” Bound wrote in an emailed statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of State John F. Kerry offered sharp criticism of President Donald Trump’s policies on climate change and diplomacy during his Tuesday visit to the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum — while also hinting at a possible campaign for president in 2020.
Kerry was joined by four Institute of Politics fellows — former CEO of the Democratic National Committee Amy Dacey, former Nevada congressman Joseph J. Heck, Bloomberg News’ senior White House correspondent Margaret Talev, and vice president of national community alliances and engagement at Teach for America Brittany Packnett — in a conversation moderated by IOP director Mark D. Gearan ’78.
Kerry emphasized at the beginning of the talk that it was a “privilege” to be with Gearan, the fellows, and the crowded forum packed with over 200 attendees.
“I’m delighted to see many of you here to think about our country and talk about where we really are today,” Kerry said. “I’m not going to hold back and I hope you won’t.”
Kerry expanded upon his activist background as he discussed his involvement with the founding of Earth Day in 1970 and said current political “troubles” — including the “hostile takeover of the Republican Party by Donald Trump”— have energized him.
“I feel as invigorated and energized as anytime in my life because of what it is happening and what is not happening in our country,” Kerry said.
This is not the first time Kerry has visited Harvard. As the keynote speaker for the Kennedy School commencement in 2017, Kerry urged graduate students to approach their careers with optimism and action. On this recent visit, however, he largely focused on the inaction he said was happening on both sides of the aisle.
“Our democracy right now is absolutely dysfunctional,” Kerry said. “It’s a disgrace. Both parties are not making it happen, folks.”
Kerry criticized the current administration for its controversial foreign policy decisions, such as pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement and attacking NATO.
“I believe if there were strong leadership that was active over half of the world and our country at the same time, we would be fighting to hold Europe together more than this instead of attacking NATO,” Kerry said.
Kerry was pessimistic about the negative implications of political inaction surrounding climate change — an issue he said could be fixed by working energy policy. He said any decisions the president makes can “cost American lives” and “billions of dollars of property damage” — and the failure to make a decision could be deadly.
“We are currently living out, by omission or commission, a mutual suicide pact,” Kerry said.
Kerry also faced scrutiny from a member of the audience and Packnett when he described the current state of immigration in the United States and Europe — a factor that he said transformed the politics of these regions.
“We have illegal people in the country,” Kerry said. “Now, either the law does mean something to us or either sovereignty or nation state mean something to us. Borders are supposed to mean something.”
Kerry later adjusted his statement after Packnett confronted the former secretary of state. He said the United States should be “a nation that is ready to receive people” and advocated for a “pathway to citizenship.”
Asked by Talev about his future aspirations, Kerry said he was “thinking” about the possibility of throwing his hat into the presidential race in 2020, but he would not commit to a definitive answer. In recent months, Kerry has consistently declined to rule out a second bid for the presidency. In 2004, he lost by a slim margin to President George W. Bush.
“I’m not going to take anything off the table. I haven't been running around to the most obvious states, laying out the groundwork,” Kerry said.
Kerry added, “Am I going to think about it? Yeah, I'm going to think about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dominant performances in their junior and senior seasons, respectively, both Simon Rosenblum-Larson and Noah Zavolas left the Harvard baseball team to pursue professional ball in the minor leagues this past summer.
“There’s two good kids who just came through our program,” said Bill Decker, Harvard’s baseball coach. “Everybody’s happy for the two. It’s a really nice story.”
Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a Madison, Wi. native, was a member of the Crimson baseball team since his freshman year at Harvard. Over the course of his three years playing college ball, the thing that stood out was personal growth, both in terms of his strength and conditioning progress and his mental presence on the mound, according to Decker.
Simon was mostly a relief pitcher during his freshman year. Though he had found great success pitching at Madison West High School, the adjustment to college-level baseball was not easy.
“As a freshman, I was not very good,” Simon matter-of-factly commented. “I had a lot of trouble with command, I had a lot of trouble with my mechanics, and I really was not comfortable on the mound at all. I just wasn’t prepared to pitch in college.”
Though not a member of the starting rotation, Simon was able to adapt to his new environment. He cites former pitching coach, Mike Zandler, as the impetus for this development.
“He really worked with me, especially late in the season, on rebuilding my mechanics,” Simon said. “If you saw a video of me throwing now versus me throwing then, it would look like two different pitchers.”
“He really worked on his body and physical growth,” Decker commented. “He learned to pitch using both sides of the plate. He learned to attack you, and he could attack you with three pretty good pitches.”
After a year coming out of the bullpen, Rosenblum-Larson was ready to increase his presence on the mound. Coming into his sophomore season, he was a much better pitcher, and consistently threw each weekend. Even so, he struggled a bit on the mound, and didn’t pitch quite as well as he would have liked to. He continued to constantly fine-tune his mechanics with pitching coach Ron Rakowski.
“We worked together constantly on fine-tuning mechanics and really rebuilding my body,” Simon said. “My command got a lot better and my feel for my offspeed got a lot better.”
Simon kept on improving, and late in that season he reached a turning point. In a pivotal game against Brown, his performance solidified his spot in the starting rotation and proved that he could compete on a high level.
“My arm slot dropped a bit, I was throwing harder, I was throwing a lot more strikes,” Simon said. “That was my second to last start my sophomore year. Something clicked. I felt something that I hadn’t felt in a long time.”
“That was the game where I said, ‘That’s the guy,’” Decker added. “He was lights out, he was unhittable, and I think that was a turning point for him, where he finally says, ‘You know what, I can get this thing done.’”
Lights out he was. Simon pitched six innings with eleven strikeouts and just one earned run in the Crimson’s victory. Along with the obvious physical comfort on the mound came a mental comfort that Rosenblum-Larson would carry with him going forward.
“I said to myself, ‘You know what, I have two starts left. I’m going to have as much fun as I can on the mound, throw it as hard as I can and hope good things happen,’” Rosenblum-Larson said with a chuckle. “There was this looseness that I took into that start that flipped the switch for me. It was mental focus but it wasn’t intensity. It was this kind of relaxed focus.”
The mental presence on the mound was always Rosenblum-Larson’s biggest challenge, and a focal point of Decker’s role as Simon’s coach.
“He’s a competitive person,” Decker said. “My thing with Simon was just to calm him down sometimes. He learned not to get too upset when things weren’t going his way. I think he did a really good job working on his mindset, which is not an easy thing to do.”
Rosenblum-Larson carried this mentality through to his junior year, when he put up the best stats of his career (2.86 earned runs average and 82 strikeouts in 63 innings pitched), despite the added pressure of having scouts in the stands. He’d internalized the lessons he learned in seasons past and had a different approach to pitching. These lessons he would carry with him into the minor leagues.
“That’s something that I’ve taken into pro ball,” he said. “Learning these lessons about how to handle these moments of pressure, these moments of frustration, and using them to relax yourself, relax your mind and compete at a high level.”
After his junior season, the right-hander faced a difficult decision. He was selected with the 570th overall pick in the 19th round of the 2018 MLB Draft, a day he described as the best day of his life, something he’d been thinking about every day since he first picked up a baseball. Even so, accepting the offer would mean leaving Harvard after just three years. Ultimately, he decided to follow his heart and pursue professional baseball with Tampa Bay Rays.
“He came in here last May and made his decision to move on and leave Harvard after his junior year, which is not an easy one,” Decker said. “Selfishly, for the program, I wish he had stayed, but what I did tell him is that, ‘If you’re going to go [this summer], don’t come back here in the fall.’ And I’m glad he took my advice.”
Simon felt confident and comfortable in Single-A ball, though he once again found himself coming out of the bullpen instead of starting. He liked the looser approach to the game, with minimal involvement from the manager and the coaching staff. Despite a definitive increase in talent in the hitters he faced, he was able to take the lessons he learned playing baseball in the Ancient Eight and apply them to elevate his game.
“Ivy League hitters are sometimes tougher to get out than pro hitters,” he commented. “They might not be as athletically talented, but they sure know how to work a count, take pitches, be selective, and really get in your head as a pitcher. Some guys in pro ball may have more loose approaches where they’re more free-swinging or they’re willing to expand the zone at times, and I was able to take advantage of that.”
The major adjustment to his game he had to make regarded his new role on the pitching staff. Simon had to get used to a schedule during which he would pitch multiple times in a week for shorter durations, as opposed to once for an extended period. Even so, after building a sustainable routine, he was able to commit to the same lifting and body-care practices he utilized in college ball.
“The same things I learned in college I took with me to pro ball,” he said. “I can’t say enough how much developing at Harvard affected by ability to adjust to pro ball. All in all, it was a pretty easy adjustment period. It was a lot of fun, and it’s the kind of thing I thrive in.”
He cites one game against the Vermont Lake Monsters in the Short Single-A Penn League as his finest moment in the minor leagues so far. Simon came in for the seventh inning and struck out the first two batters he faced. He ended up finishing the game with six strikeouts in 2.2 innings, and with those stats, added confidence akin to the boost he felt after his sophomore year game against Brown.
“It was this moment where I was like, ‘Yeah I can compete. I can hang,’” he said. “You start to believe in your stuff and believe in your abilities. That was the moment where I grew into my new shoes.”
After continuing to pitch well in Short Single-A, Simon moved up to Full Single-A ball. There, he got the opportunity to pitch in game three of the championship series. He struck out six batters and picked up the save, setting up the Bowling Green Hot Rods to win the championship the following day.
“That’s what we play for,” Simon excitedly said. “Getting a chance to be a part of that was just so cool.”
Simon finished the season with a 1.16 earned run average and 62 strikeouts in 38.2 innings pitched across two levels of Single-A ball. He looks to continue growing once next season begins, whether as a starter or as a reliever.
“I don’t know what the future holds for me, but I’m hoping that I can just keep my head to the grindstone and keep working,” he mused. “That’s what’s gotten me here and that’s what’s hopefully going to get me to the next level.”
Noah Zavolas traversed a different path through Harvard baseball. Due to his size, he started off with a fair share of doubters about his place in college baseball. For the majority of his time recruiting during high school, Harvard was not on his list. However, he put himself in the right place at the right time at the Crimson’s prospect camp, and the Harvard coaching staff saw potential in the way he attacked pitching.
“Noah came into our prospect camp entering his senior year, and he was very good,” Coach Decker said. “It wasn’t like he was tipping 90 [miles per hour] or anything like that, but he showed some presence on the mound. He just got hitters out. You could see that he was a student of the game.”
Noah played on the Crimson baseball team since his freshman year. Also like Simon, Noah needed time to adjust to playing Division I baseball.
“My whole freshman and sophomore years were spent trying to figure out how to make myself a pitcher that could actually help a Division I pitching staff,” Zavolas said. “There was a lot of trial and error and a lot of frustration during my first two years here.”
The turning point for Noah came when he played summer ball in the Yawkey League out of Boston. As a member of the Charlestown Townies, Noah was able to develop his game in a relaxed setting.
“That was a place where I could play the game, pitch every week, and work on the craft of pitching,” he commented. “I was able to become the pitcher I knew I could be.”
Noah returned to school a completely transformed pitcher. Much more confident in his abilities, he had a solid junior year and was able to earn himself a starting spot in the rotation, as well as a spot in the Cape Cod League the following summer. There, he continued to defy expectations, and described those nine weeks as “single greatest experience of [his] life.”
“Being down there, I was adopted into community where they eat, sleep, and breathe baseball. That was perfect for me,” he said. “I had some phenomenal coaches down there who saw what I could do and believed in me.”
An excited Zavolas came back to Harvard ready to embark upon a senior campaign and showcase the fruits of his effort. Unfortunately, he broke his left foot in the fall. He had to take a little time off school to have surgery, and came back during the offseason determined to take strength and conditioning seriously in order to not lose the gains he had made before his injury.
“It was an opportunity in terms of being really creative in the weight room and trying different strength and conditioning ideas, seeing what I could do to make myself better,” Noah said. “Fortunately, things worked out well enough that the foot healed a few days before the team came back to campus for spring practices.”
Coming off the injury, Zavolas was driven to prove that he could still compete at a high level and make a meaningful contribution to the pitching staff, that the injury had not derailed his career at Harvard. And prove himself he did. Zavolas had a great senior season — bolstered by increased velocity and a better understanding of the art of pitching — that legitimized the summer ball he played in Cape Cod.
The team started off hot during Noah’s senior campaign, winning the Beanpot in early April. As a senior, this win was especially meaningful to Zavolas. Though it did not contribute towards the Crimson’s Ivy League record, he felt that he had left his mark through that championship victory. A few days later, in the star moment of both his senior year and his time as a member of the Crimson squad, Noah threw a no-hitter against Yale on April 13.
“That was absolutely a high point of the year,” he said. “The stars aligned in New Haven that Friday night. I think back to it and it just doesn’t seem real.”
“The way he focused, he was just a really locked-in guy,” Decker said. “My relationship with Noah on game day was just to leave him alone. Let him do his thing. There was a trust there that I had with Noah.”
Noah struck out twelve and allowed zero runs and zero hits in the nine inning win. He finished up his senior year with the best stats of his career: a 2.96 earned runs average with 77 strikeouts in 70 innings pitched. He was selected by the Seattle Mariners with the 538th overall pick in the 18th round of the 2018 MLB Draft, what he described as a “wild day.” Being drafted represented overcoming the doubts he had faced for years.
“In some ways, he’s been an inspiration to some of the other guys,” Decker offered. “If you keep working hard, you never know what can happen.”
Minor league ball was different from Ivy League ball. Even so, the adjustment was nothing that Zavolas couldn’t handle. Like Simon, Noah actually preferred the professional schedule over the collegiate one.
“In pro ball, it’s every day, and in a lot of ways, I think that schedule is easier and more conducive to baseball even though it’s more constant and ubiquitous,” Zavolas said. “The ability to create and perpetuate a rhythm where you follow the same routine every day makes the game a little bit more relaxed.”
The improved competition of the minor leagues did pose a challenge to Zavolas. The average minor league hitter comes from a larger, more talented player pool than the Ivy League draws from, such as a large school with a strong baseball program or Latin America. All are eager to prove themselves, which leads to more high-risk, high-reward at-bats that Noah was able to exploit.
“Competition-wise, there was a relatively dramatic step up in terms of the talent that you’d face,” he said. “ I had to make some adjustments, especially in pitch selection and strategy. Guys are more aggressive in pro ball, but adjusting to that was about just learning how to read hitters’ swings. I had to do that in the Ivy League, but now I had to make different inferences based on what I saw.”
Noah’s team, the Everett AquaSox in the Short Single-A Northwest League, was very good. The minor league season is split up into two halves, and they outright won the first half. This guaranteed them a spot in the playoffs at the end of the season, from which they also emerged victorious.
“They had sparkling cider, in the big bottles where everyone sprayed it on each other,” Noah said. “It was the minor league version of the clubhouse celebrations that you see on TV. And that was special just because I had never been a part of anything like that.”
The first playoff game in that series, on Sept. 5, was especially meaningful to Noah. Like Simon, he came out of the bullpen all year, so he had very little advance knowledge about if and when he would be pitching. That game, however, he ended up coming in, and had a performance he’ll never forget.
“It was actually the first time my dad had been able to come out all the way to the other side of the country and see me pitch, so when I got the call to go into the game it was pretty cool to know that he was in the stands for it,” Noah said. “I wound up pitching about four innings, did very well, and at the end of the game it was pretty wild to lock eyes with him in the stands. We both shook our heads, [recognizing] how it’s tough to believe that baseball has brought us both out here and everywhere in between.”
Noah finished the season with a 3.03 earned run average and 41 strikeouts in 38.2 innings pitched. He is back at Harvard right now, working as a research assistant in the English Department, and looks forward to heading to Arizona for spring training in March.
While Simon and Noah are two completely different pitchers who took two completely different paths to professional baseball, they are going through this journey together.
“Simon and I became really good friends as we moved up,” said Noah. “We’re always in constant contact, keeping each other updated but also shooting the breeze and talking about different aspects of pitching.”
The mutual respect they have for each other is evident. “Noah is a stud,” Simon put it simply.
Decker certainly misses the two, but is thankful for the opportunity to coach them for those years.
“We arguably had two of the best guys in the league last year,” he said. “They were the leaders of our staff.” He jokingly added, “But I know that some of our competitors are happy that they’re gone.”

Midterms, freezing temperatures, cuffing season… oh my! Welcome to the causes of college sickness, where few are spared and even fewer are prepared. We all have that one friend that claims he or she never, like never, gets sick. A week ago, I was that friend. Unfortunately, college sickness took this personally, so take it from me and my burning throat: avoid the plague at all costs.
Tip 1: Never Leave Your Room. Ever.
We’re serious. How many people have touched the table at your favorite spot in Lamont? Or the door handle of Annenberg? Yeah, it’s better not to think about it. You never know when or where you’re gonna encounter these illnesses, so your best bet is to stay in your room forever. Your classes are filmed and you have a case of ramen in the common room — use your resources wisely.
Tip 2: Do the Things That, um, Keep You Alive
You don’t have to be premed to understand how sickness occurs (thank god). Wash your hands often with soap and water, avoid touching your face, and hydrate as often as possible. Don’t listen to your favorite elementary school teacher: sharing is not caring. Sharing is just a recipe for a stuffy nose and the worst fatigue you’ve had since last year’s reading period. Sorry, Mrs. Lacey, it’s just not worth it.
Tip 3: Make It a Competition
Harvard likes to be the best at everything, and sickness is no exception. This place finds a way to breed any and all illnesses, even the ones we thought did not exist anymore. Why not turn that competition around? Are you the ~healthiest~ among your friends? The last person to get sick? The best germaphobe around? Congrats, you’ve won good health, which is synonymous with winning the lottery in our books.
Tip 4: Law of Attraction
Maybe, if we just focus on the idea of not getting sick, we won’t get sick. Dream it, believe it. Problem solved.
If only I had listened to my own advice, maybe I wouldn’t be writing this under a pile of tissues in bed. Spread the word (not in person, of course, because germs!) and end this plague once and for all.
