After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was sort of odd, learning that I had been the target of a hateful, homophobic email via a campus-wide message from President Bacow denouncing it. But it’s August and fall move-in is underway, which, for an employee in the College Housing Office, means some emails take a little longer to get to this time of year.
More than odd, though, it was anachronistic. I don’t intend to share the email publicly for the same reasons President Bacow outlined, but it felt like something out of my childhood. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, hate organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church were common fixtures in the media, protesting the funerals for victims of brutal hate crimes like Matthew Shepard or picketing college campuses. They employed rhetoric similar to that which I saw in the email, including references to HIV/AIDS or, now, Monkeypox.
I admit I was initially amused at the thought that someone had gone through the effort of crawling through Harvard websites or list-servs to identify openly BGLTQ staff and faculty and send such a vile screed.
But then I realized there is nothing amusing about it. The last several years have seen a resurgence of hate against queer folks in this country. Pundits and politicians use false rhetoric about “grooming” to erase queer people from school curricula. Far-right extremists target innocuous events where drag performers read to children with threats of violence and hate speech. Hate groups have recently disrupted joyful Pride month events nationwide.
At around the same time I read the email, Boston Children’s Hospital — an institution (and Harvard Medical School affiliate) at the forefront of gender-affirming care for transgender youth — issued a statement about threats its clinicians and staff have received. More than a dozen states have passed laws that target trans people, including by denying them access to life-saving healthcare and barring children from playing sports.
It’s easy to feel insulated from all of this. Harvard has been one of the most accepting and thoughtful spaces I’ve encountered when it comes to supporting queer students and staff. During my six years working at Harvard, I’ve been continually impressed by Harvard’s efforts to make sure queer students are safe on campus. It helps, of course, that we live in Massachusetts — the first state in the U.S. to embrace marriage equality and one known for its political and social progressivism.
But we aren’t insulated, really. Just a few years ago, we saw the “Straight Pride Parade” march on Boston City Hall. That same year, one Harvard University police officer called another a homophobic slur. It’s not clear whether this email was written by a Harvard affiliate, but I don’t doubt that there are some individuals on campus who hold those beliefs.
There will always be more work to do to make Harvard a more inclusive space – work that is inextricable from that of creating a more inclusive society. Harvard does not exist in a bubble. While students are here, they greatly impact the Cambridge, Boston, and Massachusetts communities. After graduating, many of our alumni will become leaders — the people empowered to move their fields, their hometowns, the country, and the world towards a fuller embrace of the BGLTQ community.
That work starts on campus. We can begin by making it clear that hate has no place at Harvard.
To BGLTQ staff, faculty, and graduate students, I encourage you to add your name to the Out @ Harvard list to ensure that queer students know that they are welcome here and have resources they can contact.
To upper-level students, make sure you welcome first-years to campus warmly and remind them that all students, regardless of their identities, belong at Harvard. To all students, stay engaged with the events hosted by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and BGLTQ specialty tutors and proctors.
Beyond our campus, vote and advocate for politicians and policies that affirm the dignity of all queer people. And, if you haven’t already, register to vote either here or in your home state and request your ballot prior to November’s elections.
A lot has improved since I was younger, but the events of the past few years in our community (and my inbox) are a reminder that there remains much to do. I challenge members of the Harvard community to think about what your role is in advancing inclusion and belonging both on and off campus.
Brian M. Boughton is the Assistant Director of Housing Operations & Student Life IT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla, a 32-year-old Harvard Kennedy School student from Peru, died on Aug. 11 while in police custody at a hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia, after he was allegedly mistreated and discriminated against by police.
Ventocilla, a transgender man and a prominent trans rights activist, was pronounced dead five days after he was detained for alleged drug possession upon his arrival in Bali, where he was traveling on a honeymoon vacation with his spouse. His family alleges he was arrested in an “act of racial discrimination and transphobia,” deprived of basic rights, and subjected to police violence while family members and lawyers were kept in the dark about his condition.
Ventocilla was a founding member of the Peruvian trans rights advocacy organization Diversidades Trans Masculinas. At the Harvard Kennedy School, he was pursuing a master’s degree in Public Administration in International Development as a member of the school’s Class of 2023.
In a statement released Tuesday, the families of Ventocilla and his spouse, Sebastián Marallano, called on the “Peruvian justice system to properly investigate the human rights violations of Rodrigo and Sebastian and to guarantee truth, justice and reparation.”
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in a statement late Tuesday night that the school “supports the family’s call for an immediate and thorough investigation and for public release of all relevant information.”
“The statement from Rodrigo’s family raises very serious questions that deserve clear and accurate answers,” Elmendorf wrote.
The Bali Police have launched an investigation into his death, according to the Bali Sun, an English-language publication on the island, but it is unclear what the focus of the inquiry is or whether the results will be publicly released.
The Bali Police did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Stefanus Satake Bayu Setianto, head of public relations for the Bali Police, previously told the Indonesian news outlet detikBali that Ventocilla died after consuming unseized drugs on Aug. 8 while he was in police custody. (Ventocilla was identified in local media reports by the initials VVRDP.)
“The cause of death is a complete failure of body function that causes impaired kidney function and impaired liver and nervous system function to the patient’s brain,” Stefanus Satake Bayu Setianto said, according to a translation of his statement to detikBali.
But in their statement Tuesday, Ventocilla’s family cast doubt on the police’s explanation, writing that “we do not know the real causes of his death” because “the Indonesian authorities have not allowed” for an independent autopsy.
Ventocilla was initially brought by authorities to Bhayangkara Hospital after experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, according to the Indonesian news outlet Radar Bali. After his condition deteriorated, he was transported to the Sanglah Central General Hospital, where he died on Aug. 11 at around 3:10 p.m. local time, according to Radar Bali.
Ventocilla’s family said in the statement that authorities in Bali were not transparent about his condition.
“The Indonesian police obstructed access to the hospital at all times to the lawyers hired by the family, as well as the Harvard students who came to their aid,” the family wrote.
Ventocilla was detained on Aug. 6 upon arrival at the I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar for possession of an herb grinder, according to the Bali Police and a Facebook post from Diversidades Trans Masculinas. The Bali Police also said authorities found other items suspected to contain marijuana and two pill tablets in Ventocilla’s luggage, according to Radar Bali.
Ventocilla’s family wrote in the Tuesday statement that he was arrested for possessing prescription drugs he used as mental health medication. Ventocilla and Marallano, his spouse, were deprived of “vital human rights such as health, freedom, access to legal defense,” the family wrote in the statement.
Marallano arrived in Bali on a separate flight and was detained by police without charge after attempting to help Ventocilla, according to the family’s statement, which was not signed by individual members.
Marallano was also subsequently hospitalized days after being detained by police, the family statement said.
Police in Bali demanded “exorbitant sums of money” ranging up to $200,000 to free Ventocilla and Marallano, the family’s statement said.
Ventocilla’s family also took aim at Peruvian consular services in Indonesia, which they said “did not show up to provide support” until after the family received news of Ventocilla’s death.
“The consulate’s actions were late, negligent and hindered the family’s request for help when Rodrigo was still alive,” the family’s statement said.
The family called on the Peruvian Foreign Ministry to “assume its responsibility for neglecting its duties” and to conduct an investigation into “the actions and omissions” of Julio Eduardo Tenorio Pereyra, the head of consular services for the Peruvian Embassy in Indonesia.
“Nothing will give us back Rodrigo nor the integrity of Sebastian, however, our demand for justice and truth also pursues the objective of improving the quality of the service of assistance to our fellow citizens abroad without preferences of class, gender, ethnicity or others,” the family wrote in the statement.
The Peruvian embassy in Indonesia and the Peruvian Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment regarding the family’s allegations Tuesday.
Elmendorf, the Harvard Kennedy School dean, said Tuesday the school received the statement from Ventocilla’s family describing “extremely disturbing circumstances surrounding Rodrigo’s death.”
“Harvard Kennedy School staff have stayed in close contact with Rodrigo Ventocilla’s family and have offered ongoing support as the family copes with this devastating ordeal,” Elmendorf wrote. “Rodrigo’s HKS classmates and HKS alumni in multiple countries have also provided vital assistance.”
Elmendorf and HKS Senior Associate Dean for Degree Programs and Student Affairs ​​Debra E. “Debbie” Isaacson announced Ventocilla’s death to HKS affiliates on Aug. 12. They wrote that his death is “a devastating loss for his family and friends, for all of us at the Kennedy School, and for the many people whom he undoubtedly would have served after graduation.”
“Rodrigo came to Harvard with a resolve to create positive change within his communities,” Elmendorf and Isaacson wrote on Aug. 12. “At the Kennedy School, he was a beloved member of the BIPOC and LGBTQ communities and organized opportunities to bring people closer together.”
Elmendorf and Isaacson said there would be a gathering in memory of Ventocilla.
“The School stands with all of Rodrigo’s friends and colleagues and with the LGBTQ+ community,” Elmendorf wrote Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 24, 2022, at 1:41 p.m.
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will join the Harvard Institute of Politics as a visiting fellow for the fall 2022 semester, the IOP announced Wednesday morning.
De Blasio will visit the IOP several times throughout the semester to participate in events and programming during his visiting fellowship, joining the IOP’s cohort of seven resident fellows in the fall.
De Blasio will also serve as a leadership fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health during the second half of the fall semester, the school announced Wednesday.
De Blasio’s fellowships will be a homecoming: A lifelong Red Sox fan, he was raised in Cambridge and graduated high school from Cambridge Rindge and Latin.
“I am happy to join the IOP to help inspire our nation’s next generation of leaders to find ways to serve in politics and public service, and to build a government that serves working people,” he said in the press release.
IOP Interim Director Setti D. Warren celebrated de Blasio’s appointment as a visiting fellow.
“Mayor de Blasio’s decades of experience in local government, federal agencies, national campaigns, and running the largest city in the country will provide invaluable insight to our students and the Harvard community,” Warren said in the press release. “We are excited to welcome Mayor de Blasio to campus as we look for pathways forward on the challenges facing our democracy.”
De Blasio, who led New York City through the Covid-19 pandemic, will also teach a course on leadership and public service at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Former Boston Mayor Kim M. Janey, who led Boston for eight months during the pandemic before losing a bid for a full term in 2021, will also serve as a senior leadership fellow at the School of Public Health in the fall. She recently headlined the IOP’s spring 2022 cohort of resident fellows.
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams said in a statement that de Blasio and Janey both had the “distinction of leading during one of the toughest challenges in public health — the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“Their insights and their mentorship will be tremendously helpful to students who aspire to public office, as well as to those who are looking to lead in other sectors,” Williams said.
De Blasio served two terms as mayor of New York City between 2014 and 2021. He was ineligible to run for a third term in 2021 due to term limits.
Since then, he has struggled in electoral politics.
He launched a failed bid for president in the 2020 election, ending his campaign just four months after he entered the race. Earlier this year, de Blasio ran in the Democratic primary for New York’s 10th congressional district, but dropped out of the race just two months later.
“Time for me to leave electoral politics and focus on other ways to serve,” de Blasio wrote in a July tweet announcing the end of his congressional campaign.
De Blasio said in an interview Wednesday that hopes to impress upon students at the IOP that serving in public office can be a “life-affirming experience” and that they have the potential to make a “huge impact.”
“As difficult as this moment is — and it’s extraordinarily difficult — the answer is to engage more, not less,” de Blasio said. “And to recognize that the tremendous potential for change always exists.”
During his time at Harvard, De Blasio said he “absolutely” intends to watch a baseball game at Fenway Park.
“The Harvard-Yale game cuts both ways in our family,” said de Blasio, whose father and son both attended Yale University. “So it’s a complicated situation.”
“But Red Sox-Yankees is never complicated for me,” he said.
