After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Golden Child,” by Claire Adam — a debut novel about a father’s tough choice — is only the second book published by Sarah Jessica Parker’s imprint, SJP for Hogarth. The novel begins as Clyde half-heartedly searches for his missing son, Paul. Through these first chapters of lackluster searching, we learn that Paul is “slightly retarded,” has a twin, Peter, who is considered a genius, and his family was recently robbed by bandits. These first chapters illuminate the stark differences in how Clyde feels about his twin boys, even from their birth: Peter is “the good baby,” while Paul is nothing but “the other one.” As the novel progresses, the two sons receive the same education at some of the best schools in the area, due to Peter’s high test scores, but only at their mother’s refusal to separate the twins to different schools. Clyde accommodates his wife’s wishes by persuading the principal of a highly ranked school to allow Paul to join Peter, but Clyde continues to have faith only in Peter. While the descriptions of Trinidad, where Adam was born and raised, are illustrious, the descriptions of the characters lack the same careful crafting. Although highly anticipated, promising a tale of family and tragedy, “Golden Child” doesn’t live up to the hype.
The novel’s discussion of learning disabilities is truly lacking in anything significant or beneficial, an issue that is only exacerbated in all the scenes where a nuanced conversation could have easily taken place. A teacher, Father Kavanaugh, takes an interest in Paul and believes that those who taught Paul before just hadn’t “tried the right way.” At first it seems like this plotline will blossom into a touching story where Father Kavanaugh helps Paul learn — and learn to believe in himself — but this moment is quickly forgotten and only briefly mentioned later to explain Father Kavanaugh’s frustration at Paul’s lack of progress. Adam seems to perpetuate a sort of hopelessness for those who are born with learning disabilities.
As if that weren’t bad enough, the ending of the novel leaves a bad taste. Clyde is forced to make a Sophie’s Choice between his sons, except instead of both lives on the line, it is Paul’s life and Peter’s Harvard tuition. Clyde’s final choice is gut-wrenching, but the novel ends before he can explore the emotional consequences of his decision — there are only a measly 10 pages dedicated to the aftermath. An abridgement of the first 200 pages and an investigation on the repercussions of Clyde’s decision would have strengthened the novel’s emotional depth. Instead, the reader is subject to countless pages of petty familial squabbles.
Fortunately, Adam does have a true sense of place and a knack for describing it. The description of a place that is not often featured in popular literature makes “Golden Child” unique. Early on the reader is plunged into the world of Trinidad as Adam inundates the pages with region-specific wildlife like “agouti,” and “keskidee.” Furthermore, she captures the Trinidadian dialect in the dialogue. The well-written setting is the novel’s one saving grace, keeping the slow middle section mildly interesting. However, the setting alone is not enough.
Although the premise promises a thoughtful and heartbreaking look at family facing difficult choices, the novel is sorely hurt by the expectations set for itself. Adam fails to tackle the topic of learning disabilities in a poignant way, instead leaving a sense of hopelessness with no real discussion of the consequences of a parent’s treatment of their children. This novel could have offered so much, but failed to deliver.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past week, Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald Sullivan, who is also a professor at Harvard Law School, has been embroiled in controversy over his decision to join the legal team of Harvey Weinstein, the former film producer facing allegations of serious sexual misconduct. What should have been a routine case for an experienced legal scholar has now turned into a lightning rod for misdirected criticism on campus. Many at Harvard, both in person and on social media, have responded with “shock” and disappointment — the type of reactions that I would have expected if Sullivan himself had been accused of Weinstein’s alleged crimes. Yet, Sullivan is doing exactly what he should be doing, which is lending his expertise to a difficult legal defense, and I applaud his decision to represent Weinstein.
It appears that criticism of Sullivan generally centers around two concerns — either that his professional work for Weinstein will somehow prevent him from effectively responding to sexual misconduct and assault in Winthrop House, or that the residents of Winthrop House can no longer trust him to deal with cases of sexual misconduct and assault, regardless of his other capabilities as a dean.
Both critiques rely upon the murky assumption that the process of crafting a legal defense is so impactful to the lawyer that it causes him or her to have an automatic, subconscious bias in favor of all future individuals accused of that same crime.
By this logic, perhaps we should worry that Sullivan — who represented formerly convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez — may not believe Harvard students who are victims of violent crime. And what if he had defended a thief? Would we automatically assume that he wouldn’t respond seriously to petty crimes committed in Winthrop House? It is absurd to think that the mere act of constructing legal arguments in defense of Weinstein would transform Sullivan from a capable administrator into a negligent one. But he does have a compelling reason, given his professional experience, to take this case.
Harvey Weinstein has been burned at the stake of American public opinion — and rightfully so, in most of our minds. Over the past year and a half, we have learned nauseating details of the allegations made against him by several dozen women. Just about every news outlet in the country has covered these accusations at great length. We probably would be hard-pressed to find any individual in America who thinks Weinstein is innocent or any jury who would not instinctively convict him based on this public image. Yet, that does not change the fact that it is the responsibility of our legal system still to treat him as fairly as any other defendant. In fact, this is precisely the kind of case that we should expect a Harvard Law School professor to take — one that is seemingly so difficult to win that it demands a legal mind of the highest caliber.
There is a reason that our justice system is built upon due process. The procedure is much more important than any particular result, no matter how passionate we may be about a single case. Anything short of a vigorous fight on the defendant’s behalf cannot provide us with a guarantee that the process is working effectively. And Sullivan, as the devil’s advocate, is performing that vital role.
It is a shame that Sullivan’s character has been smeared in this way since taking on Weinstein’s case, as if he’s become a less reliable or trustworthy member of our community. On the contrary, he should be commended for defending the core values inherent to the American tradition of civil liberty.
I am terrified by the prospect that we may be nearing a day when defense attorneys feel the need to think twice before providing legal representation, because they may be subjected to public humiliation simply for doing their job. If this is ever the case, there will be no distinction between a trial by public opinion and a trial in a court of law. The onslaught of negative publicity for a lawyer will be so costly that few good attorneys will want to defend those who — for one reason or another — have been presumed guilty by a public majority. Such individuals will find no advocate in the court of law, and the integrity of our legal system will cease to exist.
The only bulwarks that we have against this dystopian, alternative reality are individuals like Sullivan. I hope — if only to demonstrate to other lawyers that they should not kowtow to the tyranny of irrational public outcry — that he continues to represent Weinstein. Sullivan will have done us a great service, even as so many of us continue to turn our backs on him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week ago, in response to debate and concern within Winthrop House and across campus, Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. sent an email out to the House community expounding upon the fundamental principles of the American justice system. The email expounded upon the totalitarian threat of mob justice, the fallibility of the justice system as it stands, and the necessity of a strong criminal defense for the accused. Sullivan’s decision to defend Harvey Weinstein, the media mogul against whom dozens of allegations of sexual assault and misconduct helped spark the #MeToo Movement, has sparked much debate. While his email certainly does not mischaracterize the nature of the justice system or his role as a defense attorney, it fails to seriously consider the effects of his decision on his ability to perform his duties as a faculty dean.
Sullivan has failed to address the incongruity of his two roles — defending Weinstein in his role as defense attorney, while simultaneously working to promote a safe and comfortable environment for victims of sexual misconduct and assault in his capacity as faculty dean. We condemn his choice to represent Weinstein and urge him to address the tension between the two roles more directly than he previously has.
As faculty dean, Sullivan has a primary responsibility to his students, namely in representing Winthrop House and fostering a “close-knit community” within the College. This includes upholding the College’s efforts to combat sexual assault on campus. By choosing to represent Weinstein, Sullivan has jeopardized his ability to keep the trust of an alarmingly large group of students on campus. The statistic bears repeating: One in five women is sexually assaulted in college. Over 90 percent of those women never report these instances of sexual assault. Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein while simultaneously holding a vital mentorship role for students risks perpetuating this silence.
In fairness, Sullivan has made himself available to his students through holding office hours to address students’ concerns. Even so, when a mentor and authority figure makes a decision to defend an individual facing allegations of sexual misconduct, he has in effect closed his doors to any student who might look to him for support or solace regarding these issues.
We recognize the validity of Sullivan’s sense of moral imperative as a defense attorney. His track record as a notable defender of those who have been prematurely condemned by the court of public opinion is a testament to the genuine nature of that feeling. In choosing this representation, however, he overlooks another moral imperative: his duty to foster an open and safe environment for all Winthrop residents. If Sullivan insists on defending Weinstein he must publicly elevate and empower other House officials as points of contact and support for sexual misconduct at Winthrop, such as the House’s Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators.
The students of Winthrop deserve a personal acknowledgement from Sullivan that his decision might make some students feel estranged from the House community. It is not enough to justify his actions with legal principles while ignoring the root of students’ concerns. We therefore strongly urge Sullivan to issue another statement to Winthrop members. This statement should explicitly address the issue of sexual assault, elevate the resources available to victims and allies, and recognize the discomfort students may feel at his choice. Such an acknowledgement would go a long way towards better promoting a culture of transparency within Winthrop about sexual misconduct.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When is last time you go to Catholic Mass?” I look down from my mother’s technicolor FaceTime profile. “This past Sunday.” She smiles, and the conversation moves on to other topics: my grandparents’ health, NPR’s coverage of the new Vatican-China deal, my cousins’ college visit to the States. I sigh in relief.
Had she not bought my fib, I’d have answered “June,” when our newly green card-endowed family visited China for the first time in over a decade and prayed in a cathedral. As I knelt before the priest’s altar, I came eye to eye with Mao Zedong’s portrait nestled at the foot of crucified Christ. My extended family, clutching their rosaries, noticed nothing. I felt a tear well up — or perhaps a wave of nausea at their ignorance. I haven’t stepped back into a church since and certainly have not attended Mass at Harvard.
If you’re confused, my worship hesitation doesn’t stem from a loss of faith in God or in religion. It’s because of a dilemma that many immigrants and bright-eyed academics wrestle with every day: The burden of knowing far too much about the status quo in the Catholic Church to stay complacent, yet being momentarily powerless to execute impactful change. “But Minjue,” one might question, “this isn’t a rare problem, and certainly not one exclusive to Harvard.” They’d be right. Yet that doesn’t expedite the problem solving process, especially in an institution where students are bred to be “citizen-leaders” that create “conditions for social transformation.”
My feelings resurface when I scroll through BBC News one day and see the headline “China Catholic bishops: Historic deal with Vatican reached,” or read about the Chinese government’s unprecedented recognition of the Vatican’s authority to legitimize Catholic bishops, or hear that Pope Francis has approved seven Chinese government-appointed bishops. Leveraging my handy Government 20 analytical skills, my stomach sinks as I realize the tentative political deal is China’s foot in the Vatican’s door — its utilization of the Holy See’s authority in its bureaucracy. China has enshrined government-prescribed teachings while increasing persecution of the underground Catholic Church more than ever before. Yet, when I try to explain to my mother that our very-underground-Catholic family in China is repressed with state-mandated doctrines that have violated our human rights, she doesn’t believe it. Instead, she insists, “The Pope is always right, and now he’s on China’s side. That’s great!”
At some point, I realized I had to accept there is an information boundary I can’t cross with my mother. Unlike me, she (and most of the ten million Catholics in China) didn’t grow up with a copy of Nora Lam’s autobiography China Cry, documenting the horrors of Catholic concentration camps during Mao Zedong’s Anti-Rightist Movement. She wasn’t surrounded by a community of religiously diverse peers who revealed to her how easily Catholics’ sermon-based teachings are dictated by a traditionally religiously oppressive Chinese government. And she certainly couldn’t stick around after lecturer Adrian Zenz’s “Recent Developments in Xinjiang” lecture at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies to confirm the worst: Crackdown on underground clergy is at its harshest.
What I’ve been having a hard time accepting is that there’s little I can do to change the injustices I know.
I’ve spoken with many other students, from China, Bangladesh, Somalia, and Ukraine, who share the same experience under different news headlines. We’re trapped in another cathedral of education, where education is our faith and inaction is our oppression. And so far, we’ve responded with the same ritualized prayer: worry, discussion, finding cultural groups on campus, speaking with professors, attending speaker events, and returning back to where we started. It makes us uneasy, talking to each other about our countries like wounds we can’t heal.
Over the past few weeks, however, I’ve been reflecting on my avoidance of all of these forms of cathedrals and churches. I’ve gone to my Chinese Government professor’s office hours, and felt a breath of fresh air when, instead of criticizing my accidental slip into Mandarin, he continued in our conversation in our mother tongue. I’ve made boba tea with the Asian American Women’s Association, comforted my Bangladeshi roommate about native conflicts, and offered a fresh perspective on Bai Juyi’s “Song of Lasting Pain” in Humanities 10a. These experiences have helped me realize, slowly, that “only knowing” isn’t a sign of shame, and “not doing” is just a passage of the present. Like a coiled spring, my potential only increases with time, and avoiding it is more of a sign of cowardice.
This week, when I FaceTime my mother, I think I’ll be able to give a truthful answer for the first time since June. There is enough space in cathedrals for faith and education, knowing and ignorance, doing and not doing. Most of all, there’s time, and forgiveness. It’s just up to us to wait for them.

Harvard Medical School faculty and staff collaborated with the American Federation of Teachers to release an online course earlier this month that aims to educate the union's more than 1.7 million affiliates on the opioid crisis.
The course, called “Combating the Opioid Crisis: AFT Responds,” is an updated version of “OpioidX,” an e-learning course initially created by the Harvard Medical School in 2017 as a free public educational tool.
Catherine Finn, the deputy editor of Harvard Health Publishing and executive producer of OpioidX, said the original version of the course featured a wide range of expertise, with personal stories from Harvard faculty members, patients, and members of law enforcement.
She said the class is a "novel course" because it is largely a video-based narrative course.
“I chose that because I am very interested in health literacy,” Finn said. “I think people’s stories and video-based materials really impact people especially if it is the medium that people are used to.”
OpioidX was released through HarvardX, an initiative that allows the public to take online courses crafted by Harvard faculty.
Michael F. Bierer ’79, an assistant professor at the Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, made guest appearances in the video lessons to discuss the distinction between opioid addiction and physical dependence. As an addiction specialist, he said he sees the course not only as an educational opportunity but as a step in the fight against the “stigma” and “shame” that surround the discussion of opioids.
“It's sad that there is such pessimism about management of this disease, and that pessimism as well as stigma and judgmental society is keeping people away from care,” Bierer said.
The medical school decided to re-launch the couse in April 2018 following its initial success. More than 24,000 people have registered since the launch of the first iteration of the course, according to Finn.
The AFT course's content closely resembles the material covered in OpioidX. Finn said some elements were adapted, however, to fit the needs of the union's members — teachers, school nurses, and other staff in both traditional and non-traditional academic settings.
AFT president Randi Weingarten discussed the central role education plays in addressing the opioid crisis in a press release announcing the new course.
“Opioid addiction is a crisis of epidemic proportions. Amidst the horrible reality that Americans are more likely to die from opioid overdoses than car accidents, education is a key first step in making sure our communities have the information they need to treat and prevent addiction and overdose,” Weingarten said.
She said the course would benefit members across elementary, high school, and higher education as they face these challenges in their everyday work.
Bertha K. Madras, a Medical School professor who served on President Donald Trump’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, and whose work for the commission greatly influenced the online course’s curriculum, stressed the importance of helping teachers respond to the crisis.
“Many people fall through the cracks and do not have this issue addressed by the medical community, by the healthcare community,” Madras said. “It is critical to educate teachers that are going to educate students, and also form a nucleus of informed people that can educate parents, because parents are very important.”
Correction: Feb. 7, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated more than 24,000 people registered for the first iteration of the course. In fact, more than 24,000 people have registered since the first iteration.

Keeping with decades of tradition, the Hasty Pudding paraded, roasted, and honored Bryce Dallas Howard, its 2019 Woman of the Year, Thursday afternoon.
But for the first time in the group’s history, six women stood among the colorfully costumed Hasty Pudding Theatricals performers as they — and Howard — made their way down Massachusetts Avenue and into Farkas Hall.
The theater troupe made headlines at last year’s festivities when it announced that it would begin accepting women into its cast. Since 1844, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals has put on a drag show every year with only male actors. Women were allowed to hold positions on the group’s business, tech, and design boards, but until this year were never given the opportunity to perform onstage.
Asked for her thoughts on the historic nature of this year’s co-ed production at a press conference Thursday, Howard said, “It’s about time.”
“I’m really, really grateful to be here, in general, and especially this year — it’s a huge honor,” she said.
The events kicked off with a parade that wound its way through the streets around Harvard Square. Undeterred by the 14 degree cold, the lively procession featured Howard waving and smiling atop a Black Bentley, flanked by Hasty Pudding President Grace C. Ramsey ’19 and Cast Vice President David J. Lynch ’20. Pudding members dressed in eccentric attire — including a Shakespearean doublet, a cactus suit, and an inflatable dinosaur costume — danced alongside the car.
Parade onlooker John L. Nugent ’21 called the parade “amazing” and said he is glad “we’re celebrating talented and accomplished women.”
Preceding the roast in Farkas Hall, Chairman of the Hasty Pudding Institute Andrew L. Farkas ’82 made a short speech reflecting on the historic nature of the occasion.
“How fun to be here on what is the most important day, perhaps, of our 200-year history,” he said. “I want to congratulate all 200 years, all the alunni members of this organization — alive, past, and all those to come — for having done what it is that every organization should do, which is welcoming women into our cast and turning the entirety of Hasty Pudding 100 percent co-ed.”
Following Farkas’s introduction, Ramsey and Lynch led the celebratory roast of Howard. Before receiving the Pudding Pot — the award given to the organization’s Woman of the Year and Man of the Year honorees — the actress was made to face off against a dinosaur in a game of basketball, produce fake tears before the audience, and pie a student in the face.
At the conclusion of the roast, Howard joked, “For some of probably the smartest people on the planet, [Harvard students] are totally bananas.”
“I’ll never forget this for as long as I live — and please accept my children into Harvard,” she added, to laughter from the audience.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of Harvard Square’s daily life, ongoing plans for a complete transformation of the central Harvard Square Kiosk and its surrounding plaza are underway. Designers, architects, and citizens mingled at a public showcase Thursday to view and discuss the project’s progress.
More than three years ago, the City of Cambridge, which owns the property, first launched an initiative to restore and rejuvenate the space. The kiosk is currently occupied by Out of Town News, which offers the Square’s visitors a selection of newspapers, magazines, and souvenirs.
In order to obtain a diverse array of public opinion, the city established the Harvard Square Kiosk and Plaza Working Group and organized several community workshops. The group published its final report in Oct. 2018 and imagines the kiosk and plaza to “attract and serve a broad range of people” and “act as platforms for community gatherings, including civic, artistic, and social activities.”
The plan's central priorities are to achieve greater accessibility, incorporate innovative technology, improve ease of transportation, and provide social services to marginalized populations. Proposed programming in the space includes festivals, music performances, art installations, historical exhibits, and food donation drives.
The design incorporates a high degree of flexibility, while also preserving historical significance, said project architect Theodore T. Touloukian. He described the new space as “adaptable,” while also also respecting the original structure.
Katherine F. Watkins, the Cambridge City Engineer, discussed the importance of the space’s sustainability.
"In terms of design, it’s really how will this space work for people today, five years from now, ten years from now, twenty years from now, and really making sure it’s a timeless piece,” she said.
Though designers and organizers were optimistic, several residents in attendance voiced their concerns about the design plans.
Cambridge resident Peter A. Torpey said that while the renovations are an improvement, he would characterize the changes as “incremental.”
“It’s not a huge change, and it feels like just a variation on what’s there now,” he said. “An improvement, sure, but not really rethinking what it could be and the potential of the space, and how it can become a showcase for Cambridge and Harvard.”
Vincent L. Dixon, a former Harvard Square tour guide, said he is worried about the possible lack of tourist information and welcoming aspects of the kiosk during renovations.
“They will pretend to provide some services on a very limited basis and people won’t even know to come in,” Dixon said.
Organizers purposefully hosted the public showcase with the goal of soliciting public feedback, according to Touloukian.
“The project itself only gets better from the feedback that we receive from the community,” he said. “Events like this tonight, the open house, are opportunities for us to really engage the general public and receive feedback about what’s going to make this building special.”
In the wake of several Harvard Square businesses closing, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said the success of the Harvard Square Kiosk is vital for the area. Though Out of Town News’s lease ended today, Devereux said the City Manager renewed the lease so that the space remains occupied during this planning period.
“We have enough vacant spaces in Harvard already – we don’t need another one,” she said.
Torpey said he thinks the public and designers alike should continue to debate the kiosk renovations so that the space can address the “needs of all the constituents in the community.”
“I’m very interested because I care about the space. It’s the heart of Cambridge and it is a landmark. It is a point of reference, it is a focal point of the community and has the potential to be even more so,” he said.
Renovation plans indicate construction on the redesigned kiosk space will begin in summer 2019.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard negotiators proposed that student workers retain the right to choose whether they join the University’s newest union and pay union dues in a bargaining session with Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers Wednesday, a provision that would be unique among Harvard’s union contracts.
The proposal drew fierce criticism from union organizers, while the University maintained the provision was meant to protect Harvard’s educational mission and its students.
Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV characterized the University’s position as an “open shop” proposal and the union’s position as an “agency shop” proposal.
An agency shop arrangement — which is typically achieved by including a provision known as a “union-security clause” — would require all student workers to pay dues to cover the cost of bargaining, according to Gould. An open shop arrangement would give student workers the choice of whether or not to pay dues.
“On balance, I think union-security clauses make a lot of sense because of the free rider problem,” Gould said. “Everyone should pay their way.”
All of Harvard’s other union contracts follow the agency shop model, as do contracts between other private universities — including New York University, Brandeis University, and Tufts University — and their graduate student unions.
HGSU-UAW proposed a union-security clause during its first bargaining session with the University in October, according to Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, an HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member.
The union security agreement was meant to ensure that “all student workers who work under and benefit from the contract share the cost of representation fairly and equally,” Sandalow-Ash wrote in an emailed statement.
“The administration’s proposal would limit the union’s resources and hurt student workers’ ability to effectively assert our rights and support each other,” she wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that, under the University’s proposal, student workers would “continue to have the choice they currently have, which is whether or not to join the union.”
The union’s proposal, Swain wrote, would require all students to join the union and pay dues, or be subject to a fee equivalent to the dues. Otherwise, they may face consequences.
“If they did not do so, they would be subject to termination, which for some student workers would make it impossible to complete their academic program,” Swain wrote.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 previously articulated the University’s intention to separate academic and labor matters in union negotiations in an email sent to Harvard affiliates prior to the start of bargaining sessions.
“We will not agree to terms that will compromise our educational mission,” Garber wrote in the October email.
Carrie Barbash, the president of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, wrote in an email that while she is not familiar with the details of the University’s proposal, she is “strongly opposed” to an open shop arrangement.
“Harvard has never proposed an open shop to any other unions, so I don’t understand why they would do it now with HGSU-UAW,” Barbash wrote in an email. “If that is what Harvard negotiators are proposing, that is extremely disappointing, and inconsistent with successful and long-standing past practices.”
Swain did not respond to a question about the differences between different unions’ contracts.
Gould suggested an alternative to terminating student workers who do not pay dues or fees: The union could instead impose other types of sanctions, such as arbitration or judicial proceedings.
“It might be a good compromise to allow the union to avoid having free riders while allowing dissenting students to complete their education,” he said.
The University and the union also continued negotiating other topics Wednesday, including health and safety provisions and a sexual harassment and nondiscrimination policy for which the union has repeatedly asked.
The union’s proposal calls for workers covered by its contract be able to pursue third-party arbitration for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. The University proposed in response that HGSU-UAW representatives be appointed to committees that could recommend changes to the University’s current Title IX policies.
The union’s proposed procedures would address instances of discrimination and harassment not covered by Title IX, Sandalow-Ash wrote.
“Under our proposal, student workers would have the right to choose how to pursue their claims of discrimination and harassment – through internal university offices, through the union grievance procedure, or both or not at all,” she said.
“The University bargaining team feels that the additional discussion around equal opportunity and non-discrimination was constructive,” Swain wrote. “The opportunity the University included in its proposal for HGSU-UAW representation on committees that will focus on strengthening University policies and procedures is an area where we feel there is shared interest and we look forward to continuing the discussion on this and other areas of the proposal.”
Wednesday’s bargaining session was an additional session added to the regular bi-weekly bargaining schedule in place of a session cancelled due to winter break. The next bargaining session is scheduled for Feb. 4.

Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated Gould did not provide examples of other types of sanctions a union could impose if a student worker did not pay dues or fees. In fact, he suggested methods such as arbitration or judicial proceedings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates and community leaders gathered Thursday evening for an event called “Beloved Streets: Race & Justice in America,” which marked the culmination of a winter-term course at Harvard Graduate School of Education of the same name.
Founded by Melvin White, the non-profit organization Beloved Streets of America seeks to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his envisioned “beloved community” by revitalizing streets bearing King’s name. Many of these regions are disproportionately under-resourced and comprise mostly African-Americans.
Panelists at the event, who span a variety of careers and disciplines, discussed topics on race and transformative justice. They also spoke about ways in which people can dismantle systems that perpetuate intergenerational poverty.
David J. Harris, managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice and one of the course leaders, said the course attempted to create some spaces and places in a curriculum, fostering transparent conversations about important societal issues.
School of Education adjunct lecturer Aysha Upchurch opened the event with an interpretive hip hop dance while sharing stories of her childhood and inviting audience members to wonder about the “beloved streets” that raised them.
Tracie D. Jones, assistant director of diversity and inclusion programs at the School of Education and a course instructor, said the course heads deliberately chose panelists who would best reflect the voices of Harvard. The event brought together a diverse group of people including students and staff members — from employees at Harvard University Health Services to instructors at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“It’s important to emphasize that the conversation we’re having is with the community, about what the community can do, and what we can do outside of Harvard,” Jones said. “I think it was very intentional of us to not bring in mayors or prominent leaders because the voice of the community then gets lost.”
Many of the panelists also noted this importance of collaboration among local groups that work to empower community members.
Jeana Dunlap, a Loeb Fellow and director of redevelopment strategies for the Louisville metro government, said she believes in the importance of “getting information into the hands of people who aren’t usually at the table.”
School of Education lecturer and Director of Harvard’s Prison Studies Project Kaia Stern served as a course head, along with Harris and Jones. She said it is necessary to include Harvard staff members in discussions about belonging since they are vital to the University.
“We saw this course as an opportunity to be as inclusive as we could and hear as many voices as we could within the Harvard community,” Stern said.
Stern, Harris, and Jones shared hopes for the University’s increased support for their course. They look to eventually expand their currently non-credit, winter-term course to a for-credit, full-term one.
Some of the Harvard student panelists said the knowledge they gain at Harvard is not just educational, but also deeply personal as they learn to utilize their education to support their communities back home.
“When I think about going into communities, what I think about is how can I operate from a place of listening,” said Emanuel Powell III, a Harvard Law School student and course participant. “How can I take what power I have or what pedestal I’ve been provided as a student here to help people.”
Shakira J. Hall ’22, an event attendee who just started as a junior research fellow with Stern at the Prison Studies Project, said she was particularly inspired by Powell.
“Seeing someone like him in a position I want to be in in the future is very inspiring,” Hall said, “I learned how important it is to actively go out and engage with people in the community, educating yourself, developing moral intelligence, and having a heart and passion.”
White, who started Beloved Streets as a postal worker dismayed by the poor conditions of St. Louis Mo.’s Martin Luther King Drive, said he hopes that Beloved Streets’ work with Harvard continues beyond the course.
“Harvard has the name. Beloved Streets — we’re a new organization. And that combination could be really big especially if people can see something tangible that’s been done,” White said. “I’m hoping that we can continue our collaborations from here on out and really try to get some things accomplished and really bring Dr. King’s legacy the respect that it deserves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Association of Black Harvard Women held a discussion Thursday to address sexual assault and its impact on black women in the wake of the release of “Surviving R. Kelly” and news that Harvard Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. will serve on Harvey Weinstein’s legal team.
More than 50 students packed into Ticknor Lounge for the event, called “Black Girls Matter,” and some were forced to find seats on the floor as the room filled with attendees. Law School student Katherine Mateo moderated the discussion, the contents of which were off the record to the press.
In an email publicizing the event, organizers wrote they believe it is “imperative” to discuss how issues of sexual assault specifically affect black women.
"In the wake of 'Surviving R. Kelly' and most recently, the report that the Winthrop House Dean—a Black man—has joined the defense of Harvey Weinstein, we think it is imperative to come together and discuss sexual assault, abuse and harassment as they impact Black women," the invitation read.
The documentary series "Surviving R. Kelly," released in early January, publicized years of abuse allegations against the R&B singer.
ABHW President Kacey E. Gill ’20 said the group wanted to give black Harvard affiliates a space to participate in an “empowering and candid discussion” about issues of sexual misconduct.
She added that one of ABHW’s goals in holding the event was to prompt a conversation about creating resources for sexual assault that are “specifically designed and executed for black women.”
“This event was intended to be a forum for discussion primarily but also a really empowering and candid discussion within the black community about sexual assault, sexual abuse, and some really significant stories that have been going on in the past few years, past few months, past few weeks,” Gill said.
After the event, several students said they are dissatisfied with Sullivan’s choice to represent Weinstein, a Hollywood film producer facing several charges of rape and sexual assault.
The day after news broke that Sullivan, a Winthrop House faculty dean, had joined Weinstein’s legal team in his Manhattan sexual abuse case, Sullivan sent an email to Winthrop residents defending his decision. His email focused on the importance of representing the “unpopular defendant.”
Attendee Ata D. Amponsah ’19 said in an interview after the event that he was “appalled” after first hearing the news and that he believes the case may affect Sullivan’s role as a faculty dean.
“When students are sexually assaulted or have to come to you, they need to feel a level of comfort in order to come to you,” Amponsah said. “You ought to be an advocate for them to the administration given your position. He shouldn’t have taken on that case.”
Sullivan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.
The discussion also touched on stereotypes black women at Harvard face and how they can shape their experiences on campus, according to attendee Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22.
“Someone made a comment about how black girls’ sexuality specifically can often really contribute to their reputation on campus, and it can often sort of color their experience really negatively,” O’Sullivan said. “I’ve definitely seen and experienced being a black woman on campus, feeling invalidated and having to question all the aspects of life I participate in.”
Gill said after the event that she believes Harvard does not provide enough resources specifically for black women and that the University faces issues in diversity among its faculty and deans.
“I feel like black women contribute a ton to this community in all different spheres. It’s like, we literally pour out our hearts and our minds and our souls and invest in this campus and this university and we get very little of that back,” Gill said. “I want more representation and I want Harvard to take more active steps to support survivors because that matters.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Though we’re just a few days into the spring semester, students are already looking to forget the weekly grind with a fun weekend out. However, the unforgiving February weather is frosty enough to make even the most seasoned partiers consider a cozy weekend indoors. For those brave enough to venture out into the cold Cambridge nights, consider these hot tips for partying in near-Arctic conditions.
(Don’t) Dress To Impress
The whole issue of braving the cold could be solved by, believe it or not, dressing for the weather. Zip up your puffer coat and channel your inner Sexy Michelin Man vibes. Sure, half the point of going out is to be seen looking ~spicy~, but who says a form-obscuring marshmallow jacket and sweatpants aren’t peak fashion? Plus, you get to peel off all those layers at the party and surprise everyone with a jaw-dropping reveal.
Fluorescence Is The Best Protection
The one thing that can make crawling out of the Igloo in the early hours of the morning even worse is being the friend who lost yet another coat at a party. Avoid the “looking for a black winter coat, last seen at the Aquarium” Facebook walk of shame by ditching your nondescript black or neutral-colored jacket for obnoxious DayGlo outerwear. This simultaneously ensures that you can always spot your clothing in the dark and deters any thief from seizing it. The more visible and less desirable the better. Consider adding this objectively sexy silver emergency warmth blanket to your nighttime attire for just over a dollar. If you don’t want to dress like a human glow stick, writing your phone number on the tag is always an option — one that may even land you a cute blind date (hello Valentine’s day)!
When The Going Gets Tough, Quit
Unlike that unsolvable pset problem or the ever-growing pile of laundry under your bed, the winter weather is one problem that will actually go away if you avoid it. Trade a frozen night wandering in party purgatory for fuzzy socks and movie marathons. Or, alternately, attempt to — hear us out — use some of the free time you have on the weekends to actually study.
Maybe the changing of the seasons is a sign that it’s time to spend weekends productively, or perhaps this is some form of natural selection designed to identify only the most dedicated extroverts. Whatever your take on the subject, one thing is clear: wintertime in New England is objectively the worst.

Bryce Dallas Howard braved the frigid temperatures as she waved to onlookers during the Hasty Pudding's Woman of the Year parade, which was followed by a roast inside Farkas Hall. The actress, producer, and director was joined by members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals dressed in colorful outfits as they danced through the streets. This year will see the Pudding's 171st production, the first time in the show's nearly 200-year history that Hasty Pudding Theatricals has incorporated female students into its formerly all-male cast.


Members of The Hasty Pudding Theatricals posed excitedly as they waited for the parade to start in below freezing temperatures.


Bryce Dallas Howard, best known for her role as Claire Dearing in the Jurassic World, arrived at the beginning of the parade route near the Inn at Harvard and was surrounded by Hasty Pudding members, press, and well-wishers.

 
The parade also featured other area performance groups including THUD, The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers, who processed down Massachusettes Avenue ahead of the Woman of The Year.



 
The Boston Circus Guild joined the festivities, walking on stilts despite the freezing temperatures.

 
The parade ended at Farkas Hall where Bryce Dallas Howard was ushered inside for a roast, press conference, and preview of the Pudding's 171st production, “France France Revolution.”

 


Poking fun at Howard's role in Jurassic Park, one member of the Hasty Pudding dressed up as a dinosaur.


Inside Farkas Hall, the Hasty Pudding presented Howard with an engraved Pudding Pot during a playful roast which saw her pie a troupe member dressed as gluten.


“This has been totally a blast. I’ll never forget this as long as I live. And please accept my children to Harvard,” Howard said.

 
Howard headed upstairs to a press conference where she answered questions ranging from whether her co-star and former Hasty Pudding Man of the Year Chris Pratt gave her any advice before coming to Harvard, to the struggles that many women in front of and behind the camera face in Hollywood.


“My reaction was, ‘I don’t think I’m the Woman of the Year.' I think we’re really seeing examples of individuals and women in particular really taking a stand and being courageous and reaching out to one another," Howard said.
“That being said, it will be very meaningful to me,” she added. “And I hope that from here, it will inspire me to do more. So hopefully I will be worthy of this hilarious award in future years.”
