After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the fashion industry under fire in recent years for its reliance on increasingly thin models, a new market for their plus-size counterparts has begun to emerge. Designers are starting to recognize the potential economic benefits of including average-sized women in their shows, and as a result, fuller-figured models such as Crystal Renn, Robyn Lawley, and Marquita Pring are finding success on the runway and in editorial work.
Plus-size models are hardly a new phenomenon—their existence dates back some 60 years to clothing brand Lane Bryant's use of larger women in its catalogs. Modeling agencies did not formally represent such women, however, until the late 1970s, when pioneering plus-size model Mary Duffy founded Big Beauties Little Women, which specialized in plus-size and petite models. Similar agencies like Plus Models soon followed, while existing management groups like the well-known Ford Models opened plus-size divisions. Today, a number of respected agencies make it their business to manage plus-size women—most of whom are either employed in catalog work or model for brands marketed specifically at plus-size women—but a select few of which go on to walk for high-end brands like Jean Paul Gaultier and Zac Posen.
It's encouraging that larger women are finally making their presence known in the wider industry, but here's the thing: plus-size models aren’t actually plus size. One might argue, in fact, that fashion does not understand what it means to be plus size. In reality, the women we see marketed under this label average out to roughly a size 12 (on women who usually stand between 5’8” and 6’); compare these numbers to the average American woman, who at 5'4” wears a size 14, and it quickly becomes obvious that the very meaning of the word has become painfully distorted—a truth which Robin Givhan, fashion editor of The Washington Post, conceded in an interview with NPR. "There is a real disconnect between what the fashion industry considers to be a plus-size model and what the average person considers to be plus size," she said.
Certainly, top design houses such as Yves Saint Laurent and Dolce & Gabbana continue with astonishing stubbornness to cater exclusively to a slender clientele: a quick visit to each brand's website reveals that very few items in their collection come in any size above a size 10. These limitations are hardly surprising given that the aforementioned Crystal Renn, arguably the highest-profile plus-size model today, is herself a size 8, measuring 33-27-37 inches in her bust, waist, and hip, respectively. For a woman who is 5'9" in height, these numbers are not only contradictory to our conventional definition of plus-size—they're downright skinny. And describing someone of Renn’s proportions with a term that is commonly understood to mean “larger than average” is just as unhealthy, or perhaps even unhealthier, than populating the catwalk with teenage waifs.
The ugly irony of the situation is that many of these so-called plus-size models have trouble fitting into the clothes provided for them to wear in photoshoots—not because they are too large, but because they are too thin. Enter padding, the utterly baffling practice of wrapping plus-size models' hips in foam so that they are able to fill out the clothes they have been hired to wear. Why not hire larger models? Perhaps it has something to do with proportion: rather than a model who is bigger all around, as a larger model would be, plus-size brands want models who are slim-waisted and full-hipped in a way that can only be achieved through a combination of a smaller model and strategically placed inserts. At the end of the day, there is as prescriptive a body standard for plus-size models as there is for straight-size models—the former might be larger in size overall, but agencies nonetheless hold them to a specific and ultimately unattainable standard that brings about its own set of unhealthy eating practices, with many women consuming large quantities of high-sodium foods to retain water weight.
It would seem, then, that the emergence of plus-size models, while well-intentioned, does not address the underlying root cause that gave rise to the plague of underweight models in the first place: the idea that models, whether straight- or plus-size, absolutely must look a certain way, conform to certain measurements, even if those measurements can only be attained by  filling one’s skirts with packing peanuts. It is no less artificial to stuff your way to beauty than to starve your way to it. But if the fashion industry had its way, we’d all choose one or the other. For the imposition of rigid restrictions on the way a plus-size model is “allowed” to look is merely a way to create a new unattainable size zero for the fuller-figured, a size for which we will forever strive, forever grasp—an impossible ideal for which we will always fall short.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At some point in Indiana, the questions that pooled in my mouth settled so heavily on my lips that Sarah turned on the radio in a flick of irritation. The car brimmed with one static-fringed country song. Then two.
I pushed my hand towards the radio, and with the same movement that turned it off, my mouth overflowed.
“Sarah, I know it’s been hard for you and Jake.” Sarah’s eyes hooked mine in the rearview mirror. “But why are you acting like this? Why are you so angry?”
I heard teeth slide against teeth.
I could feel my breath hot against my upper lip. “And what’s this sudden urge to see your mother? You said that you’d never be able to forgive her for what she said. What is this, Sarah?”
Her anger two years ago had been nothing like this: Jake had been afraid to touch her, Isaac had been worse than usual, tasting the mood of the house but unaware of its cause. They had called me over. Sarah and I had gone for a drive—my car. She’d been explosive for days, but as soon as I eased the engine on, she went limp.
“You’ll feel better if you talk about it,” I said then, pulling out of her driveway.
She talked after 15 minutes of slow, residential roads. Wood-paneled houses, blue, white, tan, the same brown shingles on every one. Trees blocking views of front doors, lawns edged with brown. Someone was wheeling out the trash as we passed. He waved. Sunday morning suburban New Jersey meandered past the window until Sarah said that, after she’d told her of Isaac’s diagnosis, her mother had said it would’ve been better if he’d never been born at all.
Now Sarah drifted into the right lane, where we halted the acceleration of an 18-wheeler, its headlights following us angrily. She drove like this for a while. A stream of cars passed.
My mother’s anger, too, used to occupy a space like this. So many times she had filled the car, bristling to me about what my father had done now—she didn’t trust my brother, too male—the seatbelt ensnaring me, suffocating. I didn’t learn until I was older that she didn’t want me to say anything reassuring. She only wanted me to feel her unhappiness, and sometimes she’d stop the car in a dark parking lot or on the side of the road and glare hard at me, at everything, like she was asking, do you do you do you?
Eventually I said to Sarah, “You’ll feel better if you talk about it.” I tried to make my voice as small as I used to feel in my mother’s car. I tried to make my voice like a knife rounding into smoothness after years of use. Sarah looked ahead.
“I know people usually start out by talking about sex,” she started, haltingly. “But Jake and I haven’t had sex in years, even before we knew about Isaac’s autism.”
“I don’t remember talking to him these past two months. He must’ve told you this—I spent all day in the bedroom, and when he’d come home, I’d sleep. All I’ve been doing is sleeping and watching those old sitcoms about groups of friends living together, or living close to one another, and having their lives so intertwined. I used to think that’d be me. Now there’s just Jake.” She thought for a moment. “And you.”
She said, “And these shows, you know, they’re funny. Sometimes I laugh. And then I hear my laughter, and I hear how empty the house is. I realize I’m all alone, and I’m laughing all alone. That’s why I sleep when Jake comes home—I’m afraid to look at him. I think he thinks it’s grief, and so he doesn’t try to talk to me about it.”
Her words hung as if over a ravine. Then she said, “No, I remember now. He said something the other day.” Her hand hovered above the steering wheel, like she wanted to touch her face, but came to rest on her leg instead. “He came into the room when I was pretending to sleep and sat at the edge of the bed. He said, ‘God, Sarah. This is all that’s left, isn’t it? Ten years married and this is it.’”
“When was this?” I asked. Her voice was dimmed by the wind that whipped past the car. We would pull over soon, stop for the night. Sarah hadn’t asked me to, but I’d been scrutinizing exit signs, squinting for a motel.
“A day or so before we left.”
I tried to read her face in the glow of the dashboard. “Why would he say that?”
Her shirt rustled as she lifted a shoulder. When we finally pulled in front of a motel, I had already been half-dozing for miles, and as Sarah twisted her key to free it from the car, before I had fully awoken, I thought it was my parents’ scraping metal as it released, and my father was going to unbuckle me from my seat and cradle me to bed as my mother headed straight for the front door, straight to sleep.

The classics have a difficult relationship with modern art. Arguably, the last writer to achieve success by taking on classic themes was in the generation of T.S. Eliot, and the academic discipline has seen a slow decline in popularity as it has come to be associated with Euro-centrism and misogyny through the 20th century.  Modern treatments of classical texts tend to spend much effort escaping their perceived stodginess—Anne Carson’s bizarre and unpleasant travesty of Sophocles, “Antigonick,” comes to mind.
It is a great joy, then, to report that this was not the case in the Loeb Experimental Theater this past weekend. Running from Oct. 9 to Oct. 11, Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “With Fates Driving”—written by Alona Bach ’16, scored by Eric R. Corcoran ’16, and directed by Sean K. Hardy ’16—presented a brilliant treatment of the fourth book of Virgil’s “Aeneid” that was both fresh and loyal to the source, proving definitively that it is possible to present an interesting and novel treatment of a text without subjecting it to intellectual fads.
Bach’s script takes as its focal point Ascanius (known familiarly in the production as Jules, a play on Ascanius’s other moniker in Virgil’s poem—Iulus), played with pathos but without melodrama by Jacob D. Rienstra ’17.  Ascanius is the son of Aeneas (William Pinkham), the last scion of the royal house of Troy and the man fated to find Italy and found the kingdom that will become Rome. The years have not been kind to Jules. He still has nightmares of the sack of Troy and dreams of his dead mother, Creusa (Katherine E. Moon ’14), who comforts him as best she can. Upon the Trojans’ arrival in Carthage, Jules finds himself nearly forgotten by his already grim and distant father, who is enamored of the Punic queen Dido (also played by Moon).
Bach’s approach is a successful departure from traditional retellings, which generally take either Aeneas or Dido as their protagonists. The style is colloquial without being jarringly dissonant with the material, in contrast with (for example) last semester’s butchery of Wilde’s “Salomé.” The play is not without low-register comedy—an early scene features a tirade from Juno (Leonie A. Oostrom ’15), who proclaims, “the whole stupid world sucks balls and I hate it”—but it never stoops to the ridiculous. Bach’s dealing with the character of Aeneas is especially well done. The Trojan prince tends to be treated as a bland figure, presented either as a flat, saintly paragon of good behavior or a weak-willed coward. Here, however, is an Aeneas who is exceedingly grim, haunted by the past and tortured about the future. A nihilistic Aeneas is something new and a productive interpretation.
Under Hardy’s careful eye assisted by dramaturge Talia M. Saal ’16, the staging worked in perfect concert with the text. The set (designed by Matthew J. Ciommo ’15), with its columns and wrecked ship, maintained a classical atmosphere without distracting the eye in the way that “period-style” productions tend to. Blocking decisions enhanced tension within scenes. The lighting (designed by Adam O. Brodheim ’16) was nothing short of brilliant: Hardy used the entire stage area of the Ex to its fullest potential, artfully conveying aspects of action and enabling transitions in scene that would have otherwise been impossible. For instance, slow light strobing allowed for the quick presentation of miniature flashback scenes, providing background for the main action. Corcoran’s incidental music, while lush and moving in its own right, never interfered with or distracted from the dramatic action and was flawlessly performed by a live band.
Actors’s performances were good throughout the cast. Rienstra’s Jules has been noted above; the other performance of special note was Moon’s apt treatment of both Creusa and Dido.  Her transitions from caring mother to shallow material-girl were deft, and her interpretation of each was subtle and well controlled. It is perhaps the greatest testament to a performer’s skill (as well as the subtlety of staging and text) that they can scream onstage without becoming laughable. Moon passed this test with flying colors.
Few things could have been improved in this production. The most notable was the somewhat ineffective treatment of the motif of playing cards, used as a symbol for chance and fate.  Their insertion throughout felt heavily artificial and not well-integrated into the text. In one scene, Aeneas teaches Ascanius how to “read cards.” It is unclear what this means. None of the cards drawn are distinctly tarot, but it does not seem worthwhile to teach someone specifically how to read face values off ordinary cards. It does not help that the cards are all blank, depriving the viewer of even the physical cues of what is happening.
Nevertheless, this production was a resounding success by any standard. It is to be ardently hoped that future treatments of classical topics take Bach’s “With Fates Driving” as a model to embrace and that the participants in this production continue to practice the artistic ideals on display here.

Last week, Princeton’s faculty voted to repeal the university’s 10 year-old grade deflation policy. The policy, which recommended that no more than 35 percent of students within a department receive A- grades or higher, stood in contrast to Harvard’s rather different policy, wherein the modal grade awarded is an A and the median grade awarded is A-. While we are skeptical that the benefits of Princeton’s deflationary policy outweighed the costs, we commend Princeton for attempting to implement a solution to what is a complex and, to many, serious problem.
Indeed, opinions on grade inflation are as varied as the pre-curve midterm distribution in Ec 10. Naturally, different understandings of the issue at hand inform different strategies for solving the problem. Does compression of the bell curve make it impossible to conduct meaningful comparisons of students? Is it a reflection of the “everyone gets a trophy” parenting style, where World’s Best Moms and Dads watch World’s Greatest Kids play soccer on the grass near Lake Wobegon? Some, including this newspaper, have questioned whether grade inflation is a problem at all. After all, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and a C+ by any other name would still stink of lack of aptitude or effort.
Regardless of how one conceptualizes the grade inflation problem, it seems to stand at the crossroads of achievement, competitiveness, entitlement, and fear of failure. Princeton’s policy reversal should be a signal that Harvard and universities across the country should continue to experiment. The ideal system would be one in which B’s and C’s were celebrated, not stigmatized, as a sign that a student had dared to venture outside his or her comfort zone. (Or, admittedly, that they derive greater utility from some of the many other activities that can be enjoyed at college than they do from studying or writing papers. Judge not another’s utility function lest your own utility function be judged.)
We hope, going forward, that institutions of higher education find a way to sort this problem out. Faculty members at Princeton not only believed that the policy of deflation was detrimental to the collegiate environment and reduced students’ tolerance for risk in their course selections; they also believed it discouraged prospective Princetonians from applying to the university. We believe this is a signal that, as universities design and implement their own policies to try to combat inflation, they must work together if they are to achieve lasting success.

President Obama may be smart and honest, but he’s also indecisive, controlling, weak-principled, and, frankly, a bit paranoid. At least that’s what former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta—and much of the nation’s top military brass—would have us believe.
In a memoir released last week, titled “Worthy Fights,” Panetta criticizes the commander-in-chief for flip-flopping on Syria—imposing a “red line” on the use of chemical weapons by President Bashar al-Assad, then backing down when the dictator dropped chlorine on his own people. He blames the rise of the Islamic State on Obama’s failure to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow a residual American military force to remain in the country. He feels betrayed by the president’s reluctance to defend the Pentagon from across-the-board budget cuts imposed by Congress.
Panetta also gripes about being cut out of important decisions, such as Obama’s release of documens about waterboarding under the Bush administration. And though Panetta lauds the president’s intellect, he contends that Obama lacks a certain red-blooded chutzpah that worthy leaders possess.
“Too often,” Panetta writes, “the president relies on the logic of a law professor rather than the passion of a leader.”
Panetta, of course, is not alone in writing a critical inside memoir of the Obama administration. He follows in the footsteps of Robert Gates, Obama’s first secretary of defense, who leveled similar—though even more pointed—criticisms at the president in his January 2014 tell-all titled “Duty.”
In that memoir, the elder statesman laments Obama’s distrust of top military leaders, from former CIA director David Petraeus to former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen.
Gates dresses Obama down for his supposed ambivalence toward the war in Afghanistan, which the president doubted was winnable, and for that absence of gusto which Panetta observed.
Interestingly, that last bit—that lack of chutzpah and red-bloodedness, lamented by both works—is a relatively common complaint, even outside the military, as commentators everywhere are demanding Obama be more a firebrand than a professor.
Take David Brooks, the New York Times’ dangerously suave neoconservative, who recently wrote that President Obama is a pragmatist—a kind of law school intellectual logician. But apparently that’s a bad thing.
“Pragmatists…have trouble rousing themselves to action,” he writes. “They try to get rid of emotions when making decisions because emotions might lead them astray. But, in making themselves passionless, they always make themselves tepid and anesthetized.”
Only those with impulsive “literary sensibilities” will “react with a heart brimming with moral emotion,” he writes.
Earlier, Charles Krauthammer lambasted the president for failing to “rally the nation” around a “cause.”
These words weren’t aberrations. Critiques of the restrained Obama Doctrine often rely on abstract concepts—like leadership, toughness, and passion—with policy disagreements sometimes thrown in for good measure
But haven’t we had enough policies based on passion and toughness and overblown anger and patriotism? Shouldn’t the path of our nation be laid out by well-educated persons who think logically about policy decisions, rather than by World War I-redux, war sentimentalists à la Cheney or Rumsfeld? I mean, haven’t we learned anything over the past decade?
A little over 10 years ago, Thomas Friedman, another Times neocon, said to Charlie Rose that the purpose of the Iraq War was to say “Suck. On. This.” to Muslims in the Middle East. No thought there. I don’t even know what “This” is. Just passion. Perfect!
The clip has gained some infamy in retrospect, but back then, it was no big deal. We had just completed the invasion of Iraq, Bush’s approval rating hovered around 70 percent, and we were on our way to dumping $5 trillion and just under 7,000 American lives into a series of failed conflicts.
Stories of how Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld manipulated Bush abound, but Bush was naturally no dove himself. “Somebody has got to be risk averse in this process … because I’m sure not,” he said to a group of advisors in 2007.
With the current administration, we no longer have a top brass that relies on career military men and Dick Cheney to provide restraint—and yes, we have someone who may draw on his intellectual experiences as a law professor, rather than just his “literary sensibilities,” however adept they may be.
Often this has meant moderate, sage decisions to preserve American life and money—opening limited diplomatic channels in the process—rather than re-plunging our nation into unwinnable conflicts, in which we attempt to confront social problems with military force. Often it’s meant refraining from what President Obama calls the “whack-a-mole” strategy of military intervention.
“The Pentagon was used to getting what it wanted,” the president recently said to the New Yorker. Now, Americans have a source of pushback.
Apparently, that’s a cause of irritation for Brooks, Petraeus, Mullen, Gates, Krauthammer, and a slew of pundits and military men keen to forget the past decade.
But as for me, I’m pretty thankful for it.

I am an atheist. I believe organized religion is at least partially responsible for the majority of the wars that have taken place on our planet since the beginning of time; I haven’t gone to a temple for the High Holidays in over eight years; and I wouldn’t attend Shabbat dinner at Hillel if Benjamin Netanyahu himself were there.
But…
This morning, when I saw that swastikas were drawn on Yale University’s Old Campus, I was more than scared; I was angry. Because I knew that whoever drew that rigid shape on the pavement outside of a freshman dorm late Sunday night was not only targeting Jews who fast on Yom Kippur or believe in the necessity of Israel. No, that swastika was directed at me—me, my parents, and my friends.
In an email to the Yale student body, Dean of College Jonathan Holloway lamented that “despite attempts to remove these the images from the sidewalk...their faint impressions remained.” Perhaps unintentionally, Holloway pointed out the almost poetic metaphor of these non-erasable swastikas; just as the chalk could not be completely erased, the lingering effects of Jewish oppression throughout the world continue to plague society.
After all, regardless of how I personally identify, I go around knowing that Adolf Hitler would have been just as happy to execute me as any practicing Jew, and if someone were once again to persecute the Jewish people on a global level, I might as well have a yellow Jewish star permanently sewn onto my clothing. And so, while I have never been a practicing Jew, I try to remain acutely aware of the fact that my ancestors were persecuted repeatedly throughout history, and that I am just one series of catastrophic events away from being persecuted myself.
However, even though I have always understood my vulnerability on an intellectual level, today marks the first time in my life that I have felt personally hated, judged, and dismissed for something I have absolutely no control over. And this feeling—which I always understood cerebrally—now has emotional relevance for me.
I still believe that religion is a remarkably destructive force, but today I am less inclined to make overarching, blanket statements about entire religions. Yes, I believe that the unimaginable inequality faced by women in many predominantly Muslim countries is abhorrent, just as I disagree with some Christians’ beliefs about gay marriage and many of the actions Israel’s government has taken in Palestine (not to create a false equivalency between any of these things). That said, I am learning to draw a distinction between devoutly religious people and religions—to separate the individual from the institution.
And while I maintain that organized religion is at the root of some of the most awful institutions in the world—and I still have no plans of attending Hillel for Shabbat dinner anytime soon—I want to stress that the type of bigoted anger that drove people to draw swastikas last night is unjustifiable no matter the cause.
Today, it is not important to condemn religion; it is important to condemn hatred.

Open Hillel—as its name suggests—seeks to make Hillel International, the organization that manages the Jewish life centers on college campus, more open. For the campaign, openness means respect for all beliefs and facilitation of unimpeded dialogue.
But the campaign’s mission is fundamentally misguided: Hillel is already open. As a result, Open Hillel is only harming the Jewish community, while actually regressing on its own goals.
Hillel International’s “Standards for Partnership” state that it will not support speakers or organizations that deny Israel’s right to exist, delegitimize, or apply a double standard to Israel, or advocate the boycott of, divestment from, and sanctioning of Israel.
Open Hillel claims this policy hinders conversation—especially considering Israel as a contentious political issue. But they’re wrong.
Hillel embraces its policy because support of Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state is a fundamental value of Judaism. According to Judaic scripture, God gave the land of Israel to Abraham and his descendants, the Jewish people. Jerusalem (also known by its alternative Hebrew name, “Zion”) appears 850 times in the Old Testament. And since the Jews were exiled from the land of Israel nearly two thousands years ago, Zionism—the pursuit of a reestablished Jewish homeland—has been at the core of Jewish theology.  Perhaps Theodor Herzl and David Ben-Gurion were not mentioned in the Bible, but the ideas they advanced have been essential to Judaism throughout its existence. Support of Israel’s right to exist is thus central to Hillel’s role as a center for Jewish life.
Though Hillel’s constitution does imply support for Israel’s existence, it does not entail the same support for the Israeli government’s policies. In fact, Hillel’s programming provides members with multiple perspectives on controversies like Israel’s West Bank presence and its Gaza operation. Last January, for example, Ari Shavit—the outspoken critic of the Israeli government who wrote “My Promised Land”—spoke at Hillel. And in April, Sayed Kashua—a journalist who writes about the challenges Arabs face in Israeli society—also spoke to students. Perhaps most strikingly, two weeks ago, members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance, a Hillel-sponsored group, joined the Palestine Solidarity Committee for the Gaza “die-in”—even though the demonstration ran contrary to pro-Israel advocacy by drawing attention to the negative effects of only Israel’s actions as opposed to Hamas’s as well.
Furthermore, Hillel is a community center for students of all backgrounds and religions. Throughout the week and even for Friday night dinner, Jewish and non-Jewish students alike congregate at the Hillel house. And Hillel’s religious programming caters to multiple Jewish denominations. As someone who regularly attends Hillel, I can affirm there is never an impediment to open conversation.
Within this context, the organization has the right to draw a line.
Should, for example, a Palestinian supporter of Hamas be allowed to speak at Hillel? Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization, states in its charter, “Israel, by virtue of its being Jewish and of having a Jewish population, defies Islam.” Therefore, it preaches the hatred and destruction of Israel.
The Hamas supporter’s views would be at odds with Israel existentially. And refusing Israel’s right to exist is an affront to Jewish values. Where one’s religion is challenged cannot serve as a comfortable space for religion observance. Imagine a Catholic church where the weekly sermon picked apart the legitimacy of the Vatican. This would contradict the very purpose of a religious community: to provide a safe space for people to congregate and share beliefs. Allowing a Hamas supporter to speak at Hillel would run contrary to the organization’s role as a center for Jewish life.
The same goes for Harvard’s Palestine Solidarity Committee. “Almost all Palestinian campus groups support the boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel,” according to Open Hillel. By advocating severe international treatment of Israel, these groups also pose existential threats to the state and would threaten Hillel’s safe atmosphere for Jewish students.
As a sovereign organization, Hillel has the right to determine its own policies. But even further, Hillel has the responsibility to maintain its integrity as a center for Jewish life.
By establishing a campaign barking at the heels of Hillel International, Open Hillel’s proponents are only further polarizing conversation and thereby, impeding the dialogue that they advocate. They are driving a wedge through their own community, which Open Hillel claims it is seeking to improve.
If Open Hillel’s proponents truly seek the betterment of Hillel, they should be working within the organization to effect change. Instead of merely drawing criticism to Hillel, the campaign should be looking to collaborate with Hillel International to achieve a constructive solution. Open Hillel should be working to build up Hillel rather than putting it down.

UPDATED: October 15, 2014, at 8:14 a.m.
The HPC—also known as The Hasty Pudding Social Club—launched its fall member selection season three weeks ago. The club is famous for its ties to arts groups and its status as Harvard’s oldest affiliated social club.
Freshmen: Do not join this homogenous and elitist institution. The HPC may have been cool when John F. Kennedy ’40 and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1903, were hanging around the clubhouse, but they graduated before segregation ended and before financial aid was introduced.
I was given a list of last fall's Pudding “punch” class from a member of the HPC (that member is being allowed anonymity because the list is meant to be confidential). The “punch” class corresponds to a pledge class at a fraternity or sorority and includes the people likely to join the club.  The list includes punches’ hometowns and high schools. Crimson editorial editors subsequently confirmed the validity of the list with another member of the Club, as well as by reviewing screenshots of a document that was shared with club members. Cross-referencing that list with data from The Crimson’s 2017 “Freshman Survey” yields the accompanying graphs.
The data speak for themselves. The club caters to a tiny slice of the larger Harvard population, creating an atmosphere nearly devoid of the diversity essential to the undergraduate experience. To counter accusations of elitist bias, the HPC has in the past claimed to select members with a “certain strength of character.” That character is now clearly associated with Northeast prep school culture: of the 55 fall 2013 punches, 25 were from New York alone. Members met at private schools such as Horace Mann, Phillips Academy, Chapin, and Sidwell Friends (which President Obama’s children now attend). Social connections will undoubtedly play a part in any social club’s admissions, but it’s wrong if they perpetuate socioeconomic stratification.
Of the 55 students on the list, 13 attended boarding schools with an average boarding tuition of $48,424 and day-student tuition of $37,052, and 34 went to private day schools, with an average tuition of $37,190 (according to the schools' websites, and not including extra fees, except where no breakdown was provided; where tuition varies by grade, these numbers include an average for 9th through 12th).
Of the eight remaining class of 2017 Pudding “punches” on the list who attended public school, only one student hailed from a community with a median income below the national household median, according to census data. The rest attended what could be called “pseudo-private” schools in communities where the median income is, on average, $130,668. Even if a couple of the listed students were on financial aid, the lopsided overall picture of the Pudding is overwhelming.
Equally troubling is the story behind the Pudding’s financial wealth. Andrew L. Farkas ’82—noted as a billionaire in “The Real Deal New York Real Estate News”—is part of a larger group listed on the Pudding website called “Guardians of the Sphinx,” a distinction for those who have donated at least $50,000 to the Hasty Pudding Institute. Other “guardians” include hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein (who in 2008 pleaded guilty to a charge of soliciting prostitution, and who has faced multiple civil actions alleging sexual assault of minors—many of which have been dismissed or settled), hedge fund manager James Dinan, and Chris Flowers ’79 (who worked in the finance industry). It is disturbing that these billionaires are funding a socially stratified institution that perpetuates many outdated stereotypes of the Harvard student.
Outdated institutions like the Pudding work against the environment Harvard seeks to cultivate. In an admissions video, Harvard claims to be a place “where anything could happen”—where students of all backgrounds collaborate together. The Pudding clashes with this ideal and has no place at Harvard and no place at all in this century.
And yet Harvard’s leaders continue to support the club.
At the opening of the new Pudding clubhouse on January 24, 2014, Harvard Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith were in attendance. At the event, Smith noted his “admiration for everything Andrew [Farkas] does” and encouraged students to enjoy the new building.
It’s embarrassing that Harvard administrators associate with an organization whose unfair preference for elite Northeast prep school graduates is reminiscent of a bygone era. What does it say to tomorrow’s leaders when one regional and socio-economic group has Harvard’s stamp of approval to socialize in luxury to the exclusion of the rest of the university?
And why do so many students blindly accept the Pudding’s homogeneity? I admit that I come from a wealthy and well-connected white family, but that shouldn’t grant me a university-sponsored rich kid clique.
Part of the explanation for students’ ready acceptance of the Pudding is psychological. New neurological evidence suggests that cultural biases stem from the deep subconscious, which, according to a 2007 Princeton study, can process information up to 500,000 times faster than the conscious. Such subtle and uncontrollable bias leads humans to instinctively search for similarity. But college should be about pushing boundaries and exploration, not hiding in the hall of mirrors. This is Harvard, and graduates have proven time and again that they can bend history’s arc.
Harvard’s best excuse for its failure to dissociate from the Pudding is the club’s co-ed status. The HPC indeed successfully circumvents the gender divide associated with Greek life and final clubs. Harvard’s social scene undeniably isolates freshmen, especially given outdated 21-plus US drinking laws. In response, freshmen drink behind closed doors, and it’s easier to do so in exclusive social clubs with their own real estate. Fraternities and sororities, made up of one gender, are limiting, and the co-ed Pudding may seem appealing in contrast. But better, more diverse co-ed options should exist on campus.
The HPC’s issues are also obscured by the merit-driven selection systems of its affiliated performing arts groups, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Harvard Krokodiloes. But the HPC doesn’t choose members based on performing talent. The club website’s current purposted justification based on “friendship”, “charity night”, and “service days” is ridiculous and hollow. The rudderless HPC falls very short of Harvard’s egalitarian vision of excellence.
It’s sad that a venerated college, one celebrated as a bastion of progressive thought, entrenches archaic socio-economic division. Harvard’s administration should help students to celebrate one another, not facilitate the formation of regional and class-based cliques that belong on the cover of tabloid newspapers, in high school rom-com dramas, or posh Harvard YouTube parodies.
There are three options available to Harvard: Continue association with the HPC and promote elitism and homogeneity; dissociate; or contact and put pressure on the club to catch up with the diversity of this century. President Faust, choose One Harvard united, not a Harvard divided.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 14, 2014, at 11:56 p.m.
Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15 is set to return to Harvard after the federal government granted him a humanitarian visa on Tuesday afternoon to travel back to the United States from Mexico.
Guerrero-Meneses, who arrived in the U.S. illegally when he was two years old, left school last spring and eventually joined his ailing mother in Mexico, where she sought alternative treatment for cancer. By leaving the country without an exemption, Guerrero-Meneses forfeited the protected status granted to him by President Obama’s 2012 executive memorandum halting deportations for many young immigrants. His mother died in August.
According to Guerrero-Meneses and University officials, at least one Harvard representative in Washington, assistant director of federal relations Jon Groteboer, had been working behind the scenes to put Guerrero-Meneses in contact with Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Rep. Michael Capuano, who represents some of Harvard’s Cambridge campus.
A spokesperson for Durbin confirmed that the senator was working on Guerrero-Meneses’s behalf. Capuano’s spokesperson said on Tuesday that she could not comment on internal matters.
College spokesperson Colin Manning said he could not comment on Guerrero-Meneses’s situation on Tuesday.
“While I cannot comment on any specific student, generally speaking, Harvard works to ensure it is doing what it can to support its students both on and off campus since it is our goal that all students complete their undergraduate education,” Manning wrote in an email.
Guerrero-Meneses’s humanitarian visa approval was first reported Tuesday by the Associated Press. Guerrero-Meneses confirmed the news to The Crimson shortly after the AP report.
The College junior said he found out Tuesday afternoon that he would be allowed to return to the United States.
“I feel relieved,” he said in a Skype interview from Los Reyes de La Paz, Mexico, shortly after getting the news. “For a second there I started to think that it would be a much longer process. There was this little voice in the back of my head that said ‘maybe I'll never go back.’”
Guerrero-Meneses’s lawyer, Alan Klein, said that his client will have to retrieve his visa from the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, before entering the U.S. Guerrero-Meneses said he expects to be back in Los Angeles, where he grew up, in two to three days.
A resident of Leverett House before leaving campus, Guerrero-Meneses added that he has already started a Harvard housing application for the spring semester. He will return as a second-semester junior.
“I need to get my life back on track,” he said. “I just want to keep my mind busy with something other than what happened this year.”
Guerrero-Meneses’s friends expressed relief on Tuesday, as the news reached Cambridge that he would return.
“[I feel] a lot more at ease about his situation,” Alex Boota ‘15 said. “[I’m] looking forward to seeing him again, seeing him at school, backing into our old lives.”
A Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, Guerrero-Meneses has been working on a documentary about his experiences. Boota, who has collaborated with Guerrero-Meneses on an immigration-related documentary before, will help out with the project, Boota said.
Tuesday’s development was not the first time Guerrero-Meneses has caught national headlines in recent weeks. In late September, he wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post headlined “I told Harvard I was an undocumented immigrant. They gave me a full scholarship.” It has received close to 1,000 comments to date.
Guerrero-Meneses said he first notified Harvard of his being unable to reenter the country late in the summer by contacting acting Leverett House Dean Bilal A. Malik. Afterwards, through a friend, he was put in touch with Klein, who specializes in immigration law.
“There has to be a better system to streamline situations like Dario, and there has to be a better way for it to happen,” Klein said on Tuesday.
Given the events of the last several months, Guerrero-Meneses said he is not sure whether he will return to Mexico or not after he comes back to the U.S.
“I don’t know how I would feel coming back here, because I don’t want to think about my mom’s passing, but then it was a transformative experience,” he said. “Kind of like in the movies when the guy goes up in to the mountains and becomes a hermit and comes down a hero.”
“I feel like I’m coming down, descending the mountain with a lot of new lessons learned,” he added.
Guerrero-Meneses said he expects to be back at Harvard in January.
“To my friends,” he said, “I don’t know man, see you guys in a few weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A chemistry professor’s home agriculture project took the cake—or more accurately, the pie—at a Rhode Island competition this weekend.
Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber grew a 1,870-pound pumpkin, which was named the biggest pumpkin in Massachusetts and the 17th largest pumpkin in the world this year, he said.
“It’s not the best for eating, but it’s not that you couldn’t eat it,” Lieber said. “If you wanted to make pumpkin pie, you’d have to add a lot more sugar.”
This year’s pumpkin growing process started in April and involved several steps, including germinating the seeds, monitoring a temperature-controlled greenhouse, and pollinating the plant by hand.
This careful process, however, is not new to Lieber, who started growing pumpkins about seven years ago when his father gave him a book about growing “giant” pumpkins, he said.
“I just decided to give it a try for relaxation, stress relief from work,” Lieber said.
Lieber’s first pumpkins were not as large as the 1,780-pound beauty. “Like in many things—in athletics or probably academics—there’s some genetic components to success and that’s true in agriculture and pumpkins,” Lieber said.
He had to play with different seeds and study soil biology to discover the best conditions for growth. “I would say the seed genetics, the soil biology,...the balance of nutrients in the soil as well as … luck in terms of what the weather is like…contribute in making everything happen,” he said.
Although his first pumpkins were smaller than this year’s prizewinner, Lieber had previously entered the weigh-off competition. In 2010, he won the contest with a 1,610-pound pumpkin, and in 2012, he grew a 1,770-pound pumpkin, which set a Massachusetts record but was 2nd place at the weigh-off.
“I learned a lot for the first few years and was able to continually improve,” Lieber said.
This year, Lieber used a combination of organic fertilizers, organic symbiotic bacteria, and a few chemical-based fungicides to keep the plant healthy. “It takes quite a bit of work and babying, checking things,” he said.
After pollination, the plant grew rapidly. “It put on—in 20 days—800 pounds,” Lieber said. To promote this growth, he had to protect the plant against insects, vine bores and other fungal diseases.
According to Lieber’s wife, Jennifer, the pumpkin attracts people’s attention as a lawn decoration. “People often stop by, and they wonder if these are real,” she said. “I heard one little girl early in the morning say, ‘It’s real, mommy, its real!’ I guess she touched it. Other people wonder where we have bought them.”
With this year’s winning entry now cut from the vine, Lieber and his family plan to leave the squash in his Lexington, Mass., yard through Thanksgiving. Lieber also has jack-o’-lantern ideas in the works.
“You can use a chainsaw, but I use a hand tree saw because, you know, the walls can be eight to 12 inches thick.”

A core group of European countries should integrate their fiscal systems in order to respond effectively to the ongoing economic crisis, according to a former President of the European Parliament who spoke at Harvard Tuesday afternoon.
Josep Borrell Fontelles of Spain, who served as President of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2007 and is currently a professor at the Complutense University in Madrid, discussed the future of the European Union during an event at the Harvard Center for European Studies.
Citing graphs that compared EU and US growth rates and public debts, Borrell said “Five years [after the 2008 recession] the American economy has recovered, [but] the European economy is falling apart.”
In explaining this disparity, Borrell identified what he calls a structural flaw in the EU: while there is a common currency, the euro, there is no international governing body that determines fiscal strategies for the member-states, leading to inconsistencies in monetary policy.
“We are fighting each other in a kind of labor and fiscal fight… because we can have different fiscal and social rules within the same common market,” he said.
Borrell contrasted this with the American federal government, which he said has been able to modify fiscal policy in order to implement the necessary response to the recession.
“We are in a trap…. It is clear that we are too diverse, too different; we don’t share the same willingness to build a complete [federal] union,” he said, referencing the difficulties he faced in coordinating the 28 member states during his time as President of the European Parliament.
The solution, according to Borrell, is for a small group of member-states to form an “avant-garde” federation with the ability to create a federation-wide tax policy and unemployment insurance system, among other powers. With a unified fiscal system he believes that these states would be able to compete in the global economy and respond effectively to future crises.
Colleen E. Driscoll, a Ph.D. candidate studying government, and M. F. Vermeulen, a Belgian postdoctoral student in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department, expressed skepticism as to whether the “avant-garde” federal government would be effective.
“Adjusting doesn’t mean getting rid of [countries that resist joining the federation],” said Vermeulen, suggesting that the current framework could still provide adequate solutions to the problems Borrell identified.
“Saying that diversity is the problem, that you have to work based on the lowest common denominator—it’s common to all federal governments,” Driscoll said.
However, Vermeulen and Driscoll said they agreed with Borell’s sentiment that an effective response to the economic crisis will require greater cooperation among EU member-states.

A team of Harvard researchers led by natural sciences professor and Eliot House Co-Master Douglas A. Melton developed a scalable technique for creating human insulin-producing beta cells in vitro, a major stride towards an effective treatment for type 1 diabetes.
According to a report published in the journal Cell on Oct. 9, this development is the first to yield beta cells that closely resemble normal functioning beta cells, in the quantities necessary for cell transfer and pharmaceutical use.
“This is an important venture for the field of stem cell research, with real potential to transform treatment for diabetics,” said Daniel G. Anderson, an MIT professor working with Melton’s laboratory on preparations for clinical implementation.
Type I diabetes, colloquially referred to as juvenile diabetes, results from an autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas which normally produce insulin—a hormone which regulates glucose levels in the blood.
With limited treatment options, type 1 diabetics alleviate their symptoms by injecting themselves with insulin. According to Jeffrey Millman, a post-doctoral fellow in the lab and one of the paper’s lead authors, this method of treatment “is a crude way to monitor insulin levels”.
“A lot of the complications associated with manual insulin monitoring can lead to a lower quality of life,” Millman said.
Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, has researched stem cell technologies for over 20 years, working to cure the disease with which both his children have been diagnosed.
“This is a project that is very important to Professor Melton personally, and the clinical prospect of the work is a priority of his,” said Millman.
For over a decade, pancreatic transplants and faulty insulin cells generated in vitro have provided temporary insulin independence for type 1 diabetes patients in lieu of these injections. However, never before have scientists been able to cure a mouse of diabetes immediately with the transplantation of beta cells, said Michael S. Segel ’14, one of the paper’s authors who worked on the team throughout his years as an undergraduate.
Beyond the production of functioning beta cells, Melton’s technique can create cells at a scale that could match the demands of an effective treatment—a feat that has never before been accomplished. Each “batch” of the suspension culture yields about 100 to 150 million beta cells, Millman said.

Degree holders from for-profit online institutions are 22 percent less likely to receive callbacks when applying for business and health-related jobs, according to a study led by David Deming, an associate professor at the Graduate School of Education.
“One of the things we found in a previous paper was that students who attend for-profit colleges are more disadvantaged than [the average student],” Deming said, in speaking about the motivation for conducting the study. “But it was not very clear how much that was due to the school itself versus students themselves.”
In the study, researchers made fictitious resumes from a pool of real resumes from one job website and randomly changed job applicants’ post-secondary institutions on each. They then posted these resumes on another job website.
“The goal of this study was to try to answer [the original study’s question] more persuasively by experimentally controlling the students and making them all have the same resumes, except for their post-secondary degree,” said Deming.
According to the study’s results, bachelor’s degree holders from large online for-profit institutions are about 22 percent less likely to receive job callbacks in business and health-related fields than those with non-selective public school degrees.
“The most interesting result was that if you applied to a job that does not require you to have a degree, you have no advantage in having one,” Deming said.
In addition, the study showed that employers also take the applicants’ likelihood of accepting a job into consideration when sending callbacks.
To illustrate this, Deming gave the example of a Harvard graduate applying to be a clerk.
“I might think that person looks very good on paper, but I am not going to call him back, because I don’t think he is going to take the job if I offered one,” he said.
According to Deming, this study provides important insights for current government policies. At present, for-profit colleges receive funding mostly from federal Title IV funding such as Pell Grants and Stafford Loans. Whether these colleges meet their responsibilities in exchange for this federal funding, however, remains undetermined.
“It’s a very difficult problem to deal with regulation. For-profit universities are responsible for the increase in higher education. It’s a bad idea to stop them and put them out of business... I think that current policy is moving toward a right direction but we probably need to think about it more comprehensively,” Deming said.
The study did not directly address free, online courses offered by non-profit institutions, which according to CEO of edX Anant Agarwal, face a different set of challenges than for-profit online colleges.
“It tends to be the case that non-profits find it easier to focus in the long run on access to the quality, the access, and the research,” he said, adding that he does not expect edX to face the problems of credibility uncovered by the study. “It’s difficult for for-profits to do so because for-profits often have to make a tradeoff between short-term goals and long-term goals,”
Still, Agrawal downplayed the inherent differences between for-profit and non-profit online education.
“I worry less about non-profit or for-profit. As long as you focus on full quality, full access to the public, and full research, then whether you are a for-profit or a non-profit, it does not matter as much,” he said.

Several members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences said they are weighing options for how best to push back against a new set of University health benefits plans they call “regressive,” even as a University spokesperson said Tuesday that the University does not plan to alter the policy for 2015.
Faculty anger over the announced plans came into focus at last Tuesday’s faculty meeting when History professor Mary D. Lewis asked University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 when and how the changes could be undone. Her question elicited applause from other faculty members in attendance and a response from Garber, outlining the changes and the rationale behind them, that some professors consider to be unsatisfactory.
Lewis said this week that while no specific action has been decided upon, “a number of faculty and exempt staff are working to plan a vigorous response.”
The issue will also be discussed at Wednesday’s meeting of the Faculty Council, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ top elected body, according to two members of the Council.
“There are lots of people thinking about what is the best way to protest,"​ History professor Alison F. Johnson, who sits on the Council, said Tuesday morning.
Johnson acknowledged that whatever action faculty members do end up taking, it is unlikely to affect benefits awarded for the current fiscal year.
In a statement Tuesday evening, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that while there are indeed no planned changes for the coming year, “we continuously review our benefits packages, in consultation with the University Benefits Committee, to ensure that they remain highly competitive and affordable for faculty and staff and that they also support Harvard’s mission of teaching and research.”
University administrators announced the plan changes at the center of faculty debate earlier this fall, based on recommendations from the University Benefits Committee of faculty and administrators. The new plan introduces a $250 deductible on non-routine medical costs and a 10 percent copay beyond the deductible, up to a threshold of $1,500 per year for an individually insured policyholder or up to $4,500 for a family. The revised policy also lowers premiums.
Many professors have criticized these changes, saying that the resulting plans amount to a “pay cut” for Harvard’s thousands of non-union employees who are affected.
"I don't care if it was faculty or administrators who made this policy," Johnson said. "It's a bad policy."
Lewis said that she is particularly concerned for more financially vulnerable members of the affected group, a point she also brought up in last Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
“If you’re making a provost’s salary, it’s a drop in the bucket,” she said. “But if you’re making a junior faculty salary, it could be quite substantial.”
Classics professor Emma Dench and History professor Lisa McGirr said the policy would most hurt families and female faculty members who wish to have children while working.
Citing their own recent medical experiences, several faculty members added that given the costs incurred by emergency medical situations, the thresholds outlined in the new plans will be easily reached, and in short time spans.
“I’m literally speechless as I look for a word to describe how disappointed I am,” Johnson said. "It is a regressive tax on those least able to afford to bear the burden."
Others pointed their criticism directly at the University Benefits Committee that approved the changes, saying that a diverse group of faculty were not consulted in making the recommendations. Only one tenured member of the FAS, Government professor Daniel P. Carpenter, sat on the committee.
Sociology professor Christopher Winship, another member of the Faculty Council, wrote in an email that, "There would be broader support for administrative initiatives and policy changes if the administration sought faculty input earlier on."
At the faculty meeting, Garber attributed the policy change to rising healthcare costs and a national trend toward greater cost-sharing between employers and employees.
Faculty members, however, maintained that the national trend should not matter.
“Harvard should be setting an example rather than following a trend,” Dench said.

Twenty-eight Law School professors called for Harvard to withdraw its newly installed sexual harassment policy in a pointed open letter published on Tuesday night.
The letter represents the most extensive public criticism of the new sexual harassment policy since it was announced this summer. It comes while Harvard’s compliance with Title IX anti-sexual discrimination statutes continues to be investigated by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.
The letter, which was addressed to the Boston Globe and posted on its website Tuesday evening, outlined the professors’ grievances regarding the policy, which centers on what they characterized as a lack of “the most basic elements of fairness and due process.”
The professors complained that the policy far exceeds the scope of the Title IX legislation with which Harvard seeks to comply, and that it was drafted and implemented without appropriate consultation with the faculty.
The group of more than two dozen wrote that the policy has reasonable aims but that its investigative and punitive elements unfairly disfavor accused parties. They pointed specifically to the lack of opportunities for the accused to see the facts against him or her, face the accusing party, and have counsel available.
“Harvard has adopted procedures for deciding cases of alleged sexual misconduct which lack the most basic elements of fairness and due process, are overwhelmingly stacked against the accused, and are in no way required by Title IX law or regulation,” the professors—21 men and seven women—wrote.
The authors also attacked the University for language in the policy stipulating that any instance of sexual conduct that occurs “when a person is so impaired or incapacitated as to be incapable of requesting or inviting the conduct” will be deemed “unwelcome.” The professors characterized this procedure as “starkly one-sided...and entirely inadequate to address the complex issues involved in these unfortunate situations.”
The authors went on to criticize the University at length for what they said amounted to bowing to the dicta of federal authorities instead of conceiving its own policy.
“Harvard apparently decided to simply defer to the demands of certain federal administrative officials, rather than exercise independent judgment about the kind of sexual harassment policy that would be consistent with law and with the needs of our students and the larger University community,” they wrote.
The authors also wrote that the policy was conceived and implemented without appropriate consultation with Harvard’s schools and faculty members, accusing central administrators of having “undermined and effectively destroyed the individual Schools’ traditional authority to decide discipline for their own students.”
While some bodies, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, have held open meetings to discuss the changes, the professors noted that none of the policy’s most substantive provisions were up for alteration as a result of these gatherings.
Late Tuesday night, University spokesperson Jeff Neal defended Harvard’s new policy while acknowledging its opponents and praising the discourse around it.
“The University appreciates that not every member of the community will agree with every aspect of the new approach,” Neal wrote. “Some believe the policies and procedures go too far; others believe that they do not go far enough. This type of discussion is fundamental to any vibrant academic community.”
Neal added that, in an attempt to better respond to community feedback, a new faculty, staff, and student committee was formed in September and “will offer advice to the University...[about] whether there might be opportunities for improvement either in the new policy and procedures or in their implementation.”
The letter is by no means the first hiccup for the new policy. Since its launch this summer, advocates have loudly complained about its lack of an affirmative consent provision, an element that has been adopted by other universities and that would require explicit consent before any sexual acts.
Tuesday’s letter carried 28 signatures: Elizabeth Bartholet, Scott Brewer, Robert C. Clark, Alan M. Dershowitz (Emeritus), Christine Desan, Charles Donahue, Einer R. Elhauge ’83, Allen Ferrell, Martha A. Field ’65, Jesse M. Fried, Nancy Gertner, Janet E. Halley, Bruce L. Hay, Philip B. Heymann, David W. Kennedy, Duncan Kennedy, Robert H. Mnookin ’64, Charles R. Nesson ’60, Charles J. Ogletree, Richard D. Parker, J. Mark Ramseyer, David Rosenberg, Lewis D. Sargentich, David Shapiro ’54 (Emeritus), Henry J. Steiner ’51 (Emeritus), Jeannie Suk, Lucie E. White ’72, David B. Wilkins ’77.

Vanderbilt English professor Hortense Spillers connected the stories of 18th century female slaves to the modern feminist movement in the first installment of her W.E.B. Du Bois Lecture Series on Tuesday.
Spillers cited Thomas Jefferson’s relationship with slave Sally Hemings, and the children he fathered with her, as “microcosmic” of the relationship between African-American women in the early American republic and the feminist movement.
“[The presence of Hemings’ children with Jefferson] exposes Jefferson himself as a figure who was riddled with spiritual ambivalence,” she added. “This was passed into the bloodstream of the nation’s ongoing identity crisis.”
Spillers argued that “sentimentality” hid the truly degrading nature of Hemings’ relationship with Jefferson, focusing particularly on analyzing Annette Gordon-Reed’s book, “Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,” a scholarly account of the relationship.She also noted the significance of the 18th century revolutionary period in defining the basic parameters of human rights and in the forming a national identity.
“This new global subject of the human, now claims for herself, himself, those imprescriptible rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that the 18th century revolutionary world set in motion,” Spillers said.
In closing the lecture, University Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Spillers discussed the decision of Hemings to return to America with Jefferson instead of becoming a free citizen of France.
Linda M. Heywood, professor of African American studies and history at Boston University who attended the lecture, commended Spillers’ treatment of the sexual relationships between slaves and masters. “There’s this hidden world of sentiment and the difference between sex and love and public and private,” she said. “It’s difficult to say exactly what emotion is, but I think she, by looking at literature, was able to humanize it,” Heywood added.Attendees also noted the depth of Spillers’ research in anticipation of her next two lectures.“There is hardly a subject her pen has not touched,” said Glenda Carpio, a professor of English and African and African American Studies, who introduced Spillers. Spillers will continue the W.E.B. Du Bois series with her second lecture, on “The Problem of Sentiment: The Hemingses of Monticello,” Wednesday in the Barker Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk and University Professor Lawrence H. Summers appeared together on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a path forward for advances in public health, particularly in developing countries.
Before an audience of about 100 in a Science Center lecture hall, Summers opened the forum by recapping a 2013 report titled “Global Health 2035: A World Converging Within a Generation,” which he authored with a group of economists and health experts. The report outlines a roadmap for investments in public health in the next twenty years.
Summarizing the report’s main conclusion, Summers emphasized that if nations come together to make certain relatively affordable investments, rates of child and maternal mortality, as well as infectious disease, could drop to record lows.
“It is possible in the next generation, by 2035 [to achieve] rates of child mortality all over the world that are comparable to the rates of child mortality in the United States and Great Britain when many of the students in this room were born,” Summers said, highlighting a potential convergence of outcomes in these areas between developed and developing countries.
Summers, who said that his economic and policy training gives him a fresh perspective to bring to the public health conversation, stressed that he believes much of the recommended investment—$70 billion per year—can be found in the rapidly growing economies of developing countries.
That money, Summers said in a reference to the report, could save about 10 million lives annually in low- and low-middle income countries.
The economist concluded by urging action.
“The World Health Organization’s budget for pandemics is about a third as large as Harvard’s athletic budget,” Summers said in conclusion. “This is not how it should be.”
Following Summers’ recap of the 2013 report, Frenk delivered brief remarks, partly in response to prepared questions from three fellows with the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Foundation, the Adams House-affiliated program which hosted the event.
Frenk focused on hailing the 1993 World Development Report, the groundbreaking global health document that was the precursor to the Global Health 2035 report up for conversation on Tuesday.
“It was the first international document that made the case that health is an investment,” Frenk said, adding that it was critical that the report was published by the World Bank. “Presidents and chairs of central banks reading about health was very important, and I think [the 1993 report] has launched a process of change that was...very positive.”
After the question period, the event concluded with a recorded message from University Professor Paul E. Farmer, who is in Liberia aiding the fight against Ebola. Farmer also urged greater investment in public health.
“We need strong health systems to protect everyone, especially the poor and vulnerable,” he said. “Sitting here in the city of Monrovia in Liberia we can see that Ebola has shaken the basic primary health system and caused it to collapse. We need stronger systems that won’t collapse, and these are going to require significant public investments and private investments if we’re going to stop Ebola or other problems we haven’t seen yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The goal of a good sports story is to make you feel like you were at the event, or at least make you wish you were. After Harvard football’s 24-7 win over Cornell at Harvard Stadium Saturday, I can’t write that kind of story.It would be impossible to convince readers that they should have gone to the game and just plain rude to force them to relive it.
Crimson games normally boast the intricacy and cohesion of a Rembrandt or a Leonardo. Saturday’s action, on the other hand, was like one of their famous works soaked in water until the paint ran everywhere.
Harvard turned the ball over on four of its first five possessions, more than doubling its turnover total for the season in just over 15 minutes Saturday.
The only first-half scoring opportunity for either team came on the final play of the second period, when Harvard fittingly missed a 43-yarder off the right upright.Both teams appeared fit for a reenactment of the French Revolution: the energy was there, but there was no execution.
Well, that’s only half-true.Because while Harvard’s offense was taking itself off the field with giveaways, it was the Crimson defense that was largely responsible for Cornell’s offensive ineptitude.
The Big Red got the ball in great field position over and over again thanks to Harvard turnovers, but then the Crimson defense held just as often. Cornell tallied five first downs through three quarters and finished the game with a season-low 10 after a garbage-time score.
Yet good defense is hard to describe; there are no perfect metaphors. Sticking with my artistic theme, if solid defense were a painting, it would be just that—solid. A rectangle of just one color, but a nice, deep royal blue one. It’s precise and it’s whole, but it’s hard to dissect or comment upon.
I could write about the most action-packed defensive play, the sack, and how senior defensive end Zack Hodges now has more of them than any other Harvard player in history. The Crimson had four of them in total Saturday. But those plays are often anomalous and rarely representative.
So I’ll let other numbers do the talking: 3, 6, 0, 3, 4, 2, 2, -1, 2, 3, -1, 2, 11, -1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 1, 2, 0, 1, -1, 2, 5, 5, 0, -5, 4, 1, 3. That’s how many yards Cornell gained on its 31 rushes (not including sacks). At least they were persistent!At times Harvard was a dance partner, perfectly mimicking and thwarting each of the Big Red’s advances. Other times the Crimson played the role of cat, cornering the mouse that was Cornell’s offense and leaving it no choice but to play dead.
But again, there are no perfect metaphors because people do not spend a lot of time describing stillness. The heart of a story is action—something this story lacked.
That’s why I can’t write a good sports story this week. But I can give Harvard fans some good news.
In the second half, the Crimson offense found a rhythm. First it exploited a coverage flaw on two nearly identical throws to sophomore tight end Anthony Firkser that led to the team’s first score of the game and set up a field goal on the next drive. Then Harvard scored twice in the fourth quarter to put the game away.
With Firkser’s touchdown, the Crimson scored in an Ivy-record 162 straight games. That’s proof that the futility we saw in the first half Saturday are rare in the Murphy era. History says the Crimson will likely return to its high-powered form against Lafayette.
So it’s good Harvard got this out of its system against an opponent it could still manage to beat, because the league looks as winnable as ever today.
The Crimson is the only unbeaten team in the Ivy League after Yale lost to Dartmouth Saturday, and Dartmouth’s defense was far from immovable in its 38-31 win.
Meanwhile, Princeton lost to a Colgate team that had just squeaked past Holy Cross the week before, and Penn looks like a shadow of its former Ivy champion self, if only it was high noon so the shadow was really small and the shadow had an 0-4 record with a -93 scoring differential.
If Harvard can rebound (and get healthy) next week against the Leopards, it should enter the heart of the Ivy season as the favorite. Maybe then I’ll be able to write a good sports story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Hope Schwartz arrived at Harvard for freshman year, she was a soccer player.
For the previous four years, she had played on her Oakland high school’s varsity team. She made the all-city first team as a senior. At Harvard, she planned to try out for the Crimson’s varsity team.
But early in the year, Schwartz, who is also a Crimson sports editor, decided to focus on activities other than soccer. She began to look for groups that would give the same team thrill that soccer had. In the process, she settled on women’s rugby, a sport that she had never played before and knew relatively little about.
Two years later, the Harvard women’s rugby team (3-2, 3-2 Ivy) is reaping the benefits of this decision.
Last Saturday on Cumnock Field, Schwartz, now a junior co-captain of the team, pushed through the Dartmouth line (2-3, 2-2 Ivy) to score the winning try in the last minutes of play. Her effort not only gave the Crimson a 10-5 victory, but also clinched a postseason berth.
“Winning raises the bar,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “It proved to us what we’re capable of…. That’s the standard we should be achieving at all times.”
Rainy conditions and physical defense from the Big Green turned the match into a low scoring affair. The Crimson scored first, but Dartmouth equalized with ten minutes remaining in the game. Despite maintaining most of the possession, Harvard could not organize a scoring attack. All that changed when Schwartz caught the ball in the last minutes of the game.
“The Dartmouth game was a turning point for us,” co-captain Kaleigh Henry said. “Now we are playing with a new passion and intensity.”
Schwartz has not always been comfortable on a rugby pitch. As a freshman, she did not know many of the game’s rules and had to learn as she played.
Yet teammates such as Kantor insist that they have always seen potential. A sophomore when Schwartz joined the team, Kantor has witnessed the full evolution of her teammate from first-time player to elected co-captain.
“What stood out to me was her dedication to learning the game and her versatility in terms of position,” Kantor said. “She’s extremely tough.”
During Schwartz’s second season on the team, a knee injury suffered during the Crimson’s first game stalled her progress on the field as she was sidelined for most of the year.
“She has overcome a lot of injuries,” Henry said. “I know the team respects her immensely for pushing through so many tough times.”
The knee took months to heal, but Schwartz grew in another way: as a teammate. “She is a very caring teammate,” Henry said. “She notices things that most people don’t. She’s always there for injured players and is a great source of support.”
At the beginning of this season, the team recognized her leadership qualities by choosing her as one of three team captains. She is only a junior.
“Hope is a good leader because she is not afraid to take charge,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “She’s comfortable looking a teammate in the eye and holding her accountable.”
Parker is not alone in these opinions. Teammates such as Kantor have seen Schwartz’s growth since her freshman year.“Hope is a great teammate,” Kantor said.
“Her ability to push through rough situations is inspirational to the rest of the team. She is also great at encouraging players in a way that works for them as individuals.”
As the Ivy League playoffs approach, the Crimson will need Schwartz’s support on and off the field as it travels to play Navy in its final non-conference tune-up before the playoffs begin. Harvard has its sights set on a second straight Ancient Eight title.
“We have yet to reach our potential,” Henry said.  “But we are working hard each day at practice so that we can play at an even higher level in a few weeks.”

Let’s face it, sexiling your roommate is awkward. Nobody likes finding out he’s been banished to the less-than-magical land of  the Friend’s Futon. But hey, at least you’re having a better night than he is!
Here’s a three-step guide to being the most courteous sexually active roommate this side of the Charles:
1. Communication. Nice guys may finish last, but they also start early. If you think something’s a brewin’, let your roommate know ASAP. A simple text works. If he doesn’t respond, try posting to his Facebook or tweeting at him or something subtle like that. There’s also this new thing called Yo, which does as little and as much as you think it does.
2. Leave a gift. I’m sure your hookup/future soulmate won’t mind if on the walk home you insist on stopping at Felipe’s and grabbing your roommate a burrito. Shove it in the door mailbox and cover it up with the millions of pamphlets you've received. It’ll be better than whatever garbage the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, drops in there.
3. Follow the rules. You probably established rules, so be sure to follow them. Stay off your roommate’s bed, turn his stuffed animals to face the wall, and exterminate the evidence when you’re done!
And for that noisy neighbor? There’s only one tip you need:
The Cheer. Assemble everyone in your entryway (that isn’t having his own nighttime fun) outside the room of the abuser and cheer loudly: “You can do it! I believe in you! Break a leg!” To add insult to injury, scream “Encore!”

Happy Wednesday! It’s hump day, which means we probably have many feelings about a lot of things at this point (ex. sleep deprivation, midterms, papers, desperately wishing for the weekend to come already). Here are some things we have mixed feelings about at the moment:
HUDS
Pro: When it serves food like french fries, moose tracks ice cream, and turkey burgers with avocado (@HUDS: can we have avocados all the time, pretty please?).Con: When it serves food like vegetable paella and beef fettuccine fajitas.
Lamont
Pro: Sushi at Lamont Cafe.Con: Just about everything else at Lamont.
Mid-day naps
Pro: When you wake up feeling infinitely better than you did pre-nap (aka you no longer feel extremely irritated when someone says hi to you or asks you how your day is or more generally just interacts with you).Con: When you wake up and realize it’s a new day, specifically 20 minutes before that midterm you were going to wake up to study for.

Ladies and gentlemen, claim your study spots quickly because it’s midterm time, and Lamont is about to become more densely populated than Border Café on a Friday night. However, when you’re done pregaming (for LS1a, that is) and you’re looking to trade that math proof for some 100 proof, Flyby has got you covered. Here are a few cocktail/music combinations to accompany your “studying.”
1st Hour:
Bloody Study Buddy 
2 oz vodka4 oz of tomato juice1/2 tsp Tabasco saucedash of blood and sweatcelery for garnish
Getting started is half the battle. Motivate yourself to begin reviewing with this studious twist on a classic. With a healthy serving of fruit, vegetables, and vodka, this is the drink that keeps on giving. So what if the librarian is giving you dirty looks? He or she is probably just mad jealous. You're getting the necessary nutrients to knock those midterms out of the park!
Jukebox Jam:
Let’s Go Study - Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa
Let’s be honest, who wouldn’t want Snoop Dogg (Lion?) as a life coach? Listen to him and Wiz Khalifa croon encouragements, and inspire you to hit the books and knock back this next drink.
11th Hour:
Vodka Cramberry
1 oz vodka4.5 oz cranberry juiceThe rest of your adderall prescriptionStress tears to taste
It’s crunch time and this drink takes an OG cocktail to the next level. Swap the juice with Four Loko to give your beverage an extra caffeine kick and counteract the impending sugar crash. Why is your heart beating so fast, you ask? Well unless supply and demand curves get you hot and bothered, it’s most likely the addie.
Jukebox Jam:
I Wanna Get Better - Bleachers
At this point, I’m sure there are a lot of things you want to get better at—Econ, drawing amino acid structures, holding your liquor, whatever. This song will inspire you to do all three. And maybe get around to actually studying.
Post-Test:
Jåegerbombed Exam
4 oz Red Bull1 Shot of Jagermeister1/2 oz regret1/2 oz indifference
If you’re starting to think that skipping your review session to get hammered in your room wasn’t the best idea, you may be on to something. However, with Red Bull to restore your mojo and a shot of Jager to ease your worries about your future (or lack thereof), this spicy cocktail will have you feeling better in no time.
Jukebox Jam:
Survivor - Destiny’s Child
Rejoice, you’re done with midterms! As Beyoncé would say: now that they’re out of your life, you’re so much better. Congrats, survivor, you made it. If you’re feeling adventurous, keep turning up.
