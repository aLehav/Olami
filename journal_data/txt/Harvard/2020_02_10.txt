After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With “Jojo Rabbit,” a coming-of-age Nazi comedy, modish writer and director Taika Waititi makes a big wager: that audiences will swallow their initial discomfort long enough to decide that Waititi has actually fashioned a brilliant mockery of Nazism and bigotry. That realization never comes — not because the premise itself is insurmountable, but because once the shock value wears off, “Jojo Rabbit” fails to sustain its own daring aims. Top-notch acting brings both pathos and humor to the film, but Waititi’s unsubtle directing and guileless script results in an attempt at satire that is dangerously neutered by its own heavy-handedness.
The film’s most entertaining sequence is arguably its first. As the twilight of the Third Reich looms, lonely 10-year-old and budding Nazi Jojo Betzler (the manipulatively adorable Roman Griffin Davis) heads to a kiddie military boot camp, accompanied by his bespectacled friend Yorki (Archie Yates) and his imaginary best friend, Adolf Hitler (played by the director himself). The ensuing summer-camp-style montage, including a slow-mo book-burning bonfire jubilee, is an amusing gimmick. The resignedly patriotic crack team that runs the camp — Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), Finkel (Alfie Allen, of “Game of Thrones” fame), and Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson, inextricably herself in every movie) — land some of the film’s best lines in their cheaply comic German accents as they attempt to corral a gaggle of hyper-enthusiastic little Nazi wannabes. “I’ve had 18 kids for Germany,” Wilson proclaims, by way of inspiration.
But as the plot develops and Waititi adopts the gravity of serious storytelling, the film becomes laden with ungainly symbolism. “Rabbit” becomes attached to the young protagonist’s name after he nobly refuses to snap a bunny’s neck and is teased for his meekness. Only “Jojo Puppy” would have been better tailored towards establishing this swastika-loving boy as a caring, innocent youngster. Through heavy metaphor, Waititi paints Jojo, driven by a childlike desire to belong, as so sympathetic that the film’s satirical slant slowly becomes softer than advertised.
A stellar central cast manages to deftly carry the film’s increasingly didactic morality. The arrival of Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), Jojo’s mother, enlivens the film with Johansson’s buoyant charm and the character’s ubiquitous bright pink lipstick. Davis sells Jojo’s inevitable transformation from indoctrinated child to gentle, world-weary tween, and Thomasin Mackenzie is beautifully flinty as Elsa, the Jewish girl — surprise — that Rosie is hiding in her attic.
Talented young actors aside, it is Johansson who emerged from the awards gambit with a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for this role, and she is undeniably the film’s beating heart. Though she is burdened by her share of poorly executed themes, Johansson effortlessly conveys the pain of a mother who fears losing her son to Nazism but still strives to raise him with joy. “We must dance to show God we are grateful to be alive,” she tells Jojo. Only this theme, of dancing in the face of tragedy, manages to reappear in an emotionally authentic way. A motif of leather shoes culminates in a devastating moment foreshadowed by the motif's own incessant recurrence.
Waititi’s compositional aesthetics — symmetrical and literally framed shots, bright pastels, toy-like sets — are undeniably evocative, if not derivative, of the Wes Anderson palette. These twee tableaus benefit from Mayes C. Rubeo’s superbly anachronistic costuming, perhaps itself the most consistently funny element of the film.
Yet the almost gauche luster of Waititi’s lens, rather than sustaining a visual identity throughout the movie, fades as the horrors of the Nazi regime accumulate in Jojo’s life. Steady shots of a bewildered Jojo rising only to the knees of the adults around him become unstable cuts from various perspectives. Michael Giacchino’s eerily ebullient marching-band score unravels similarly into melancholia. These pre-third-act shifts are an attempt to sober the audience. Instead, they erode the strongest satirical tool in Waititi's arsenal — the scathing dissonance between presentation and implication, between the film’s colorful, childlike worldbuilding and the immutable spectre of evil that lurks beneath every well-intentioned Nazi comedy.
Herein lies the potentially problematic intersection of “Jojo Rabbit”’s artistic obviousness and its weighty subject matter. By adopting a Disney-ified model of storytelling and virtue signaling, Waititi obfuscates the question of exactly who this strange Führermania bildungsroman is meant to appeal to. To pull off his concept, Waititi needed to make a film that was deft and incisive throughout. Instead he shaped it into a pat emotional arc. And these days, a mediocre Nazi comedy with a sprinkling of unilateral sympathy can wear our collective patience thin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years ago, when I first arrived on the campus I now call home, I faced the daunting question that meets everyone who walks through Harvard’s gates: What comes next? For the first time in my life, I had a place to start, but no finish line in sight. When I was young, the finish line was clear: the top of the tree in the backyard (or, in hindsight, a branch no more than 5 feet off the ground). I grew a bit older, and the finish line shifted: get straight A’s, make the team. High school came and the finish line grew more distant: top of the class, good college. After four long years, I crossed that finish line and enjoyed the victory lap that is senior summer. Since then, while I have wondered about the next big finish line, I have not truly sought it.
Freshman year at Harvard is too much of a whirlwind to deeply ponder your next great goal; you make new friends, move into a new home, and experience new challenges and triumphs on a daily basis. Eventually, the newness of it all settles down, and it is somehow sophomore fall: time to pick a concentration! Advisors and peers alike tell you it’s no big deal, it’s not a binding contract, and it’s not a lifelong commitment. And yet you cannot help but feel the gravity of picking a direction. Of course you can change your concentration down the line, but it is suddenly more difficult to explore. You see the sheer number of classes you must take to complete the requirements, and wonder how there is any possible way to start down one path and then reach the finish line of another. When it was time for me to pick, I questioned everything. I loved computer science, but was it truly my favorite field of study? I can’t even answer when asked my favorite movie or book. There are so many stories I love; how can I choose between Harry Potter and the Avengers? And yet, like everyone else, I made a decision, and I am now quite comfortable with it.
Even with my concentration settled, the next big finish line is utterly unclear. Do I want to go to graduate school or go straight to work? Am I studying computer science to program forever or to hone it as a technical skill for a different field? In the short time since I started this piece, I have already decided to switch out of a computer science class I thought for sure I must take this semester.
Indeed, everyone around me is taking different paths, made clear by summer plans already settled in January — high caliber internships to pad the resume, jobs at the grocery store to pay tuition and save for the future, more classes to get credits out of the way. I find it difficult to pick which path to tread, knowing not what my future holds.
After all, I have always taken my steps with a specific goal in mind. Now it seems each step is into an abyss of uncertainty, hoping the light of clarity and purpose is on the other side.
When I share my uncertainty with my closest friends, I realize that only a lucky few know where their next finish line is. The majority, however, are stepping blindly. The myriad of paths taken by students at Harvard can be intimidating, but it should be viewed as a manifestation of the petrifying perplexity everyone feels. If there was a clear finish line of success and happiness and an obvious path to get there, we would all walk it together. Instead, we wander about, hoping to stumble into a path that suits us. So perhaps it is time to stop fretting about this uncertainty. For now, all we can do is embrace not knowing what comes next.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many people told me to cherish every semester at Harvard and not let a single one go. Yet — much to the dismay of my friends, family, and even thesis advisor — I instead made the unpopular decision to do exactly the opposite: to pack up my books, let go of Harvard, and fly overseas for a semester. And, you should, too.
I want to begin by expressing my rather unobjectionable support for the slim minority of Harvard undergraduates— in 2015, the Harvard Political Review reported the figure as less than 4.5 percent — studying abroad during any given semester. Despite study abroad being one of the highlights of many college students’ experiences across universities in the United States, it remains an extremely uncommon choice for Harvard students.
You may regret not studying abroad, but I doubt you will regret actually taking the plunge and doing it. Indeed, some iteration of this sentence has been whispered to me by many a former study abroad student who then proceeded to retell the whimsical travels, relief of academic stress, and forged friendships from their time in a foreign country, most often during their junior spring semester.
Since it is so uncommon for Harvard students, I think study abroad alumni try their best to avoid discussing the downsides of it. While I do think that all students should study abroad, I find it important to also mention the less glorious parts of the experience: loneliness, discomfort, unfamiliarity, and fear of missing out.
I am studying abroad at the Jesus College of the University of Cambridge this semester. Though it has only been a few weeks, there have definitely been some incredibly hard moments. I have felt completely lost and overwhelmed by being thrown into an entirely new environment in the middle of their academic year as well as mine; I have felt estranged from my closest friends and most comforting confidantes; I have honestly sobbed myself to sleep and begged to return home. And from casual conversations with other study abroad students, these kinds of experiences do not seem to be entirely unique.
The bigger picture, though, is that these tough moments, and the many more incredible ones that accompany them, have pushed me to grow in immeasurable ways academically, socially, and personally. My experience thus far is entirely different than it has been for the past two and a half years at Harvard, and it prepares me well for life after graduation. I am living pretty much entirely on my own, including grocery shopping and cooking for myself. I am taking one-on-one supervisions here at Cambridge, which means I don’t interact with any other students intellectually. Instead, I am spending an extremely personalized and tailored time with leading scholars in their respective fields. I have the unique opportunity to travel the world easily, seeing different cultures and peoples all across Europe on literally a weekly basis. In my experience, the social life here is much more centered around pubs than it is clubs, or Final Clubs for that matter, making it foreign but much more accessible.
In fact, my experience at Harvard will be so much richer because of the time I spent away from it, not in spite of that. My academic experience will be stronger because I have had to read and write at the level and in the style that Cambridge requires, while also participating in classes held that very much challenge my established rhythm. I will be stronger socially and more appreciative of the close-knit community that Harvard offers. I will also be more independent because studying abroad inherently forces an uncomfortable, but meaningful degree of solitude. Lastly, I will be re-energized to return to Harvard after spending six months focusing on personal and academic growth, with the comfort of also knowing that classes are pass/fail.
Despite all of the hard moments that there have been, I have never once regretted my decision to leap across the pond for my junior spring semester. Harvard, in all its glory and in all its stumbles, is fairly consistent. Incremental change and progress are indeed always happening, but nonetheless it is a predictable place. Over the course of a four-year undergraduate experience, the difference between having seven or eight semesters living in the Houses and going to class in the Yard does seem rather negligible. In fact, I feel better suited to return to Harvard for my senior year, with a newfound appreciation of all that Harvard provides that other esteemed institutions like Cambridge do not. Indeed, I will be armed with the knowledge and reflection that six months of being away from the Harvard bubble has given me. I will be ready to come back and fully take advantage of Harvard, as a re-energized senior who missed the sense of home elicited by Harvard, but grew immensely because of that.
While many people will tell you to not let go of a single semester at Harvard, I believe that studying abroad is not only a valuable experience in and of itself, but also makes every other semester at Harvard so much better. It may be unpopular, but study abroad is worth it. And, while there is no certainty that it will be easy — indeed, it probably won’t be — the one thing anyone who has gone abroad can guarantee is that you will never regret it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a Crimson investigation revealed an extremely troubling culture of discrimination and favoritism within the Harvard University Police Department. Twenty-one current and former HUPD officers attested — via interviews, multiple lawsuits, formal discrimination complaints, and meetings with University administrators among other means — to a work environment that can only be described as toxic. They allege, for instance, that HUPD officers have used racial slurs with little consequence, that female officers are passed over for promotions and face increased scrutiny, and that HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, at the center of these allegations, “rewards members of his inner circle while passing over officers who voice concerns.”
Condemning the alleged toxic, discriminatory culture these officers paint is necessary, but not nearly sufficient. These allegations are alarming to say the least, and they inevitably reframe how we think about past HUPD-related incidents, including the interaction between students of color in Romance Languages and Literatures Professor Lorgia García Peña's course. The University cannot reasonably expect its student body, and minority students in particular, to trust HUPD under Chief Riley — a man consistently identified as either creating or enabling this culture. Not only for this urgent practical reason, but also out of clear moral obligation, we call for his immediate resignation.
These events represent an egregious wrong that demands accountability. We extend our sympathy and support to those HUPD officers who have experienced (and may still be experiencing) acts of harassment and discrimination, particularly those who were forced to remain silent out of fear of retaliation and economic need. Only with Riley’s departure can HUPD begin to mend the evident rifts within the department and its relationship with the student body.
Failing to ensure a good relationship between Harvard affiliates and HUPD threatens the safety of everyone on campus by making effective communication with individual officers less likely. Indeed, Riley’s presence at the top of the department stains the public’s perception of the many fair-minded, conscientious officers that keep our campus safe, actively hurting both his force and the student body more broadly.
While Chief’s Riley’s resignation is vital, it is not, however, sufficient. Beyond Riley himself, the university bears significant responsibility for the events. Prior to Crimson’s reporting, top Harvard officials appear to have consistently ignored numerous signs that pointed at the problematic dynamics at play in the department. From filings with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, to settled lawsuits and unfruitful meetings, Harvard remained unfazed despite multiple red flags.
The University did not act in the students' best interest by withholding information about many of these incidents and continuing to allow officers who had allegedly committed racist and sexist acts to continue interacting with students on a daily basis. We condemn the top Harvard officials who were allegedly informed of the department’s culture and failed to take action, including Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, Senior Advisor to the President John S. Wilson, ombudsman Lydia L. Cummings, and Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, as well as any others not revealed by the Crimson’s reporting. We call for an investigation into the alleged negligence displayed by top leadership that reveals why so many complaints fell on deaf ears, and an appropriate response to its findings.
Harvard can’t erase the pain allegedly inflicted by Riley during his time as the head of the department. But we can — we must — strive to do better. That work starts with Riley's resignation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 50 Harvard students called for Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley to resign at a rally in front of the John Harvard Statue Saturday afternoon.
Co-hosted by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, the event featured speakers from the two student groups as well as representatives of Divest Harvard, Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, and Harvard Student Labor Action Movement.
A week before the protest, The Crimson published an investigation into Harvard’s police force that found repeated instances of racism and sexism in the department over the span of nearly three decades. Lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews with current and former officers painted a picture of a department divided over instances of racism and sexism and alleged favoritism and retaliation.
Those who voiced their concerns in the department held Riley — who has headed Harvard’s police force for a quarter of a century — responsible for what they described as a toxic culture in the department.
Brandishing signs that read “Abolish HUPD, End Discrimination,” “White Supremacy Kills. We Will Defend Ourselves,” and “Policing is Violent,” protesters chanted slogans such as “No Justice. No Peace. No Racist Police.”
Protestors demanded an end to the alleged harassment they said they have experienced by Harvard police officers and called for Riley’s removal.
HPDC member Zoe L. Hopkins ’22 condemned Harvard’s police department in her opening remarks.
“We are here today to say to the Harvard University Police Department that we’ve had enough of their racism, enough of their sexism, enough of their harassment, enough of their xenophobia, enough is enough,” Hopkins said.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that the department treats all University affiliates equally.
“The Harvard University Police Department is committed to providing a safe and secure campus through quality policing and treats all persons with dignity and respect,” he wrote.
Hopkins told the crowd that The Crimson’s investigation was not news to her. She alleged that there was a connection between the instances of racism and sexism found within the department’s walls and the way HUPD polices students on campus.
“The Crimson article that was released last week only confirmed our suspicions of the racism, sexism, xenophobia and prejudice that is embedded within HUPD,” she said. “We are here because we are tired of the harassment. Tired of the tension in our chest when we see an armed officer. Tired of having to defend ourselves. Today we demand disarmament and an end to the tireless harassment of students of color. We are demanding that Francis Riley resign.”
In a speech also given on Saturday afternoon, Ethnic Studies Coalition member Cecilia A. J. Nuñez ’20 alleged that HUPD officers and officers from the Cambridge Police Department discriminate against students of color.
She said that police from both departments have increased their presence on campus to monitor student activists, many of whom are people of color. Nuñez alleged that she has seen an increase in plainclothes HUPD officers monitoring events and said she has also noticed CPD officers “called in at alarming rates.”
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email that the basis of CPD’s presence at rallies is to keep both protestors and the public safe.
“In the event that we become aware of or are requested to assist with any planned or formed rally or protest, our primary goals are two-fold: to ensure protestors are able to safely exercise their first amendments rights and that public safety is maintained,” he wrote.
To Nuñez, this alleged increase in police presence evinces Harvard’s belief that minority students are “a threat.”
“The University sees its students of color as a threat and a population to be controlled. It is no coincidence that the heightened police presence comes at a time of increased activism and public visibility of students of color on campus,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment for this article.
Fraught relationships between students of color and police on campus are neither new nor unique to Harvard, Nuñez said. She related interactions between Harvard affiliates and HUPD and CPD officers to the broader relationship between police and minorities across America.
“At the same time that we are seeing an increase in the policing of Harvard students of color, black and brown communities across the country are facing police brutality, surveillance, and fear,” she said.
Nuñez also spoke about CPD’s arrest of a black Harvard student in 2018, which touched off allegations of police brutality at the time.
“Students at Harvard are still reeling from the violent attack of a black student by Cambridge Police Department in 2018 and the recent reports of sexism and racism currently taking place in the Harvard University Police Department,” she said.
Asked to respond to allegations regarding the 2018 arrest, Warnick referred to the independent review of the arrest, led by former Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Roderick L. Ireland and released in May of 2019, which found that the officers involved did not use excessive force.
In an email sent to HUPD employees on Tuesday, Riley wrote that he “will be moving forward in the near future” with an internal review of his department following the recent report of racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism in the department.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council voted to fund an event to promote student engagement with the Council’s Black Caucus in its first general meeting of the semester Sunday.
The $300 allocation from the UC’s discretionary “Burst Fund” will pay for food and publicity for the “Meet the Black Caucus” event.
UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22 and Ivy Yard representative Chloe E. V. Koulefianou ’23, the new co-chairs of the Black Caucus, said they hope the event will allow undergraduates to meet UC members and discuss concerns or recommendations.
“I’m really hoping to get this off the ground and make it a more regular thing because I feel like right now we’re a little bit disjointed,” Koulefianou said. “I really want for there to be more of a sense of togetherness in the communities.”
The caucus system has been a source of controversy since the Council established it in early 2017. While the UC almost scrapped the system last year, current UC president James A. Mathew ’21 and vice president Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 discussed revamping it during their campaign for Council leadership.
Lowell House representative M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 proposed an amendment to the legislation that would require event organizers to record the number of attendees.
Larson argued that recording attendance figures would provide transparency and help the Council ensure it funds only well-attended events.
“I would say the UC historically has not kept good records of its events,” Larson said. “This means that we funded a number of things that have had low attendance.”
Eliot House representative Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 and Crimson Yard representative Yousuf Bakshi ’23 opposed the amendment. Ganesh argued that it would pose an “undue burden” on representatives tasked with tracking attendance figures at the Black Caucus event and future events.
“This sets a precedent for anything moving forward,” Ganesh said.
Mathew and White-Thorpe, who ran on a platform centered on diversity and improving student life on campus, said their proposed Unity Caucus would allow students from outside the UC to collaborate with representatives on projects.
The duo also discussed applications for their executive committee, which advises the UC president and vice president on various aspects of student life.
Prospective members do not have to be Council representatives and can also apply to become project directors. Project directors would carry out specific programs from Mathew and White-Thorpe’s campaign platform.
The UC also unanimously approved legislation that would publicize the faculty nomination form for the Board of First-Year Advisors. The form allows students to nominate professors they would like to see become First-Year Advisors, who support freshmen in their transition to college.
The Council will hold midterm elections next week to fill sixteen vacancies on the body, the largest number of open spots by the time of the February elections since at least 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Black Health Matters Conference hosted its third annual conference this weekend with a series of keynote speakers, panels, and workshops discussing racial disparities in public health outcomes for black Americans.
A team of undergraduates plans and organizes the conference each year at Harvard.
Two undergraduate students founded the organization three years ago after they felt frustrated by lower health outcomes in marginalized communities, according to conference co-director Yoseph D. Boku ’21.
Boku said the purpose of the conference is both to shed light on social determinants of health and to discuss possible interventions with students and faculty at Harvard.
Boku said the theme guiding this year’s conference was “community empowerment,” or encouraging individual participation in the public health decision-making process.
“If you could make community members agents of social change, and if you make every community member responsible for improving not only their own health, but also their neighbor’s health, then you can drastically decrease social determinants,” Boku said.
Keynote speakers, panelists, and workshops met in the Northwest Building to examine social determinants of health that are particularly relevant to black Americans. Discussions on the first day of the conference included covered topics like black maternal mortality, racial barriers to accessing medications, black mental health care, and spirituality.
Harvard School of Public Health Professor Nancy J. Krieger ’80 spoke about the importance of considering history and context in empirical research when analyzing racial and health inequity.
“Again, the point of such research is not to — quote unquote — prove that racism is bad. It is to understand and prevent its adverse health impacts and spark imagination and action to bring about health equity,” she said.
The conference’s second day dealt with the issues of HIV/AIDS, mental health stigma, food and housing inequality, sexuality, drug use, and sleep health among black Americans.
“I think these spaces are a great place for people who are all in the same mission to come together and be like, ‘This is something that’s real, and what are we going to do about it?’” attendee and public health worker Andrea C. Royo said. “It’s good to kind of convene and speak truth to what’s going on.”
Attendee Sergine Cindy M. Zeufack ’20 said she appreciated the platform that the conference offers because she thinks learning about these matters in public health classes often feels too “abstract.”
“Being able to attend a conference like this really takes the abstract and makes it really concrete, because you have all these panelists of variety, of different backgrounds, giving you all this information, whether it’s empirical data or personal experiences,” Zeufack said.
Boku said he hopes the conference will mobilize student attendees to address the social determinants of health.
“We think that the only way we’re going to solve social determinants of health is by mobilizing youth and making youth key members in the fight for health equity,” Boku said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Advising Programs Office has reimagined its first-year concentration advising this academic year with the launch of the Exploring Fields of Study program, which will replace its predecessor Advising Fortnight.
The pioneer program will preserve the Fields of Study Fair — the focal event of its forebear — while also introducing Fields of Study Sessions, hosted by each concentration.
As in past years, the fair will offer first-year students the opportunity to discuss potential fields of study with advisors from all 50 of Harvard’s undergraduate concentrations over a buffet dinner served in Annenberg, the freshman dining hall.
At subsequent Fields of Study Sessions throughout the semester, students will connect with faculty, advisors, and peers from their prospective concentrations to learn about the structure and character of each program.
Under the previous system, most first-year concentration advising events took place during a two-week period known as Advising Fortnight. Now, individual concentrations will have the latitude to host information sessions and other events at any time during the spring term.
Lauren Bimmler, the English Department’s undergraduate program administrator, wrote in an email that she is “pleased” that the new program will give freshmen more time to explore potential concentrations.
“Since the Fields of Study Sessions will be available to students throughout the semester – rather than just during a two-week stretch in April – first-years will have more time and freedom to explore all the College has to offer,” Bimmler wrote. “Moving toward a model where first-years and advisors meet early on and where subsequent advising events are more numerous and spread out seems like the most productive way forward.”
Other advising staff, however, acknowledged both merits and drawbacks of the new model.
Anne N. Le Brun, a lecturer and advisor in the Economics Department, wrote in an email that though the program’s lengthened schedule could impede opportunities to directly compare concentrations, it would likely ease students’ time pressures.
“I suppose it’s possible that if students have a compressed timeline to explore all potential concentrations, they can make a more direct comparison of apples and oranges than if they extend their exploration over the course of the whole semester,” she wrote. “But one could also make the argument that a longer time frame might be useful to students who are cramped for time.”
“So I think there are arguments on both sides, which I imagine the APO considered carefully before making their decision,” she added.
Christina Zaldana, the manager for advising programs and diversity outreach at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, agreed with Le Brun on the effects of the timeline change.
“The semester long schedule just helps us spread out events, which is helpful for students comparing similar concentrations — like [Applied Math] and [Computer Science] — that might not be able to sacrifice two days of the week for this type of exploring,” she wrote in an email. “The only drawback I see is that some students might be more nervous about the open-ended style of the event that lasts all semester rather than just two weeks.”
The Exploring Fields of Study program will kick off with the Fields of Study Fair Monday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Major University donor Leslie H. Wexner failed to address inappropriate conduct and a culture of misogyny inside L Brands, the company he runs, a New York Times investigation found earlier this month.
Wexner — whose ties to another Harvard donor, convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein, came under scrutiny last year — provided the University and some of its affiliate organizations multiple multimillion-dollar donations over the span of several years.
Former employees of Wexner’s company told the Times that it had a persistent misogynistic culture, raising complaints about inappropriate conduct by his deputy, Edward Razek. Executives said employees brought these complaints to Wexner to no avail. Wexner himself was also heard making demeaning comments about women in the workplace, according to the Times.
Wexner did not respond to a request for comment.
Wexner and his wife, Abigail S. Wexner, are the founding benefactors of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership. They also sponsor the Wexner Israel Fellowship, which supports up to ten Israeli public service officials to pursue a one-year mid-career public administration degree. Wexner donated more than $42 million to the Kennedy School before 2012, and one of the school’s six main buildings is named for him.
Epstein — a New York financier who died last August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — served as Wexner’s financial advisor for decades. He facilitated, but did not contribute money to, a donation from Wexner that funded the construction of Harvard Hillel.
Wexner was one of Epstein’s only known clients. The Wall Street Journal reported last July that Epstein also attempted to participate in the process of selecting models for Victoria’s Secret, the flagship subsidiary company of L Brands.
Another Harvard affiliate — Patricia S. Bellinger ’83, University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s chief of staff — sits on L Brands’ Board of Directors alongside Wexner. As Bacow’s chief of staff, Bellinger oversees activities of the Office of the President, assists with key University initiatives, and helps promote Bacow’s agenda. Bellinger previously served as a senior fellow at the Center for Public Leadership.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Bellinger’s behalf, directing the request to L Brands spokesperson Tammy R. Myers. Myers did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Dozens of Harvard undergraduates braved sub-freezing temperatures over the weekend to campaign for Democratic presidential candidates in New Hampshire ahead of the state’s first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday.
Groups of supporters for United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04, and businessman Andrew M. Yang trekked to the Granite State to take part in canvassing and campaign events.
“I really enjoy canvassing,” Harvard College Democrats for Biden co-founder Amelia M. Apgar ’20 said. “I think it’s one of the most important parts of running a campaign because you actually are face-to-face speaking to the people who matter.”
Apgar traveled to volunteer in the Manchester area with three other Harvard students who support Biden.
Diego A. Garcia ’20, who founded Harvard College Democrats for Biden alongside Apgar, said the former vice president’s disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Monday has sparked interest in the Biden group on campus. After technical problems delayed the results from being reported last Monday, Biden finished in a distant fourth place with support from just under 16 percent of caucusgoers. The Associated Press eventually decided it could not declare a winner after significant errors in the results were found.
“I think that our Harvard for Biden membership, in addition to a lot of traditional Harvard College Democrats members, [has] really appealed to other demographics within Harvard — other groups within Harvard who have not necessarily canvassed before,” Garcia said. “And they realize with the disappointing result — the gut punch that we received in Iowa — that it was not the time to be sitting on the sidelines.”
The Biden group’s canvassing efforts focused mostly on voter turnout during the final weekend before the election.
“At this point, I’m not trying to turn a Warren voter over to Biden or anything like that,” said Garcia, who previously canvassed in both Iowa and New Hampshire for Biden.
Some students knocking doors for other Democratic hopefuls took a different tack, however.
Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang volunteers Michael Zhu ’22 and J. Alexander White III ’23, who door-knocked for much of the day on Saturday, engaged in sometimes lengthy conversations with voters at the door, asking residents about their priorities and attempting to convince them to support Yang.
Zhu, a Social Studies concentrator who founded Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang, said canvassing helps to “put a face” on the Yang campaign.
“If I can even get some people to see both Andrew Yang, but also just a guy wearing a blue hat that says MATH knocking on their door and telling them about health care or about education reform — I think putting a face on the campaign is so much of what canvassing is about,” Zhu said.
The Yang canvassers ran into some New Hampshire residents who were skeptical of the former start-up executive’s ability to pay for his signature proposal — a universal basic income program that would provide American adults with a $1,000-per-month “Freedom Dividend.”
Zhu directed one voter who expressed reservations about the policy toward a New York Times op-ed written by longtime Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who called Yang’s plan “practical.”
“It’s definitely something backed up by plenty of research,” Zhu said.
Despite some voters’ concerns about paying for universal basic income, White said he thinks Yang is electable and could win some voters who supported President Donald J. Trump in 2016.
“You have a guy who in a Democratic primary is actually willing to say that Donald Trump did not create all the evil in the world, and that, you know, some of the problems in the world actually created Donald Trump,” White said.
Roderick P. Emley ’23, who canvassed for Warren in Rochester, N.H., on Saturday, said voters can sometimes get “really honest with you on the doors in kind of an emotional way” while discussing issues that have affected their lives.
“On one level it makes me so angry because when you’re talking to people who have these stories, you realize how much injustice there is and that the deck is so stacked against so many people,” Emley said. “But then you can be optimistic about it too, because it feels like doing work like that can actually make a difference.”

Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in an interview Friday that Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is “limited” in its ability to track whether its faculty members engage in illicit or unauthorized research collaborations.
Stubbs’s comments come in the wake of federal charges against Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber, who was arrested last month for making false statements about funding he received from the Chinese government. Lieber, an acclaimed nanoscientist and University professor, was required to surrender his passport by a federal judge and was placed on indefinite paid leave by Harvard as he awaits trial.
The charges against Lieber form the latest development in a months-long federal crackdown against “academic espionage,” the process by which scientists pass academic research from American universities to foreign governments. Stubbs announced in November that the University and FAS have formed new oversight committees to review sensitive research projects and examine FAS’s policies for compliance with federal funding guidelines.
Stubbs said Friday that the committees’ efforts have aided members of FAS’s Sciences division in understanding their responsibilities as researchers. He said the group has trained both faculty and staff to ensure affiliates are “fastidious” in record-keeping, tracking funding and effort, and disclosing “financial and intellectual entanglements.”
“What we try to do is to track that in real time and identify, early on, instances where we’re headed towards a discrepancy and take corrective action,” he said.
Stubbs said he expects the Chinese government — as well as other researchers and government officials across the world — to follow codes of conduct that govern global research. He added that Harvard will continue to welcome any foreign researchers who receive visas from the federal government.
“I think that the challenge that we face is the relationship between the government, the military, and institutions of higher education in China is structured differently than it is in this country,” Stubbs said. “I think there are unwritten norms and expectations of conduct, and we undertake our scholarship here in the expectation that our competitors and collaborators follow the same norms and codes of conduct that have led to increases in prosperity and wellbeing internationally for a long time.”
In the future, Stubbs said he plans to make new efforts to educate faculty in his division on research regulations and procedures as needed.
“We’re continually reviewing our internal policies and procedures and communicating our expectations to colleagues and trying to be proactive in educating the Harvard science community about ethical behavior, norms, and expectations,” he said. “We hold ourselves to a high intellectual standard. That’s been true forever and isn’t going to change in the future.”

Harvard’s Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which is tasked with handling issues of corporate social responsibility, voted on four resolutions presented to Facebook shareholders during the last fiscal year, according to a Friday report.
Though the Harvard Management Company increasingly turns to external money managers to invest its $40.9 billion endowment, it still retains shares in some publicly traded companies.
Facebook is “one of the few publicly traded companies in which HMC directly held voting shares as of the relevant date in 2019,” per the report.
The Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility — which consists of several members of the Harvard Corporation and is chaired by Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 — is responsible for all final decisions on shareholder resolutions.
Two of the resolutions — which the committee opposed — were related to conservative political ideology at Facebook.
Several American conservative politicians have accused Facebook, founded by Harvard dropout Mark E. Zuckerberg, of political bias as the company faces scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election.
The first of the two resolutions was based on “concerns that the company’s board lacks ideological diversity and that conservative views cannot safely be expressed in some American boardrooms,” per the report.
The resolution requested that a minimum qualification for board nominees be set, and requested that all nominees’ skills, ideological perspectives, and experience be presented in a chart or matrix form.
The report said that, in voting against the resolution, committee members reflected upon substantive differences between categories such as gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity, which are not a matter of personal choice, and “ideological perspectives,” which are.
The second resolution sought information on “affirmative action and protection for conservatives” at Facebook, asserting that there is a “dominant political ideology” at Facebook that makes it an unwelcome work environment for some employees. It also requested a report on programs to protect and support employees who “do not share all or part of Silicon Valley’s dominant political ideology,” and to recruit employees from “free-market, conservative and libertarian think tanks, political organizations and job banks.”
The committee voted against the resolutions, based on “reservations” about using ideology as a criterion for affirmative action and the existence of discrimination against employees with conservative views at Facebook.
The committee voted in favor of a proposal introduced in 2018 that asked Facebook to publish a report evaluating “content governance,” with regard to the dissemination of hate speech, misinformation, and images or videos of extreme violence and cruelty.
They also voted in favor of a 2019 resolution that requested Facebook report its global median gender pay gap.
The report also contained “subject-specific proxy voting guidelines” drafted throughout the year to match the changing nature of HMC’s investment strategy, which involves less direct investment in individual companies and relies more on outside money managers.
Three of the eight guidelines focused on the environmental impact of businesses that Harvard invests in by proxy. They included support for reporting and reducing methane emissions, reporting on business risks and climate change, and reducing waste of plastic/polystyrene products.
Harvard has faced calls from students and faculty to divest from the fossil fuel industry. University administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, have resisted calls for divestment.
The proxy guidelines also addressed topics such as lobbying and political spending, anti-genocide policies, and gender-, race-, and ethnicity-based pay disparities.

MANCHESTER, N.H. — Democratic presidential hopeful Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 fended off rivals’ recent criticisms at a New Hampshire Democratic Party event attended by nearly all the major Democratic primary candidates Sunday.
Buttigieg, a former Crimson editorial editor, faced criticism over the weekend from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., as well as United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Biden — who came in fourth-place in in the Iowa caucuses last week and is lagging in the polls in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Tuesday — released an ad criticizing Buttigieg’s work as the mayor of South Bend, Ind., on Sunday.
Though he did not name Biden, Buttigieg responded to criticisms in the ad Sunday night at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner — an annual fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic party held at the 11,000-seat Southern New Hampshire University Arena.
“I know some are asking: What business does a South Bend Mayor have seeking the highest office in the land?” Buttigieg said. “You don’t have an office in Washington. You don’t have decades of experience in the establishment. The city you’re the mayor of isn’t even the biggest city in the country — it’s more like Manchester, New Hampshire.”
“To which I say, that is very much the point. Because Americans in small rural towns, in industrial communities — and yes, in pockets of our country’s biggest cities — are tired of being reduced to a punchline by Washington politicians and ready for somebody to take their voice to the American capital,” he added.
Diego A. Garcia ’20, the co-founder of Harvard College Democrats for Biden, said the former vice president’s record “speaks for itself” in contrast to Buttigieg’s.
“I think that Vice President Biden has the utmost respect for our mayors and local government across the country,” Garcia said. “But at the end of the day, what matters in a presidential primary cycle — in a presidential election — is what you've accomplished in life.”
Sanders, a former Harvard Institute of Politics resident fellow, also sharpened his criticisms of Buttigieg over the weekend by painting him as wealthy donors’ candidate of choice at campaign events and on Twitter.
Buttigieg responded Sunday night by rebuking Sanders’ call for a “political revolution.”
“With a president this divisive, we cannot risk dividing Americans further, saying that you must either be for a revolution or you must be for the status quo,” Buttigeig said, drawing boos from Sanders supporters in the crowd.
Garcia said he thinks Sanders supporters booing other candidates is unhelpful for party unity.
“I just don't think it’s healthy for the party for us to be trying to sow this type of discord,” he said.
Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang President Michael Zhu ’22, who attended Sunday’s McIntyre-Shaheen dinner, said that after hearing from every major Democratic presidential hopeful except for Michael R. Bloomberg — who is not on the ballot in the Granite State — he feels comfortable pledging support to the eventual nominee.
“Regardless of anything else, I still consider myself a lifelong Democrat,” Zhu said. “Even before I could actually vote, I’d still stand behind my party, of course.”

Diana L. Nelson ’84 will join the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in July, the University announced Monday.
Nelson will replace James W. Breyer, who stepped down from the Corporation in May.
Nelson said in a press release that she is honored to join the Corporation and carry out the school’s mission.
“I am deeply honored to join President Bacow and my future Corporation colleagues in serving to support and advance Harvard’s mission,” Nelson said in the press release. “Harvard is a powerful engine of opportunity for students, the broader community, and society at large. Thanks to its capacity for constant renewal, and the creativity and dedication of its people, I’m confident the University will meet new challenges and be an ongoing force for good.”
Nelson graduated from the College and then attended Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, where she received a master’s degree in management. Nelson served as the chair of Carlson Inc., a hospitality company, and is involved in a variety of education and art-related organizations, including Teach for America and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
Nelson, who previously served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers from 2010 to 2016, is “known for her strong commitment to education and wide ranging governance experience,” according to a press release.
While on the Board, she served as the vice-chair of the Board’s Executive Committee and as co-chair of the Harvard Campaign, which ended in 2018. She also served as chair of the Board’s Subcommittee on Visitation, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Alumni Affairs and Development, and chair of the Committee on Finance, Administration, and Management.
In addition to serving on the Board, Nelson co-chaired the Harvard College fund, co-chaired a Faculty of Arts and Sciences task force on the undergraduate experience, and served the Radcliffe Institute’s Dean’s Advisory Council. Since 1994, she has led her class reunions every five years.
William F. Lee, the senior fellow of the Corporation, wrote in a press release that Nelson has been a “devoted” Harvard alumna.
“Diana Nelson has been one of her generation’s most devoted Harvard alumnae,” Lee said in a press release. “She knows the University well, she has a passion for education, and she brings a remarkable breadth of experience in governance roles. We are sure to benefit from her thoughtfulness and insight, and we look forward to welcoming her back to Harvard’s governing boards.”
The Harvard Corporation — which is known formally as the President and Fellows of Harvard College — is the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere. The Corporation consists of 13 members that exercise responsibility in the University’s academic, financial, and physical resources, and overall well-being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up by two with under three seconds left, Harvard found itself in a familiar position. It was Brown ball, and the Crimson needed just one defensive stop to come away with the victory.
The prior night, Harvard had bailed Yale out by gifting the Bulldogs with a four-point play opportunity with less than a second remaining. But veteran guard Azar Swain missed the critical free throw to tie the game, and Harvard eked out a one-point victory.
On Saturday night, the Crimson had the opportunity to redeem itself for its late-game blunder in the previous game by getting a defensive stop and closing out the Bears. Instead, junior forward Tamenang Choh drove to the basket and hit a challenging layup while getting fouled. Harvard would not be as lucky this game, as Choh sank the free throw and gave Brown the 73-72 victory.
“We shouldn’t have fouled or have come close to it again,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was redundant from last night, but it was a tough call. But the kid made a tough shot and made his free throw.”
Heading into Pizzitola Sports Center for its fifth straight road game, the Crimson (14-7, 3-3 Ivy) had become accustomed to tough nailbiters in its Ivy League matchups, with all of its conference games decided by five points or less. Playing the Bears (11-8, 4-2 Ivy)  proved to be no different, as the game played out in typical Ancient Eight fashion. The game was tightly contested, often sluggish, and had a myriad of sloppy possessions from both teams.
Harvard was hurt by foul trouble from the outset of the contest. With seven minutes left to go in the half, the Crimson found itself in the double bonus, which Brown took full advantage of. The Bears shot 20 free throws in the period and made 18 of them. In a half where Harvard shot 52 percent from the field and limited the Bears to 41 percent shooting, the score was tied 39-39.
“Brown played really well and I thought the difference for us was our inability to keep them off the foul line,” Amaker said. “It’s really hard when they’re making their free throws. They made 28/32 and we need to do a better job of keeping them off the line especially when they’re cashing it in.”
Foul trouble also kept key members of the rotation off the court. Senior guard Christian Juzang only played four minutes in the first period because of his two early fouls, while senior forward Chris Lewis picked up his fourth foul with eight minutes left in the game and had to leave the game in its critical moments.
“It was tough,” senior forward Justin Bassey said. “We had to go pretty deep into our bench and our bench was able to give us a good lift but losing some of our key guys early on really hurt us. We gotta clean up though. You know it's on us, and it's about us to make sure that we're playing great defense without fouling.”
The Crimson also had a tough time guarding senior guard Brandon Anderson, whose 22 points led the way for Brown. Anderson had only averaged 11.5 points on 39 percent shooting heading into this matchup, but was able to take advantage of Harvard’s foul trouble and score a significant portion of his points from the free-throw line.
“He's always played well against us and you know he's very fast and shifty and quick with the ball and because he gets downhill,” Amaker said. “We're scrambling a little bit and then he can get into your body to the foul go to the free-throw line. He got nine against us so he gets to the line and cashes in. That’s part of their arsenal and game plan against us.”
With turnovers and fouls hindering the Crimson scoring attack, senior forward Rob Baker was an offensive bright spot for the team. Baker scored a career-high 18 points on 58 percent shooting from the field. The Woodstock, Ga. native was also 3-5 from three-point range, while the rest of the team was a combined 4-18.
“He made some tremendous plays for us with his scoring,” Amaker said. “He did a lot of things for us that helped us stay in the game.”
The leadership of Baker and the rest of experienced veterans on the team will be critical as Harvard enters a four-game homestand in its conference play.
“We've been in this position before throughout the years especially with older guys knowing a lot about how do we regroup and respond,” Bassey said. “We come together and set a precedent, and it's great that we have the opportunity to do that at home after a tough two weekends. We have to learn from our mistakes in the past and make sure we’re not putting ourselves in these positions again.”
The Crimson looks to reverse its fortunes as it goes back to Lavietes and hopes to secure home wins against Columbia and Cornell next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — On Monday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team played in a game it had hoped to avoid.
The consolation matchup of the Beanpot Tournament — held in a mostly empty TD Garden ahead of the all-important finale — can be challenging to muster enthusiasm for. The No. 18 Crimson (11-8-4, 9-4-3 ECAC) appeared to fall victim to this trap, as No. 7/6 Boston College (17-8-1, 10-6-0 HEA) skated to a lopsided 7-2 victory to claim third place.
“The focus wasn’t there,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We talked about not really creating offense for them, and we did. We gave them two shorthanded goals, several bad changes, things that are very controllable…. They’re a very good team, very skilled and talented. But to me, I just don’t think we made them have to work to get those great chances.”
Harvard brought the nation’s top powerplay into the contest and even converted on it early in the tilt. Nonetheless, on Monday the man-up unit was the cause of the Crimson’s ruin.
Midway through the second period with the Eagles ahead, 3-1, forward Graham McPhee took a hooking penalty to give Harvard the extra man. Over the ensuing two minutes, BC potted not one, but two shorthanded goals, deflating the Crimson bench and suppressing the likelihood of a comeback.
Freshman forward Alex Newhook and sophomore forward Jack McBain were responsible for the Eagles’ NCAA-leading eighth and ninth man-down tallies on the year. After McBain’s tuck — his second of the night — the result was all but decided.
“It’s an important game for us [in terms of the] Pairwise [rankings],” Eagles coach Jerry York said. “We’re disappointed that we’re not playing for a trophy tonight at eight o’clock. We don’t shy away from that fact. That’s what we want to do, win trophies. We didn’t get a chance to do that tonight, but good win for Pairwise, as far as national seeding.”
With the win, BC picks up its second triumph over Harvard this season after a late-November matchup went in its favor. Since coach Donato took the helm ahead of the 2004-2005 campaign, the Crimson program has posted a dispiriting 1-10 record against the Eagles in the Beanpot. Monday also marks the first time since 2016 that Harvard has finished fourth in the storied hockey classic.
The final stanza saw the adversaries trade chances, with BC finding twine for the seventh and final time. The third-period goal was the sole strike against senior Cameron Gornet (1 GA, .857 SV%), who replaced rookie Mitchell Gibson (6 GA, .800 SV%) between the pipes after the second intermission.
The barrage thrown at the Harvard backstops helped the Eagles preserve the edge they had built by the first-period horn. Late in the first frame, McBain sent a pass goalward from behind and to the right of Gibson. The errant attempt ricocheted off the skates of Crimson sophomore defenseman Marshall Rifai and into his own net, representing another atypical score, along with the two shorthanded notches, that made a difference on Monday.
Before the blowout affair took shape, Harvard opened the game on a positive note. Despite the sluggish atmosphere characteristic of the “early game” of the Beanpot’s second week, it did not take long for action to arise. Within a minute of the incipient puck drop, the referees whistled Eagles forward Matthew Boldy for slashing.
On the man advantage, Harvard sophomore forward Casey Dornbach ripped a one-timer from the left circle past BC net-minder Spencer Knight (2 GA, .929 SV%), getting his squad off to an ideal start.
The snipe marked the 19th time in 23 games this season that the Crimson has executed on the man advantage. This consistent success has yielded the league’s top conversion rate (31.3%). Even with the early tally, though, Harvard’s powerplay ironically was its downfall on Monday evening.
“There was a lot of the game left,” coach York said. “We’ve scored first goals early, too, and not won those games. I thought our kids were pretty resilient. We came right back and had some excellent chances early in the first period. [But it’s] always a bummer to start with an early penalty and then give up a goal.”
Twelve minutes after Dornbach’s pretty goal, Eagles captain David Cotton evened the ledger and confiscated the lead from the Crimson, which would never own it again.
BC’s top forward line, featuring upperclassmen Julius Mattila and Logan Hutsko, combined for a textbook passing play in front, allowing Cotton to bury a close-up chance on a mostly empty net.
Mattila, who logged the primary assist, registered his 100th career point (37–63—100) on the play. The Finnish centerman has collected seven (2–5—7) of these points against Harvard in six meetings.
In addition to Mattila’s contribution, the Eagles’ seven strikes gave six skaters multi-point outings. Boldy led all participants in Monday’s clash with three points (1–2—3), while Hutsko, Cotton, Newhook, and freshman Mike Hardman finished with one goal and one assist apiece. McBain’s two scores led all skaters.
“We had, I think, six different goal-scorers in the game, which was good,” Mattila lauded. “We got our contribution from all four lines.”
While a five-goal disparity correctly suggests that BC dominated on multiple fronts, perhaps the Crimson could have benefitted from the services of junior blue-liner Reilly Walsh, who was absent from Monday’s roster following a lower-body injury sustained in practice this past week. The puck-moving defenseman brings both scoring prowess and experience to the Harvard back end and remains day-to-day ahead of Friday’s upcoming rivalry match with Yale.
“Harvard is missing one of their very best players in the Walsh boy,” coach York said. “The absence of one of their best defenseman, our ability to get two breaks [while] shorthanded…that’s a pretty good turn of events for us during the game.”
Of course, placing fourth in the Beanpot is far from the outcome that coach Donato’s group desired. And the aura of the consolation game affixes an asterisk next to any takeaways one might derive from the performance.
That said, Monday’s defeat continues a season-long trend for the Crimson: a lack of statement wins against marquee opponents. Previous losses to the Eagles, Boston University, No. 2 Cornell, No. 5/7 Clarkson, and No. 12 Northeastern represent missed opportunities to pocket crucial victories for the Pairwise rankings, the determinant of at-large NCAA Tournament berths.
To finish the regular season, Harvard turns back to the ECAC slate for six contests. All else being equal, Harvard would have to win out to be ranked among the top 16 teams entering the conference tournament, which itself provides more opportunity for ranking improvement.
For now, the squad will strive for a top-four seed and bye week in the ECAC playoffs — in which a deep run could earn the talented Crimson a spot in the national tournament.
“Everything is still right in front of us,” coach Donato said. “We still have a lot to play for. As a group, we’ve shown flashes of the type of team we can be…. We have been inconsistent, and we’ll have to improve on that as we play down the stretch, but I really enjoy this group. They work hard, and I really believe that there’s some good things to come with this group at the end of the season.”

Ellen: Hi, I’m Ellen and I love chicken. My vegan friends have been bemoaning my chicken addiction, and to their delight, I’ve been shifting to a more flexitarian diet. However, I wondered what it would be like to completely cut out meat and dairy, especially at HUDS where finding vegan options seemed difficult. I wanted to understand the difference in meal accessibility for meat-eaters and for vegans.
Janani: Hi, I’m Janani and I love salad. I’ve been vegan for a while, and it’s not always easy in the d-hall. When Ellen decided to go vegan, in true solidarity, I decided to help her look for HUDS hacks.
Days 1-2
Ellen: Like anyone else who has ever had a New Year’s resolution, I started out excited to try out egg substitutes at Berg breakfast. As an avid egg lover, I was most worried about vegan “eggs,” but HUDS delivered. I ended up pleasantly surprised, and even found myself enjoying the “eggs” after dousing them in Sriracha sauce.
Lunch and dinner the first day were surprisingly simple: I made a beeline to the vegan corner at Berg. Some of the entrées were completely different from the meat options, and I tried a lot of new foods, including seitan and falafel.
Day 2 dinner was when my willpower suffered. The free food event I attended boasted thick slices of pizza, covered in delicious, dairy-filled cheese and shredded chicken. It was tough, but I managed to stay true to the challenge and munched on vegan pizza squares.
Days 3-4
Janani: The third day of something new is always rough, and the not-so-vegan HUDS dessert was definitely tempting — Mississippi mud squares, anybody? Ellen was craving chicken, and, I’m not going to lie, I was too. We were basically eating beans for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But we stayed strong.
I introduced Ellen to Berg’s prized possession: the almond milk dispenser. No more having to give up coffee or cereal when you can drink all the almond milk you want. (Ellen tried the oat milk too, but it’s honestly a bit too watery.)
Days 5-7
Janani: It was the fifth day that we both experimented with the HUDS vegan muffins. Turns out, these are an absolute gift from the universe, aka the HUDS workers in Annenberg. It is a big shame the upperclassmen Houses don’t have vegan muffins because they are now the best part of our days. Sadly, HUDS only makes one batch of vegan muffins every day, so if you want to be a happy vegan, you have to wake up early.
Ellen: The last days were tough, but certainly much easier than before. Being vegan felt more natural, and I found myself going to the plant-based bar out of habit. The Square has a surprising number of vegan options, and on the last day, I treated myself to a Beyond Burger from Veggie Grill — an absolute delight!
Final thoughts from the Vegan: Honestly, I learned a lot this week, and I am a little sad about being a lonely vegan again tomorrow. It was really fun to have someone to vent to/appreciate the ups and downs of being vegan with, and I’m going to work on getting my other friends to try veganism too.
Final thoughts from the Non-Vegan: I really enjoyed being vegan! I learned so much about the plant-based diet from Janani, like possible protein sources (go seitan?) and the secret gem of HUDS: vegan muffins. The hardest part was not staying vegan at HUDS, but at the campus events stocked with loads of non-vegan treats like Insomnia and cheesy snacks. Something else surprising: my skin glowed after cutting out dairy, which was a definite bonus along with the environmental benefits of veganism.
I don’t know if I could do this full time, but I’m realizing that more and more restaurants and eating services are changing to accommodate plant-based diets, making veganism far more accessible. I never thought I would say this, but as a result of my lovely friend Janani and this experience, I’ve decided to go vegan four times a week — leaving just enough time to keep my chicken addiction satisfied.
