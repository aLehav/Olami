After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A review of the Harvard Athletics Department released Friday by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay found that while the Department provides a strong sense of community, many staff and student-athletes feel a sense of removal from FAS as a whole.
The study, commissioned by Gay last fall, found that the vast majority of student-athletes view their team experience and their coaches favorably. Still, athletes also reported significant time constraints, with just 41 percent of surveyed athletes saying they “have time to relax and unwind during the week.”
Just 40 percent of athletes said they feel they “get to take advantage of all the community experiences that Harvard has to offer.” Forty-five percent said they feel like they are active in their residential community.
“I found in their words compelling testimony of the unique power of sport to forge strong bonds and a deep sense of belonging, and about the valuable role of our coaches as mentors in their Harvard journeys,” Gay wrote to athletics affiliates. “Our students were equally candid about their struggles. They do not always feel well understood by their non-athlete peers or well supported in their efforts to integrate their athletic commitments with their academic passions and responsibilities.”
Athletics Department coaches and staff reported feeling a sense of purpose in their work. The vast majority of Athletics Department staff said their job gives them “a sense of meaning and purpose” and that they are “motivated to go beyond what is normally expected to help Harvard be successful.”
The report also found a disconnect between the Department and the rest of FAS, and it recommended strengthening DHA’s bonds with FAS and the College. Just 22 percent of DHA staff members said there is a “high level of collaboration and partnership between Harvard College’s faculty and staff and Harvard Athletics’ coaches and staff.” Less than half of staff members said they thought “athletics is considered an important part of the college experience at Harvard.”
“We need more opportunities for faculty, staff, coaches, and students to talk to each other about our priorities, our aspirations, and the barriers we confront in supporting our student-athletes,” Gay wrote. “This process is a first step to building stronger relationships among all those who are committed to the success of our students.”
Students and athletics staff both reported that professors do not always help students balance athletics and academics. Forty-one percent of student-athletes said their professors help them “balance my athletic interests and my academic responsibilities.” Just 33 percent of athletics staff members said they thought professors did a good job helping student-athletes do so.
The report made four recommendations, including that Harvard engage in “community building efforts that enhance students’ physical, mental, and social wellbeing.”
“We have a strong foundation to build on in our shared commitment to the success of our student-athletes, to the health and well-being of our students more broadly, and to Harvard,” Gay wrote. “I am excited to participate and to do my part to make those efforts successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Law School faculty published an open letter to students and Harvard affiliates Monday criticizing President Donald J. Trump for calling for a military response to ongoing protests against police brutality.
The letter received signatures from 160 faculty members, including former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha J. Power. It was reopened for signatures on June 2 after requests from additional Law School teaching faculty and law librarians.
The authors of the letter denounced a tweet posted by Trump on May 29 which included the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” in reference to nationwide protests following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. They argue the president’s language encourages violence by private citizens.
“By legitimating lawless action by public officials, the President’s tweet invites other individuals to take similarly destructive action,” the letter reads.
The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Law School professor Christine A. Desan, who worked on drafting the letter, said Trump’s tweet signified a commitment to using violence against citizens involved in the protest. She said she finds the message problematic since Trump speaks as the Commander in Chief of the Army.
“We don't under our Constitution live in a society where even if somebody is stealing something they get shot,” she said. “To have him pledge to use excessive state violence against people indiscriminately is really unlawful — deeply unlawful.”
The letter also states Trump borrowed the phrase in his tweet from former Miami police chief Walter E. Headley, who supported police brutality during the Civil Rights Era. Desan said that the phrase’s tie to a previous era of white-on-black violence demonstrates Trump intended to call for violent action against citizens.
Professor Kenneth W. Mack — who also authored the letter — echoed similar concerns about the historical interpretation of the phrase.
“It seems to be saying quite correctly that ‘if I sent in the military, they will act in a way that the segregationist sheriff promised he would act the 1960s, which is to shoot people as a deterrent, to deter from them from protesting,’” he said. “That would seem to breach the fundamental principles of democratic governance.”
The faculty wrote in the letter that the military holds a responsibility to protect civil order — a principle Trump would violate by using federal authority against protestors.
“There are rules for the deployment of the military,” Mack said. “We don't shoot people for protesting.”
Desan argued that by sending in the military, the President would exceed the authority of his office and breach his responsibility to minimize the force and use of the army.
“It's not Donald Trump's army,” she said. “The President can only use what force we've delegated, what authority we've delegated to him.”
Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic Director Deborah E. Anker, who signed the letter, noted the importance of the large number of faculty members who supported the letter.
“It is so important to highlight these actions of the President that are divisive, anti-democratic and encourage hatred and violence, including private violence,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
Devos also noted the rare and “striking” unity among the Law School faculty, a group commonly rife with ideological disagreements.
“It's a forceful message from a group of people who might not agree on much at all but agree that this conduct crossed a very profound and important line,” she said. “The fact that it reacted at this moment, I think, is a real message that deeply troubling conduct occurred.”
Mack said he hopes students who read the letter realize their professors aim to teach them how to act against injustice and defend the fundamental principles of the legal system, rather than simply teaching them the technical details of law.
“We're not just teaching our students tactical principles of law,” he said. “We are hopefully teaching and setting an example about how to be responsible citizens — lawyers specifically — in a democracy.”
He added that lawyers especially carry a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and speak out against injustice — a duty that motivated the group of faculty members to join together.
“The protests were set in motion by an act of lawlessness, and the President of United States has responded by promoting, recommending, and pledging to engage in further lawlessness,” he said. “That was the reason we felt the need to speak up.”
