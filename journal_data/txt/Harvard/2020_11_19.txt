After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you haven’t read August Wilson’s original play “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” and were hoping to get a taste of the upcoming movie adaptation while avoiding spoilers, the trailer is a bad place to begin. After two and a half minutes of bandmates standing idly and the occasional snippet of a blues performance, it is still unclear what this film, directed by Tony award-winner George C. Wolfe, is actually about. On the other hand, considering the plot of the play, the obscure nature of the trailer does make sense: It is not a spoiler to say that “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” consists entirely of four bandmates waiting for Ma Rainey to arrive at the recording studio. With only one setting — this studio in 1920s Chicago — Wilson reveals the conflict among the bandmates and with their producer solely through dialogue. Translating this limited plot into a full feature film is quite the ambition.
Nevertheless, the trailer reveals that Wolfe has taken a few creative liberties and inserted scenes in new locations. Expanding on Wilson’s brief play, the trailer includes multiple on-stage performances by Ma Rainey (played by Viola Davis) and stolen glances that suggest a budding romance between the trumpet player and one of the band’s dancers. It seems another theme Wolfe will explore further is the misogynoir experienced by Black women in the early 20th century. While Wilson’s play focuses entirely on Ma Rainey and the white producers who attempt to exploit her talent, the trailer suggests the film will delve into those power dynamics more broadly. For a brief moment, the trailer shows a factory full of Black women laboring over sewing machines as well the aforementioned dancer, a character Wolfe created, who seems to join Ma Rainey as one of the film’s few Black female leads. Given the current surge of interest in Black stories following a summer of intensified national reckoning with racial injustice, Wolfe’s exploration of misogynoir is timely.
“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” boasts an incredible cast, including the inimitable Viola Davis as Ma Rainey and the late Chadwick Boseman as Levee, the band’s trumpet player. Like other films released during the pandemic, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” will debut on Netflix on Dec. 18.

As Christmas slowly approaches, people are setting up décor, buying presents and — of course — waiting for a Christmas tale to brighten up the doom and gloom of this horrible year. On Nov. 9, Hulu released the trailer for its new original “Happiness Season,” written by Mary Holland and Clea DuVall, who also directed the film. At first glance, the trailer checks all the boxes for a traditional Christmas movie: seasonal joy signaled by melodic ringing bells, Christmas décor, winter snow, and family gatherings. Yet there is something slightly unconventional about this film. While holiday-themed romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, “Happiest Season” is the first Christmas rom-com from a major studio to center around a queer couple. Early in September, DuVall tweeted “All I ever wanted was a holiday movie that represented my experience”— and that’s exactly what she made. DuVall highlights her LGBTQ+ protagonists by celebrating, not mourning, the love story of Abby (Kristen Stewart) and her girlfriend Harper (Mackenzie Davis).
The trailer begins with a jovial whistling tune as Abby waxes poetic about how enamored she is with Harper and her plans to propose. But when the couple visits Harper’s family for Christmas, a caveat emerges — Harper has yet to come out to her conservative family. The trailer offers doses of comedic relief through teasers of this ordeal as Abby relays this premise to her gay best friend John (Dan Levy). When Abby asks John to be her “ex-boyfriend” to help preserve the lie that she is Harper’s straight, orphaned roommate, John exclaims, “Have they ever met a lesbian before?” Stewart imbues her character with a loving personality, and her comedic timing shines through as she interacts with Harper’s family — such as when she awkwardly stutters to cover up her relationship with Harper to Harper’s sister (Mary Holland). The trailer amplifies the cast’s comedic personas with light jokes and references. When Harper’s mother (Mary Steenburgen) catches Abby hiding from the family, she blatantly asks, “What are you doing in the closet?” Moreover, towards the climax of the trailer, the phrase “secrets will be coming out” is highlighted in another clever double entendre.The trailer for “Happiest Season” already contains some heartfelt moments of self-discovery. Towards the trailer’s end, Abby confronts Harper about how much it hurts to be hidden, only for Harper to tearfully reply,“I am hiding me. I am scared that if I tell them who I am, I will lose them.”
The trailer’s cheery seasonal atmosphere assures the viewer that this queer love story will be filled not with tragedy but rather with comfort, bliss, and happiness. Instead of a typical coming out story, Duvall universalizes the narrative as a heartwarming journey of meeting a partner’s family and seeking familial acceptance, with the pain of deep secrets and the power of uncovering our authentic selves to those that are truly special. ‘Tis the season for “Happiest Season” to become a modern Christmas classic!

Official broadcasters are no match for the genetic predisposition Black women carry for spilling tea. Usually, a piping hot development is best served with a low murmur, incomplete sentences, soft gasps, and a concoction of raised eyebrows, pursed lips, and judicious nodding. However, the announcement that Kamala Harris was officially the first Black woman to be elected Vice President required a bombastic rejoicing full of cathartic dancing and singing (and probably a little bit of cussing too).
After all, why not? It was a momentous day in United States history and an emotional day for Black women. One Donald Trump later, over 79 million people have chosen Vice President-elect Harris and begun an unforeseen chapter in the country’s story about Black women, our desirability, and our essentiality. Seeing a Black woman with both an assertive silk press and demeanor elevated to one of the highest positions in our country uplifts and validates Black femininity in a way that defies its historical rejection.
Like several notable Black American cultural figures before her, Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black university colloquially considered to be “The Mecca” for Black intellectual exploration and awakening. She knows the struggle of many Black college students attempting to maintain their academics while memorizing strolls for their Divine Nine probates, and she likely lets out an occasional high-pitched “Skee-wee” when she reunites with her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorors.
Kamala Harris’s win was not only an electoral victory, but also an illustration that unapologetic Black femininity and success do not have to be mutually exclusive — an empowering message in a world plagued by code switching and respectability politics.
Black girls deserve to relish in this moment and bask in the beauty of themselves because Harris’s victory was achieved largely by our design. Across multiple southern battleground states, female Black organizers played a decisive role in flipping key districts and dedicated their labor towards correcting an electoral system that traditionally has failed to protect us. By supporting the Biden-Harris ticket in the highest numbers of any race-gender demographic category, Black women proved once again that we'll always show up for America even though America has never shown up for us.
Despite securing victory, Black women must now navigate a difficult conflict of interests. While representation does provide us a source of validation, representation alone will not breed the institutional changes necessary to improve our conditions. Harris’ identity does not ensure that her actions while in office will reflect the commitment to change we want our girls to emulate. Holding a prestigious position within a flawed electoral system bears little virtue unless the Black women in power actively work to reconstruct and re-envision the oppressive systems that very few manage to persist through.
In the midst of our excitement about what electing a Black woman as Vice President symbolizes, we should not overlook that no matter who occupies the White House, the U.S.’ current institutions will never benefit the most marginalized.
During the Biden-Harris administration, there will likely be a decline in racist rhetoric and an increase in relief programs targeting student loan debt and health care, which will undoubtedly aid struggling minorities. However, Harris and Biden owe Black organizers and communities more than lip service and moderate policy initiatives. They may say Black Lives Matter, but does it matter if they do not believe in defunding the police or other initiatives to combat systemic racism? The Obama era taught us that it does not.
Throughout the tenure of our first Black president, Black people were protesting the exact same injustices as they are now during the Trump administration. Obama’s presence in the White House offered the Black communities that were his most vocal supporters very little reprieve from racist institutions. Yet Black America allowed the elation of his unprecedented victory to dissuade critical discourse.
We cannot repeat these mistakes. Neither Kamala’s Blackness nor her womanhood disqualifies her from falling complicit into an evil system, and we should refrain from sensationalizing her as Black “Girl Boss.” Feminism and representation lose their significance when the women making gains achieve their success through perpetuating harmful systems.
Black women in the U.S. must see past the joy we feel as U.S. citizens and think about our sisters in the Global South who are not inspired by Harris’s election. They know that historically, regardless of which party holds power, U.S. foreign policy will remain invasive and rooted in exploitation. We should be fighting against any elected official that maintains repressive structures, even when they wear pink and green, wrap their hair at night, and listen to Tupac.
Make no mistake, Black women are allowed to enjoy this moment. But we should not slip into complacency or let our celebration overshadow our consciousness. Some days, we will be proud to have Kamala Harris represent us in the White House. Other days, we will not. Every day, our feelings will be valid, requiring nuance and sensitivity.
Over the next four years, whether we are criticizing her actions or praising her accomplishments, Black women should pour into Kamala Harris like we pour into ourselves, our communities, and our country. We should never forget that progress is contingent on love. However, love always requires holding each other — even our first Black female Vice President — to the highest anti-imperialist, anti-inequality, and anti-racist standard.

It’s official: the end of the pandemic is on the horizon. After months of false starts and shaky optimism, Pfizer announced yesterday that they had developed a vaccine with 95 percent efficacy against COVID-19. With numerous competitors on the brink of their own vaccines, experts expect inoculations to begin as early as December, a bright capstone on one of the most chaotic years in memory.
After months of wildfires, murder hornets, and (no joke) dead people elected to office, the news of an effective vaccine was refreshingly positive. I don’t think I need to rehearse all the reasons 2020’s been so miserable — the list would outstrip my word limit, and there are already websites devoted to that. Instead, apropos of the vaccine, I think it’s a good moment to stop and reflect on just how lucky we are to live in a society with that kind of technological capability.
And I don’t just mean medical technology — though it’s worth noting that the 1918 influenza epidemic, largely owing to clinical deficiencies, had upwards of forty times COVID’s death toll so far. From the connectivity standpoint, we’ve won the cosmic lottery. For people in past major pandemics, iPhones and video chat were the stuff of science fiction. The technology that’s allowed nearly half the American labor force to work from home this year was essentially nonexistent. Zoom University would have been impossible. Even just 15 years ago, the pinnacle of instant entertainment was getting DVDs delivered to your mailbox. And while there’s plenty negative to be said about services like Amazon and Instacart, their networks have made it possible for millions of Americans to obtain groceries and other necessities from the safety of their homes.
In fact, even though the pandemic has significantly limited in-person interactions, it’s arguable that it’s also deepened relationships. With the ubiquity of Zoom and FaceTime, many are realizing just how easy it is to connect with people — and, in a time of crisis, how crucially important.
In my own life, the effect has been dramatic. Before the pandemic, I called home maybe a couple times a month, and despite having two sisters in the Boston area, we rarely made time to meet up. High school friends were rapidly fading from my life, even ones I kept in regular contact with early on in college. With the advent of the pandemic, it’s not all that surprising that these relationships would be rekindled: for those of us taking classes at home, the whole situation already feels like something of a high school bonus track. But the particular way they’ve returned has been striking. Not only did my sisters and I become closer during our shared time at home in the spring, but since their return to the northeast, we’ve instituted regular Zoom calls with our extended family, including relatives we barely spoke to previously. Some of the friends I’ve reconnected with are ones I haven’t seen in four years. And the few in-person meetups I’ve had have been invariably high-quality: owing to social distancing, there’s not much we can do besides talk, which is probably what we should have been doing all along.
All of this is anecdotal, of course. But there are countless other examples of the pandemic having a surprisingly salutary effect on social connectivity. Consider the country’s newfound appreciation for grocers, cashiers, and delivery people, jobs that used to garner little recognition but are now recognized as heroically necessary. Or the way neighborhoods in New York City spontaneously celebrated healthcare workers during the peak of the crisis, clapping and sounding noise makers every evening at 7 p.m. And despite the economic recession, most donors surveyed indicated that they plan to maintain or even increase their charitable giving in 2020.
What’s remarkable, I think, is that many of these activities were just as available before the pandemic as they are now. We didn’t lack the technology for family Zoom calls, or ample reason to appreciate workers in our community. But crises have a way of making people reevaluate what really matters to them. And when the crisis directly affects our ability to socialize, it’s perhaps unsurprising that we see people drawing closer to one another in response.
As we exit the alternate reality of the pandemic, there’s no question that the world we return to will be dramatically different from the one we left in 2019. Here’s to hoping that world will be a better one — and maybe a little more connected than before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a meeting of the Committee on Student Life last month, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said that the Dean of Students Office has tapped affiliates of the Harvard Graduate school of Education to produce a report on comp processes at the College.
In a year that has already physically separated students from the sites of their extracurricular activities — changing the nature of all and straining many — this institutional effort to evaluate comp processes is a worthy one. Some organizations have struggled in exile, and we hope the office’s review looks to care for communities that have languished in the new virtual norm. They’ll need rekindling when we return to Cambridge.
But only a few of the issues that plague comps materialized in March 2020. At their worst, comps can exacerbate some of the most toxic, regrettable aspects of Harvard’s culture.
Not all do, of course. Every comp is different. Some commendable organizations have painstakingly designed comps that are accessible and encouraging. Others, suffice it to say, have not. Taking stock of where comps stand on this spectrum and scrutinizing how we can improve them when we return to campus seems prudent. Some issues, however, seem obvious.
First, comps can be hyper-competitive by substantive metrics. Students who have competed with brilliant peers from around the world for a spot at Harvard arrive in Cambridge only to find that the doors that open for them in the next four years are largely a function of applications. They’re dropped into a world of organizations they must naively navigate, hoping to gain entry somewhere “good.” To us, this seems like the wrong message to send 1600 bright-eyed freshmen about the kind of community Harvard can offer them.
Second, these hyper-competitive comps end as planned: a few students get into their clubs of choice, while most don’t. Exclusivity is competition’s younger but close-following twin. Who ends up on the winning side of exclusivity is substantially related to who knew how to work the system upon arrival. Students with family connections to the College (take legacies) enter with a leg up on their peers when it comes to navigating and courting the who’s-who of the extracurricular scene. Students from low-income backgrounds and students of color disproportionately enter the college without those connects. This disparity in knowledge of Harvard’s inner, unspoken workings is among the most significant practical inequities that continues to divide students by class once they arrive in Harvard Yard. Exclusive comps, particularly social comps that make no substantive evaluation beyond personal compatibility, perpetuate this cycle of inequality.
Finally, exclusive comps can be academically limiting. If you’re rejected due to lack of skill from an organization that’s dedicated to the practice of an area you’re unfamiliar with, but are interested in learning about, how can you acquire those skills?
Perhaps some comps exist this way because it is beneficial to the organizations to maintain them as such. Not only do groups that thrive on a reputation for exclusivity get to claim social clout as a perk to prospective members — some use their abundant resources to lavish their small number of members with, frankly, unreal perks. On its website, the perennially exclusive Harvard College Consulting Groups boasts that it took members to see Kelly Clarkson and Logic live in concert and hosted a party in a castle. Is this what the “non-profit” is accepting so few applicants for?
There is another way. Educational comps don’t cut students, choosing instead to teach skills that equip them with the tools they need to be effective members of their organizations. These can be lengthy, and may be no less difficult than exclusive comps, but they send the right kind of message to new students about their place in our community: You may have to work hard and learn fast, but with demonstrated commitment, there’s no extracurricular that will refuse you. To be sure, not everybody who comps a completion-comp organization will choose to stick around or win the trust of their peers to rise up through the ranks upon arrival, but such comps at baseline emphasize that everyone is welcome, and that everyone will be given a chance to learn and apply themselves. Such processes — at their best — serve not the organizations that run them, but the generations of students who learn from them and the world that hopefully benefits from the things they learned.
In the end, isn’t that who the comp is for?

Over the past seven months, Massachusetts residents have relaxed their adherence to COVID-19 prevention guidelines, according to a new survey conducted by researchers from Harvard, Northeastern, Northwestern, and Rutgers.
The report — published Nov. 13 and titled “The Trajectory of Health-Related Behaviors in Massachusetts” — analyzed survey data to characterize how individual behavior has changed in the state over the course of the pandemic.
Overall, the survey showed a “substantial relaxation of many of the behaviors that helped slow the spread of the disease in the spring.” Such behaviors include avoiding public and crowded spaces, frequent hand washing and disinfecting, and limiting contact with non-household members.
The survey also showed that people have increased participation in activities outside of their homes, such as going to restaurants and bars, exercising at gyms, and visiting friends.
In April and May, for example, the number of respondents who reported activities like spending time in close proximity to non-household members and going to restaurants in the past 24 hours was low, at 22 and 5 percent, respectively. By October, those figures had doubled and tripled, to 45 percent and 15 percent.
Matthew A. Baum, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and a researcher on the team, said the findings “disappointed him.”
“But I wouldn't say it's surprising,” he said. “It's really hard for people to stay on their guard for a really, really long period of time. It's exhausting.”
Mask-wearing is the only exception to the trend, having increased in Massachusetts since April. In October, 80 percent of respondents reported wearing a mask outside of the home, “among the highest levels of adherence anywhere in the country,” per the report.
The report on Massachusetts is the 24th in a series of research reports — launched in March and entitled “The State of the Nation: A 50-State COVID-19 Survey” — that aims to find links between social behavior and COVID-19 transmission in every state.
“There was basically an almost complete lack of information around the country as to where the emerging hotspots were and how the virus spread,” Baum said.
Though Baum said the series of reports isn’t a true substitute for epidemiological data on virus transmission, he and fellow researchers thought “it might be the next best thing.”
Mauricio Santillana, another member of the team and a professor at Harvard Medical School, acknowledged that the desire to congregate and the tendency to become fatigued after months of isolation are natural.
“We love congregating, and we'll do our best to do it, and that's part of humanity,” Santillana said. “Unfortunately, in this crisis, that will play against us.”
David M. J. Lazer, a professor at Northeastern University and first author of the report, said the team also hopes to study how colder temperatures will affect social distancing behaviors and virus transmission rates this winter.
“Tracking both the behaviors and attitudes around this will be important as we go through the winter, because part of the problem we're confronting is that we can't do the things we could do in summer,” Lazer said. “So how do people react to the constraints the environment — like the climate — is putting on us?”
Though there may be new challenges this winter — like spending the holidays away from family and increasing mental health concerns — researchers said they hope to encourage Americans to stay vigilant about adhering to public health guidelines.
“Preventable deaths may happen because of our fatigue, and so we’re trying to encourage people to not give up too soon,” Santillana said.

Jorge G. Ramos and Maria L. Hinojosa, celebrated Mexican-American journalists for Univision and National Public Radio, respectively, discussed the future of Latinx leadership in the United States and the evolving nature of the American Dream in a virtual talk hosted by the Institute of Politics Wednesday.
Moderated by Ramos’ daughter Paola Ramos, a correspondent for Vice News and a Kennedy School graduate, the talk centered on the role of journalists in the age of President Donald J. Trump and the promise of emerging young leaders in the Latinx community.
Hinojosa said she views the American Dream with skepticism, citing Trump’s challenges to the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.
“The American Dream nightmare, the nightmare that we are living through right now, with a president — do we use that term — who fails to recognize an election. ¿Qué es eso?” Hinojosa said. “The country that my family left, which was a Mexico that Jorge knows so well, which is an anti-democratic Mexico at that time, and they go to a country that is supposedly a democracy, but the democracy is being tested there.”
Ramos disagreed, contrasting his freedom as a journalist in the U.S. with the censorship of the press he experienced in Mexico.
“I had to leave Mexico because of censorship, and then when I first arrived in the United States in 1983, everybody was criticizing Ronald Reagan. And then I realized, well, this is the country where I want to live,” Ramos said. “I criticized, as you know, Donald Trump right from the beginning, and nothing happened. I can go to the supermarket, I take a bike ride, and nobody is here waiting for me to kill me or to censor me.”
Ramos said journalists must “report reality” and always challenge those in power, referencing Trump's hostility toward him as evidence of this special responsibility.
“I still remember it was August 2015 when a candidate called Donald Trump ejected me from a press conference with a bodyguard,” Ramos said. “And we said ‘Be very careful, this is against democracy, this is against freedom of expression, this is against freedom of the press,’ and nobody paid attention.”
“The only other person who used a bodyguard to prevent me from asking questions was Fidel Castro of Cuba,” Ramos said in an interview following the seminar.
Of his encounter with Trump, Ramos said, “Nobody listened, and I wonder why. I wonder if it was simply because I was a Latino journalist.”
Hinojosa said she agreed that journalists have a crucial role in holding power to account.
“Our job is to hold the powerful accountable, and we won't be quiet,” Hinojosa said, “and that's why people either love us or hate us.”
As the conversation returned to the subject of the American Dream, Ramos and Hinojosa expressed hope for the next generation of Latinx leaders in America.
“The fact that Sonia Sotomayor was possible gives me the idea that yes, [the American Dream] is still alive,” Ramos said. “For many, many years, I think we were looking for the next Cesar Chavez or for the next Sonia Sotomayor, and I think now we have learned that it is not one person, another leader, that we're looking for, but thousands of them.”
Hinojosa said she was “more circumspect” about the achievability of the American Dream, stressing that it must be made clear that “the streets are not paved with gold.” She compared it to a marriage. “You have to work at it,” Hinojosa said. “You just really, really have to work at it.”
Karen E. Torres ’24, a first-generation Latina student who attended the seminar, wrote in an email she was inspired by the speakers’ optimism for the future of the Latinx community.
“Jorge, Maria, and Paola are incredible and powerful Latinos whose work has been instrumental in making me into who I am today,” Torres wrote. “To hear all three of them tell me that I am the future is a moment I will never forget.”

Several Harvard Law School professors and affiliates have agreed to assist President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s transition to the White House as members of agency review teams, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's transition team announced Tuesday.
The teams will spend the upcoming months learning the operations of each governmental agency to ensure a smooth transition on Inauguration Day. The Biden-Harris transition team aimed to recruit “talented professionals” with experience in numerous policy areas, according to its website.
“The teams have been crafted to ensure they not only reflect the values and priorities of the incoming administration, but reflect the diversity of perspectives crucial for addressing America’s most urgent and complex challenges,” the website reads.
Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus will serve as a volunteer on the Department of Justice team. This team is also responsible for reviewing eight other agencies, including the Federal Election Commission, the Commission on Civil Rights, and the National Council on Disability.
Lazarus currently teaches courses on torts and environmental law. He has brought 40 cases before the United States Supreme Court, respresenting the United States, state and local governments, and environmental groups.
Lazarus also served as the Executive Director of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling Commission, a group tasked with investigating the causes of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Mark Wu ’95 — Vice Dean for the Graduate Program and International Legal Studies at the Law School — will volunteer with the team focusing on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. International Trade Commission, and the U.S. Trade and Development agency.
Prior to entering academia, Wu worked as an economist at the World Bank in China and as the Director for Intellectual Property in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. He currently serves on the Advisory Board of the World Trade Organization Chairs Programme, a body dedicated to fostering understanding of the trading system among academics and policymakers in developing countries.
Wu, who also serves as the Faculty Co-Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, is the only faculty member to have received both the HLS Student Government Teaching and Advising Award and the Sacks-Freund Award for Teaching Excellence.
Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor Robert T. Anderson will volunteer with the Department of the Interior team. The team will also review seven other commissions, including the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Commission on Fine Arts. Anderson has served as a visiting professor at the Law School since 2010 and a professor at the University of Washington School of Law since 2001. Previously, he served as associate solicitor for Indian Affairs in the U.S. Department of the Interior, as well as counselor to Secretary of the Interior Bruce E. Babbitt and co-lead of the Department of the Interior team during President Barack H. Obama’s transition to the White House. Anderson is also a co-author and Executive Editorial Board member of “Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law.”
Executive Director Joseph Goffman and Guest Fellow Cynthia J. Giles of HLS’s Environmental & Energy Law Program will both serve as volunteers on the Environmental Protection Agency team, which will also review the Chemical Safety Board.
Current and former Harvard spokespeople — including Jonathan L. Swain, Senior Director of Media Relations and Communications for the University — and Harvard Medical School professor Atul Gawande also joined Biden's transition team. Swain will lead the Small Business Administration team, and Gawande will serve as a member of the Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board.

An open letter calling on Harvard to develop “accountability guidelines” for inviting former members of President Donald J. Trump’s administration to campus as professors, fellows, or speakers circulated online this week, sparking outrage from some who have ties both to Harvard and to Trump.
The letter condemns Trump and his associates for having “trampled norms of free and fair elections and peaceful transfer of power” and exhibiting “a complete disregard for the truth.”
“We worry that in following tradition and inviting members of the Trump administration to Harvard, the school would be legitimizing this subversion of democratic principles,” it reads. “That is why today we are asking you to set up a system of accountability for high-level political appointees and Trump administration consultants before they are invited as fellows or to teach or speak on campus.”
The letter requests that Harvard share such guidelines with students before the end of 2020. It also asks the University to “fully vet speakers for their role in undermining these commitments and hold them fully accountable for that complicity.”
“The Institute of Politics at HKS, or any other center, has the responsibility to boldly confront Trump administration alumni invited to speak at Harvard about their collaboration or passive acceptance of this attack on truth and fundamental democratic principles — or not invite them to speak at all,” the letter reads.
Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics has previously invited individuals who served in the Trump administration to campus.
In fall 2017, the Institute hosted former Press Secretary Sean M. Spicer as a visiting fellow. Spicer participated in 11 off-the-record events at the time, and returned to speak at another off-the-record event in April 2018.
The IOP also hosted Gary D. Cohn, who served as director of Trump’s National Economic Council between January 2017 and March 2018, as a fellow in spring 2019.
It remains unclear who started the open letter, or how many affiliates have signed onto it.
Marisa J. Borreggine, the vice president of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, wrote that the union agrees with the petition’s aim to “stand for democratic principles and not hire any outgoing Trump officials.”
“It would be disappointing and disheartening for an institution like Harvard that is meant to uphold these principles to hire officials from a blatantly anti-democratic, anti-science, and anti-labor administration,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
So far, the University has stayed quiet on the issue. Its spokesperson, Jason A. Newton, said “the University is aware of this student petition,” but had no further comment. James F. Smith, a spokesperson for the Kennedy School, also declined to comment.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh M. McEnany, a graduate of Harvard Law School, urged Harvard to reject the petition, according to a tweet from Fox Business reporter Lydia Moynihan.
“I hope the school administrators rebukes [sic] this movement,” McEnany said, per the tweet. “Academic communities should be bastions of free speech. I will happily walk back on campus and challenge this.”
The open letter claims its signatories are “fully committed to free speech and debate of difficult subjects — especially the damage being done to democratic governance around the world.”
“We do not believe, however, that individuals who engage in this behavior should be legitimized or rewarded by the university,” the letter reads. “An institution dedicated to the fostering of good democratic government should remain apart from those who were willing to bring it down for their own benefit.”
Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, who represented Trump in his impeachment trial, also spoke out against the open letter.
“Will I be banned from speaking at Harvard?” he wrote on Twitter.
In an interview with The Crimson, Dershowitz said the open letter is “a terrible idea.”
“A university can't pick sides, Republican or Democrat, or Trump or Biden. A university must remain politically neutral,” he said. “The idea that having people express different views from the consensus on the university, is somehow going to corrupt and destroy the university, is pure McCarthyism.”
Dershowitz also said that if the University enacted the policies the open letter advocates, he will challenge them under civil rights law.
“If it comes into being I will challenge it,” he said. “I will represent, pro bono, students and faculty and potential faculty, who are victimized by this McCarthyism.”
“My only regret in having retired from Harvard after 50 years is not being there to stand up to these student bullies,” Dershowitz added.
Paul Musgrave — a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst — took to Twitter on Nov. 7 to call on “prestigious public policy schools to do an open letter, right now, today stating that they object to hiring Trump officials.”
In an interview with The Crimson, he defended the open letter.
“It is a call for the Harvard administration to publish transparent accountability standards about why and how some people will be given the opportunity to come to Cambridge, and why others won't. That is a minimal demand,” he said.
Musgrave said he himself is concerned about the role of public policy schools as “white-washing facilities” for people's reputations, and emphasized that Harvard “sets precedents for how other institutions will act.”
“The Trump administration has not just had bad policies or bad response to COVID,” he said. “It has specifically attacked ideals of democratic integrity and academic freedom that institutions like Harvard claim to respect above all else. If Harvard's motto really is ‘Veritas,’ then how can you take people from an administration that has undermined truth at every turn?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cherokee Nation citizen Kimberly Teehee, the first delegate of a Native American tribal nation appointed to Congress, spoke on the significance of her appointment and her advocacy for tribal nations at a virtual event hosted by the Harvard Institute of Politics Wednesday.
Teehee’s unanimous confirmation this August fulfills a clause outlined in the Treaty of New Echota between tribal leaders and U.S. commissioners in 1835, which gave the Cherokee Nation the right to send a delegate to the House of Representatives. Andrew Lee, the moderator of the event and a Seneca Indian affiliated with the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, opened the conversation by underscoring the treaty's significance.
“In a nutshell, treaties matter,” he said. “The Cherokee Nation is using its treaty rights enshrined in 1835 to exercise its sovereignty in government relations.”
Teehee explained that although her position in Congress is similar to that of delegates from U.S. territories, understanding her appointment requires historical context. She outlined what she described as the egregious treatment of Native Americans that resulted from the Treaty of New Echota, such as the loss of their homeland and the displacement of tens of thousands of Native Americans.
“You’ve got to understand all the bad things that the courts and Congress and U.S. policy did to dismantle a nation, and then appreciate the rebuilding that it took up until now,” she said.
This rebuilding is an ongoing process: Both Teehee and Lee outlined the various policies of the Cherokee Nation’s “era of self-determination and self-governance.” Teehee explained that Native American tribes have repeatedly shown they are most successful when given adequate resources to make independent decisions.
She described how she partnered with Oklahoma State University to establish the first medical school on a reservation — a breakthrough policy for a rural community suffering from a lack of doctors.
The speakers also discussed the Cherokee Nation’s success in controlling COVID-19 compared to the pandemic’s overwhelming devastation of the Native American population. Teehee described their policies, which included a mask mandate, rapid testing, travel restrictions, and readily available PPE. She also noted that Congress failed to include the Cherokee Nation — the largest U.S. tribal health system — in the first stimulus relief package.
In addition, the nation has worked with local restaurants and the USDA to serve nearly 6.1 million meals to citizens – particularly schoolchildren – since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Teehee. They are also building a meat processing center to combat rising meat prices.
Still, Teehee called for the federal government to free up capital to meet the needs of Native American Nations.
“It all relates to funding,” she said. “I think that Indian Country deserve to have funding be mandatory funding, the way social security is mandatorily funded, the way the food stamp program is mandatorily funded – we don’t have something similar.”
Teehee said she is looking forward to working under the Biden presidency, especially as a former senior policy advisor for Native American affairs under the Obama-Biden administration.
“[Obama] set the bar, and I feel like there’s opportunity for Biden to go farther,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Donald J. Trump’s recent lawsuits alleging election fraud are drawing criticism from members of the Harvard Law School faculty, who say the lawsuits lack evidence and present a danger to democracy.
Since the Nov. 3 election, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party have filed more than 20 lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and Michigan. The lawsuits introduce challenges such as whether mail-in ballots were properly authenticated and whether poll observers were allowed sufficient access to the counting process. Many of the claims have been withdrawn or rejected.
Law School Professor Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos ’01 said Trump’s claims have largely failed to produce proof of widespread or nefarious election fraud.
“There's nothing inherently legitimate about filing these lawsuits,” he said. “There's simply no evidence to support the allegations of fraud, non-compliance with state law, faulty software or glitches, etc.”
Stephanopoulos also said the lawsuits would not alter the results of the presidential election even they all proved successful because they do not challenge a large enough number of ballots. He noted that the 2020 election saw a much wider margin of victory than the 2000 election, where roughly 500 Florida votes stood between the candidates.
“Here the differences in votes are in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, whereas all of Trump’s lawsuits are small-bore, small potatoes claims that don't remove the effect of that many ballots,” Stephanopoulos said.
Professor Emeritus Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said he is similarly concerned about the lack of evidence behind the lawsuits.
“A fair number of lawsuits are frivolous, in the quite technical sense that it would [be] appropriate for a judge to impose sanctions such as fines on the [lawyers] who filed them,” he wrote in an email.
“Essentially all of the remainder are insubstantial, either because the lawyers haven't produced even the barest set of facts to support assertions of fraud or because, no matter what the facts turn out to be, the effect on the vote count is too small to affect the results,” Tushnet added.
Constitutional law Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe ’62 shared criticisms of the president and his lawsuits on Twitter, referring to the lawsuits as “BS dressed up as legalese” Friday. Tribe also claimed the attempts to challenge thousands of ballots could suggest a danger to the smooth transition of power.
“The concerted effort to negate the clear and convincing Biden victory this November 3 is bound to fail on its own terms but is increasingly looking like a Trojan Horse within which something sinister dwells,” he wrote in a Nov. 11 tweet.
Stephanopoulos also said he thinks Trump’s decision to launch litigation without sufficient evidence demonstrates “bad faith” and threatens the democratic principle that each side is willing to concede the election if they lose. He said his concerns surrounding the lawsuits extend beyond simply their legitimacy and evidence.
“It's also the bigger question of does the Trump campaign and do the Republicans who are endorsing the Trump campaign’s tactics really believe in democracy and transition of power when voters have chosen to vote out the guys in power?” he said. “I’m not so sure right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Forward, a student and alumni group working to end climate change and increase recent alumni representation within Harvard’s governance boards, announced the launch of their 2021 campaign in an email to supporters Tuesday.
Their 2021 slate includes three candidates: Yvette Efevbera, a global health specialist and a graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health; Megan Red Shirt-Shaw, an education activist and graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education; and Natalie Unterstell, a climate change policy expert and graduate of Harvard Kennedy School.
A Candidate Selection Committee composed of students, faculty and staff chose the three new candidates.
“Our 2021 candidates were chosen by a Candidate Selection Committee that included not only Harvard alumni but also students, faculty, and former staff members – groups that are just as much part of the Harvard community but are ineligible to participate in the election,” their website reads.
Harvard Forward launched in October 2019 with a slate of five candidates. Since the start of their inaugural campaign, the group has kept up an active social media presence.
Three of the five candidates they put forward in the 2020 Board of Overseers election — Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Jayson U. Toweh, and Dorothy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08 — were elected to serve on the Board.
Divestment activists who had spent years working to make their case with Harvard’s administration praised the election results. Changes that came after the election, however, have made it more difficult for petition candidates to win seats on the Board of Overseers.
Nearly three weeks after the results, Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72 and R. Martin Chávez ’85, the president of the Board of Overseers, announced that no more than six petition candidates may be elected as Overseers at any given time.
The report was completed on July 31 — ahead of the election results — but Strasburger and Crenier alleged that the change in policy was “in response” to their victory at the time and wrote that they were “alarmed” by the policy change.
The Board of Overseers is made up of 30 members elected in slates of five to serve six-year terms. Under the new rules, a maximum of three members who are nominated by petition may be elected to serve in the next five years. The other 24 members must be elected to the board after receiving a nomination from the Harvard Alumni Association’s Nominating Committee.
This year, the petition process is entirely online. Last year, Harvard Forward organizers worked to attain the necessary signatures to put their candidates on the ballot.
University Spokesperson Christopher A. Hennessy confirmed in an email to The Crimson that while the petition process is entirely online, voting, which has not yet kicked off, will be available online or by paper ballot.

Harvard has made its way to potentially one of the biggest events of reality TV via the iconic Harvard alum Bennett A. Jordan ’07. From his relatable sentiments to dropping the Harvard “H-Bomb” and dealing the roast of the year, we can all agree Bennett deserves every rose from here on out.
Jordan, Bennett Jordan
Agent 007 arguably made the best introduction of the season stepping out of a Rolls Royce and rocking a classic Connery look. Bennett was the talk of the mansion… or hotel... after this intro, manifesting the dream entrance we all wish we had.
Bounding Bennett
With his “antelope” like stride, Bennett emulates graceful and sophisticated country club vibes. If only I looked as great running to get the last toilet paper at Costco, or running from tourists in the Yard.
Burn Bennett Burn
Dale vs. Bennett. The matchup of the century, perhaps more notable than Team Edward vs. Team Jacob and surely more notable than that Batman vs. Superman movie. This matchup brings as much passion from Bachelor Nation fans as students have during Harvard-Yale!
The At Home Spa King
Sporting an iconic bathrobe and with dirty martini in hand, Bennett is all of us trying to have a self care day mid-quarantine. Who knew “just having my evening spa water” would be the quote from this season living rent free in my brain. Also, we all know he should have been on the spa date, smh.
The Devil Wears… Bennett?
From the minute we saw Bennett in his scarf we knew he had impeccable fashion sense, but his shoe collection is something else. So. Many. Loafers. But as we all know “There’s only seven days in the week, gotta mix it up!” And those bright blue loafers are really mixing it up!
Brainy Bennett
Did Bennett actualize all of our quarantine self improvement goals by “Brushing up on some light reading… on emotional intelligence?” Yes. Did we all swerve and binge Tiger King, perfect our Animal Crossing island, and try and bake sourdough but end up with what surely could be used as a brick instead? Also yes.
 Despite a truly wild season (bye Claire & Dale!) Bennett has definitely proven himself the shining star. Here’s hoping the rest of his time with Tayshia is just as iconic!
