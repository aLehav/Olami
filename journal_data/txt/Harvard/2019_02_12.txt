After a five year wait, screenwriting duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller have delivered “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” a worthy sequel that is wonderfully meta, colorful, and fun for all. Since the 2014 original hit, life for the wholesome, ever-cheery Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), resident badass Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), and perpetually broody Batman (Will Arnett) has become decidedly “not awesome.” Their homeland has been turned into a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and Lego Duplo creatures, however innocent and friendly they may seem, begin to attack and eventually capture Emmet’s pals. Launched headfirst into another high-action, comedic adventure, Emmet must travel to the distant “Systar System” to save his friends and the world as he knows it from being dumped into the void known as the “Bin of Storage.”
At its surface, nothing about this movie’s plot screams originality — it is quite similar to its predecessor, except that the threat of being frozen by a Krazy Glue-wielding Lord Business (Will Ferrell) has been replaced by the threat of being thrown into a dark plastic bin forever. What makes “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” so enjoyable, however, is how hilariously self-referential it is. Of course, this children’s movie doesn’t have any fourth wall breaks à la Austin Powers, but its willingness to constantly acknowledge that it is a Hollywood movie full of famous actors with familiar reputations allows for some brilliant laughs. Trying to top the original film’s trademark hit, “Everything is Awesome,” is certainly challenging, but instead of trying to come up with a new optimistic catchphrase and groundbreaking melody, songwriter Jonathan Lajoie landed on “Catchy Song.” With the repetitive lyric “This song’s gonna get stuck inside your head,” the tune certainly delivers on its promise — the swarms of children shout-singing it as they walked out of the theater is proof enough. Since the new installment is chock-full of other memorable but borderline annoying songs, Lucy acts as a mouthpiece for many parents in the audience dragged to the showing by their children when she huffs, “Are we in a musical?”
One of the most meta but also most delightful parts of the entire movie was probably the not-too-subtle wink at Chris Pratt and his transformation from lovable comic with a “dad bod” into an action hero hunk. On his way to the Systar System, Emmet runs into Rex Dangervest, a rougher, tougher Lego figurine who is also voiced by Chris Pratt. Pratt commands a barely recognizable husky voice as Dangervest, and explains his backstory as a space superhero, raptor trainer, and someone who used to have a lot of baby fat that he has since lost. It’s reassuring that Pratt has remained humble enough in his quick rise to A-lister fame and has a good enough sense of humor to laugh at himself in this manic joyride of a film.
With all its energy and goofiness, “The Lego Movie 2” is a masterclass in how to make a great family movie that appeals to both the young and the old. It has plenty of bright colors, musical numbers, and slapstick humor to keep kids entertained and giggling. The visual effects are just as engaging and impressive as they were in the first film, and the animators even upped the ante with Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (Tiffany Haddish) whose shapeshifting, amorphous look must have been a pain to animate in Lego form.
Yet the film fails to live up to its predecessor, namely because all of the gang’s adventures are just the result of a real life boy Finn (Jadon Sand) and his sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince) fighting over their toys. While this twist made the entertaining “The Lego Movie” more endearing and complete, it only makes the plot more convoluted and existentially terrifying this time around. At the start of the sequel, this concept still matched well with the storyline as an older, angstier Finn switched out his childish Lego set for the edgier, apocalyptic desert one, and his sister stole some of his toys to add to her pink, glittery one upstairs. It is the point in the movie where Emmet and Rex Dangervest are able to truly move on their own — presumably by sheer force of will, though the movie never makes it clear — where the movie begins to contradict itself. The inconsistent role of humans in these figurines’ lives raises a lot of logistical questions that never get resolved. How sentient are these little figurines? Why do they only occasionally realize their being manipulated by humans? What would happen if humans ever saw them move? While “Toy Story” made us think twice about our toys when we left the room, “The Lego Movie 2” makes us wonder whether the ones at the bottom of the pile in that cardboard box in the attic are paralyzed in tortuous darkness. A younger audience probably wouldn’t dwell on such concerns unless they rewatch the movie later in life, though these dark unresolved questions are unusually off-putting for such an upbeat movie.
Basing a movie almost purely on timely pop culture references is always a risky endeavor. Rather than trying to rein in nonstop shout-outs to our current culture in order to produce something timeless, Lord and Miller have fully and shamelessly embraced the pop culture material. Of course, this film won’t age like a fine wine or be scrutinized in pretentious film classes for generations. But that’s not the point. No matter what the future holds for this film, in 2019, where pop-culture is only a Google search away, “The Lego Movie 2” makes for a cheerful two hours and a great way to kick off any weekend.

Underdog stories are nothing novel in the classic realm of sports flicks (take “Rudy,” or “Remember The Titans”). Nor are sports films that weave an ambitious athlete’s endeavors with a family narrative (“Rudy” again, really, and “The Blind Side”). But when done well, they’re a pleasure to watch. That’s exactly what “Fighting With My Family” is. Based on the real story of wrestler Saraya “Paige” Bevis (Florence Pugh), the film follows a small, punky girl from a family of wrestlers in northern Britain as she earns a contested spot in World Wrestling Entertainment. Her brother Zak (Jack Lowden), however, doesn’t make the cut, and Paige is off to America alone. The plot follows Paige as she fights more for her family than with her family, striving for what they had all dreamed of but had never gotten before: a chance to prove themselves. Stephen Merchant both directs and writes the script for the film, and his sometimes-corny jokes mostly invoke a few laughs, and at other times fall cringingly flat. At crucial moments, Paige’s family is the one that pushes her on, and Merchant emphasizes that point. But for most of the film, when she’s training in Florida, it’s not the presence of her family, but rather the lack thereof, that both pushes her and also (almost) breaks her.
Pugh’s tough but not invincible portrayal of Paige seems effortless, such that it’s almost hard to believe that she’s not Paige in real life. The grunge is there, and so are desire and pain. It’s unclear why Paige wants to be a professional wrestler so badly — but Pugh makes her seem determined, and it’s convincing. One would hope that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who plays himself in the film and who supposedly comes from a similar wrestling family background as Paige, would pay her more sincere sympathy or dispense better advice. But instead, he’s mostly full of himself, a borderline jerk. His sparing words to Paige and Zak don’t even pass as tough love, but they still idolize him.
Though The Rock is at all disappointing, Vince Vaughn makes up for his lackluster performance in the film. Playing Hutch, the coach of NXT, the “Next Generation” of WWE, Vaughn is sometimes antagonistic, but cut in the realistic, tough love kind of way that the best coaches are. He can both be easy to hate and easy to love, depending on what the workout of the day is. He doesn’t accept Zak into the program, which, of course, causes tension between the siblings, but then reveals that he’s really doing it with Zak’s best interests in his heart. And Vaughn makes his tough love believable. With a girlfriend, a new baby, and good-but-not-Dwayne-Johnson wrestling skills, Zak isn’t going to find what he’s really looking for in the WWE, and Hutch knows it even if Zak himself doesn’t.
The fact that Paige is the only girl picked from her try-out in Britain raises hopes that the film will highlight the gender imbalance in the field. But “Fighting With My Family” is no “A League of Their Own.” Merchant doesn’t really explore the difficulty of being an elite female athlete in the WWE. Instead, he unfortunately brings out the cattiness of women who compete against each other. Paige forms an easy and early animosity towards most of the other women on the NXT team: After a tense wrestling session, spurred on by her mother’s well-intentioned but malformed advice, she reductively perceives the ex-models and dancers on the team as “just tits and ass.” The bonding and team-tagging they go through later is pleasant, but a bit forced and not particularly heartwarming, especially given their former (and needless, on Merchant’s part) animosity.
At once, “Fighting With My Family” is a coming-of-age story and an underdog story. The fact that there’s a happy ending is not a spoiler, really. Right from the start the film doesn’t seem like it will end tragically, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Although the film’s tropes are tried and true, and none are particularly pushed in any groundbreaking direction, it’s a touching feel-good story, packaged neatly with a pretty tied bow on top. It could even earn a spot in the classic Friday night family repertoire.
The film made its international debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 28 and will be publicly released in the U.S. on Feb. 14.

Hasty Pudding Institute Chairman Andrew L. Farkas ’82 had to stop his introduction for the Pudding’s 2019 Man of the Year celebration within minutes of beginning his talk. After introducing Milo Ventimiglia, the Pudding event’s honoree this year, Farkas mentioned the unprecedented co-ed casting of the Pudding’s 2019 musical — and the crowd burst into a long round of cheers.
“I’m done,” Farkas said after the applause died down, throwing up his hands and smiling.
Friday marked both the debut of the Pudding’s historic 2019 show — “France! France! Revolution” — and the 53rd round of their Man of the Year festivities. Ventimiglia is known for his current role as Jack Pearson in the NBC drama “This is Us.” He has previously acted on “Gilmore Girls,” “Heroes,” and “American Dreams.”
In both the roast’s opening remarks and in the press release after the celebration, Ventimiglia and the Pudding members mentioned the Pudding’s newly-complete gender inclusivity. Three of the six women cast in “France! France! Revolution” took part in the Man of the Year celebration’s annual celebrity roast, lead by Pudding producers Elizabeth C. Mann ’20 and Mariana C. Sanchez ’20.
In the roast itself, Mann and Sanchez made fun of Ventimiglia’s name, his acting career, and his “Sexiest Vegetarian Alive” title (bestowed on him by PETA). Ventimiglia sang Fergie’s “Big Girls Don’t Cry” — a nod to his role in the music video — and rapped the theme song from “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” When Ventimiglia gave a lap dance to Pudding cast member Eric J. Cheng ’20, Cheng made a joke about Ventimiglia’s mother watching from the audience.
“It was so hilarious — and definitely unexpected!” Cheng wrote in a later email. “I liked that he played along; it was fun, funny, and very sexy!”
In the press release afterwards, Ventimiglia spoke to both the historical nature of the Pudding’s show and to his own role as Man of the Year honoree.
“It’s absolutely the right thing to do,” Ventimiglia said of including women in the Pudding cast. “It’s the greatest thing to do, because the heart of an artist isn’t only in one type of person, one way of being. It’s really in all of us.”
Ventimiglia also talked about his mother — who, according to the actor, was fine with watching her son’s lap dance.
“My mom was more than excited,” Ventimiglia said. “I barely got the word ‘Hasty’ out and she knew ‘pudding.’”
After discussing his production experience and his upcoming projects, Ventimiglia ended with his thoughts on his current role as the father in “This is Us.”
“I think people want to feel good, even in pain and sadness. I think people want to know that there’s a community of family, the one that you’re born with or the one that you find or create yourself,” Ventimiglia said.
“It’s a gratifying thing when I as an artist know that the work that I’m a part of is creating positivity.”

Seventeen-year-old indie-pop singer-songwriter Billie Eilish released a new single, “bury a friend,” to be featured on her upcoming album “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?” The single is very much in the vein of her recent songs “you should see me in a crown” and "when the party's over" due to their shared gothic sound and beat-heavy production. The L.A. native’s new song relies on tried and tested methods — heavy on synth melodies, voice modulations, and layered vocals — yet distinguishes itself through its much faster, more upbeat tempo and powerfully disturbing lyrics.
The beginning of the song sets the fast pace, with collaborator and rapper Crooks announcing Eilish’s name in a booming voice. The songs jumps pretty quickly into the first verses. The lyrics themselves are rather sparse and ambiguous, but unveil themselves to be a monologue told from the perspective of a persecuted or ostracized speaker — perhaps a monster hiding under the bed who does not quite understand the fear they inspire, as Eilish herself has suggested. But in fact, the song is more ironically concerned with teasing out the tormented thoughts of the creature: “Why do you care for me? / When we all fall asleep, where do we go?” At its heart, this is a nightmare brought to life.
Overall, the dark lyrics and strange phrases stir feelings of dread and sublimity that beg to be unpacked. There is much rumination on mortality, which is a significant theme in Eilish’s work: “Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly / The way I'm drinkin' you down / Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.” The images she conjures with these words are undeniably haunting, oddly contrasting with the slickness of her soprano voice.
What makes the song so catchy are its syncopated rhythms and the different sounds she plays around with. There are screeches and shrieks to punctuate verses. Like in other songs, Eilish uses ordinary sounds to correspond with the lyrics of the song. In this case, glass breaks, and a stapler is pressed to correspond to various lines. Eilish peppers the track with pauses as if to mirror the quick breaths of someone stuck in a panic, which keep the song from being too predictable. In recent interviews, Eilish has said that this single is the nucleus of the new album. While fans may have to wait another month for her album, they can relish in this deliciously eerie ballad in the meantime.

New competitors have entered the all-out brawls for pizza and dessert supremacy on the corner of Brattle Street and Massachusetts Avenue. On Feb. 2, &pizza and Milk Bar opened in a shared space to the delight of the hundreds who attended. While the two establishments share a roof, they still leave different impressions.
&pizza takes its namesake — pizza — and adds a build-your-own approach to the mix. The D.C.-based chain makes pizza in an iterative process similar to that of Subway and Felipe’s. With the exception of shrimp, all additional toppings are free of charge. While this reviewer intended on ordering “the OG,” &pizza’s classic pizza, the topping bar was hard to resist. The resulting pizza had peppers, onions, grilled chicken, arugula, and olive oil added along with the usual cheese and tomato sauce. Even with low expectations (given the sheer amount of good pizza in Harvard Square), &pizza impressed with its options and flavors.
Without knowing much about &pizza before its opening, my fear was that it would be good, but not distinct. However, the individualistic and exploratory dynamics of the topping bar encourages the patron to construct a pizza exactly to their liking. This system comes at a cost — &pizza is not the place to grab a quick slice or even a few pies for your dorm — but it may pay off in an area already experiencing peak pizza. The store’s competition, however, is fierce. Pinocchio’s is a mainstay, Oggi Gourmet has experienced a renaissance since the opening of the Smith Center, Otto has devotees for its unique combinations, and Cambridge, 1. has cornered the upscale market. But it is unlikely that &pizza will go the way of Crazy Dough’s, which failed to adapt to a changing pizza environment. Its niche (along with the popularity of Milk Bar) may be enough for it to grab its slice of the pie in the fight for pizza popularity.
Moving to the other side of the venue, Milk Bar has a lot to live up to. New Yorkers know the establishment well. Originally founded as the back room of the East Village’s Momofuku Ssam Bar, the dessert shop has since expanded to other cities and has gained a cultish following. Its popularity was made clear by the lines outside, which did not subside much in its first few days of operation. Milk Bar’s smaller space serves to make it look full more easily, artificially boosting its popularity.
&pizza and Milk Bar take massively different approaches to food construction, which is ironic given the corporate synergy between the two partners. While &pizza may be saved by its ability to customize, many of Milk Bar’s items are sold pre-packaged. Those items, while expertly presented, seem mediocre. The establishment’s famous Crack Pie — based in brown sugar — did not justify its rich and buttery taste. The cereal milk soft serve was exactly as advertised, which leaves one to wonder why exactly someone would want to have soft serve that only tastes like cereal milk. The birthday cake truffles were very floury, although tasty enough to compensate. On the bright side, the compost cookie — containing butterscotch, chocolate chips, pretzels, and more — was superb, and easily the highlight of the “Greatest Hits” bundle.
This is not to say that Milk Bar serves objectively bad food. It is very much suited toward people who have nostalgia over cereal milk, people who are willing to shell out $50 or more for a cake, and people who are fine with sacrificing taste for aesthetic and Instagrammability. If you do not see yourself in one of those categories, some offerings — like the compost cookie — make Milk Bar still worth trying. But it may take more to bring patrons back for seconds.
&pizza and Milk Bar are like conjoined twins now, tied at the hip to each other’s successes. Their relationship is symbiotic: The attention surrounding Milk Bar will likely help boost &pizza’s bottom line. Moving into the future, this could help &pizza by increasing foot traffic, but it could also create a vibe that renders &pizza barren and second-rate. While the final answer will probably lie somewhere in between, there should be optimism about the shared space’s long-term prospects. The location is perfect for maximizing the number of students and general visitors on a daily basis. Both chains will likely inspire its fanatics to keep coming back for more. And the overall convenience of being able to get some solid pizza and dessert under the same roof will mask the fact that both establishments are in deeply competitive markets. While &pizza and Milk Bar are currently a house divided, that shared space may well be its blueprint for success.

We live in a world enthralled by connection. To feel is to draw eyes, and to invite, if not demand, scrutiny. Take Ariana Grande, whose last few years have seen her consecutive tragedy and heartbreak broadcasted across airwaves and tabloid covers. Grande has been forthright about her use of music as a healing process: Her latest album comes barely a half year after her previous release, “Sweetener.” Embracing the blasé over the saccharine, Ariana Grande’s “thank u, next” redefines grief in the age of celebrity.
In many ways, this record can only be understood relationally as the offshoot of its immediate predecessor. Juxtaposed against the pastel caramel of “Sweetener,” the greyscale, graffitied cover of “thank u next” brings a near-unconvincing level of bite. The albums’ respective designs, however, aren’t actually that different: Taken together, the two tell the story of a life turned, quite literally, upside down. Whereas “Sweetener” meets strife with simple gratitude, “thank u, next” confronts this emotion more aggressively.
What sets this album apart from its predecessor is its production. While “Sweetener” had moments that were overproduced — its first half suffered from the heavy handed funk that producer Pharrell is known for — this new release is correctly conceived. It feels as though Grande understands the type of music she wants to make and is fully equipped to do so: She weaves the towering vocals of her pop work with the moodiness of R&B and a smattering of trap. Fans who worried that her run of room-filling tracks had come to an end should find relief in this release. The funky brass of “bloodline” emphasized by bursts that are almost “Dangerous Woman”-esque and the secretive spontaneity of “bad idea” and its bouncing synths, are a firm reminder that Ariana can still land an upbeat bop.
What’s really impressive about this piece of work, however, is its reckoning with intimacy. Listening through the record, one gets the sense that Ariana is comfortable pulling back the curtain and opening her heart to viewers without it ever feeling disingenuous. “imagine" brings a bout of whistle tones atop light, rattling production. It’s measured and minimalist, bringing a conversationalism reminiscent of a back and forth between two people unaware but also unbothered by those around them who might hear. “needy” is draped in self-awareness, confessing that “I’m obsessive and I love too hard / Good at overthinking with my heart” before melting into a pool of sentimental strings. “ghostin,” a track which likely contends with the feelings she has faced regarding both her breakup with Pete Davidson and the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller, features lagoon-like synths aside layered vocals which call back to the sleep imagery of past track “R.E.M.”
If anything, this album proves that Ariana is an expert at framing. Several of her songs are preceded by samples: “bloodline” includes a quote from her grandmother Marjorie about satisfaction, “in my head” borrows from close friend Doug Middlebrook as he tries to pull Ariana down to earth, and “fake smile” plasters itself with the bitter joy of Wendy Rene’s “After Laughter.” Like the scrapbook cover art of “thank u, next” the single, the album feels thoughtfully cut and pasted together, patched with vignettes, quiet reflections, and notes scribbled in the margins. The best use of this stylistic device is the introduction by drag queen Shangela in “NASA,” proclaiming, “This is one small step for woman / One giant leap for woman-kind,” harkening back to “God Is A Woman.” The track is lofty, whimsical, and assertive, each letter of the acronym delivered with the energy of a grin over one’s shoulder. Ariana knows she contains multitudes, gently positing that the very cosmos belong to her in suggested negotiation with spacetime itself.
The tail end of the album is backloaded with her number one singles, “7 rings” and “thank u, next.” In the context of the entire album, the two are even more appreciated than they were on their own. Outfitted in candor and vulnerability, title track “thank u, next” is wholly unafraid to name drop or hold back. Those who wondered how Ariana could follow up such an in-the-moment cultural phenomenon with an entire album have their answers: Her release encompasses all of the love, patience, and pain that the surprise drop promised. The shift in tone of “7 rings,” though unexpected, also works well within the milieu of the larger album. Its self-aggrandizement is self-aware and defiant of those who feel as though they have the license to criticize her on the content of a single song, to surveil her healing process and police how she chooses to share it without knowing the entire story. People who take umbrage with this track are as in their heads as Doug Middlebrook points out Ariana is. Those who think that this performer truly believes she can spend her way to happiness can rest easy. She knows she can’t — trust me.
The closing track “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored” is sonically consistent, but unwieldy given the logical exit option the title track would have offered. All things considered though, it really isn’t too out of place. The pre-chorus is silk, the tone is jarring enough to command attention, and the instrumental pulses with the same heartbeat that so many of the tracks in this album have. Yes, it might not have been most people’s first choice to wrap up the album, but an intimate look at one’s emotions isn’t most people’s first choice to mourn.
Break up with your expectations. Ariana is bored.

Spanish-born dancer Fernando Hernando Magadan believes that his work is not meant to produce beauty. Magadan is the artistic leader of the Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT) 2, one of the world’s most celebrated contemporary dance companies, which marked its 40th anniversary last year. The company — and its leader — arrived at the Boch Center in Boston for two performances on Jan. 26 and 27, sponsored by the Celebrity Series of Boston. “[Our work] is not about being pretty,” Magadan said in a post-show talk. “It’s about being human.” The company’s performance did produce multiple moments of beauty, but it achieved much more than that: It offered a compelling mosaic of the delightful, ridiculous, and disturbing aspects of what it means to be human.
The evening started with “mutual comfort,” a highly energetic piece by Romanian-born choreographer Edward Clug. From the first moment, the dancers, who are all classically trained, showed their extraordinary skill, oscillating elegantly between sharp twitches and soft movements. Even at the most silent moments, undercurrents of tension characterized the piece. The motion was constant; as the curtain closed, one dancer was still moving her head, subtly, almost invisibly.
The second piece, “Sad Case,” alleviated some of the tension of its predecessor. Choreographed by the company’s English-born artistic director, Paul Lightfoot, and his Spanish-born artistic advisor — and wife — Sol León, it often felt like a self aware parody or a reflection on the dancers’ métier. León was seven months pregnant when they created “Sad Case.” As Lightfoot noted in the program, “hormones of laughter, madness, and the trepidation of the unknown ahead [were] the umbilical cord of this work.” Indeed, the piece was built around suspense and unexpected turns. Set to an upbeat soundtrack of Mexican mambo music, it featured some astounding moments of unison, as well as exuberant solos, which all coalesced in a satirical display of the wide range of movements possible for the human body. The dancers, whose skin was powdered white, almost seemed possessed, jumping, falling, and flooding the stage with energy and jubilation.
“Wir sagen uns Dunkles” — the third and most recent piece in the show, created in 2017 by German-born choreographer Marco Goecke — slightly shifted the tone. Its eclectic soundtrack, ranging from the classical tunes of Schubert and Schnittke to the alternative rock of Placebo, framed the piece as an artistic experiment. Even though the score seemed to be a potential mishmash at first, Goecke managed to establish a captivating visual and auditory language over the course of 30 minutes. It was a melodramatic piece, punctuated with moments of comedy: The dancers licked themselves, touched their nipples, and made faces.
The show culminated in a moment in which a dancer dressed in a bright suit peeked from backstage right after intermission. The house lights were still on. He looked at the audience, smiled, walked a single step in slow motion and back again. This light-hearted opening led to “SH-BOOM!” — perhaps the most innovative piece in the evening, choreographed masterfully by the duo Lightfoot and León and inspired by Francisco de Goya’s satirical sketches. The dancers, dressed in black and white, playfully explored different modes of communication to the sounds of post-World War II songs. The piece included unconventional combinations of light, sound, and motion, which demonstrated the long-standing commitment of the company to pushing the boundaries of contemporary dance. In one particularly striking moment, four dancers held flashlights with which they followed a naked dancer, revealing and concealing his expressive movements. The success of this piece, as well as many others in the show, was not only in its exploratory nature; the piece had a profoundly emotional dimension to it, which made the dancers’ performance remarkably moving.
Just before the lights went out on “SH-BOOM!,” confetti flooded the orchestra. The tiny white pieces of paper filled the auditorium, each imprinted with the words: “LIFE COULD BE A DREAM.” For two hours at the Boch Center, it really was.

5. Animated Movies
Who knew that 1998 was actually a big year for animation? After the mild disappointment of the previous year (whose highlights were “Hercules,” “Princess Mononoke,” and “Anastasia”), 1998 restored the faith of moviegoers in talking cartoons. Each of the major American studios released a hit which went on to become a classic: DreamWorks reinvented the bible with “The Prince of Egypt,” Disney transformed our lives with “Mulan,” and Pixar’s “A Bug’s Life” — the big winner — grossed more than $360 million worldwide.
4. “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets”
Even though the long-standing dispute regarding the best book of the popular series will probably never be settled, “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” seems to have been universally acclaimed from day one. Well, almost. Back in 2001, a critic named Mary B. Stuart found the final battle in the Chamber of Secrets “quite intense” and “extremely frightening to sensitive (and younger) children.” Even though her review was positive overall, Stuart warned her readers that “it feels almost as though Stephen King donated a few lethal paragraphs to the book's ending.” It seems as if times have changed: Later works like Neil Gaiman's “Coraline” and Suzanne Collins’s “The Hunger Games” have redefined for what counts as a “frightening” young adult book.
3. Britney
On October 23, 1998, the world stood still when a young American singer, almost unknown, released the first single from her debut studio album. With an irresistible beat, Britney Spears’s “...Baby One More Time” revolutionized what we know about pop music and went on to become one of the singer’s greatest hits. In fact, this single was one of the main reasons that the Daily Beast declared in July 2013 that 1998 was “the Best Year in Music for Millennials.”
2. “Sex and the City”
Four months before Britney came into our lives, a momentous event took place on television screens when a blonde woman appeared with a tutu skirt to the sound of a catchy theme tune. This young woman, Carrie, and her three friends — Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda — would soon become frequent guests in living rooms all around the world. Though in retrospect the show might not seem as glamorous as it seemed back in the 1990s — from its overwhelming whiteness to its controversial contribution to the feminist struggle — its tremendous impact on American television cannot be overlooked.
1. “The Truman Show”
It seems like this 1998 classic has almost everything: Jim Carrey at his best, an unforgettable soundtrack, and a brilliant script by Andrew Niccol that provides a fascinating indication of the state of mind in America on the verge of the new millennium. If you haven’t watched it yet, please log in to your Netflix account and do it now (and in Truman’s words: “In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!”).

As the temperature hovered in single digits two weeks ago, Harvard students and most Cantabrigians huddled in heated rooms under layers of wool. Any excitement over the kick-off of a new semester remained smothered within the safety of warm dormitories. Unfortunately, the freezing streets weren't completely devoid of life, as some Cambridge residents remained outside braving the cold.
Homelessness has long been a severe and persistent problem in Harvard Square. In recent years, there have been significant, commendable strides taken to confront this issue. The city of Cambridge has undertaken measures to help the homeless population obtain subsidized housing and the public restroom installed in 2016 offers great relief for the homeless population.
Volunteers, including many Harvard students, however, are really leading the charge in confronting homelessness in Harvard Square. Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y Harvard Square, the only two shelters in the Square, are both affiliates of Phillips Brooks House Association and staffed mainly by Harvard students. These shelters and the volunteers that run them provide essential services to the most vulnerable members of our community.
Both of these shelters operate at full capacity and must use a lottery system, turning away many seeking a night of warmth. HSHS offers 24 two-week beds and five additional emergency one-night beds. They receive as many as 12 callers per two-week bed lottery and rarely have more than one or two beds to give away. These shelters do not have space, funds, or staff to deal with the endless flow of homeless patrons.
According to a recent study, unsheltered homeless people living in the Boston streets had a death rate nearly three times higher than those living in shelters. Thus, the ten or more callers that don’t receive beds in the lotteries face serious, and potentially fatal, consequences.
On Jan. 31, temperatures dropped to three degrees overnight with a windchill of 15 below. A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development count conducted the same night, found there were 561 homeless residents in Cambridge: 142 individuals in transitional housing, 340 in emergency shelters, and 79 unsheltered in the streets. It is a moral imperative on all of us, Cambridge residents, to provide a roof over these 79 heads on below freezing nights.
As the city of Cambridge and Harvard students struggle to help the homeless, one party is conspicuously absent — the University. Though the University has taken certain measures to alleviate homeless suffering in the Square such as donating leftovers from Harvard University Dining Services dining rooms to pantries and shelters, they can and should allocate more resources to confront the homelessness crisis plaguing its community.
One might argue that the University does not have an obligation to homeless residents in the Square. After all, aren’t these citizens the responsibility of the city?
Yet, there are several reasons that the University has a duty to the vulnerable individuals that live in the streets around its campus. First, Harvard is partly responsible for the rising rent prices plaguing Cambridge. Since the leading cause of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing, the University is partially at fault for the scale of homelessness in Cambridge and, as a result, should help mitigate its effects.
Second, there is another much more fundamental reason that the University should do more for its homeless neighbors. Harvard’s demonstrated ambivalence toward homeless Cantabrigians constitutes a failure on behalf of the University to “practice what they preach.” The University offers public policy courses where students learn how to build a better society as people in our very own community are cold, hungry, and neglected. In Philosophy 12: “Ethics of a Human Life,” students ponder the dignity and value of human life in the warmth of Emerson Hall as the homeless freeze to death locked outside. The Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab has even started many projects around the country to combat homelessness without any measures to specifically help the homeless closer to home. Yet, the persistent homelessness in Harvard Square reveals that the ideas and values that are the lifeblood of the University are confined to these classrooms.
The University should work to expand emergency shelter and transitional housing projects to prevent future unnecessary deaths. The University is both one of the largest landowners in all of the Boston area and has the largest endowment of any university with $39.2 billion; it has adequate resources to open up more shelters and hire staff if there are not enough volunteers. At the very least, it can contribute financial support to existing shelters. Currently, both shelters rely on grants and donations, and they receive no funding from the University itself.
Shelters are by no means a viable long-term solution to homelessness. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to a problem as complex as homelessness; however, Harvard can allocate funds and space to improve the current situation in numerous ways. The University should increase mental health and substance abuse counseling to lower the hurdles preventing the 227 homeless Cantabrigians suffering from substance use disorders and the 99 homeless Cantabrigians suffering from serious mental illnesses as of Jan. 31 from holding down a job and securing housing.
The University can also offer subsidized housing in numerous Harvard-owned apartment buildings in the Square and around the city. For the most part, housing-first approaches that grant homeless people restriction-free transitional housing have proven to be cheaper and more effective in the long-run than the conventional work-first approach that requires homeless people to break addictions and secure jobs before housing is allotted. As a result, providing additional transitional housing may be the most effective approach to the ongoing crisis.
Harvard can and must implement policies that will assist our neglected neighbors. With the resources at its disposal, the administration is in a unique position to become a model for ending homelessness throughout the nation.

While in an earlier article I was defending the admissions practice of preferring legacies, I had occasion to mention John Adams’ definition of a gentleman as one who has received a liberal education. I then proposed, on the basis of Harvard’s own endorsement, that the purpose and duty of these gentlemen is to lead their towns, states, and country. But the reason that the education must be liberal, rather than technical, I did not explain, and we cannot consider the subject adequately treated before I do.
Until the last century, college curricula comprised mainly the natural sciences, mathematics, philosophy, and Latin and Greek classics, which together furnished the student with considerable refinement of thought. None, however, obviously lends itself to practical application in a job — even scientific education had the character of classifying and understanding rather than engineering and contriving. The goal of this liberal education was not to impart a skill but instead to cultivate the mind, preferring integration to specificity.
The notion of college that has emerged since World War II, however, is quite different. One often hears experts urging higher education as the path out of poverty and into prosperity. The mere fact of having a degree is said to increase one’s earning potential so dramatically that one should attend at all costs, and nobody is surprised when Senator Bernie Sanders pipes up with the demand that this earnings benefit be given to everyone for free.
But if having a degree is actually the cause of someone’s higher salary, then the reason must be that there exist many jobs that require skills that are especially or exclusively obtained in college. This is obviously true in the case of such fields as chemical engineering, medicine, and theology, in which on-the-job training results in death or heresy — that is, failure. Yet for many other jobs, the market is plagued by “degree inflation” — employers demanding degrees even though the work does not require them.
Recent studies have attempted to document this problem. Burning Glass Technologies found in 2014 that 65 percent of jobs posted for an “executive assistant” listed an A.B. as a requirement, but only 19 percent of executive assistants working at the time had one. A 2017 Harvard Business School investigation concurred: “In 2015, more than 1.4 million people were employed as first-line supervisors of office and administrative support workers. Of those, only about 34% had a bachelor’s degree. However, in 2015, 70% of job postings for this occupation asked for a bachelor’s degree … even though the nature of the job remains the same.”
Because, as the Business School study also suggests, employers are merely using the degree as a proxy for general aptitude and maturity, it does not much matter what an administrative support worker studies. Hence the proliferation of such ridiculous, inane, and anti-intellectual majors as communications, marketing, and management, for which perfectly employable high school graduates pay through the nose. (I do not, of course, blame them; how else ought one behave under extortion?) This is the origin of the 2013 statistic that only 27 percent of college graduates have a job related to their major.
Even fields that could plausibly demand some prior technical knowledge — accounting, say — are illogically served by four-year programs when the necessary skills could be taught in six months. The traditional period of four years, or at the English universities three, accords with the liberal-arts model of education as moral and cultural as much as intellectual training, a marinating that takes time. Learning how to code, on the other hand, can be done in a boot camp. The result is that for thousands of students, college is four years in which to do only one year of work, the rest of the time to be filled with taking travesties of liberal-arts classes and stepping over fraternity brothers at the bottom of the stairs.
These facts surrounding degree inflation suggest that there was a significant supply of unnecessary degrees before degree inflation started — one suspects the G.I. Bill and its successors, but that is beyond the scope of this piece. The point is that the intelligent observer will realize that the liberally educated remain a small minority of the national population regardless of how many people attend universities, even if Senator Sanders gets his way. One is amazed that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should want to foist her obviously narcoleptic education upon thousands of respectable high school graduates who could get a fine job if only for degree inflation. What we need instead, so as to avoid adulterating higher education any further and burying alive any more hapless students under mountains of debt, is fewer college students, not more.
The governing class — the liberally educated — is a small group, self-selectingly so, and the health of the republic depends on the restoration of the integrity of that liberal education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the surfacing of numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez this past spring, the Government Department has found itself playing a large role in Harvard’s community-wide involvement with the #MeToo movement. The results of the department’s climate survey, released last week, are perhaps the first tangible outcome of its efforts to frankly and openly engage with its shortcomings in creating an inclusive and safe environment for all of its affiliates.
While we are heartened to see that the department has begun to follow through in its efforts to create internal change, the numbers these efforts reveal are troubling. The survey, conducted in October, demonstrates that a third of female respondents to the survey have experienced limitations due to their gender, with 26 percent of female graduate students reporting discrimination. Moreover, nine respondents reported that they have experienced harassment from “somebody associated with the Government Department.”
The department’s strides in uncovering this information cannot remain in the realm of statistics. Concrete action must follow.
Through the survey, the department has begun to recognize its lack of transparency, equality, and accountability. A variety of measures are being designed or proposed to respond to instances of harassment and to build a more representative committee. We are particularly excited by the potential for an ombudsman who would be able to counsel affiliates and respond to misconduct complaints. Compared to the speaker events and socials the department has been hosting so far, this position would be a more concrete step in the department’s work toward creating a more inclusive environment. We hope that the Government department will follow through on their proposals and create the necessary institutional support and resources for the role.
We hope to see the department pursue a number of other tangible goals, especially as it moves towards its April meeting to present proposals to the entire faculty. For example, the department should encourage the enforcement of greater consequences toward those who engage in discrimination in order to prevent further incidents of the likes of Dominguez from happening. This could also be done through a strengthening of the department’s relationships with women student groups in order to directly solicit recommendations from them to improve the climate for female concentrators.
For this meeting, the department should also aim to create a more diverse set of faculty members. Hiring more tenure-track faculty members of different backgrounds would especially benefit graduate students, who work more closely with tenured faculty and also tend to experience more harassment.
While the efforts of the department to analyze the extent of harassment and discrimination are commendable, there is more that needs to be done in regards to an impetus of this survey — the Dominguez investigation. We are skeptical of the internal Title IX Dominguez investigation, much as it was critiqued by 15 accusers of Dominguez in a letter to then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. The signatories of the letter argued that the structure of Title IX investigations fail to provide a “full and fair” account of the long term abuses of which Dominguez has been accused.
The department should continue to strongly advocate for an external investigation, as the 15 accusers themselves have. Currently, the University administration does not plan on taking “public steps” to sponsor an external review until the Dominguez investigation is complete. Given the general sluggishness of these kinds of proceedings — and so far the Dominguez case has been no different — it is unclear when an external investigation will begin. For this reason, we urge the department to use its institutional clout to more aggressively advocate for an external review.
As the survey results were released only a week ago, the department will no doubt need more time to consider and respond to these findings. Though they have taken the right initial step, we hope that they will continue to strive to make the Government Department an inclusive and discrimination-free space for everyone.

Timothy R. Barakett ’87 and Mariano-Florentino “Tino” Cuéllar ’93 have been elected the newest members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, the University announced Monday.
Barakett and Cuéllar will replace outgoing Corporation members Susan L. Graham ’64 and Jessica T. Mathews ’67, both of whom already planned to depart the Corporation, on July 1.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation, said he is looking forward to Barakett and Cuéllar beginning this summer and pointed to the expertise each of them brings to the 13-person body that includes University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
“Tino offers a remarkable breadth of experience and accomplishment in higher education and public service,” Lee said in the press release. “Tim will bring us notable financial and business savvy, as well as deep engagement with alumni affairs and philanthropy.”
Cuéllar attended the College and later Yale Law School, and earned a master's and a Ph.D. from Stanford University. He currently serves as a justice on the Supreme Court of California and has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — since 2017. Within that group he sat on the standing committees on social sciences and institutional policy, the advisory committee on honorary degrees, and the visiting committees for the Graduate School of Design and Harvard Medical School. He is also a member of the law school faculty at Stanford.
Cuéllar was born in Matamoros, Mexico and later moved to Calexico, Calif.
“When I arrived at Harvard from a small California border town, I found opportunities I could scarcely have imagined,” Cuéllar said in the press release. “The privilege of serving on the Corporation represents a chance to do all I can to help others have the same life-changing opportunities.”
“I look forward to working with President Bacow and the governing boards to ensure that Harvard continues to live up to its promise as a force for creativity, integrity, and humanity,” he added.
Barakett played a significant role in the Harvard Campaign, the University’s capital campaign that raised a record-breaking $9.6 billion between 2013 to 2018. Barakett co-chaired both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences fundraising committee and the committee on financial aid. The campaign brought in $1.3 billion alone for financial aid across the University.
A graduate of the College and Harvard Business School, Barakett founded and led the hedge fund Atticus Capital, where he served as chairman and CEO for 15 years. The company became one of the largest hedge funds in the world in 2007 under Barakett’s leadership. He is also a current trustee and executive member for the Dalton School — a New York City preparatory school — and has served on the boards of various hospitals.
“I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to serve on the Harvard Corporation,” Barakett said in the press release.
“I know firsthand the impact that Harvard can have on individuals, communities, and organizations throughout the world, and I look forward to working with President Bacow, the members of the Corporation, and Harvard’s leadership to further its important mission.”
The election of Barakett and Cuéllar follows the elections of Penny S. Pritzker ’81 and Carolyn A. “Biddy” Martin to the Corporation last year. Pritzker and Martin filled vacancies left by Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 and Bacow, who was a member of the Corporation before his selection as University president in February 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 50 students called for College administrators to remove Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., from his post at a rally in front of Massachusetts Hall Monday afternoon.
Toting signs that read “Do Your Job” and “Remove Sullivan,” attendees laid out a set of demands for Harvard administrators. They called for Sullivan’s removal, a public apology, and a formal inquiry into faculty deans’ responsibilities to students.
Sullivan, who is also a Harvard Law School professor, currently faces scrutiny over his public defense of two men accused of sexual misconduct. On Jan. 23, the New York Post reported that Sullivan had joined Harvey Weinstein’s legal team as the Hollywood producer faces charges of sexual abuse.
A week later, Sullivan criticized Harvard’s handling of sexual harassment claims leveled against Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., in a RealClearInvestigations article that referred to him as Fryer’s lawyer. Sullivan called Harvard’s investigations into Title IX complaints against Fryer “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.”
Harvard has opened three Title IX investigations into Fryer based on complaints brought by former female employees who say he harassed them while they worked at the Education Innovation Laboratory, the research group he founded. One of the investigations is ongoing.
In an email to Winthrop students about his decision to represent Weinstein, Sullivan wrote that defense lawyers have a duty to represent “unpopular defendants.” He later followed up with another email to Winthrop residents, announcing “processes” that he and Stephanie R. Robinson — his wife and fellow Winthrop Faculty Dean — were implementing after soliciting students feedback following his decision to defend Weinstein.
At Monday’s rally, students stood in front of Massachusetts Hall with tape over their mouths.
After several minutes of silence, a series of students spoke. Hilda M. Jordan ’19 said Sullivan’s comments on Weinstein and Fryer conflict with his role as a faculty dean. In particular, she pointed to Sullivan’s allegations that witnesses in Harvard’s investigations into Fryer were coached.
“Your role is not just in filing paperwork or smiling in our faces. Your role is to deal with the culture that you establish as a Faculty Dean. So Dean Sullivan, please reconcile how you can care about sexual assault and at the same time, have claims against a Harvard affiliate being nothing more than coaching?” she said. “You are a faculty dean, not just an attorney.”
Winthrop resident Madeleine D. Woods ’19 also called for Sullivan to step down from his post and for administrators to reshape the faculty dean position.
“Even if he puts out an apology, the fact that he didn’t even think of the impact this would have is probably the most damning element of this,” Woods said. “The only move forward is not only to remove Dean Sullivan, but then to have a structural reconsideration of what it means to be a faculty dean so we don’t have an issue like this again.”
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment.
Several College administrators attended the event. Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Harvard College Title IX coordinator Emily J. Miller watched the protest and spoke with students afterward. The Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response also set up a table with hot chocolate and handouts for attendees.
Lowell Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck, who attended the rally, said she agreed with students’ calls for the College to reevaluate the faculty dean position.
“We talk a lot about what the role of a resident dean is, what the roles of our tutors are, but the faculty dean role is really important. It’s not nominal. It means a certain amount of hard decision-making on the part of those of us who assume that role,” Eck said.
Danukshi "Danu" A.K. Mudannayake ’20, a Crimson Design editor, organized Monday’s demonstration late last week. She also organized a Change.org petition that calls for Sullivan’s removal and had received 164 signatures as of Monday night.
“The issue is that he cannot simultaneously hold that role while still having a charade of saying that he can actually protect the integrity of his students,” Mudannayake said in an interview Thursday.
At the event’s start and end, Mudannayake repeated the organizers’ demands and criticized administrators’ lack of public response.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email Monday that support for students in residential spaces is “among the highest of the College’s priorities."
“I take seriously the concerns that have been raised from members of the College community regarding the impact of Professor Sullivan’s choice to serve as counsel for Harvey Weinstein on the House community that he is responsible for leading as a faculty dean,” Khurana wrote. “I have also met with Professor Sullivan to discuss his responsibilities to the House and have communicated that the College believes that more work must be done to uphold our commitment to the well-being of our students.”
Mudannayake, who concentrates in Visual and Environmental Studies, said her aspirations to work in the film industry made Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein personal.
“I'm a filmmaker, I study film here, and I hope to one day work in the entertainment industry and when the #MeToo thing happened with Harvey Weinstein's case breaking out in the first place, I was deeply shocked and saddened and very afraid,” Mudannayake said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
As Harvard’s dining service workers carried out their 22-day strike in October 2016, they did not stand alone on the picket line. Joining the UNITE HERE Local 26 members were affiliates from various other University unions.
This show of solidarity has played out many times over the years — from unions’ efforts to support non-Harvard UNITE HERE hotel workers during a November 2018 protest in Boston, to backing the new graduate student union throughout its organizing efforts and into contract negotiations the past few months.
For many union organizers, no matter the different types of employees they represent, their work as labor organizers on Harvard’s campus is intertwined, both in advocacy efforts and the fine print of their contracts.
In particular, after helping the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers win a seat at the bargaining table last year, leaders of other campus labor organizations said they now hope the graduate students’ new contract can pioneer provisions that will benefit their own workers in the future.
'COLLECTIVE' BARGAINING
Nine bargaining sessions in, Harvard and its graduate student union have put forward more than 40 proposals total and reached at least four tentative agreements – with no agreements yet reached on economic issues such as wage, healthcare, and housing benefits.
As the union negotiates its first contract, HGSU-UAW can base its proposals on agreements made previously with graduate student unions from other universities across the country. But HGSU-UAW has another tool in its arsenal: the provisions already included in Harvard’s other union contracts.
“Our grad union grew while standing on the shoulders of giants on campus,” union organizer Felix Y. Owusu wrote in an email. Those “giants,” he said, include the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers; Service Employees’ International Union Local 32BJ, which represents security guards and custodians; Harvard University Security Parking and Museum Guards Union; and UNITE HERE Local 26.
HGSU-UAW negotiators said their work is in part possible because of previous unions’ efforts.
“Our proposals to strengthen protections against discrimination and harassment — such as by banning discrimination on the basis of immigration status or past criminal history — follow in the footsteps of Local 26, who secured protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation before Massachusetts enacted protections for LGBTQ workers,” Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, another member of the HGSU bargaining committee, wrote in an emailed statement.
As part of HGSU-UAW’s push for student workers to be allowed to pursue third-party arbitration in sexual harassment and non-discrimination conflicts, the union has referred to the use of grievance procedures – a dispute resolution mechanism implemented in collective bargaining agreements – outlined in other Harvard unions’ contracts.
“The other unions on campus – including UNITE HERE Local 26, SEIU 32BJ, and HUCTW – have all negotiated contracts that secure their members’ rights to address issues of discrimination and harassment through a fair and neutral grievance procedure,” bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16 wrote in an email.
Other unions on campus have been eager to help out the graduate students, according to their leadership.
“We think that the language that they get will be an extension of where we are today,” said Ed Childs, chief shop steward of UNITE HERE Local 26.
“We sat down with them, and showed them our contract, especially about respect clauses dealing with sexism and racism and homophobia,” Childs said. “They really liked it. I think they took a lot of ideas from our contract.”
William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College at the City University of New York, said that drawing from language in past contracts is common practice in collective bargaining.
“There have been collective bargaining agreements in higher education involving graduate assistants since 1970,” Herbert said. “We have quite a long record involving contracts that can be examined to figure out how a specific issue was dealt with and I'm sure these kind of questions have come up in contracts and there's model contract language that can come from those contracts.”
A TWO-WAY STREET
Just as the older unions have supported the graduates students’ negotiations, HGSU-UAW has advocated for other unions during their organizing efforts.
When UNITE HERE began its 2016 strike, HGSU-UAW — which had just initiated its public campaign in the spring and would go on to fight two additional years for their eventual unionization — stood in solidarity with dining service workers along with other labor groups.
“As we organized to form our union, we had the privilege of watching, learning from, and supporting Local 26’s October 2016 strike,” Owusu wrote.
Roxana Rivera, the vice president of SEIU 32BJ, said her union has seen that when they work together with other unions, they “win more.”
“We stood in solidarity with the food service workers when they went out on strike. It was at the same time that we were going to the bargaining table for security officers and janitors,” Rivera said. “We stood strong with them and held some rallies and marches with them. They were able to win a good contract. Security officers and janitors were, too.”
Last March, as the second vote on graduate student unionization was approaching, HUCTW, UNITE HERE Local 26, HUSPMGU, and SEIU 32BJ together endorsed graduate students’ unionization efforts.
“We gave a huge amount of support to them when they [held the] vote for the union,” Childs said. “We attended their rallies and…spoke at their rallies and also had them come to our rallies, especially during the strike.”
BARGAINING FOR EVERYONE
Nearly a year later — as HGSU-UAW and Harvard work toward negotiating the first labor contract crafted between the University and graduate students in its history — other unions are looking to the developing agreements as a map for their future bargaining efforts.
“We see it as a positive change to have a larger union presence on campus — not only for HGSU members and other unionized staff, but also for the non-union staff,” Carrie Barbash, HUCTW’s president, wrote in an email. “Unions help raise the standard of living for everyone, not just the members they represent.”
Curt E. Rheault, president of HUSPMGU, said he is looking forward to hearing the results of HGSU-UAW’s negotiations because they often can help direct future contract negotiations.
“If they share the contracts…then that helps us out a lot because some things we didn't even know we should be pushing for, that we didn't know was available to us,” he said. “When you say, ‘hey, listen, by the way, we did this with our union, it was very well received by management, you should try that with your management,’ it helps it makes our life a lot better.”
Childs said the contract provisions HGSU-UAW is able to negotiate will be particularly important given today’s political landscape.
“Their contract is a big reflection and extension of our contract, but it's also a much more difficult period, the period of Trump, anti-workers sentiment,” Childs said. “That's why we want to help them out as much as possible and their contract will reflect where ours will pick up next contract.”
SEIU 32BJ will negotiate a new contract in the next presidential election year, and UNITE HERE Local 26 will begin new negotiations in 2021. Rivera emphasized the importance of the precedents HGSU-UAW will set in SEIU 32BJ’s negotiations.
“We are supportive of things that help our efforts for the whole University and in negotiations,” Rivera said. “The biggest thing that we're going to be addressing with the environment of the 2020 election and what's going to happen there and issues affecting immigrant families.”
HGSU-UAW organizers say the union has embraced its role in creating new possibilities for other unions.
“The other unions on campus have set remarkable examples to follow, and our mutual support of one another on issues of immigration, non-discrimination, and healthcare will continue to build our strength as we organize for a healthier and more equitable Harvard,” Owusu wrote.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Owusu is a union bargaining committee member. In fact, he is a union organizer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Education received a $10 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to fund national research on rural school districts.
The grant establishes the new National Center for Rural Education Research Networks at Harvard, which aims to “build the capacity of rural school districts and supporting state agencies to use their own data to improve the education of their students.” NCRERN will use data analysis to address chronic absenteeism, college readiness, and college enrollment.
“This center was created to help school districts and state agencies use their data to improve,” said Thomas J. Kane, a professor at the Graduate School of Education and the principal investigator for NCRERN. “Any organization, whether it’s a school district or a university, needs to be able to pilot and test interventions and see whether they work if their goal is to improve.”
NCRERN will begin its research through collaboration with 60 rural school districts in Ohio and New York before expanding to other states over the course of the five-year grant. Kane’s team will organize studies to test the efficacy of proposed solutions, some of which will be suggested by the participating schools.
Kane’s previous work for the Proving Ground project at Harvard’s Center for Education Policy Research aimed to address challenges faced by urban districts and used some of the same methodologies and data analysis techniques he plans to use at NCRERN.
Bi Vuong, who worked with Kane as the director of the Proving Ground project and now serves as the interim director of NCRERN, said the grant will expand their prior work into rural systems. “That’s the experience we bring, like the randomized control trial, the data analytics, the advice and support.”
Karen Eppley, a member of the NCRERN advisory board and editor of the Journal of Research in Rural Education, said the new center will have university faculty work alongside districts to determine and evaluate solutions.
“Positive interventions then can also be scaled up to other states with high percentages of rural schools,” she added.
Kane compared NCRERN's research methods to those employed by the pharmaceutical and retail industries. He said those industries test and analyze potential solutions rigorously before scaling them to the full system. Rural school districts often lack the resources to conduct similar tests on their own.
“I can’t think of a thing that will make a bigger difference 20 years from now than school districts getting in the habit of doing this piloting and testing and measuring results before scaling up,” Kane said.
Kane and Vuong highlighted the importance of data availability and district leaders’ devotion to the research for evaluating schools that may want to partner with the center in the future.
“The whole reason I think we are engaging in this is to try to improve the outcomes for students in K-12 education and having the rural centers actually have a way to support rural students in a way that we have not done before,” Vuong said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay called Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.’s response to students’ concerns over his decision to represent Harvey Weinstein “insufficient” in an interview Monday.
​​​​​​
Sullivan, who has defended several high-profile figures in his career, including accused murderer and former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, made national headlines last month when he announced he will represent Weinstein. The film producer is currently facing five charges of sexual assault, including rape, in New York District Court.
Sullivan’s decision to defend Weinstein has sparked anger and public condemnation from students, including a Monday protest and a petition signed by more than 160 Harvard affiliates. He has also come under fire for his public support of Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., who is currently facing allegations of sexual harassment.
Sullivan criticized Harvard’s investigation into Fryer in a Jan. 29 RealClearInvestigations article, which refers to Sullivan as Fryer’s lawyer, calling the process “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.”
Days after the announcement that he would serve on Weinstein’s legal team, Sullivan sent a 1,200-word email to Winthrop residents centered on the importance of defending the “unpopular defendant.” A few days later, Sullivan sent another email to House affiliates directing them to Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the house’s “point person” for sexual misconduct issues.
Gay called Sullivan’s response thus far “insufficient,” especially relative to the seriousness of students’ concerns.
“When we think about the faculty dean role, part of it is the faculty dean as an educator, someone that’s helping to connect students to, frankly, the excitement of intellectual and academic life,” Gay said. “But there’s also a pastoral role, sort of an expectation of a special responsibility to the well-being of the students who are part of the community.”
“I’m just very committed to making sure that those who hold that role inhabit all of the responsibilities as fully and effectively as we expect them to,” Gay said.
Sullivan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.
Gay said neither administrators nor students question Weinstein’s right to adequate counsel, but rather that the “discussion on campus” has centered around the “impact” of Sullivan’s decision on Winthrop students.
“I feel like the intensity of the response, in some ways, is just this incredibly powerful reminder of the important role of the faculty dean in the life of the College, and in some ways kind of a reaffirmation of the importance of that role,” she said. “I think that students depend on their faculty deans. They really need them.”
Gay added that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has spoken directly with Sullivan about his obligations to Winthrop affiliates and the “additional work” he must do to fulfill those obligations. Khurana wrote in an emailed statement Monday that he, too, is “committed” to ensuring house administrators fulfill their “critically important role in our community.”
“Over the past week, I, along with my leadership team, have been actively engaged with the Winthrop House residential staff,” Khurana wrote. “I have also met with Professor Sullivan to discuss his responsibilities to the House and have communicated that the College believes that more work must be done to uphold our commitment to the well-being of our students.”
Asked whether she has doubts about Sullivan’s ability to fulfill his role as faculty dean — a position he has held since 2009 — Gay said the steps Sullivan has taken since his conversation with Khurana are “promising.”
“The fact that the level of upset has not declined, and in fact has only grown suggests that those steps were still insufficient and there’s more work that needs to be done,” Gay said. “I am hopeful that Professor Sullivan is prepared to be a partner in that work.”
“We’ll see what happens next,” she added.

Harvard raised $1.42 billion in fiscal year 2018, the University’s largest-ever annual fundraising sum, and a higher education record. The total represents a more than 10 percent growth over its fiscal year 2017 donation income.
Harvard raised the most of any university in the country, according to a report from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. This is the third consecutive year Harvard topped the fundraising field, with Stanford University coming in second all three years, after nearly a decade at the top. This year, Stanford brought in $1.1 billion.
Fiscal year 2018 was the final year of Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign, which brought in $9.6 billion over its five-year run. The campaign was launched in 2013 with a goal of $6.5 billion; before its conclusion, the campaign had raised $1.3 billion for financial aid alone.
The capital campaign will help fund projects across the University, including a $1 billion science and engineering complex in Allston and the ongoing House renewal project which involves the renovation of a number of the College’s nearly 100-year-old undergraduate Houses.
All but the first fiscal year of the capital campaign saw annual fundraising totals in excess of $1 billion. Last year, Harvard raised $1.28 billion, up from $1.19 billion the year before. This year, only two other schools — Stanford and Columbia University — crossed the $1 billion threshold.
The University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, San Francisco rounded out the top five, with $787 and $730 million, respectively.
Yale University raised the tenth most overall, bringing in $586 million, less than half of Harvard’s total. Several other Ivy League universities — including Brown University, Dartmouth College, and Princeton University — did not make the top 20.
United States colleges and universities raised $46.73 billion in the 2017-2018 academic fiscal year, according to the CASE press release. This marked a 7.2 percent increase over the previous recording period and the highest amount ever raised by U.S. institutions of higher learning.
The 20 institutions that raised the most money had a combined fundraising total of $13.26 billion, representing nearly 30 percent of the total amount raised by the 929 higher education institutions in the United States who responded to CASE’s annual survey.
Part of the increase in fundraising may be tied to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act adopted in December 2017, according to a research brief published by CASE. The new law — which imposes a tax on some universities’ endowments, including Harvard’s — removed several incentives for donors, and thus may have pushed people to give more before the changes went into effect.
Though Harvard’s fundraising has consistently led the pack, its endowment has not kept pace with its Ivy League peers in recent years. Last year, only Columbia had a lower endowment return rate than Harvard. In response to this outcome, Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. Narvekar wrote that the organization has “much work ahead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
Two divestment activist groups organized on Harvard’s campus last week — one calling on the University to end its investment in farmland holdings, and the other seeking to cut Harvard’s financial ties to companies connected to the United States prison system.
Roughly 30 students gathered in front of the Smith Campus Center and Massachusetts Hall — which houses Harvard’s central administration — on Friday to urge University President Lawrence S. Bacow to divest the University’s $39.2 billion endowment from farmland holdings around the world. The rally was organized by students in groups including the Harvard Democrats, Native Americans at Harvard College, and Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice — an organization affiliated with the Divest Harvard campaign.
A September 2018 report detailed the web of companies through which Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm, invests in farmland from California to Brazil.
The 16-page document included accounts from those who said they were unfairly pushed off of land that Harvard now owns, or who said they have suffered health problems from Harvard-linked farms nearby.
Organizer and College student Ilana D. Cohen ’22 read from a list of demands put together by Divest Harvard — a student group committed to divesting Harvard from fossil fuels — which was eventually delivered to Mass. Hall.
“We call upon the University and the Harvard Corporation to take responsibility for the human and environmental rights violations stemming from their investment practices, as well as support a comprehensive independent investigation into these practices and to abide by their own code of investments moving forward,” the demands read.
The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — has played a roll in previous Harvard divestments, including its financial separation from tobacco companies in 1990.
Harvard Management Company spokesperson Patrick McKiernan wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s investors work on initiatives to “ensure” that they “can leave the land and community better” than when investment were first made, and have worked to “reposition” their portfolio in recent years.
“Their aim is to create a more focused and efficient portfolio that, in partnership with local managers, can meet or exceed our quality standards,” McKiernan said. “As a result, we have sold a number of assets and are considering divestment from others.”
Rally participants sang songs and carried posters emblazoned with slogans like “This Is Not A Favor, Hands Off The Land,” as they listened to speakers describe their concerns with Harvard’s investment in these holdings.
Isabelle Flores-Jones ’19, who spoke at the rally, said in an interview Saturday that the University should “abide by their ethical standards.”
“The reason that we feel it's really, really important that students, the community, and really the wider world know about Harvard's investments in this land is because we're asking Harvard to abide by the principles that they have set out to be a responsible investor, which includes respecting human rights and includes respecting the environment,” Flores-Jones said.
University spokespeople did not respond to multiple requests for comment about these statements.
Farmlands, however, were not the only target of divestment activism at Harvard last week.
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign released a petition last Monday calling on the University to withdraw its investments from companies tied to the prison industry. As of Monday afternoon, the petition had garnered 1,081 signatures.
The petition, which lists several demands for Bacow, asks the University to “divest Harvard’s holdings from companies that profit from the prison-industrial complex” and invest instead in “communities disproportionately affected by mass incarceration.” The activists also called on Harvard to disclose all of its endowment holdings and specify any stake Harvard may have in companies that profit from the prison industry.
Business and Law School student Amber A. James ’11, an organizer for the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, said Harvard affiliates should be made aware of the University’s investments in companies with connections to the prison industry.
“Harvard students have a right to know but also to not be associated with an institution that is supporting the prison industrial complex, which is responsible for caging millions of people, surveilling millions more people, inflicting violence, harm, and oppression on people of color, on low income people, and communities from which they come,” James said.
An Undergraduate Council ballot referendum last year urging for divestment from the “prison-industrial complex” garnered 77.2 percent of the vote.
Asked in October whether Harvard would consider divesting from prisons, Bacow repeated the longstanding position of his predecessors: The endowment is not the appropriate mechanism to effect social change.
“The University should not use the endowment….to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said. “There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”
Organizers like James, however, argue that the University’s large endowment should be a tool for social activism
“Knowing that money is power, the power to coerce, the power to influence, there is no way the endowment is apolitical,” James said. “President Bacow saying the endowment is not political, or he doesn’t want the endowment to be politicized, really is just a request of the Harvard community to not hold Harvard accountable for how it’s investing its money.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jonathan Swain reiterated Bacow’s previous statement.
“There are other ways the University works to influence public policy, including through scholarship and research,” Swain wrote.

​​​​​​
In light of results from a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences climate survey that found more than a quarter of respondents have experienced harassment or discrimination, SEAS administrators have implemented a number of diversity and inclusion measures.
Alexis J. Stokes, director of diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS, piloted the climate survey last April after examining previous data on diversity issues and consulting different individuals. The SEAS Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging — which Stokes chairs — identified “eight priority areas” based on the survey’s findings, including increasing accessibility; reducing and preventing instances of harassment and discrimination; and recruiting diverse faculty, students, postdoctoral fellows, and staff.
Stokes said SEAS affiliates are working to develop specific recommendations for each priority area, which will be published by the end of the semester in the form of a five-year plan.
SEAS administrators have already undertaken several new initiatives. This semester, the school is offering faculty and staff two diversity-related trainings, Diversity 101 and Harvard IDEAS.
In addition to the trainings, SEAS administrators have started requiring a “diversity statement” from all new faculty applicants. They also plan to host their second annual BRIDGE week in April, a weeklong program celebrating diversity in STEM and educating affiliates about diversity and inclusion best practices.
Both Stokes and Kathryn A. Hollar, who has served as director of community programs and diversity outreach at SEAS for the past 15 years, said they have seen increased engagement with issues of diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS in response to the survey’s results.
Hollar has helped coordinate the Research Experience for Undergraduates program, which works to elevate recruitment of diverse graduate school candidates within SEAS. She is also a member of the Graduate Admissions Diversity Subcommittee, which she described as “a group of faculty and staff who read applications and make recommendations to faculty.”
“To do really creative science and engineering research that has a positive impact on all populations requires that we have people who come from different backgrounds and life experiences,” Hollar wrote in an emailed statement. “This committee points out the value of those different experiences during the grad admissions process.”
The presidents of two student organizations at SEAS — the Harvard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers and Women in Computer Science — said the results of the climate survey have reinforced the need for diversity and inclusion initiatives at the school.
“The results of the SEAS climate survey only highlight what we have known to be historically true of STEM fields, that they have a past rooted in practices that often discriminate against women and minorities,” HSBSE President Arin L. Stowman ’19 wrote in an email.
“Knowing this only leads to the firm resolution that organizations like HSBSE, SHPE, WiCS, and SWE need to exist on this campus not only as forms of support, but also so that efforts can be made to change the environment at SEAS,” she added, referencing the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers.
Katherine E. Binney ’19 and Angeline Rao ’19, co-presidents of WiCS, said the SEAS climate survey largely affirmed the findings they had gathered from their annual, WiCS-specific climate surveys.
Both Binney and Rao said that while SEAS provided significant support for their organization in terms of publicity and event programming, they believe that many of the diversity initiatives are student-driven.
“I think that [SEAS serves] maybe a more supportive function, and a lot of the initiatives that we’ve come up with have come largely from within WiCS,” Rao said.
For example, Binney said the Computer Science department’s new peer concentration advising program resembles existing mentorship and advising systems within WiCS.
“In some ways, it seems like they’re trying to take the burden off of us so we can focus on other new initiatives and not have to do things where it’s like, ‘Hey, if every CS concentrator is coming, that’s probably something [SEAS] should be providing,’” Binney said.
Binney and Rao also said mandatory diversity training within classroom settings could facilitate students’ sense of belonging.
“I think it’d be really great if SEAS as a whole could offer more training to professors and to TFs about what an inclusive classroom looks like,” Binney said.
Stokes said she hopes to increase on-the-ground programming — for example, by bringing in more speakers and organizing more events — in the future and wants to make sure SEAS affiliates feel involved in the process.
“My hope would be that we have some programs in place that all stakeholders within SEAS can get involved in,” Stokes said. “To show that all of these initiatives are for our community, and we’re all taking ownership of our community and the diversity, inclusion, and belonging of our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 Harvard’s squash teams continued to dominate over the weekend, with both teams taking home their respective Men’s and Women’s Ivy League titles. The victories concluded their seasons in perfection.
The women’s Crimson team clinched its fourth straight Ivy League Title. While it clinched a share of the Ivy League title last Friday at No. 4 Yale, Harvard won the title in its entirety with its win over No. 12 Brown on Sunday.
“We have won it the past four years in a row so we have some expectations for us,” said junior Gina Kennedy. “We do all that we can to prepare and then just do our best to perform on the match day.”
The Crimson continued its dominance over the weekend against Yale and Brown. The team cruised to the finish, as Harvard won both matches 9-0, as they have done in every other match this season.
Senior Sabrina Sobhy started off her final regular season match with a win against Brown’s Alexa Jacobs, 11-8, 11-6, 11-1. Kennedy followed suit dominating her opponent Isabel Young, 11-1, 11-5, 11-7. Similar scores were seen across the board for the following seven games. Harvard has yet to ever lose to Brown, with an all-time record of 49-0.
Consistent trust in each other is how the team has managed to maintain its superiority over the course of this season.
“We are all so confident in our teammates,” said Kennedy. “Even though it’s a team sport, it is very individually based. I think everyone is very focused on trying to perform the very best they can for the team because everyone is so confident in our ability to win for each other.”
The Crimson’s unbeaten streak was extended to 62 games, which dates back to the 2014-2015 season. Kennedy credited the dominance to the incredible recruiting of the coaching staff.
“The recruiting is amazing; our coaches recruit from all over the world,” said Kennedy. “We’ve done so well with getting the strongest players to come to Harvard.”
With the continued success over the past few years, it could be perceived as nit-picky to determine how the team could improve. However, in her third year on the team, Kennedy believes this is the strongest squad she’s been apart of.
“I think this year it feels like we know exactly what to do,” she explained. “Our team is so strong this year, probably the strongest team since I’ve been here. There’s just a nice air of confidence around us.”
 The men’s squash team appears to be experiencing a very similar air of confidence, riding its longest win streak since the 2013-2014 season at 12 games. The team clinched a share of the Ivy League title with its win over No. 6 Yale on Friday, and then clinched the entire title with its win over No. 20 Brown.
Though it is Harvard’s fifth Ivy League title in the last seven years, the team was particularly motivated to win it this time around.
“It was really important to get this title, especially since we didn’t win the title last year,” said freshman Victor Crouin. “We just wanted to get the trophy back home.”
At the number one spot, Crouin beat Brown opponent Grant Sterman, 11-1, 11-5, 11-1, to kick off the match for the Crimson. Another first-year, Marwan Tarek, defeated his opponent Andrew Wei, 11-6, 11-4, 11-7, at the number two position to extend his regular season win streak to 11 games.
The success continued for each of Harvard’s players, with only one loss of a game to a Brown player. Just like Harvard’s women’s team, the men’s team has never dropped a contest to conference foe Brown, with an all-time record of 29-0.
The victory resulted in the 42nd Ivy League title for the team.
Both teams are now in their last stretch of the season, preparing for the College Squash Association Team National Championships at Trinity College. The men’s tournament will take place February 15 through February 17, and the women’s tournament from February 22 through February 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in four years, Harvard has a shot at taking home the Beanpot. A rough January now long gone in the rearview mirror, the Crimson enters the match against No. 7/8 Boston University red-hot on a six-game unbeaten streak.
Harvard’s last run to the Beanpot Finals came in 2015 in the midst of a historically dominant season. The Crimson entered the game 18-4-2 and would go on to appear in the Frozen Four, before losing in the national championship against the Minnesota Golden Gophers.
This year’s team posts a decidedly less dominant 10-11-3 record heading into the Beanpot, but being an underdog in the battle for Boston is nothing new to the Crimson — the 2015 championship team faced the nation’s best in No. 1/1 Boston College (27-0-1, 18-0-0 WHEA). Luckily for this year’s Harvard squad, both games of the 41st Women’s Beanpot have ended in upsets.
“The Beanpot is an unbelievable opportunity,” co-captain Kate Hallett said. “Only four teams in the country get to take part in this, and we’re one of them…. This is the first time in my career that we’ve made it to the Beanpot Championship…. It’s something that is really special to be a part of, and we’re just really grateful for the opportunity.”
Like this year’s Harvard team, the 2015 squad was fighting to give its seniors their first Beanpot Championship — and Boston bragging rights. Despite a 10-2 demolition by the Eagles early in the 2014-15 season, the Crimson pulled off a 3-2 upset for one of the signature wins of its national title-game campaign.
Before the 2015 victory, the Crimson’s last Beanpot triumph came in 2010. A common factor between 2015 and 2010? Both games were played at the Crimson’s Bright-Landry Hockey Center — the site of this year’s final.
“To have it at your own rink, it’s protecting your barn and really owning your rink,” sophomore forward Becca Gilmore said. “The last time Harvard won was in 2015 on home ice. We walk by that picture everyday. I’m excited to hopefully get another win.”
The Crimson is on a tear coming into the game, going unbeaten in its last six (5-0-1), good for the third-longest such streak in the NCAA. The team will face a tough test against Boston University as the Terriers have been even hotter of late, compiling a ten-game unbeaten streak (8-0-2) that ranks first in college hockey.
“Knowing that they are on a high right now, I think we just have to note that but not focus on that,” Hallett said. “We need to focus on our own game, what we’re there to do—kind of block everything else out.”
Over the weekend, BU flexed its high-flying offense with a 7-1 win over Holy Cross. The Terriers have outscored opponents by a margin of 26-12 in their last five.
The Terriers can also keep their cool in tight games. In the semifinals last week, BU eked out a shootout victory against No. 3/3 Northeastern after overtime ended, despite having trailed twice earlier in the game.
“They’re a team that’s not going to go away,” Gilmore said. “It’s going to take a full 60 or more minutes to win the hockey game, and we can’t take a shift off.”
Harvard should be up for the challenge. In recent tough games, the Crimson has also found the resolve to come from behind. During the six-game unbeaten streak, two games, including the Beanpot Semifinal against BC, have seen Harvard go down early only to battle back for the win.
With a nationally-ranked lineup, BU has players to watch. Sophomore forward Jesse Compher, who scored a power-play winner against the Crimson in the teams’ last meetup, ranks sixth in the nation in points per game (1.72) and second in assists (1.17). On the back end, sophomore goalie Corinne Schroeder posts a .929 save percentage.
Harvard, though, has experience against high save percentages. In last weekend’s game at RPI, the Crimson faced senior goalie Lovisa Selander, the record holder for most career saves in NCAA history. Harvard knew what it had to do, constantly pressuring the net and putting up 56 shots en route to a 2-1 win. This marked the Crimson’s second night of the month with 50 or more shots, with the other coming two weekends ago against Brown.
High shot numbers are less of an obstacle for Harvard’s defense, with freshman goalie Lindsay Reed’s nation-leading .945 save percentage. Pressure seems to have little impact on her ability to block the puck. In her first-ever Beanpot game, Reed notched a jaw-dropping 52 saves, allowing only one goal to help the Crimson to a 4-1 victory despite being outshot 53-26.
Defensive play has been a strong suit for the Crimson all year. The team is only giving up 2.17 goals per game. Strikingly, on four separate occasions, Harvard has given up one goal or fewer yet failed to secure a win (three separate 1-0 defeats and a 0-0 tie). The Crimson’s defense has been hot even in offensively cool games.
“One thing that we’ve talked about is just owning the front of our net—net-front battles, picking up sticks,” said Hallett. “If someone shoots a puck from the point or from the outside, we’re making sure that we’re man-on-man and taking those opponents’ bodies outside the front of our net so that our goalies can see the puck really well.”
The offense, however, is now finding the back of the net—and at a dramatic pace. Over its first 19 games of the season, Harvard averaged only 1.63 goals per game; in the last five, the Crimson has been averaging 4.2 goals per contest.
Part of the offensive boom could be the new line combination of Gilmore, sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich, and freshman forward Dominique Petrie. The triumvirate, assembled only five games ago, has already combined for 21 points. Having a healthy, fully-staffed roster—the lack of which was the team’s Achilles heel in a January slump—is another key.
While the game will of course require technical expertise from the Crimson, the storied history of the Beanpot will create an environment of raw competition where anything can happen — a setting that can be conducive to an underdog.
“[The seniors] are one of the most deserving classes to get a title,” Gilmore said. “You know that they’re going to give 110% of their effort, so we’re going to match that and get a huge win for them and our team.”

Datamatch is right around the corner, which means that first years near and far will leave their collective Canaday septuplets and finally allow their skin to feel some sunlight for the first time since returning to this frozen landscape we call “campus.” You probably know what Datamatch is because that’s the content that Flyby is rolling out this week. The actual etiquette behind it might be a little confusing, though. I’m here to help. Grab my hand, and allow me to walk you down the social-skills American Ninja Warrior that is Datamatch.
What to wear
If you want your date to know that you don’t get out a lot, I recommend a CS50 shirt. If you want your date to know that you’re shallow, don a HCCG Patagonia. If you want your date to know that you’re in a final club, go all out with that Vineyard Vines vest and a baby blue polo. I’m kidding (only a little bit, though). Dress casually but not sloppily. Athletic shorts and a stained t-shirt are out of the picture, but a mildly nice button down and jeans or that sherpa jacket you haven’t broken out yet is a solid move. Maybe wear an accessory as a conversation starter or just to show that you put some effort into this and totally didn’t do Datamatch because your blockmates are worried about your love life. Deodorize (please) and brush your teeth. It’s not a job interview, but it is a form of coerced social interaction that should be approached in a mildly respectable fashion.
Where to go
Anywhere but Clover. It’s not even an option this year. This is just a suggestion regardless of whether or not you’re doing Datamatch. Next.
What to talk about
Start out by making a banal joke about how zany the questions on the survey were. It’s a layup and shows that you know how to read. Talk about your extracurriculars, hometown, where the bodies are hidden, favorite bands and movies, etc. Let your date talk, though; after all, it’s a “date.” Try to not think about the fact that the person is likely sitting across from you because free food was involved. Be calm and listen.
How to follow up if the date goes well
Ask for their phone number and say “you’d love to get a real meal sometime” and then chuckle, noting that you “mean it.” I don’t know what the relationship retention rate is for Datamatch, but I’m sure it’s not 0 percent. College is about putting yourself out there and shooting your shot. Maybe you did well on this date and can make something work in the future. There are friends and lovers and LinkedIn matches to be made, and this is your chance to do all three.
So, that’s just about it. Good luck. Meeting strangers is hard, but being alone with your thoughts is harder.

Valentine’s Day is one of those polarizing things that you either love or hate, and for good reason. Hear from two writers who give you their hot takes on this holiday.
Hate It: It’s all a corporate ruse — Maya S. Bhagat
Beyond all the Cupid fluff, we need to take a look at the darker side of the holiday that claims to celebrate true love. So-called Valentine’s Day gifts entail playing the fruitless exercise of the giver trying to guess exactly what their special someone wants, and the said soulmate has to feign delight over the gift even if they hate it with every fiber of their being. Since true love is usually mutual, each relationship has to endure all this stress twice.
Valentine’s Day is a $14 billion industry, a corporate construct to make us feel like we should have already partaken in cuffing season and have something to show for it. And if not, we need to retreat into the deep recesses of our rooms lest we be reminded that another year has passed and we have failed to find someone.
I would continue my argument against Valentine’s Day in a similar vein, except if I do so, I risk fulfilling that rom-com stereotype of the cynical-but-actually-lovelorn character whose true love is rounding the corner in the course of the nonexistent plot. Let’s face it: Valentine’s Day is a story we tell ourselves to explain away our hunger for affection. And as uber-competitive college students whose environment already favors deteriorating mental health, do we really need another opportunity to pretend that everything’s rosy?
Sure, some people are in healthy relationships or genuinely enjoy the holiday. It’s also the time of the year when it’s socially acceptable to shoot your shot with minimal embarrassment. But maybe Valentine’s Day is just supposed to be the time of the year to step back and ponder our very philosophies of love…
Love It: Let us love the day of love — Peyton A. Jones
Right up there with HUDS and country music, everyone loves to hate Valentine’s Day. The same old tirade about the holiday being a capitalist scam is trotted out every February like clockwork, both by singles and people in relationships. But I have to ask, why does a holiday about love attract so much hate?
Sure, Valentine’s Day might be a reminder that you spend more time in Lamont than on dates, but it doesn’t have to be a bummer. Instead of using your Facebook stalking skills to keep tabs on what your ex’s plans are for Cupid Day, find some fun events to treat yourself or some friends to a sweet holiday outing, like a trip to the Museum of Science Planetarium for a Valentine’s Day Drag King Show or to L.A. Burdick’s for some truly decadent hot chocolate. You can even make the holiday fun without stepping foot outside — challenge your other single friends to a competition to see who can get the most Tinder matches in one night.
Valentine’s Day is the gift that keeps on giving — hit up the Harvard Square CVS the day after for some discount candy. V-Day may be a capitalist scheme, but that doesn’t mean you can’t reap the benefits.
Let the haters hate, but this Thursday, use the most ~wholesome~holiday of the year to love yourself and your friends.
