After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said he anticipates that “as many as 50 students” will test positive for the coronavirus “soon after arrival on campus.”
Garber said the estimate is based on the number of students coming to campus — around 25 percent of undergraduates — and the “overall prevalence of the coronavirus nationwide.”
“Most would likely have minimal or no symptoms,” he said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication. “We have put the systems in place to prepare for this possibility and many other contingencies.”
The interview with Garber and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen comes amid a nationwide reconsideration of university reopening plans.
Several schools within the Ivy League — including Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University — have reversed their fall reopening plans. The University of North Carolina switched to an all-remote learning plan one week after the school reopened to a sharp increase in coronavirus cases, while the University of Notre Dame suspended in-person classes after the school reported hundreds of new cases.
Unlike other institutions across the county, Garber said Harvard has “sharply limited” the number of students returning to campus.
“Across the country, colleges and universities developed a wide variety of plans for the fall,” he said. “Some of the institutions with outbreaks brought a much larger percentage of students to campus — two-thirds of their student body or even more — than will Harvard.”
On top of state travel regulations, Nguyen said that Harvard-specific safety measures will “engage” students as soon as they arrive.
“Our hope is that we are able to identify people who have COVID-19 quickly, before they are highly infectious and before they have exposed many other people,” he said. “After identification, we will be able ensure that these students are supported, and that others in the broader community are not subsequently exposed.”
Nguyen added the University has separate buildings capable of isolating hundreds of undergraduates who test positive at a time. He said students on campus who test positive will have single rooms with a private bathroom. HUHS and College personnel will monitor them during isolation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Economics professor Michael R. Kremer ’85, one of the recipients of the 2019 Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences, is leaving Cambridge to direct a new Development Innovation Lab at the University of Chicago.
“The University of Chicago’s commitment to the Development Innovation Lab provides a tremendous opportunity to develop new knowledge on ways to address global poverty and ultimately to expand economic opportunity and improve lives,” Kremer wrote in an email. “I am excited to join the faculty at Chicago and to help build the Lab.”
Kremer, who will join both the Economics and Harris School of Public Policy faculties at the University of Chicago, will begin his new roles on Sept. 1.
Harvard Economics chair Jeremy C. Stein wrote in an email to the department faculty that Kremer's departure is an “enormous loss.”
“This is an enormous loss and we will miss Michael terribly—as a scholar, colleague, mentor, and friend,” Stein wrote. “But I know you join me in wishing both Michael and Rachel all the best in their new endeavors at Chicago.
Kremer wrote that he will remember his three decades — including more than 20 years as a professor — at Harvard fondly.
“I have had a wonderful experience at Harvard as an undergraduate, graduate student, and faculty member, and learned a tremendous amount from colleagues and students here,” he wrote.
Kremer won the 2019 Nobel Prize along with MIT Economics professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo for their research on alleviating global poverty.
The group pioneered a new approach to development economics: conducting experiments with randomized controlled trials to explore the root causes of poverty in developing countries.
Kremer was scheduled to teach ECON 2390: “Development Economics” and several graduate seminars this fall, and Freshman Seminar 41J: “Economic Development” in the spring. The Freshman Seminar Program announced on its website that the course would no longer be offered.
