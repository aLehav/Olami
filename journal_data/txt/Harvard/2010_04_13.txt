After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You can’t live your life believing every ten-penny self-proclaimed teacher, critic, agent, etc.,” writes David Mamet in “True and False,” his 1997 treatise on acting, “Your first and most important tool is common sense.” Mamet’s words of advice for the young actor are wise. A veteran playwright and director, he knows as well as anyone else that there is a lot of pabulum passed off as legitimate acting technique or theory. More importantly, he knows that even some rudimentary logic can deflate the argument of a charlatan.
In light of this fact, it is difficult to account for the deep-seated argumentative flaws in his most recent book—the simply and aptly titled “Theatre.” A collection of 27 brief chapters, Mamet’s book is an exposition of his opinions on everything from Constantin Stanislavsky’s method to the Great American Play and a host of other subjects relating to theatre.
These are lofty topics, to be sure, and he makes quite a number of lofty claims about them. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with a book taking on such a grand scope, Mamet does so without any sense of rigor. In “Theatre,” he makes a number of fascinating and provocative claims, but they are ultimately founded on flimsy arguments that are more reductive than revelatory. The end result is a read that is mostly frustrating with its self-important tone and baseless claims.
Ever the iconoclast, Mamet takes on the role of the heretic in “Theatre.” Much of the book is spent attempting to dismantle ideas that have been the foundation of theatre-making for over a century. Mamet seems to have no problem unabashedly denouncing his predecessors, but Stanislavsky unequivocally bears most of the criticism in Mamet’s book. “Stanislavsky’s trilogy is a bunch of useless gack,” he writes, “Brecht’s gibberish about the alienation effect is, as proved by a lot of Joe Papp’s oeuvre in the seventies, unimplementable.”
His actual critique of Stanislavsky, however, is mostly based on an uncharitable, oversimplified reading of the director’s prolific work: “Stanislavsky’s famed (if essentially hypothetical) system, then, was and is the dissection of the motives and emotions of the character. One hundred years of actors have wasted their time in this pointless pursuit.” He proceeds to expound on why the emphasis on character over plot is a flawed method of theater making, but he never successfully validates his vitriolic reading of Stanislavski. To take on a figure so influential, one must do more than simply excoriate his work, but Mamet has an unfortunate tendency to make overstated claims without enough substantive proof or analysis.
Even when he praises other artists, the compliments seem oddly back-handed. In a chapter about Great American Plays, he lauds many authors, but gives special credit to Thornton Wilder for “Our Town.” Mamet has some intriguing thoughts about how the play utilizes language with verisimilitude to American dialect. The problem is that he insists that “the vulgate, the actual language of the people can be found only in the cultural anathemas known as popular entertainment.” This argument is tenuously developed to a frustrating conclusion: “The job of the dramatist is to get, and that of the actors and directors to keep, the asses in the seats. Period. This is what pays the rent.... The purpose of theatre is not to instruct, to better, to expiate. It is to entertain.” Mamet’s perspective on drama is simply reductive. To say writers such as Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee are worthwhile simply because they put “asses in seats” is to grossly undermine the impact they have had on dramatic literature. Beyond that, it is incredibly restrictive to ascribe entertainment as the sole purpose of drama.
One of the underlying problems of “Theatre” is that Mamet’s style of writing does not lend itself to sophisticated argumentation. His dramatic dialogue is iconic—often referred to as “Mametspeak”—and his plays are full of terse and crude language. The effect translates to his nonfiction as well, and much of language in “Theatre” has the colloquial feel of dialogue, which does little to lend credibility to his opinions. Rhetorical questions abound—many of which he subsequently answers himself. The phrase “blah blah blah” even makes an appearance.
Brevity is another key factor to Mamet’s writing—chapters are rarely longer than four or five pages, and paragraphs are often only a sentence or two. The trouble is that this concise style renders his arguments insufficient. To dismiss Stanislavski’s entire body of work in seven pages without even quoting the man is more than just a stylistic gaffe—it creates a tone of self-importance and haughtiness that is a aggravating as is it unconvincing.
It is lamentable that Mamet’s actual writing doesn’t do a better job of motivating his arguments, because he does occasionally make truly insightful observations. In a chapter titled “Hunting Instincts” he compares the theatrical experience to that of a hunt, insofar as the audience experiences a primal drive to follow the plot along. He uses this metaphor to account for the suspension of disbelief: “We suspend the rational process of intellectualization, which is to say, of the comparison of phenomenon to idea, which is a process too slow for the hunt.” The connection he draws between the theater and the primal rings true, even if the analogy he uses to explicate his point is a bit overwrought.
While such moments of enlightenment appear sporadically throughout, Mamet’s arguments lack any sense of nuance and his writing style does not help him support his opinions. If anything, his trademark style comes off as supercilious in the context of nonfiction. There is some value to the incendiary nature of the questions he poses—his opposition to canonical theater artists is almost admirable in its total conviction—but the failure to effectively substantiate his claims renders this book an exercise in futility. However, to call Mamet a charlatan would be to commit the same error he does in “Theatre.” As one of the seminal theatre artists of our age, his ideas are certainly important—hopefully Mamet will heed his own advice and employ a little more “common sense” while penning his next book.

Alexis de Tocqueville is famously taught in American middle schools and high schools as the Frenchman who loved America and who wrote the treatise “Democracy in America” in the mid-19th century. There is usually no further discussion of the man or his famous book before moving on to material deemed more important by state-standardized testing boards. The motives behind Tocqueville’s mission are therefore overlooked and any meaninful insight into his character is completely lost.
Tocqueville once wrote, in reference to the danger of America’s non-authoritarian, self-governing society, “Once an idea has taken hold of the American people’s minds, whether it’s a just one or an unreasonable one, nothing is more difficult than to uproot it.” One could say Harvard Professor Leo Damrosch faces this challenge in writing “Toqueville’s Discovery of America.” In his new book, Damrosch is attempting to remedy the general American conception of Tocqueville through a meticulously-researched, accessible, and thoroughly charming account of the writer’s journey across 19th-century America. Instead of leaving Tocqueville as the flat character oft-quoted in college government and history classes, Damrosch delves into letters, journals, and accounts—many published for the first time in English—to fill in the missing dimensions of the political thinker’s life and experience in America.
“Tocqueville’s Discovery of America” reads more like a novel than a deeply-investigated historical text. Damrosch weaves insights pieced together from his extensive research with many of Tocqueville’s own words and those of his companion, Gustave de Beaumont, to construct a biography of Tocqueville. Scattered throughout the text are illustrations of Tocqueville, the people he met, and the scenery he witnessed on his journey, contributing to the authentic, accessible feel of the book. In addition, the intimate details of Tocqueville’s life—from his loss of faith to his sexual adventures—add color, humor, and warmth to the image of the social scientist.
Damrosch’s purpose in “Tocqueville’s Discovery of America,” however, is not solely to demystify the man behind the famous work of social science. The anecdotes about Tocqueville serve a greater purpose: to illuminate the ideas and thought processes of an author who wrote the text that continues to define American democracy across the world.
One of the most striking chapters is “Boston: Democracy as a State of Mind,” in which Damrosch recounts Tocqueville’s run-ins with Boston bluebloods and intellectuals, who were more like French aristocrats than any Americans that he had met up to that point. Between his discussions with intellectuals and civilians that he met on the streets, Tocqueville became aware of the distinct separation between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law in America. He concluded that the “habits of the heart” and the ideals of the common people held together a society as much as written laws.
He also came to understand the different methods of centralization that caused such a huge difference between French and American societies. The astounding French bureaucracy and central decision-making process in Paris meant that French communes “vegetated in invincible apathy.” By contrast, Tocqueville saw that the American system of umbrella federal governance with state and local administration and enforcement allowed citizens to come up with and execute innovative new ideas via “local initiative.” As Josiah Quincy, then President of Harvard and previously Mayor of Boston, informed Tocqueville, the lack of overbearing central authority in America and the abundance of “individual enterprises [surpassed] by far what any administration could undertake.”
Damrosch also highlights some of Tocqueville’s less well-known views. By exploring Tocqueville’s experiences in Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and many other Southern states, Damrosch addresses Tocqueville’s reservations about the treatment of race in the United States. Tocqueville was vehemently against the enslavement of blacks and the poor treatment of Native Americans, and concluded in an incredibly prescient manner that the discrimination against blacks in America would result in “the most horrible of all civil wars, and perhaps the destruction of one of the two races.”
Despite the easy accessibility of “Tocqueville’s Discovery of America” and its colorful anecdotes, the book does tend to run on the dry side from time to time. “Democracy in America” is a monumental text in and of itself, and while an in-depth account of Tocqueville and Beaumont’s journey across America lends a sense of time and place to such an important work, it drags a bit when it strays from its focus on illuminating Tocqueville’s most famous book.
Regardless, Damrosch’s work lends insight into the mind of the man who defined America for the world. In “Tocqueville’s Discovery of America,” Damrosch explains the diverse experiences that allowed Tocqueville to both construct and critique America’s political ideology and the pulse of its society. As Tocqueville himself once said, “Everything I see, everything I hear, everything I still see from far away, forms a confused mass in my mind that I may never have the time or ability to disentangle. It would be an enormous labor to present a tableau of a society as vast and un-homogenous as this one.” Damrosch’s careful labor in recreating Tocqueville’s journey is not unlike his subject’s work in dissecting the vast and varied American culture.

This past year the National Book Award celebrated its 60th anniversary by conducting a public poll to select the best work of fiction that had won the award. To make the short list for this poll, the National Book Foundation balloted a number of select writers to pick their three favorite winners. Interestingly, four out the six books chosen were short story collections—the collected stories of William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Flannery O’Connor, and John Cheever respectively. Only two were novels—Thomas Pynchon’s “Gravity’s Rainbow” and Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man”—which suggests that there should be a different focus in the traditionally novel-dominated study of 20th century American literature.
There is an inherent prejudice in literary culture against the story as a lesser art form than the novel. Literary critics are obsessed with arguing about the so-called Great American Novel, but one never hears a debate about what could be termed the Great American Story. Many claim that the short story is dead, arguing that most contemporary writers write stories while in school as a mere stepping stone to eventually writing novels. Ironically, the short story is the most organic American literary form, largely developed by authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Aside from the historical roots of the story, there seems to be a valid argument that the short story is better suited to capture the flavor of American life.
The short story offers inherent advantages over the novel, stemming simply from the length, which imposes a certain focus and brevity on the author’s prose. The writer can simply offer an evocative scene, without the pressure of maintaining plot momentum and design over the course of a full-length novel. Perhaps the greatest strength of the form is that the story relies so heavily on what is left unsaid. Every gesture, every phrase, every detail in a great story takes on additional significance since it both signals the literal action and evokes everything that is left out of a scene.
No writer better exemplifies the importance of the unspoken than Flannery O’Connor. O’Connor’s fiction features the recurring Catholic themes of the fallen nature of man, grotesque humanity, and violent salvation. Many of her stories climax with a confrontation between two archetypal characters. One is often an entitled southern lady with a superior attitude, while the other figure is typically of a lower-class, seemingly ignorant or naïve. The tension gradually builds throughout the story until it is released when the working-class character suddenly attacks or humiliates his privileged counterpart. This kind of reversal, which occurs so often in O’Connor’s work, not only highlights the sinful arrogance of humanity but also overturns the social dynamics of Southern society. The condensed structure of the short story is the perfect form for O’Connor’s exercise in vicious catharsis. These brutal acts of violence become a radical form of the Catholic concept of grace. In O’Connor’s fiction, God’s grace manifests itself in the human world through violence, and the reaction of mankind is often no more than ambivalence or even scorn.
But the fate of O’Connor’s characters after they experience a moment of grace is often left unresolved. At the end of “A Good Man is Hard to Find,” the reader cannot know if the infamous criminal “The Misfit” will reform his life after murdering the family’s grandmother. In the story “Good Country People,” Hulga Hopewell is left trapped on the top floor of a barn when her artificial leg is stolen by a Bible salesman. It is unclear whether any character will be saved or change in any way. It is what is left unsaid and unresolved that lends these stories their impact.
The particular strengths of O’Connor’s writing are perfectly fitted to the form of the short story, which becomes increasingly apparent by comparing her short fiction with her novel “Wise Blood.” The novel follows the many disturbing encounters of the sardonic prophet Hazel Motes, who preaches the idea of the “Church Without Christ” while wandering through the South. Accordingly, the novel seems to be a series of stories strung together, but the incidents and violence lose their sting when compiled on top of each other without the tight structure in O’Connor’s short fiction. The emotional power of each shocking episode is slowly diluted to the point where Hazel’s ultimate death becomes anesthetized.
The conclusion of “Wise Blood” seems almost tacked-on, simply to leave the reader with a sense of finality. At the end of the book the corpse of Hazel Motes is returned to his boarding house after he runs away because his landlady is pressuring him to marry her. The novel comes to a close as the landlady looks into Hazel’s eyes “trying to see how she had been cheated or what had cheated her, but she couldn’t see anything... she felt as if she were blocked at the entrance of something.” While the endings of many of O’Connor’s short stories leave her reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty towards the human condition, “Wise Blood” ends with a scene of banal mystery that is not worth exploring.
Some may argue it is unfair to judge the difference between short and long fiction by examining an author such as Flannery O’Connor who is acclaimed for her stories and not her novels. However, this somewhat lopsided example conveys the specific strengths of the short story. While not offering the complex world of a novel, a short story collection can offer genuine snapshots of real human activity. Perhaps American life is better represented through these short visions than through the grand and singular narrative of a novel.

The relationship between the three ‘blood-brothers’ in “The Warlords” is a bromance of epic proportions. General Pang (Jet Li), Wu Yang (Takeshi Kaneshiro), and Er Hu (Andy Lau) travel together, share each other’s space, fight over women, and defend one another like characters in a typical Judd Apatow film. Their bromance is complicated, however, by the fact that they are three of the most powerful warlords in late-Qing dynasty China, and their brotherly spats result in starvation, massacre, and wholesale destruction of entire cities rather than knocked-up girls and marijuana misadventures.
“The Warlords” begins with a violent battle in which General Pang is the only survivor. In shock, he wanders around China and is restored to health by the lovely Lian Sheng (Xu Jinglei), after which he meets Er Hu and Wu Yang, two skilled leaders of a ragtag army that pillages and steals to survive. Impressed by each other’s fighting skills and ideals, the three men make a pact to become blood-brothers—it seems like the start of a beautiful friendship.
Almost as soon as the three generals make their pact though, the foundation of their brotherhood starts to crumble. General Pang and Lian Sheng fall in love and begin an affair, despite the fact that Lian Sheng is Er Hu’s wife. Pang’s ambition grows as he leads the brothers and their armies to victory after victory against rebels in the kingdom; but with increased ambition comes increased corruption. He is often in conflict with the purer morals of his brothers, and his determination to become a powerful government official turns “The Warlords” from a war-movie bromance into a devastating moral tragedy centered around the complete destruction of a friendship.
The movie is the most engaging when it explores the emotional complexities of the warlords’ relationship and the challenging decisions they must make. The epic battle scenes and elaborate fight choreography rival those of “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, but to some extent they serve as a distraction from the dynamics of the characters, who are amazingly acted by Li, Kaneshiro, and Lau. Every facial expression, gesture, and spoken line of the three men, particularly Li, is so firmly embedded in character that the presence of the actor is virtually invisible. They work together seamlessly as a team, and watching them act out the slow destruction of their characters’ relationship is as much a study in acting as it is an accomplishment on film.
Their acting chops are especially evident in the most memorable scene of the movie, in which the brothers have to decide whether to slaughter unarmed soldiers so that their own troops don’t have to starve or honor their promise to spare and feed the soldiers. Er Hu, moved by compassion, starts to feed the soldiers and plead for their lives, while General Pang, the ruthless and strategic general, has Er Hu locked up so that he cannot protest the massacre of the unarmed soldiers. Lau’s desperate clawing at his chains and guttural shouts as he is locked up express the agony of Er Hu remarkably well, and the look of stunned defeat on his face when he is finally released is painful to watch. Li plays the part of General Pangg in an incredibly nuanced way, betraying his character’s seemingly stoic face as he makes the decision to kill the men with desperately conflicted eyes and a single tear that slowly falls down his face.
The acting and battle choreography are not the only strong elements in the film. The costumes, sets, and cinematography perfectly capture the desperate conditions of wartime, the exhaustion and pain of the characters, and the aesthetic of mid-nineteenth century China. The film’s script is equally strong; despite the heaviness of the plot and the moral decisions the characters must make, there is still warmth, humor, and wit in their lines.
One of the few flaws in the movie is the character of Lian Sheng. Despite Lian’s important role in the story and the depth of emotion that her character should possess, Jinglei does not do much more with her character than stare forlornly into the distance with a flat expression. She does not inspire compassion or sympathy, and the chilling conclusion to her role in the film is difficult to watch because of the misguided intentions behind it, not because her character will be missed. As one of the only women featured in the movie, she is a disappointing and under-acted character.
The central focus of “The Warlords,” despite all of the action scenes and moral pontificating, is the exploration of relationships between men who love each other. With its epic scope and emotional sensibility, Chan has crafted an awe-inspiring tale of the human condition.

When asked about his music, The Doors’ iconic lead singer Jim Morrison drawls, “There is a heavy, gloomy feeling of someone not quite at home...  aware of a lot of things but not sure of anything.” That feeling pervades this portrait of The Doors, lovingly assembled by director and writer Tom Dicillo, who recounts the history of the tumultuous band while trying to disentangle fact from myth.
Using original footage shot between 1966 and 1971, “When You’re Strange” is a refreshing documentary in that it refrains from feeling like a nostalgic home video. It somehow manages to preserve an air of mystery while stating fact. Though a seemingly random choice of narrator, Johnny Depp actually gives depth to the movie by delivering the stories and details in a reverent tone.
The movie opens with footage of a grizzled Morrison on a deserted highway, presumably on a road trip, with radio coverage of his death serving as the score. The juxtaposition is confusing and haunting, and an appropriate introduction to the story of such a complex man and his band.
The movie quickly backtracks to images of the turbulent 1960s, introducing the viewer to the troubled times in which The Doors emerged. The band starts as most do: one talented person meets another, who has other talented friends, and they come together pretty casually. But the person who stands out almost immediately is Morrison, and it is his life that the film essentially follows, up until his sudden death in 1971.
Dicillo offers an intimate look at Morrison, allowing the viewer to see him as person, not just another rock star falling off the deep end. The film even includes footage of Morrison in his hometown with his family, when he started reading Friedrich Nietzsche and William Blake at the age of 16. In fact, the name of the band originates from a line in Blake’s “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.”
The film premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, and was received with appreciation as a tribute not just to music, but to the generation that followed it. And though Val Kilmer put a valiant, uncanny effort into portraying Morrison in Oliver Stone’s 1991 homage “The Doors,” it is really more exciting to watch the real thing. There is also no doe-eyed Meg Ryan to distract from the excitement of The Doors’ ride to fame. Dicillo’s documentary also lacks the exaggerated flamboyance that pervades Stone’s adaptation. Instead of making it seem that Morrison was born in the spotlight, DiCillo offers a very candid perspective, effectively highlighting Morrison’s metamorphosis from a shy, unsure singer to the wild performer who became conditioned to relish attention.
Morrison’s self-described “music for the different and the uninvited” serves as a perfect score to the story of his life. DiCillo does a great job of including both hits and lesser-known songs when appropriate. It is especially poignant to hear Morrison croon “The End” as images of other fallen legends, including Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, drift across the screen.
The documentary only disappoints when it restates information that is already commonly known. The film is targeted at Doors fans, and many of them already know of Morrison’s struggles and escapades. Some of these include being dragged offstage by police in New Haven, as well as his alleged indecent exposure onstage in Miami. Since all the band’s original members but Morrison are still alive, it would have been nice to get their perspective on their late band mate and his eccentric behavior.
“When You’re Strange” is a very intimate look at the talent and peculiarity of Morrison and the influential music his band created. Those unfamiliar with The Doors might find this a path to enlightenment, if not revelation.

Every year, the famous jewel-toned glass that illuminates the interior of the Gothic cathedral of Nôtre Dame de Chartres attracts millions of visitors to France. However, just as this kind of pilgrimage has taken on new and divergent significance from the spiritual and the religious nature it did seven centuries ago, the priceless and ornate windows also lack the luminosity they once demonstrated during the Middle Ages.
Headed by Patrice Calvel, architect-in-chief of the Historical Monuments in France, the Chartres Cathedral restoration team publicized their efforts to raise money to restore the Cathedral’s former grandeur in one of the series of lectures on April 2 held by Harvard’s Committee on Medieval Studies. Financial need aside, the talk updated the attendees on the team’s progress and stressed the importance of broadening the national scope of the project into an international concern.
“Every medium has its own demands, and every object has suffered unique damage... [Chartres’s] windows, so recently dull, now sparkle thanks to the restoration. I am all for it,” History of Art and Architecture A.B. Julia E. Schlozman ’09 said in an email.
Most famous for its extensive collection of stained glass windows, Chartres’ cathedral has been on the list of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites since 1979. Since then, active and consistent restoration efforts have rid most of the cathedral’s windows and stonework of grime buildup from the past centuries. In order to sustain the program, non-profit organizations like the American Friends of Chartres (AFC), based in New York, and its French counterpart, Chartres Sanctuaire du Monde (CSM), were founded to seek direct, mostly fiscal contribution to accelerate the process.
“We are a conduit for enabling Americans to contribute to Chartres because those who have been there have been touched by its magic. It’s just very special, and [the cathedral has] always been a mystical place, spiritually and aesthetically,” AFC president Monika Riely says.
Supporters of the cathedral’s restoration urge that although Chartres cathedral is a French building, it possesses intellectual, spiritual, and artistic value for all countries and not just for France or the United States.
“It’s not only for the French people. There are so many people who have visited the Chartres cathedral. It’s a universal issue. Our mission is to make known the present state of the cathedral to complement the French people’s [restoration] work,” CSM president Servane de Layre-Matheus says.
According to sixth-year History of Art and Architecture graduate student, Shirin Fozi, the United States’ interest in the cathedral lies not only in a touristic fascination with centuries-old buildings, but also a deep, historical connection to France.
“You could look at something like the destruction of Reims [Cathedral] in World War I and the reaction in the U.S., suggesting that there is a long history of Americans feeling connected to medieval France, but that’s not a reason why we ‘should’ care. [It’s] just evidence that Americans have long cared about issues of cultural preservation, particularly in France because the US has seen itself as France’s intellectual heir since the days of Franklin and Jefferson,” said Fozi, in an e-mail.
Most of the difficulty with retroactive restoration thus lies not in obtaining moral or financial support, but in dealing with ethical issues of authenticity and the redoing of misguided, past restorative efforts. However, Fozi says that such mistakes are due to the lack of scientific technology required to take on the delicate task of piecing together the original vision of the cathedral. Now with the availability of new and advanced techniques of handling stained glass, restorers can turn their focus to other ideological issues of restoration.
“The main difficulty has been in the ethical decisions that we have had to make with regards to restoring parts of the cathedral. The important thing is to have the mentality of an architect of the past,” Cavel says. “We try to maintain this authenticity by, for example, using stone from the Bercheres quarry, where the original stone for the Chartres cathedral comes from.”
The publicity in the United States has its advantages in targeting a younger audience in an academic context. Institutions like Harvard provide not only the potential for financial investment in the projects, but also an intellectual source for ideas and advancement in education for the monuments.
“Universities provide art-historical and scientific expertise to guide restoration and analyze its results. Even if university affiliates are not directly involved with the restoration itself, many of the people most interested in the restoration of medieval monuments are to be found on college campuses,” said Schlozman. “Besides, it’s always good for art historians inside and outside the academy to talk to one another.”
Echoing Scholzman’s sentiments, Layre-Matheus recognizes that these scholarly discussions begin with the students. While most will not likely be able to contribute significant monetary donations, their enthusiasm and admiration for Chartres Cathedral ensure that conservation efforts will not remain stagnant in the coming generations.
“This is an open activity. We hope that students will also gain interest and that this will perhaps also be a project for the younger generation,” she says.

Steve Carell and Tina Fey’s onscreen chemistry shines in the chaotic and funny story of a married suburban couple in “Date Night.” The two combine slapstick and sarcasm in a winning combination, and turn this far-fetched story of wrong-place-wrong-time into something hilarious and original. However, given the focus on comedy and adventure, the typical formula for romance feels somewhat unnatural.
Phil (Carell) and Claire (Fey) Foster are a typical suburban couple who are starting to notice just how bland their marriage has become. When the Fosters find out that one of the happiest couples they know is splitting up, the two decide to spice up their weekly ‘date night’ with a dinner in the city. After appropriating the dinner reservation of a pair of absentee diners—who happen to be petty criminals—the Fosters’ night gets progressively and entertainingly worse.
Though Fey had no official hand in the writing, her performance embodies her signature brand of sophisticated comedy with an immature flair. Carell also falls into his familiar, loveable-yet-bumbling routine, accusing his wife of “lighting up like a sparkly sparkle” when laying eyes on another man. The two play off each other wonderfully, creating the dream team of comedy that many hoped they would be.
In fact, the two get along so well that sometimes it’s hard to believe their characters are supposed to be married. As the two fend off crooked cops, mob bosses, and tattooed criminals, all the while cracking jokes, their romance seems to be the least important element in the film. So when the two do go through the motions of couples in other romantic comedies—including moments of communication breakdown, self-awareness, and atonement—they feels out of place and slow the movie down considerably.
Aside from these momentary lapses, the movie carries itself very well. The script is extremely quotable and rife with entertaining vulgarities. Carell and Fey also make some potentially conventional scenes uniquely hilarious, including a misguided car chase and possibly the least-incognito performance in a strip club.
It is, however, a bit disconcerting when other stars start coming out of the woodwork. Mark Wahlberg makes a memorable appearance as a security intelligence expert who refuses to put his shirt on. Ray Liotta plays a stereotypical mob boss by the name of Joe Miletto, Leighton Meester pops up as a scheming babysitter, and James Franco and Mila Kunis play the petty criminals for whom the Fosters are being mistaken. At times it’s a bit distracting, but each star makes a small but satisfying contribution to the movie.
While there is never any real fear that the Fosters won’t survive their night in the city, and their marriage never seems in danger of disintegration, such tensions are ultimately trivial. The movie is a comedy, and shouldn’t be treated as anything else. Carell and Fey’s collaboration definitely lives up to the hype and is worth seeing. And the movie also provides a timeless moral: don’t steal someone else’s reservation!

“The Losers,” a new film by Sylvain White opening April 23, follows the misadventures of a black ops team betrayed by an inside man. Left for dead in the jungles of Bolivia, the “Losers,” as they’ve been dubbed, decide to track down the man who betrayed them, an evil mastermind known as Max who plans to drag the world into a technological World War III.
Columbus Short and Chris Evans co-star as two members of a five-man team that spend the movie kicking butt and taking names. Short plays Pooch, the laid-back, family man who acts as the team’s driver while Evans is Jensen, the smart-alec computer whiz.
Short, who is best known for his roles in “Stomp the Yard” and “Armored,” is both a husband and a father, and says that those personal roles that have helped prepare him for this one. “It’s not a departure at all, it’s actually a great help,” he said. “I don’t know if I’d necessarily be able to tap [into the role] in the right way if I wasn’t actually a family man.”
In reply, Evans quipped, “I just tend to play smart-asses.”
Neither of them had read comic books as children but when cast in “The Losers,” a film adaptation of the comic series of the same name, both began to read the books.
“‘The graphic novel is fantastic, period. [The film] is one of the closest translations I’ve seen from graphic novel to film and that alone is going to set it apart,” said Evans.
Maintaining that level of integrity called for months of filming in the hot jungles of Puerto Rico as well as extensive military training before shooting could even begin. Both men learned how to handle and fire many of the weapons that they use in the film and also underwent basic tactical training so they could realistically portray a coordinated military team.
“We had a guy named Harry Humphrey down there who was the real deal,” said Evans. “You know, this guy’s seen battle; he’s got bullets in his leg and he’d trained actors before so he knew how to help people who have absolutely zero experience… it was like summer camp for the military.”
That camaraderie was especially important in a movie without a huge star in the cast. “A lot of this movie lives and dies on the chemistry of the cast,” said Evans, “Even if the script’s great and the director’s great, if you don’t care about the characters and the relationships they have with one another then I think we missed the ball.”
Despite the heavy emphasis on action, both men insist that this is a movie without a demographic. The film includes both action and comedy and also includes a strong female character who should appeal to everyone, claimed Evans.
“There’s really no demographic, this is a film that’s going to preach to the masses I think,” said Evans.
Short has worked with White once before, on “Stomp the Yard.” When asked about this second encounter, he replied, “It was just as amazing as the first movie to be honest. When we were doing ‘Stomp the Yard,’ when we went into our last week of production I told him, ‘You know, man, the next [movie] we do, let’s blow some stuff up.’”
This relationship helped to ease the process of discovering characters, as the movie relied heavily on the actors’ improvisation. “Sometimes what’s on the page might read well but on its feet it just doesn’t quite translate as organic or as believable,” said Short.
“The best directors are willing to evolve, and go with the flow; you have to be organic about it and White was very accommodating.”
When asked what will set this film apart from the other movies in the genre, both men agreed it was the humor.
“It was good to go back and do some good old fashioned mama jokes,” said Evans.
“We kind of reinvented it. You gotta’ step it up if you know what I mean,” quipped Short in reply.

Last Tuesday, Lin-Manuel Miranda—writer, composer, and former star of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical “In the Heights”—came to speak at Harvard about his writing experiences and career. After his lecture at Professor Carol J. Oja’s course Literature and Arts B-85: “American Musicals and American Culture,” he sat down and talked with The Crimson about everything from the “Heights” and new musicals he’s currently working on to his creative process.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to incorporate more unconventional music styles, like rap, into your work?
Lin-Manuel Miranda: I’m a fan of storytelling, and I’m a fan of lots of different genres of music. I think that one of the things that unfortunately sometimes happens is you get people who only listen to musicals writing musicals and they don’t see what those composers were pulling from. So with “Heights,” I tried to bring in the music I love and use those types of music to tell stories. I’m always compelled by good storytelling, whether it’s Sondheim’s “A Weekend in the Country” from “A Little Night Music” or it’s “Meet the Parents” from “Blueprint 2” by Jay-Z, storytelling is storytelling. And the fun of it was not many people are trying to do it, so we really got to write the rules in terms of how we’ve used those genres.
THC: Could you describe a bit of your process?
LM: I wrote a draft my sophomore year; it wasn’t for course credit or anything. I just really felt like I needed to write it, and I wanted to write a full-length musical. They say to write what you know, so I took everything that I knew and threw it into the pot and called it “In the Heights,” and then over the course of the eight-year process getting “Heights” to Broadway, I learned how to write. It’s a lot of discarded songs and ideas, and a lot of making good songs better and throwing out bad songs. But I had the luxury of excellent collaborators and producers who believed in our show for what it was and not what it wasn’t.
THC: What were you looking to to bring to the genre of musicals with “In the Heights”?
LM: I think most writers try to put out in the world what they don’t see, and I wanted to write the kind of musical I’ve always wanted to see—and hip-hop is sorely lacking. I mean, if you’ve seen hip-hop in musicals before “Heights”—at least Broadway ones—if hip-hop is used, it’s ironically commenting, “Hey we’re rapping and we’re lame!” I wanted to just treat it as another kind of storytelling.
THC: Do you have any advice for any people at Harvard going into the arts?
LM: My advice is to keep writing. You have a lot of free time on your hands in college, so write as much as you can now. You will not have that free time when you are working a nine-to-five job trying to make your dreams come true. I wrote a play every year when I was in school, sometimes two, and I was determined to leave with more than my diploma under my arm. The other thing is to just be nice. That sounds so cliché, but you will meet the same people going up as you will going down. So treat the guy who has a lot of money you want to invest in your project the same as the pianist who may have gigged your show, because that guy may go one to become a composer and he could become a very important person in your life down the line.
THC: What are you thinking about doing in terms of future projects?
LM: I’m co-writing the score to a musical adaptation of “Bring It On” with Tom Kitt, who wrote “Next to Normal” and did the orchestrations for the upcoming “American Idiot.” I’m working on the movie adaptation of “Heights,” on a hip-hop album about Alexander Hamilton, and I’m working on an animated musical for DreamWorks.
THC: You grew up in a neighborhood similar to “In the Heights,” and it seems like you’ve placed a lot of that in how you’ve expressed yourself. Is it difficult to continue that in further works?
LM: You write what you know to be true, and I mean that in a much more abstract sense. You know, like this Hamilton project I’m working on. I’m not a founding father, I didn’t grow up during the Revolutionary War, but when I read Ron Chernow’s biography of Hamilton, there was something about Hamilton’s drive to excel and to use words to excel that really spoke to me in a way and I said, “I know that guy.” It’s not necessarily about the specifics, but about really trying to connect with something that you feel like you can do justice to.
THC: Finally, what’s your favorite musical and why?
LM: That’s an impossible question to answer. I can tell you the most important musical to “In the Heights” is “Fiddler on the Roof.” A lot of people think it’s “West Side Story,” but it’s actually “Fiddler,” because it really tries to paint a portrait of a community in the midst of change, and we were going for the same thing—although with different demographics and different styles.

“Pirates of Penzance,” like many other Gilbert & Sullivan productions, is no typical opera. This isn’t a dark, heart-wrenching tragedy nor do the performers sing in Italian. Instead, it is a show of pure, comic fun.
“It is one of Gilbert and Sullivan’s most popular and most widely performed works,” director Sara J. Libenson ’10 says. “It is different from other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, for others are known for biting satires and their criticism of bourgeoisie ideals. But this is nothing like that. Really it is just a comedy, and it is just hilarious—a rollicking good time.”
This latest production by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players follows the story of Frederic (Benjamin J. Nelson ’11), a young pirate apprentice who dreams of when he can be free from his pirate trade. In the opening scenes of the play, he meets the beautiful Mabel (Bridget Haile ’11) and, after falling in love with her, promises to marry her on completing his apprenticeship. But to the distress of the fated lovers, the Pirate King (Ilan J. Caplan ’10) informs Frederic that he will be released from his adventures not when he turns 21, but on his 21st birthday.
However, the catch is that since his birthday is on February 29, a leap year, this technicality forces him not only to serve his apprenticeship for another 63 years, but also to help the Pirate King force Mabel into marriage.
Although known for its unadulterated comedy, stage manager Chappell L.W. Sargent ’12 says that “Pirates” does intersperse poignant moments of real emotion.
“It is more than just jokes. It has a compelling narrative,” Sargent says. “Productions need moments of gravity to ground them. Sara has directed very emotional scenes which come in the middle of the light-hearted action.”
Libenson herself says that she wants the audience to feel connected to whatever is happening on the stage, whether it is with the most dramatic scene of the play or some of its more light-hearted situations.
“You need to care. If you don’t care, you are laughing at them,” she says. “We stop the action for the main couple to have a truly emotional moment, but then as soon as the scene is over we are right back into the action. We don’t want [the emotions] to hold down the comedy.”

As an art history concentrator, I spend my days studying the artistic greats, trying to understand what it is that makes them great. When I encounter them, they have already been sanctified by the academy and the museum, elevated to the pantheon of figures on the art history syllabus. But in a desperate attempt to build up my mental database of important artists, it’s easy to forget that there are artists beginning their careers today who will become the master artists of tomorrow. So recently, I decided to discover the work of young emerging artists from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA).
Founded in 1876, the SMFA has served as the training ground for internationally renowned artists such as Cy Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly, Nan Goldin, and Jim Dine. Just across the street from the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), the SMFA is housed in a building designed by Graduate School of Design grad Graham D. Gund, perhaps best known at Harvard as the architect of the guardhouse next to Johnston Gate.
Right now, much of the SMFA’s expansive gallery space is occupied by an exhibit featuring the work of five participants in the SMFA’s Fifth Year Certificate Program, designed for artists who have received a studio diploma from the SMFA and who seek to devote significant time to an individual project.
Participating artist Soojin Kim’s room of deceptively banal or kitsch paintings and sculptures of cookies and crackers tantalizes the viewer, while the half-eaten sweets evoke a sense of nostalgia or loss. Kim describes her work in relation to memories of her father indulging in American candies and sharing them with her during the Korean War. Despite the unity of the subject matter, Kim’s work exhibits a remarkable range, with a Wayne Thiebault-esque canvas of peanut butter cups, a bronze relief of a bitten Oreo, and a wall of small oil paintings arranged Salon-style in unique frames, featuring portraits of commonplace snack foods like Teddy Grahams, Goldfish, and animal crackers. Kim shares the gallery with fellow student Taylor Butler, whose large, quasi-abstract canvases featuring technologically-inspired imagery like a jet-ski or a car hauler, look like watered-down versions of Kristin Baker’s racecar-inspired paintings, without the saturated colors reminiscent of Pop art.
In the other gallery, Milo Fay’s series, “If a Poet Knows More,” displays lyrical photographs of horses made using an outdated 19th-century process in which iron acts as the light-sensitive agent, creating a delicate tonal range. Meanwhile, Japanese-born artist Atsuko Ito’s split-screen video documentary centering on conductor Florencia Gonzáles reflects the artist’s own training at the Berklee College of Music prior to enrolling at the SMFA.
Finally, Hae-Shin Chung’s installation, “The Cell—The Daily Life of a Sojourner,” is an amalgam of highly intricate silkscreen prints, projected images, and readymade objects covered in hot glue. The glue sheath gives the objects a unique duality—in the light they glimmer like crystal while in the shadows they appear to be coated in melted candle wax. The work of SMFA students, however, is not confined to the SMFA galleries. Next door, an exhibit at the MFA, which opened on Saturday April 10th, features the work of the five SMFA Traveling Scholars. The scholarship, awarded to select SMFA graduates annually since 1899, funds a year of travel and study, culminating in a show at the MFA.
This year’s show features work by Lizi Brown, Michael Bühler-Rose, Liz Cohen, Wendy Jean Hyde, and Christopher Lamberg-Karlovsky. It’s surely a daunting proposition for any emerging artist to share a roof with the likes of Rembrandt and Van Gogh, but this year’s crop largely stands up to the challenge. The stand-out is Lamberg-Karlovsky whose “erasure” and “archival” series explore the issue of memory in diverse ways.
As I left the student gallery space of the SMFA to enter the grand encyclopedic MFA, I felt like I was charting the path many young artists hope their work will take. Indeed, what is exceptional about schools attached to major museums like the SMFA is that they can offer a bridge to the professional world. For the artists chosen as Traveling Scholars, the exhibit represents a unique opportunity to be seen by thousands of visitors at one of the nation’s leading museums. For viewers like me, it was a reminder that artists graduating from art school today—some not much older than I—will be included in art history syllabi in the years to come.

Directed By Maria-Ilinca Radulian ’11
Produced By Ari C. Peña ’10
Martin McDonagh’s “The Pillowman” tells a tale of childhood trauma, violent political oppression, and a writer whose twisted stories gruesomely come to life. Yet in spite of its dark subject matters, it’s ingeniously hilarious.
“It’s an intense play,” says visiting scholar James R. Morris, who plays the unfortunate writer and protagonist, Katurian. “But it’s also very funny, and places brilliant moments of dark comedy alongside a real range of emotions.”
The story takes place in a police state and follows Katurian as he undergoes a brutal interrogation regarding his work. The detectives leading the investigation suspect the author of committing a series of child murders, which are incidences that closely resemble the plots of his short stories. In this production’s interpretation of the play, the narrative weaves together scenes from the interrogation and reenactments of Katurian’s own stories, blurring the line between the artist’s reality and the world of his invention.
“[The audience] should probably expect it to be disturbing in places, possibly slightly uncomfortable. It’s not a happy play,” Morris says. “It’s about someone being interrogated in a dictatorship and their life depending upon answers they give.”
In order to represent the fluid division between the play’s real and imagined worlds, set designer Elizabeth G. Shields ’10 has constructed a large mirrored box with glass walls to frame the action of Katurian’s memories and fantasies.
“The biggest challenge has been finding the best way to immediately communicate the fear, danger and threat of a space, and how you escape and don’t escape from that in [Katurian’s] stories,” Shields says.
Despite its dark subject matter, director Maria-Ilinca Radulian ’11 describes the tone of “The Pillowman” as “playful.”
“I believe that this kind of story which is so dark, about people getting tortured and censored and executed, can only be told through humor and poetry,” Radulian says. “We’re basically treating it as a fairy tale and enacting it as a fairy tale, and like all fairy tales, it’s based on something true in society—psychological things, trends, dark undercurrents.”
According to Radulian, “The Pillowman” ultimately blurs the boundary between fiction and reality to question the artist’s role in society.
“It’s a story that talks about the right of speech and when censorship should be put into effect,” she says. “It’s about the responsibility of the artist, knowing the power of art and that it can come true.”

The Boston Opera House boasts cavernous ceilings adorned with gold filigree and chandeliers, which naturally calls for performances of virtuosity. With the opening of its production “Coppélia” last Thursday in its home theater, Boston Ballet exhibited not only virtuosity, but also an artistic flair that brought a 140-year-old ballet to life in a world very different from its 1870 premiere.
Based on E.T.A. Hoffman’s book “Der Sandmann,” the classical ballet “Coppélia” was first choreographed by Arthur St. Léon to the music of Léo Delibes. It is one of the greatest comic classical ballets in history, telling the whimsical tale of the easily fooled Frantz, his love Swanilda, and their encounters with old Dr. Coppélius, the town toy-maker and magician. Though Frantz originally pesters Dr. Coppélius, he is lured by the beauty of the scheming toy-maker’s life-sized doll Coppélia and bewitched with magic sleeping potion. All the while, clever Swanilda fools both the toy-maker and Frantz—her husband-to-be—in a wildly entertaining tale of ironic mishaps.
Though retaining traditional elements, Boston Ballet’s production follows George Balanchine’s neoclassical choreography of “Coppélia.” The ballet was originally cast in 1974 for Patricia McBride (Swanilda) and Helgi Tomasson (Frantz), two of Balanchine’s greatest stars in the New York City Ballet. This spring, Judith Fugate staged “Coppélia” for two of Boston’s own stars: Misa Kuranaga and Nelson Madrigal.
Kuranaga’s performance as the charming Swanilda evokes McBride’s distinctive articulation and finesse. As the curtains opened on the set of a quaint Austro-Hungarian village, Kuranaga took to the stage with flawless technique, embodying the spirit of the young, vivacious Swanilda with spunk. Madrigal portrayed a naïve and good-natured Frantz, complementing Kuranaga both in character and skill. The first act was light and playful—the dancers of the corps de ballet (the chorus of the Boston Ballet company) swished their period costumes in Balanchine’s authentic character dances. Character dances are stylized portrayals of folk or national dances.
The most amusing act of “Coppélia” was the second, as both Swanilda and Frantz delved into mischief. Swanilda and her friends crept through the dark scenery of Dr. Coppélius’s home, winding up his elaborate mechanical dolls to dance around the workshop. Kuranaga revealed her girlish good when she disguised herself as Dr. Coppélius’s beloved doll, fooling the old toy-maker into thinking his masterwork had come to life. Dr. Coppélius, played by the comical Boyko Dossev, hobbled around the stage in delight as Kuranaga danced a Scottish reel and a Spanish fandango. His delight turned to dismay when she revealed her trick and ran from the workshop hand-in-hand with Frantz. It is in this second act that Léo Delibes is truly distinguished as a dancer’s composer. His symphonic score faithfully highlights the ballet’s plotline while drawing upon national themes and adding whimsical sound effects to hold the attention of the audience. Though conducting for ballet is notoriously difficult, Maestro Jonathon McPhee skillfully led the Boston Ballet Orchestra while paying close attention to the dancers on the stage.
The third act of “Coppélia” is entirely Balanchine’s own work, as the focus shifts from the storyline to the dancing itself. In the Festival of the Bells, the townspeople celebrated their new village bell tower in front of a breathtaking set; the wings were adorned with bouquets while garlands and bells hung from above. In a series of dances to commemorate moments when the town bells would be rung—dawn, prayer, work, war, and peace—Boston Ballet’s principals and soloists performed with grace. Soloist Rie Ichikawa (as Dawn) and Whitney Jensen (as Spinner), one of the corps de ballet, gave particularly technically sound performances. They were accompanied by more than 30 young students of the Boston Ballet School, who were endearing in their meticulous symmetric formations and tiny pink tutus.
The Festival of the Bells also welcomed the newly wedded Swanilda and Frantz in their closing pas de deux, a duet for a man and a woman. Kuranaga again demonstrated her versatility as an artist: the elegance and poise of a new bride took the place of the mischievous spirit she exuded in Dr. Coppélius’s workshop. Madrigal distinguished himself as a skilled partner, presenting Kuranaga with ease.
With the swell of the orchestra, all of the dancers in the Festival of the Bells returned behind the married couple in the finale, dancing together toward the ballet’s jubilant conclusion. “Coppélia” is a testament to the high caliber of  Kuranaga, Madrigal, and the rest of Boston Ballet’s technical and artistic skill.

“When I heard that my magazine was banned, I thought that it had died. I thought that its body was corrupted, like a human being, adding dust to dust,” says Iranian writer and editor Shahriar Mandanipour in reference to the censorship he experienced in his home country. “This event, the Living Magazine, I thought, could wake it up from its grave, like Lazarus, even if for one night.”
The Living Magazine—an event taking place this Wednesday at the Sackler Museum—aims to share some of the works of censored international writers, like Mandanipour, hailing from countries including Iran, Burma, and China. The featured writers will be giving presentations about their work as editors of publications, all of which have been banned by their government except for that of Burmese writer Ma Thida.
The Living Magazine is this year’s installment of the Visiting Writers Series, a project initiated by expository writing preceptor Jane E. Unrue last spring. Unrue says that the idea for this event stemmed from her experiences in her course Expository Writing 20: “The Voice of Authority.” In the course, students are asked to read works of two international writers, prepare a comparative analysis, and then directly contact the visiting writers. Unrue says that it has been these teaching experiences that have led her to appreciate the effect that firsthand interactions have on people. The purpose of this event will be to build on the activities of the class and showcase the visiting writers here under the “Scholars at Risk” program—an insufficiently funded project in which persecuted or at-risk writers are given an opportunity to pursue their work at Harvard.
Brown University hosts a similar event in which a persecuted writer is featured every year. Yet, Unrue argues, “I don’t see too many things where people from a variety of countries are brought together. I think that’s just really a special sort of opportunity to see things in different ways, and you can do that at Harvard.”
Featured writer Mandanipour is a returning guest from last year’s series, and he hopes to explore the issue of censorship in depth. Mandanipour recognizes that the extreme degree of censorship in some countries is something that many people may not realize. His banned publication, “Thursday Evening,” used to focus on the younger generation of Iran and accepted literary critiques and original pieces from young writers. His censorship from the Iranian government began because of his comment, “Iranian people are scratching our faces as we try to grab the little rights that we have from each other because the government took our great human rights from us.” For The Living Magazine, Mandanipour has prepared an essay about his memories in publishing the magazine, some of which he admits are bitter.
Another featured writer, Ma Thida, is the editor of the Burmese “Teen Magazine.” Although “Teen Magazine” strives to be a more educational publication, Thida maintains that it is very difficult to run publications because of the strict regulations of the government’s Press Scrutiny Board. “That’s why we have to be very careful,” Thida says. “But we have a very good readership; they can read between the lines and have very strong imaginative power. That is why my presentation will be about my magazine: how we reflect the voices of the ordinary youths and how ‘Teen’ pages become bridges between the youth in urban and rural areas of Burma.”
Because they are all editors, the visiting artists will also introduce a new writer from home, read a piece of theirs, and discuss their work with the audience. In this way, they can function as editors at the event as well, affecting the content.
Harvard students have also made various contributions to The Living Magazine. Many of the students of Unrue’s class have come up with ideas to help form the event, and it has taken shape through their process of working together. Input from the student population has ranged from fundraising, publicity, and graphic design to actual participation in the event’s presentations.
“The reason that I got involved with the event is that I think very little has been said about censorship in certain totalitarian regimes,” says Ivet A. Bell ’13, who has been working to raise funding and publicity through the Undergraduate Council. Bell recognizes the importance of Unrue’s efforts: “She’s trying to bring students to an event that could perhaps be confined to a literary community, but I hope that it won’t be, and that it will attract the interest of various groups. It really is something worthwhile in the context of human rights.”
The Living Magazine stands as an argument against the countless magazines that are rendered “dead” by the censorship of their governments. Although it may be easy to forget that free speech is in fact a privilege and not a right in many areas of the world today, this stifling reality is something that writers like Mandanipour face as a constant presence. Many have suffered imprisonment in dedicating their lives to fighting for their freedom. In this way, The Living Magazine offers an opportunity for these writers to speak for many of those who cannot.

“I have played colleges before,” Patrick Park says. “But I’ve never gone on before a rapper.” Sandwiched between Wale and Kid Cudi on the bill for this Sunday’s Yardfest, Park is hardly playing the kind of gig he’s used to. However, the Colorado singer-songwriter—who has just released his third album, “Come What Will”—is no stranger to touring and promoting his material, and hopes to continue raising his profile over the coming months.
The 33-year-old Park is best known for his track “Life is a Song,” which was chosen as the final song on the 2006 series finale of the Fox TV drama “The O.C.” This may have been Park’s big break—he notes the strangeness of seeing his song covered on YouTube by hundreds of fans—but Park himself didn’t tune in. “I’m thankful for [the opporunity]. But I’ve never seen the show,” he admits, chuckling.
Luckily, Park is perfectly comfortable with near-contradictions like breaking through on “The O.C.” without ever watching the show. His music, for instance, is usually labeled folk, but he cites early blues artists like Brownie McGee and Robert Johnson as his most affecting influences.
The influence of blues isn’t immediately evident in the sound of Park’s music, but his background helps explain his affinity for it. His father was a blues guitarist, and Park grew up in a small mountain town where “there was a lot of time and space to think and play music,” he says. This abundance of relaxation and reflection shows through in the unaffected, folksy sound of his songs.
Whatever his music is labeled, Park is confident that it will connect with Yardfest attendees. “It used to be that kids listened to one or two types of music and that was that,” he says, “but [today] it seems that peoples’ tastes are so much more eclectic.”
Certainly, “Come What Will,” released April 6, suggests the diverse nature of Park’s range of influences. The new songs, fine-tuned by longtime collaborator and producer Dave Trumfio (Wilco, OK Go), have a certain hard-edged melancholy that conjures the blues in spirit if not in musical styling.
“The Lucky Ones,” one of Park’s favorites from the new album, captures that spirit with its cathartic chorus releasing the tension built by a darkly churning guitar intro. His other favorite, the title track, captures the album’s thematic designs. Park sings, “We’ll turn our backs while yesterday goes up in smoke / Tear down the walls that bar the diamond sky.”
Underlying the album, Park says, is a simple message: “Day after day it’s more bad news and problems that seem insurmountable, but... you do what you can to be happy and be a good person and live your life the best you know how.” The directness of this message matches the straightforward feel of Park’s songs, which are often stripped down to his gently vibrating vocals and his soft guitar work.
The sure-handed tenderness of his music complements Park’s message. “There’s a thread of redemption running through these songs,” he says, offering “Blackbird Through the Dark” as a track from the new album in which that thread shows through. He attributes the album’s redemptive focus to current events, expressing his feeling that “this is really the moment where we can make things better.”
This is also a significant moment in Park’s career. Yardfest comes at the beginning of his tour promoting “Come What Will,” and Park is excited to hit the road and share what he considers his best work to date. Attendees can expect to enjoy Park, his guitar, and a bunch of sweetly simple folk tunes in a show tailored specifically for the event. “I’ll work out how the vibe feels and play songs accordingly,” he says, explaining his process of working from a group of possible songs rather than a rigid set list. Park is confident that, whatever the vibe in Tercentenary Theater this Sunday, he can deliver the goods and please his audience. “I’m definitely going to put on a good show,” he promises.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s rare that the final track of an album is its most telling, but Brooklyn-based alternative rock band MGMT’s sophomore release, “Congratulations,” achieves just that with its title track; an acoustic ode to success and the acclam that accompanies it. The song, much like their debut album’s opener, “Time To Pretend,” is puzzlingly ironic, in that one is pretty sure it is ironic, but can only guess to what extent. Whereas “Time to Pretend” presented an obvious pastiche of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, “Congratulations” confronts the hubris on the other side of this cliché. The group is now successful and, having been through their years of pretending, are receiving the praise they deserve. If this image of the band is invoked ironically, then what does that say about them? Apparently, that they hate what they’re doing and what they’ve become. While this interpretation seems far too extreme, a sense of trouble and uncertainty hovers over the song—the culmination of a similar uncertainty apparent throughout the record. "Congratulations” is a truly exceptional album, but one that must be approached cautiously, and one that refuses to be fully understandable.
On their debut album “Oracular Spectacular,” MGMT—comprised of Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyndarden—traversed a wide variety of styles, achieving most success with the psychedelic synthpop hit “Kids.” For their second album, however, the group have refused to release any singles. Instead they recorded a cohesive body of work meant to be heard in one continuous sitting. As such, “Congratulations” contains no songs that come close to the New Order-inspired thrills of “Kids;” in fact, it’s hard to imagine a single track off this album making its way anywhere near a dance floor. Nevertheless, it succeeds in cohering as a thoroughly engaging and rewarding second album.
Stylistically, “Congratulations” does not diverge from many of the album tracks on “Oracular Spectacular.” The 1970s prog rock and ambient music that inspired “Weekend Wars” and “The Handshake” are the key touchstones on this record. Heck, “Congratulations” even has a track called “Brian Eno”—one of the album’s more straightforward cuts, avoiding the numerous shifts in style that define most of the tracks. “Brian Eno” is mainly a frantic, devoted, yet questionably-framed ode to the British producer and composer. Something about the song’s tribute just doesn’t quite add up. The song’s conventional structure at one point gives way to a 20-second music hall-esque bridge where Eno’s name—complete with all nine of his middle names—is chanted in a strikingly devotional, and creepy, manner. And is the figure described by the lyrics actually not all he’s built up to be, as is suggested by the refrain, “What does he know?” Alongside the lyrical self-consciousness present across the entire album—“When I was stuck he’d make me memorize elaborate curses / Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses”—all this doubt alienates the listener, who will have a hard time finding any emotional anchor in the song.
This alienation is appropriate, since “Congratulations” as a whole does not try very hard to invite a listener in. It is an insular and convoluted record that explicitly rejects passion and, instead, aims for more cerebral pleasures. As the opener “It’s Working” states, “It’s working in your blood / Which you know is not the same as love / Love is only in your mind.” If one can fall in love with “Congratulations,” it’s due only to its workings on the mind; the instrumentation—generally formed of heavily overlaid guitars and piano rather than synths—refuses to settle on easy, passion-inciting hooks. The album’s appeal is based on the fascinating opacity of its lyrics and the avant-garde innovation of its songwriting.
Take, for instance, “Flash Delirium,” the closest the album has to a single. Released a few weeks ago as a free download, like many of the tracks on “Congratulations,” it is a smorgasbord of styles. At one moment it seems like the successor to the synthpop groove of “Time to Pretend,” but within seconds it shifts to a guitar melody with a heavy walking bassline, eventually arriving at an atmospheric conglomeration of multiple vocal lines and ringing synths. During the song’s surprisingly-condensed four-minute run time, the lyrics travel just as far as the music. They are amusingly self-deprecating: “The hot dog’s getting cold / And you’ll never be as good as the Rolling Stones;” plain psychedelic: “See the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt;” and even socially radical, in a very moden way: “Stab your Facebook / Sell sell sell / Undercooked / Overdone / Mass adulation not so funny.” If MGMT had the guts to release the track as a single, it would have been one of the best of 2010 so far. As is, it will have to settle for being the best album track of the year. What the song actually means, though, is almost completely impossible to tell.
But “Congratulations” isn’t supposed to be easy or accessible. Many may listen to it once, find nothing of interest, and discard it. But that will be their loss. Whether it’s the Kinks-like tongue-in-cheek third-person storytelling of “Song for Dan Treacy,” the Berlin-era, Bowie-esque piano instrumental “Lady Dada’s Nightmare,” or the seeming dozens of stylistic shifts through 12-minute album centerpiece “Siberian Breaks,” the album is full to bursting with fascinating compositional decisions. It can be overwhelming and far too much to absorb in one—or even five—listens. But “Congratulations” proves that MGMT are a band with stunning and apparently limitless vision. Challenging your audience is fine if you can back it up with great music, and that’s exactly what MGMT have done here.

It is no secret that post-rockers Sigur Rós make music that reflects their Icelandic roots: ethereally beautiful, pastoral, and momentous, yet glacial in its motions. The quartet distills the essence of their homeland into extended experimental records that occasionally pay lip service to classical and pop music, but nonetheless remain firmly rooted in their own world. The group never concede a shred of their perfectly-structured compositions for the sake of accessibility, and in fact, their lyrics are often sung in a gibberish language of the band’s invention.
Sigur Rós haven’t released an album since 2008’s “Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust,” and despite their indefinite hiatus, lead vocalist and guitarist Jón “Jónsi” Birgisson has stayed busy, releasing an album titled “Riceboy Sleeps” with his boyfriend, graphic artist Alex Somers, last year. Jónsi’s first solo effort, “Go,” features the instrumental arrangements of composer Nico Muhly, who has made a name for himself in popular music via contributions to Grizzly Bear’s “Veckatimest” and Antony and the Johnsons’ “Crying Light.” But despite Muhly’s classically-oriented input, “Go” is by far the poppiest, most accessible record Jónsi has ever released. It isn’t a bad change—“Go” retains most of the delicate beauty of Sigur Rós but drastically shifts the music’s emotional timbre. While Sigur Rós’ albums always seemed meant to be listened to on overcast winter days, “Go” is a record for springtime: a bright, hopeful statement intent on capturing some of the season’s natural vitality.
The first hint that this is a pop album at its heart comes at the very start: unlike nearly all of Sigur Rós’ more symphonic releases, the best song on “Go” is the first one. “Go Do” may back Jónsi’s familiar soaring falsetto with chiming percussion and orchestral flourishes, but it is nonetheless a consummate pop song—and a great one. From the opening, cheerfully syncopated vocal samples through the disconcertingly straightforward verse-chorus-verse structure, “Go Do” takes the listener on a compressed journey through the emotional high points of a seven- or eight-minute Sigur Rós track. It leaves out the gloom and heartache, however, instead crooning, “We should always know that we can do anything / Go do, you’ll know how to.”
The meat of the album occasionally gets caught up in the experimental flamboyance of Muhly’s compositions, but never strays far from the more immediate poppiness of “Go Do.” “Boy Lilikoi” features fluttering flutes and pounding snare drums which would feel perfectly at home in a symphony, and yet it feels far more down-to-earth than such instrumentals would suggest. The vocals and percussion, which are mixed unusually high throughout the record, dominate Muhly’s complex arrangement and contribute significantly to that unpretentious quality. “Go” is an album which is easy to appreciate on first listen, but its immediacy never detracts from the emotional rollercoaster Jónsi is so adept at creating.
Even at its most melancholic, “Go” is always more wistful than mournful. “Grow Till Tall,” the album’s longest track, is a meandering, spare number that constantly threatens to build to a crashing, desolate conclusion—in a manner reminiscent of many of Sigur Ros’ best songs—but never actually does so. Instead, it underpins Birgisson’s nostalgic wailing with a couple of whining violins and jittering electronics, ensuring lyrics like “You’ll really want to grow and grow till tall / They all, in the end, will fall” never sound fatalistic. Far from undermining the album’s generally buoyant mood, this emotional low point makes the more hopeful track that follows it, “Hengilás,” all the more cathartic.
It may seem limiting to constantly compare Jónsi to Sigur Rós, but Jónsi invites the association by making music that has so much in common with his band—his own heartrending falsetto, simple but perfectly arranged orchestral support, and an unabashedly emotional atmosphere—and then self-consciously moving away from much of what defines them. Where Sigur Rós were sprawling, Jónsi is concise. Where Sigur Rós were languorous, Jónsi is propulsive. Where Sigur Rós were grandiose, Jónsi is playful. “Go” still feels like an Icelandic record, but perhaps it reflects an Iceland feeling the effect of global warming. Jonsi has created an undoubtedly ambitious work that stretches the definition of “pop” to its very breaking point, but its unabashed optimism and the simple beauty of the music make it a thoroughly enthralling album.

Perhaps the strangest thing about seeing John Stirratt and Nels Cline of Wilco comfortably eating burritos at the Harvard Advocate at 2 p.m. on a Monday was that it didn’t seem at all strange to them. This sort of bemused acceptance of everything—be it the miracle of Wilco’s latent mainstream success or the oddity of their appearance last week for a public Q&A session at the Advocate—is as pervasive in the easy-going, warm mannerisms of the group’s bassist and guitarist as it was in the unabashedly nostalgic nature of Wilco’s last two records.
The hour-long informal discussion touched on subjects ranging from balancing the musicians’ numerous projects, to their seemingly miraculous ability to maintain a devout fanbase despite several stylistic changes.
“We always lost a lot of fans,” explained Stirratt, “especially after the first record… even then, early on, we just realized that you were going to disappoint people no matter what you did, and that you needed to forge ahead and make records that were interesting to you.”
“Jeff [Tweedy, Wilco’s frontman and principal songwriter] has quipped more than once that for every new Wilco record, just enough people come on as jumped ship. There seems to be a sort of balance,” added Cline with a slight grin.  Stirratt laughed easily, explaining, “We figure everyone in the country is going to be a Wilco fan at one point.”
After 16 years as a band, probability is working in their favor. Despite Stirratt’s having been one of the founding members and Cline’s status as a recent addition, both seem equally accepting of the industry’s vicissitudes and extremely happy with the group’s current line-up. “Ultimately it’s playing on the road that’s kept the band out there” said Cline. “As long as we keep playing, we’re fine, because people come to the shows, and, at this point, as far as I can tell, people like the live shows.”
To say that people “like” Wilco’s live shows is an understatement, but these quietly confident alternative rockers are masters of the understatement. In one particularly striking example, Cline admitted that he rarely practices guitar. “If I practiced every day I’d be so much better,” he said. “Just sitting down every day in the morning and going through some kind of studies I’d be ‘god-like’ at this point.” However, between efforts to realize 16 upcoming projects and a recent engagement, it’s hard to prioritize.
“I don’t have a balance right now at all,” confessed Cline before acknowledging the looming questions of “how to have a personal life—how to have a life when you’re always travelling and playing music.”
Stirratt further expounded on the theme of balance, musing, “You look around and realize that your hobby has been usurped by your profession… I realized how wonderfully narcissistic being an artist in your twenties is—just unlimited amounts of time, and now I feel like I’m better than I’ve ever been at doing what I do, but I don’t really have the time for it. It’s interesting, when I get home I’m handed the child immediately.”
Despite their increasingly complex lives, both Stirratt and Cline hold a special place in their schedules and hearts for Wilco. When asked about their favorite songs, both thought hard for a few seconds before responding. Stirratt chose “She’s a Jar” from the group’s 1999 album, “Summerteeth,” explaining, “There have been a few really magical moments when you finish a take and just know it’s good before you hear it. That was one of those moments for me.”
Cline chose “Radio Cure” for it’s sumptuously textural treatment of depression, but expressed a special affection for “You and I,” one of the standout tracks on last summer’s “Wilco (The Album),” and a track he sees as one of the best examples of Wilco’s unique appeal.
“Jeff is now joking when we play the old material, saying things like ‘That’s for all of you who remember what Wilco was like with edge!’ because there are all these ideas that people have about longevity as a band and stylistic diversity and they start trying to place you,” he said. “So here’s this gentle pop song called ‘You and I’ on the new record and… I was just totally freaked out by how someone could take something so familiar and add a special resonance to it and at the same time make it personal.”
Stirratt nodded in agreement while Cline paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts before concluding his point on how the familiar can be rediscovered and made personal. “Sometimes too much time is spent trying to be original, or trying to worry about ‘Wow, does this sound too much like [your influences]’ and it can’t be like that because you’re you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no “competitive dance” tab on the Harvard University Athletics website home page. Click around a little, though, and you’ll eventually find the Crimson Dance Team (CDT) and the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team (HBDT) listed among the club sports—along with figure skating, capoeira, and Harvard’s own Quidditch team.
Technically a fictional sport—sprung from the pages of J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series—Quidditch earns the same designation as the two competitive dance teams, both of which straddle a curious line of their own. Instead of facing Quidditch’s problem of self-identification with the real or the magical, however, tension for the dance teams exists in their classification as either sport or art.
The teams have the best of both worlds: they receive funding from the Department of Athletics, yet practice at venues supported by the Office for the Arts at Harvard. Their craft involves rules, competition, intense training, self-control, and teamwork—like many other sports—while also allowing for self-expression on a more sophisticated level than pure competitive drive. The Crimson Dance Team and Harvard Ballroom Dance Team fuse athletic competition with artistic interpretation, in a unique hybrid of art and sport.
OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT
While dance groups abound at Harvard, only HBDT and CDT focus on competition. Harvard Ballroom began in 1990 to fill a gap in the dance community. “Our mission is to spread the art of ballroom dancing in a social and competitive way,” says Marco F. Perez-Moreno ’11, president of HBDT.
Throughout the year, HBDT team members learn the 19 dances that comprise the four World Dance Council categories of style: International Latin, International Standard, American Rhythm, and American Standard. Dancers work to become proficient in these groupings through training and the two to three annual competitions HBDT attends as a team.
The slightly-newer CDT was founded in 1995 to offer the opportunity for jazz and hip-hop dancers to demonstrate their skills not only in performances but also against other schools. According to CDT co-captain Ashley R. Prince ’11, competition pushes dancers and encourages progress the way performance might not. “In competitive dance, you have the opportunity to really assess your own skill set and techniques, whereas when you put on a show, it’s just fun to perform,” she says. “On CDT, you get to grow and see concrete improvement.”
CDT competes at the Universal Dance Association College Dance Team National Championships in Orlando, Florida, in addition to performing at men’s and women’s basketball games and exhibition shows. Their choreography mostly focuses on jazz and hip-hop, but they performed pom—a style of dancing similar to cheerleading—when they competed at the National Dance Alliance Championships in years past. Despite their practice of pom, CDT members insist that their craft differs from cheerleading in method.
“In cheerleading the technique is tight with the motions, which is where we overlap the most,” says Mary Caroline Szpak ’11, Prince’s CDT co-captain. “We both generate spirit, but it’s on different terms. Cheerleading is more classified as a sport, but with dance it’s more like a sport and an art.”
The two groups share a desire for competition and also a basic language: ballet. “You can’t walk until you crawl, and you can’t dance until you learn ballet. It’s the foundation of everything,” Szpak says. “The connection between ballet and dance team is like with the alphabet: once you have the letters down, you can make any word.” This dance alphabet leads to the diverse styles CDT performs, and just as with a spoken language, it’s easier to make the sounds if you’ve been exposed early. As a result, the team encourages its dancers to take ballet classes if possible.
Ballroom, too, depends on ballet for its foundation—but the former diverges from the latter in one critical way: the relationship to the floor. Ballet dancers stay lifted up off the floor, making minimal contact with it and absorbing any impact into the muscles so the moves remain graceful and quiet. Ballroom dancers strive for the exact opposite: they push their weight down into their muscles and make contact with the floor. Still, both depend on graceful elevated arms for the entirety of the dance, which means strong shoulder muscles are essential.
ONE STEP AHEAD
Once the foundation is laid, the teams undergo a process akin to a visual artist picking and priming his tools as they prepare for competition. CDT first chooses a choreographer based on an intense selection process. “It involves watching more YouTube than you can imagine,” Prince says. The captains then suggest music and a theme to the choreographer, who comes back to the team with a set two-minute routine. Even so, the members sometimes tweak the piece to fit their vision and showcase their dancers’ strengths. A winning routine is often a trade-off between performing advanced moves and fitting the team’s skill level.
Rehearsals of the piece span around two months, after which the dancers focus on cleaning and editing the routine so that everyone has the exact same timing and precise movements. Intense daily practices lead up to Nationals, which—according to the captains—are similar in atmosphere to the competitions portrayed in the 2000 film “Bring It On.”
HBDT’s training comes in mastering the “syllabus,” which supplies a framework for dancers to move up the ranks as they satisfy bronze, silver, and gold level “figures,” or skill levels. Three professional coaches teach dancers at the syllabus stages until they become proficient enough to dance at a more independent “open level.” These coaches typically create the syllabus-level routines, but some partners choose to choreograph themselves with moves that fit their stages.
Since ballroom competitions can have up to 20 couples on the floor at one time, the syllabus ensures a safe environment. “If you have people who are lifting their partners, it could get dangerous very fast,” says Madison J. Shelton ’11, the HBDT competitions chair. The first HBDT rehearsals of any given year involve around 200 members on a small floor, so tricky moves like lifts are not only prohibited, but impossible.
HBDT’s rehearsals culminate in the Harvard Invitational, an annual competition between as many as 50 schools at which the team showcases their talents. The competition lasts two full days, during which the four styles at all three levels are performed. Professional judges wander the dance floor looking at each couple for a short amount of time; each round, they cut half of the couples until finally selecting the highest scorers.
Hard work pays off for the teams. CDT has placed around fifth or sixth in their division in recent years. They also stand alone as an Ivy League school at their contests. “People always think we’re joking when we say we’re from Harvard,” Prince says. “We get a lot of attention.”
HBDT also consistently performs at the top of their competitions, especially against their rivals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Members claim the rivalry is friendly—the two teams often share dancers because of various gender and number discrepancies between the schools—but they proudly report that they either beat or tied MIT in most of the finals at the 19th Annual Harvard Invitational at the end of March.
CHOREO AND CARDIO
These competitions require intense athletic training and teamwork. Like other fusion sports such as fencing and figure skating, competitive dancing requires intense physical fitness. The Department of Athletics recognizes the physical aspects of competitive dance, providing both teams with funding as club sports. “We review the groups’ specific goals and objectives and then work with them to accomplish these over the course of the year,” says Gary Brown, the Department’s Manager of Recreational Services.
Competitive dancers are certainly athletes, whether or not their competition of choice is seen as a sport. The stamina, flexibility, and energy dance demands necessitate frequent cardiovascular training and exercise. CDT usually practices four days a week for around two hours. Perez-Moreno runs regularly and Shelton does total body conditioning in addition to dance training. The brevity of routines—as opposed to football or basketball games, which can last hours—might seem to entail less need for endurance, but the dancers would strongly disagree. “When you get off a stage after a two-minute routine and you’re just panting—that’s the moment you know it’s a sport,” Szpak says.
Teamwork—an element generally absent in most art forms—also becomes essential. CDT members must perform in sync—“like the Rockettes,” Szpak says—while HBDT dancers work with partners. These pairings are chosen based on physical compatibility (a taller male partner facilitates certain moves) and motivation. Dancers who push themselves differently or set imbalanced goals eventually clash and split up. “In ballroom you rely a ton on your partner, especially as a woman, since you follow: he decides what you do next,” Shelton says. “You have to be very aware of another person.”
In the same way, Szpak compares CDT to a track team: “Everybody is dancing on their own, but it only succeeds if they all move together—so in that way, it’s more cohesive than a sport. If someone in front of you moves, you have to move even if they’re wrong. It really is like we’re on a playing field together, working as a team,” she says.
MAKING A POINTE
Such rigorous athletic training makes creative expression possible. “We’re classically training our muscles but we’re also expressing ourselves through dance,” Prince says. However, a routine won’t rise to its greatest form unless dancers have the stamina, flexibility, and poise that training provides. “You need to do a nice line with your arm, and to be competent at expressing that, you need to be physically able,” Perez-Moreno contends.
Dance teams are judged on various, partly subjective, criteria: technique, difficulty, passion, creativity, style, ability to communicate emotion, clarity, control, synchronization, and musicality—all of which highlight the hybrid aspects of the art. In ballroom, there are four principal aspects: musicality, beauty and technique, partnering, and speed and power. Musicality—or a dancer’s capacity to interpret the music through motions that fit the mood and rhythm—shifts these competitive dances from a sport to an art form. A competitive dancer should not just be robotically performing moves; there needs to be emotion behind every figure.
This is especially true for the lyrical style that CDT practices. A combination of ballet, jazz, and modern dance, lyrical style movements speak directly to the words and tone of a song using gestures and facial expressions. “If in the song the lyrics say that something is far away, then you extend your arm out to indicate that,” Szpak explains.
Nevertheless, both teams admit that show dancing—rather than competition—is where their work truly becomes an art. Almost theatrical in nature, non-competitive performances require the dancers to tell stories using their bodies as media. Performers can communicate a storyline even before the dancing begins through costuming.
Dance teams are even judged on how well costumes convey the theme and mood of the piece. CDT wore glittered black and purple outfits reminiscent of the night sky for their “Midnight” piece two years ago. This year’s vibrant red costumes were cut dramatically to suggest the fury of a woman incensed by her ex-lover, as the song dictated.
A woman’s costume in ballroom must catch the judge’s eye to bring attention to the couple, so attire is typically shiny and vibrantly colored—and, particularly in Latin dances, revealing. Dancers also need to be extremely tan, both to draw attention and look appealing under bright lights. “You need to put forward confidence; there’s a certain beauty in it,” Shelton explains. Every ballroom style has its own character that requires performers to act to the music, so costumes help dancers fit the parts. “You play a role of elegance and high class for Standard and a role of sex appeal for Latin,” Perez-Moreno says. These extravagant costumes require dancers to spend exorbitant sums of money to stay on top of their appearances—which often deters less-serious performers.
STRIKING A BALANCE
While these competitions might seem obscure to outsiders, the dancers insist on the mass appeal of their sport—as evidenced by popular entertainment such as “Dancing with the Stars” and the 2005 documentary film “Mad Hot Ballroom.” A fusion of physical skill and artistic beauty, competitive dance attracts those who want athletic challenge, creative expression, or a little of each. “As athletes, we’re constantly training and pushing our bodies to be better,” Szpak says. “As artists, we’re always looking for inspiration from outside sources and different ways to express ourselves.”
While show dancing seemingly provides more of an opportunity for self-expression, competing helps dancers build the skills necessary for collaborative creative communication. “When you dance by yourself, if your hip’s in a different direction than it should be, it doesn’t necessarily matter,” Szpak says. “It’s hard to get used to, but competitive dance forces you to realize, ‘If my triple isn’t perfect, the team will suffer.’ You’re not dancing for yourself anymore—it’s like a team sport, but one that makes a beautiful and expressive product.”

Female sexuality has long been an epistemological lacuna. Freud, never at a loss for words about male psychosexual development, deemed woman’s sex a “dark continent”—a subject he could only broach by injecting penis envy with estrogen. Contemporary sexologists seem to fare no better: Women’s experience during penetrative sex, from female orgasm to the ever-elusive G-spot, remains an enigma.
The enduring ambiguities of women’s sexual desire have not, however, deterred big pharma. Despite the lack of consensus on what constitutes female sexual normality, drugmakers, heartened by their latest cash cow, male impotence, are attempting to reincarnate Viagra in female form. From Proctor & Gamble’s testosterone patch, Intrinsa, to BioSante’s LibiGel, an androgen-based skin cream, comes flibanserin, the metaphorical peanut butter to Pfizer’s stiffening jelly. Yet, unlike Viagra, which remedies a mechanical problem by diverting blood from the brain to the penis, flibanserin acts on the female psyche. Initially conceived as an anti-depressant, it corrects the serotonin imbalances now imputed as the etiological agent of women’s low libido. Not in the mood, ladies? The problem, it seems, lies not in your vagina, but in your brain.
Flibanserin purports to treat Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, catchily abbreviated HSDD—though the disease moonlights under a remarkable array of pseudonyms, all equally authoritative and sufficiently vague, from female sexual dysfunction to female sexual arousal disorder. Regardless of the title—syndrome, deviation, perversion—they all make one point emphatically clear: Women thus diagnosed are abnormal. Yet, precisely what norm sufferers of FSD are deviating from, though tacitly assumed, is never made explicit. While male sexual dysfunction centers on the convenient question of erect or soft, female sexual anomalies prove more difficult to quantify. Specified measures include hormone levels, vaginal pH, and clitoral blood flow, yet clinicians remain divided on what the normative standards for these measures are—or, barring that, what they should be.
Compounding the confusion, in 1999, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study claiming that 43 percent of women suffer from sexual dysfunction, as compared to 31 percent of men. Authored, not surprisingly, by consultants to Pfizer, the statistic voids sexual normality of all substantive meaning: When the in-group is barely the majority, what legitimating function—of certifying, beyond doubt, the healthy and the natural—can it serve?
Now consolidated into a medical field, complete with an annual conference, journal, and professional organization, FSD promotes belief in its own existence through sheer tautology—it says it exists, therefore it does. Officially defined as “inability to experience an orgasm or lack of lubrication, often causing painful intercourse and/or lack of desire/decreased libido,” this neologism seems to apply to any, and every, woman. Here, the center cannot hold because no one knows where to draw the dividing line: Female sexual perversion and function converge to the same amorphous horizon. Grounded in an ineffable understanding of woman’s sexual essence, the normal becomes consubstantial with, even defined by, the abnormal.
The medicalization of female sexual experience is nothing new. Doctors in the 18th century had a heyday with hysteria, a diagnosis reserved exclusively for females and imputed to malign uterine vapors. In retrospect, the absurdity of charging vagrant vaginal fumes with the ability to distend the female brain appears patent—yet, as the New York Times noted, the grounds for FSD may be no more substantial.
Indeed, an article in the 2003 British Medical Journal named FSD “the freshest, clearest example we have” of the corporate-sponsored creation of a disease. In doing so, the piece exposed the conspicuous ties between researchers in the field and pharmaceutical companies still high on Viagra’s success. Thus, although FSD’s online wing claims to be purely informational, providing the tools for women to realize their feminist entitlements to sexual pleasure and multiple orgasms, its goals are far from altruistic. By articulating dysfunction, FSD capitalizes on women’s sexual insecurities, establishing a norm which no woman meets and solidifying a consumer base for forthcoming treatments.
In our culture, where women are enjoined to “get Dirrty” with Christina, female sexuality is decidedly overexposed. Advanced by the male-dominated media industry and reinforced by profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, the voracious female libido has become normalized, leaving those of us who don’t enjoy a good mudfight in assless chaps feeling like prudes. Hyperbole aside, the problem lies not in talking about women’s sexual experiences, but in stringently classifying them, only to exalt deviance from an ill-defined norm as a pathology in need of remedy.
Abstracting from sexuality’s complex social and relational dynamics, FSD reifies genital function and biomedical cure as the be-all, end-all of satisfying sex. What’s more, by granting medical authorities the power to proscribe and regulate, FSD denies women the agency of sexual self-definition—we are told to “consult a physician,” rather than arrive at our own normative judgments. Against this medicalizing current, control over female sex should return to where it rightfully belongs: women themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A good man is hard to find, but a hometown hero is even harder. Consider the criteria: a hometown hero has to be at the top of his profession and exciting to watch; he has to be local and embody the values of his home; and he has to be a role model, the kind kids grow up wishing they could be. In professional sports, not surprisingly, the list is pretty small. In fact, it’s pretty much limited to two players: the NBA’s LeBron James and MLB’s Joe Mauer. Both were MVPs of their respective leagues last season. Both are straight out of high school, phenoms who skipped college to go straight to the pros—though both had the talent to play Division I football. (The only athlete to ever be named USA Today’s Player of the Year in two sports, Mauer turned down an offer from Florida  State.) In the course of their amateur and professional careers, neither has strayed from his home allegiances. Mauer decided that now wasn’t the time to start—the Twins’ catcher just inked an eight-year $184 million deal.
It’s not time for James to leave home either.
It seems like an idealistic argument—and an unfair one. What place do I have to tell LeBron to choose the Cavalier fans over his own finances?
Well, he shouldn’t pay for pennies. If he is expected to make a commitment to his city, then his city has to show its commitment to him and pony up some serious dough. It’s hard to believe that the Cavaliers, who keep arming themselves with better and better players to get a championship, including four-time NBA Finals champion Shaquille O’Neal, won’t be willing to spend significant amounts of money on him. But if it comes down to a good deal with Cleveland, and a slightly better deal with another team, the wise decision for James, himself, would be to stay with the Cavaliers.
In fact, one might argue that by staying in Cleveland, James is supporting his family—the one that made him the basketball player he is today. James is a product of Akron, Ohio, just 36 miles from Cleveland. As his book “Shooting Stars,” which he coauthored with Buzz Bissinger, makes clear, despite James’s talent, much of his success wouldn’t have been possible if not for the support of those around him, especially his coach Dru Joyce Jr.
James is also an influential community presence, through his LeBron James Family Foundation, which he and his mother Gloria founded in 2007, but this is largely dependent on the fact that he plays in the community. The Foundation runs an annual bikeathon in Akron and has installed play areas across the country. The Foundation says its mission is to empower children and single-parent families. How could James expect to accomplish these missions and have his good intentions ring true if he abandons Cleveland for a bigger market?
On the other hand, if he stays in Cleveland, James can solidify himself as the most beloved figure in the city’s sports history. If he wants an example, he can just look at the warm embrace Mauer is experiencing right now in Minnesota. If the catcher continues to display prowess behind the plate, he will rank with two-time World Series champion Kirby Puckett, perhaps even above him given Mauer’s St. Paul roots.
If LeBron James stays with the Cavaliers, he’ll be right up there with…himself. James brings hope for sports glory to a city best known for the Drive, the Fumble, and the Shot—all heartbreakers. Rightly or wrongly, he’s come to be acknowledged as “The Chosen One,” or the one that can deliver Cleveland from its status as “Most  Tortured Sports  City,” as ESPN named it in 2004. But when James hits free agency, he’ll be the choosing one, and he’ll have to decide between the chance to make history in his hometown and the chance to be just another basketball player, wearing a jersey of a city that means nothing to him.

For college students, few distinctions of prestige rival admission into Phi Beta Kappa. Since 1778, Harvard has annually considered the top students in the College for admission into PBK. Last week, however, officers of the Harvard-Radcliffe PBK Society announced that the process that determines which students will become members of the illustrious society will change. Instead of requiring students under consideration to provide letters of recommendations and upload their own transcripts, the chapter will consult the directors of undergraduate studies of the considered students’ concentrations after first obtaining academic records from the Registrar. This unfortunate change eliminates individual agency on the students’ part, obscures the transparency of the procedure, and ignores the perspective faculty members can offer.
Under the current system, students have the opportunity to choose the professors who could best speak on their behalf—a luxury no longer afforded, given the changes. Whereas many colleges base PBK elections solely on grades, the Harvard-Radcliffe chapter prides itself on looking more holistically at students. Indeed, the current election system allows professors who know students well to make informed, nuanced recommendations. However, the new rules give this power to the directors of studies, who may not know each candidate well enough to have a firm basis for judgment.
This delegation of power impairs the credibility and legitimacy of the final decisions, given the vastly different sizes of departments. The director of studies of a smaller concentration is more likely to be able to provide helpful and personal insight on a candidate’s qualifications than a director of a larger department who has more students to get to know. Students of large departments will therefore be unfairly disadvantaged if their director of studies is unable to provide as glowing a recommendation as a professor who has worked closely with the student would have been able to offer.
That is not to say that the directors of undergraduate studies in each department have no valuable contribution to add to the election process. PBK should welcome more information about the quality of each candidate, not less. After all, directors of each department are the people who are most familiar with their respective concentrations and, as such, can offer key information concerning the difficulty of each candidate’s course-load. Still, while this input is significant and deserves to play a role in PBK decisions, the value of student-sought faculty recommendations should not be understated in relation.
In addition, the changes will further obscure a process that already lacks sufficient transparency. Under the new rules, seniors will not be informed of their standing with PBK unless they are admitted, which would occur days before graduation. Students who are not elected will never even know they were being considered. Although this may spare the hurt feelings of students who are considered but not ultimately elected, students deserve to know where they stand. To be considered at all is an honor.
Although the changes in procedures are intended to help students by not needlessly giving them hope of being elected, they actually detract from students’ power to advocate for their admission into PBK and unfairly disadvantage some students. As such, PBK should reverse trends and insert more transparency into its selection process, not less.

Come next January, students will have one less excuse to be trawling the CUE guide for an easy fourth class the night before Study Card Day. Beginning next spring term, undergraduates will be required to pre-register for courses using a new online course-planning tool, as Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced at a  faculty meeting last week. It is prudent for the College to establish this system, as pre-registration is a painless way for the University to save money in a time when budgetary needs are of special concern.
The College often misjudges which classes will be “hot” in the upcoming semester, leading to an over or under-allocation of Teaching Fellows for some courses. Although this may be a lucky break for students who land in unexpectedly small sections, in general it is a waste of money; according to Harris, the College lost $1 million because of this TF misallocation last year. Thus, this move will both help the College gauge interest in classes and distribute money more efficiently.
Additionally, pre-registration allows the College to save resources in a way that will only marginally inconvenience students. Since the uploaded pre-schedule will be non-binding, students have no reason to fear that they will lose the chance to enroll in different courses if they change their minds. The process also does not seem like it will require much effort on the part of undergraduates. Noting classes one might be interested in next semester from the comfort of one’s laptop seems remarkably easy, and as a budget cut, this seems remarkably unintrusive.
In order for pre-registration to succeed, students must take it seriously. Therefore, we encourage undergraduates to talk to friends, look at online syllabi, and think seriously about their schedules before they pre-register. This will benefit the College, and will also make shopping less stressful.
To this end, we encourage professors to post syllabi and other relevant class information early, in order to help students make truly educated decisions during the pre-registration process. Presently, many classes do not have an updated syllabus posted on their course website until shopping period begins. Harris has said that pre-registration will tentatively occur in November, which is a full two months before students usually begin researching courses. Since many decide on a class because of the workload, number of major assignments, or the dates on which they fall, there is no way students can pre-register properly without having class syllabi widely available.
Pre-registration seems like a positive measure, especially considering the current fiscal environment. The proposal has been intermittently under discussion at least since 1977, and we are glad to see the College finally taking this step. We hope that both students and professors will support it in their respective ways.

Thanks to our current political leadership, it has somehow become fashionable to criticize America’s allies while offering conciliatory gestures to our enemies. While this trend as a whole is questionable at best, one of the most dangerous effects it has had is the suggestion offered by some that the U.S. should in some way weaken or rethink its alliance with Israel. Most disconcertingly, the Obama administration seems to be taking this idea to heart, as evidenced by its recent snub of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, put it, “President Obama’s abysmal attitude toward the State of Israel … is shocking.”
Israel is America’s strongest ally in the Middle East and the only true democracy in the region. From the perspective of America’s grand strategic interests and moral responsibilities, it is very much in this nation’s interest to maintain a strong alliance with Israel. Many disparate terrorist groups engage in frequent internecine bloodletting, but they all have in common a fierce hatred of both the U.S. and Israel. Terrorism is a grave national security threat to the U.S. and an existential one to Israel. Hence, the support of a stable Middle Eastern democracy that has reliably sided with the U.S. is crucial to American strategic interests.
American arms sales to Israel are thus beneficial for both nations; weapons export is one of the very few industries in which the U.S. maintains a positive trade balance. These arms sales to Israel are also necessary for supporting the balance of power in the region, as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Egypt, and other nations in the area vastly outspend Israel on the imports of advanced American and Russian weaponry.
But what of the moral prerogative? The truth is that Israel is a paragon for human rights protections. It has the highest human development index and democracy index of any nation in the Middle East. Unlike any other country in the region, Israel respects basic liberties such as freedom of assembly, religion, and the press, as well as more specific causes such as women’s and gay rights.
But somehow, these facts have been submerged and twisted into a narrative in which Israel is a violator of human rights. Israel is an oasis of freedom in a desert of tyranny and oppression. In most of the Middle East, women still lack equality and face segregation in universities and workplaces; Freedom House recently described women’s rights in the Middle East as the “most severe” on earth. Israel has one of the highest percentages of support for same-sex civil marriage in the world. While a gay pride parade takes place in Tel Aviv, gays are executed in Egypt. Under Israeli law, all citizens are equal and enjoy freedom of religion. Every citizen in Israel has the right to vote, and there are numerous Arabs in the Israeli parliament—Israel is in fact one of the only places in the Middle East where Muslim women can vote. On the other hand, the Jordanian government has recently revoked the citizenship of nearly 3,000 Palestinian Jordanians to nothing but silence from the Obama administration. In the meantime, the Hamas government in Gaza fires rockets at Israeli schools and towns from behind human shields. There can be no moral equivalency between Israel and its neighbors.
Settlements are a thorny issue for both sides, but in truth they are a thinly veiled excuse for further criticism and attacks on Israel. It was agreed at Camp David in 1995 that Israel, in a final peace deal, would exchange some land in Israel proper for the largest Jewish settlements in the West Bank; this was agreed to by Palestinian negotiators several times under both Clinton and Bush.
This is why it is so baffling that this flimsy pretext for criticism of Israel has caused the Obama administration to publicly chastise one of its strongest allies. The moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process is not at a standstill because Israel will build apartments in its capital over the next few years. It has stopped because Israel’s putative negotiating partner is a radical terrorist organization whose very founding documents are fundamentally opposed to Israel’s existence.  It is unclear how one would negotiate a peace with an organization that exists on the basis of permanent opposition to peace. Similarly, Mahmoud Abbas—universally considered a moderate—recently gave his strong approval for the naming of a square after a suicide bomber terrorist responsible for the deaths of 37 innocent Israeli civilians; negotiation with partners that glorify terror also seems a fruitless pursuit.
Ultimately, it is in the interests of all to reach a peaceful settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But as Mayor Koch pointed out, “…to treat Israel and its prime minister as pariahs…only emboldens Israel’s enemies and makes the prospect of peace even more remote.” Peace, in the final consideration, will only be achieved by holding all sides to a fair and equal standard. In the meantime, the U.S. must realize that it cannot distance itself from its allies in order to appease its enemies.

Providing financial incentives for positive behavior can lead to higher test scores among adolescents, according to a study led by Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer and released last week.
In the study, students’ test scores increased when they were paid to perform specific actions, such as reading books or wearing their uniforms.
In contrast, paying students after they earned higher test scores did not significantly change their performance on the tests.
“I think [the results] are surprising at first glance...but once you put yourself in the shoes of a student in one of these studies, it actually begins to make a good deal of sense,” Graduate School of Education professor Martin R. West said. “When you are paid to do something you may not know exactly how to accomplish, it’s not clear how you respond. But if you are being offered money to do something very concrete...then that might be easier to respond to.”
Fryer said he originally had predicted that rewarding grades and scores as opposed to actions would lead to greater academic achievement, following common economic theory.
He said he believes that his actual findings contradict this theory because students “lack the know-how to translate their excitement about the incentive structure into measurable output.”
Among the students in the study, Hispanics, boys, and students with behavioral problems showed the greatest improvements.
Although critics have long argued that paying students for results can lead to a decreased interest in learning, Fryer’s new results show no evidence to justify or support these claims.
Government Professor and author of “Saving Schools: From Horace Mann to Virtual Learning” Paul E. Peterson argues that “rather than paying kids to learn, one should teach to their ‘price point,’ which varies with every student” and use new technology “to adapt curriculum to each child’s skills and level of mastery.”
Fryer called the study’s findings “an interesting set of first results” and said that more studies need to be carried out on the effectiveness of employing incentives.
“I’m interested in what are the four or five investments that, when put together, have the potential to close the achievement gap,” Fryer said. “Incentives could be one of [them], I don’t know yet. This is the first kind of large scale experiment in urban schools on incentives, and I hope it’s not the last.”

Three speakers—each with ties to business or religion—discussed different perspectives on how to define personal success at an event sponsored by the Center for the Study of World Religions yesterday.
Harvard Business School professor Howard H. Stevenson, author of the book “Just Enough: Tools for Creating Success in Your Work and Life,” headlined the event and spoke about what constitutes “enough” personal success. Stevenson outlined what he believes are the four cornerstones of personal success—achievement, happiness, significance, and legacy.
When it comes to balancing these four characteristics, which he calls “the four satisfactions,” Stevenson said, “It’s about juggling...The most important ball is the one that’s falling.”
Following Stevenson, Harvard Divinity School lecturer Daniel P. McKanan ’89 responded to Stevenson’s comments from a spiritual perspective. McKanan said that Stevenson’s reading of success was very individualized in nature and said that while his four principles of success could also be fostered within religious communities, this has not occurred much to date. He said he hopes that religious communities can better integrate the four paths to personal success.
Candice Carpenter, a Business School graduate and co-founder of leading women’s network iVillage.com, also responded to Stevenson’s initial comments. Carpenter focused on the notion of “generative capitalism,” a form of capitalism that creates and adds meaning to personal lives.
“If I spend time consuming, I’m not creating,” Carpenter said.
Carpenter described a moment in time when she considered purchasing a $50,000 Versace dress. Ultimately, she said, she could not go through with the transaction, invoking Stevenson’s notion of “enough” to explain her thought process at the time.
“Because we can have anything, what’s enough?” Carpenter asked the audience.
The event’s moderator, Center Director Donald K. Swearer, said that yesterday’s talk, part of the Center’s series on “Ecologies of Human Flourishing,” was one way to bridge the divide between the Business School and the Divinity School.
“It’s time for the two tubs to get off their bottoms,” Swearer said, to laughter from the audience.

Brown University, the only remaining Ivy League institution without an autonomous school of engineering, is moving closer to the conversion of its existing division of engineering into a full school.
The proposal garnered faculty approval at a meeting on April 7, moving the final decision regarding the formal establishment of an engineering school into the hands of the Brown Corporation, the university’s highest governing body.
“This is the right first step,” said Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, former dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Venky—who is renowned for pioneering the establishment of SEAS in 2007—sits on the Brown engineering advising council that is providing guidance in the planning stages of the proposed new school.
Members of the engineering faculty at Brown said in interviews yesterday that they hope the Corporation will approve the proposal at its May meeting.
The creation of a new school would require $100 million in fundraising efforts to pay for 12 new faculty members and 35,000 square feet of new and renovated facilities, according to Brown Engineering Professor Huajian Gao.
Brown hopes to focus the proposed engineering school on entrepreneurship, building upon the current divisional engineering program’s partnership with the university’s economics and sociology departments, according to Brown’s Interim Dean of the Division of Engineering Rodney J. Clifton.
“Brown will be able to define itself as a niche school in this way,” Venky said.
Unlike SEAS, the Brown School of Engineering will not feature the applied sciences—such as applied mathematics, applied physics, and computer science—and will focus on the engineering sciences, according to Venky.
The creation of a school would allow for a greater allocation of resources to the engineering sciences, which have been limited by the current division’s “unusually” small size, according to Clifton. For example, the division has been unable to expand its course offerings.
Brown’s engineering building, which was constructed in 1960, limits the division’s current programs amid “rapid developments in technology and science,” Gao said.
Preliminary plans for the new school include the construction of a 100,000 square foot building—35 percent of which would be occupied by the engineering sciences, according to Gao.
“This move will increase our visibility and attract students and faculty to Brown,” he said.
The preparation of the proposal for the establishment of an engineering school took a year and a half before its submission to the faculty, according to Clifton.
“This process always takes longer than you hope,” he said. “It actually has gone quite smoothly and should improve Brown and its education of the sciences.”

The Silk Road Project, a nonprofit arts and educational organization created by world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, will move its headquarters from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, R.I. to a Harvard property in Allston in July.
The lease marks the University’s second successful letting of a vacant property in the neighborhood since the December announcement that Harvard would be aggressively pursuing tenants for its unoccupied holdings in Allston. The announcement came in the wake of the indefinite halt of construction on the Allston Science Complex, a major component of Harvard’s plans to build a new campus across the Charles River.
The Silk Road Project recently completed a five year residency at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, a collaboration that motivated the organization to move to Allston in order to form a deeper partnership with the University, according to Ma.
“By actually being more on campus we can have a deeper engagement with and understanding of what’s actually happening at the University,” he said.
Ma emphasized that the move will help advance the organization’s goal of bringing together artists and audiences worldwide to engage in multidisciplinary artistic exchange.
“What we want to do is maximize the passion for and the memorability of learning things,” Ma said. “We want to sponsor courses at Harvard where people are making things, emphasizing the continuity between thinking and making, using all of our senses in order to pursue creative inquiry.” In addition to sponsoring and informing course offerings, the Silk Road Project hopes to hold symposia on subjects ranging from the state of the arts to community involvement.
University officials said they had high hopes for the Silk Road Project’s involvement in arts programming at Harvard.
“Silk Road’s move to Harvard is also a representation of Harvard’s commitment to the arts and to international dimensions on the arts,” University President Drew G. Faust said.
Ma also said that Silk Road hopes to be directly involved with the Allston community.
“We want to listen to their wish-list and see if there’s any way of making some of those things happen,” Ma said.
Faust also said she was excited to see how the Silk Road Project would integrate itself into the Allston neighborhood.
“I think the Silk Road’s engagement with Harvard and the community will be a real plus for all of us,” Faust said.
Allston resident Ray Mellone, who chairs the Harvard Allston Task Force, echoed those sentiments.
“I think it will benefit the community,” Mellone said, adding that he especially hoped the Silk Road Project would improve arts education in Allston.
Silk Road’s move to the neighborhood is emblematic of Harvard’s overall leasing strategy in Allston, according to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who oversees the leasing of Harvard’s Allston property and its relations with the local community.
“This is an example of weaving together Harvard’s priorities along with our spaces in Allston, not only to bring vibrancy to the community, but to reflect this institution’s priorities,” Lapp said.
The announcement of Silk Road’s move comes less than three weeks after Harvard finalized the lease of another one of its Allston properties to Earth Watch, a nonprofit environmental organization.
Lapp said she hopes to announce more leases to local organizations in the near future.
“We leave no stone unturned,” Lapp said. “We continue to follow up with people. We will continue to be as aggressive as we have been.”

For the small population of Harvard students with severe food allergies, every meal requires weaving through a maze of hidden ingredients and airborne allergens—a process made significantly easier through the help of Harvard University Dining Services staff, these students said.
National statistics suggest that 4 percent of people are allergic to some food, but college dining services are unable to get exact statistics  about food allergies among their student bodies because that information is protected by medical privacy laws, according to the Boston Globe.
Other colleges in the Boston area, including Boston College and Holy Cross, have entire kitchens dedicated to serving students with serious food allergies, but Harvard students report that menu variety in the dining halls has allowed them to choose from existing HUDS options.
Some students with allergies, even a few who described their allergies as very severe, said they decided not to inform HUDS and instead to navigate their food decisions alone. But students who have contacted dining hall staff said that HUDS has accommodated their needs.
Tal Oppenheimer ’12, who has an airborne allergy to peanuts, said she met with the Annenberg staff before her freshman year began. They gave her a tour of the kitchen, showed her an ingredient list that she could check daily, and pointed out the location of the peanut butter so that she could avoid the entire area. Oppenheimer said she is careful not to attend meals when peanuts are a main ingredient in the entrees, because even the presence of peanuts can be dangerous for her.
Oppenheimer described a recent incident at lunchtime when she forgot to check the ingredients in a new soup—which happened to contain peanuts. A member of the Mather dining hall staff immediately approached her, notified her about the soup, apologized, and even removed it from the day’s dinner menu.
For Theodore A. Peng ’13, who is allergic to all nuts, as well as kiwis, strawberries, raw carrots, parsley, sesame seeds, soy, corn and whole grains among other things, food contamination is potentially problematic.
He said that he trusts the kitchen staff to scrupulously separate ingredients, but said he worries that other students are less careful about mixing foods in the servery.
“I’ve seen it before where people want some other type of food, but they won’t use another scoop,” Peng said.
The allergic students interviewed for this article said they agreed that the University was doing as much as it could to facilitate their dietary needs.
“As long as student are proactive about checking the ingredients online, I think Harvard is doing everything it needs to,” said Jeremiah B. Glenn ’11, who is allergic to peanuts.

Student group leaders hoping to offer their own programming during the next January Term have responded positively to the College’s recent decision to allow all students to return to campus more than a week before spring classes begin.
Many groups believe that next year’s J-Term schedule will give them an opportunity to organize their own activities during the last week of the break.
“Having everybody being able to be back is a big boon,” said P. Kenzie Bok ’11, president of the Institute of Politics’ Student Advisory Committee.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced on Friday that the student body would be allowed to return to campus on Jan. 16, 2011—eight days before classes begin.
But many logistical problems remain for student groups as they work to transform their ideas for programming into reality by next January.
Before the guidelines for next January were made public last week, many groups had initially planned to develop activities that would span multiple weeks.
“Having [the period] a little shorter than two weeks is not ideal from our perspective,” Bok said, since the IOP had originally envisioned a two-week program of political workshops and service events.
Harvard Undergraduate Television also had plans for a longer J-Term program, in which they hoped to gather students to produce a short film on campus.
HUTV President Tiffany N. Fereydouni ’11 said that the group has not given up on the undertaking and plans to apply for approval to stay over the earlier portion of J-Term as well.
Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 said that the UC will try to lobby the administration to allow more groups to stay on campus.
“Last year there were many student groups that received housing, mostly in public service and the arts,” Bowman said. “We’re hoping [it] will be extended to [other groups].”
But the UC may face some challenges, as Hammonds has said that the College will limit the number of students on campus during the restricted period to the capacity of Annenberg Hall—the only dining hall that will be open for most of January.
Student group leaders say they are still working out the logistics of their programs and are waiting for more information from the College before they can fully plan for the last week of J-Term.
For example, although larger organizations like the IOP and HUTV have their own budgets, many smaller student groups may need to procure additional funds in order to host programming.
Though the College does not plan to provide funding for J-Term activities on campus, Bowman said that the UC will “definitely consider” providing financial support for student group programming if there is enough interest.
Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, president of the Harvard College Democrats, also cited room reservations as a problem that student groups will likely have to face.
“We do have to worry about having...spaces open in which to hold these events,” he said. “Are we going to be able to reserve rooms?”
But, on the whole, student group leaders and the UC remain optimistic about the new chance to develop student-led programming over J-Term.
“Having these eight days for programming is an incredible start,” UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said. “I would hope that if this [next J-term] is successful, we can work towards an even more expanded system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adams House’s three Undergraduate Council representatives scooped vanilla ice cream and fielded questions from student constituents last night at the second pilot “UC Study Break” held in Adams dining hall.
According to event organizers, the study break aimed to provide a forum for UC reps to acquaint themselves with students and listen to their concerns and ideas.
Adams representative Sanjay P. Misra ’12 said that while communication typically occurs through e-mails, he wanted Adams residents to approach their UC reps in a “more comfortable” setting.
“We are hoping to meet as many people as we can and have people get to know our faces,” Adams representative Ellen V. Lehman ’11 said, adding that the study breaks function to initiate dialogue between the UC and undergraduates.
Francisco N. Alvarez ’11, a producer for Harvard College TEATRO, appeared to take them up on that offer, saying that the UC “fucking sucks.” According to Alvarez, after he was initially issued a grant by the UC Finance Committee for a play earlier this semester, the committee retroactively canceled the pledged funding.
“I would not have known about [such an experience] if I hadn’t been scooping him a scoop of ice cream,” Adams rep Harry T. Rimalower ’10 said, adding that he felt UC reps are not currently visible enough in their Houses.
In addition to an assortment of other snacks, which included chocolate chip cookies and Whoppers malted milk balls, the UC also provided study break attendees with a one-page UC update that highlighted recent initiatives—including UC Cameras, “UC TKTS,” the UC Rooms Reservation Web site—and general information for student groups on applying for UC grants.
Koning Shen ’10 said the update sheet was a more effective way of disseminating information compared with the “giant PDF file of everything that happened at [UC general] meetings,” which the UC sends out weekly over House and dorm lists.
“No one’s going to read that,” she said, in reference to the usual online format.
The idea for UC study breaks was conceived by freshman West Yard representative Ivet A. Bell ’13. The next UC study break is scheduled for Thursday night in Mather dining hall and will feature food from Boloco. The freshman East Yard and Eliot House will host UC study breaks in the coming weeks, according to Bell.

Students passing by the Science Center this week will notice a group of t-shirts hanging from clotheslines as a symbol of solidarity in response to sexual violence against women.
The Clothesline Project—an initiative organized by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in light of Sexual Assault Awareness Month—offers women the opportunity to decorate a shirt and hang it in public to raise awareness of sexual violence.
“It’s a beautiful way of raising awareness,” said Sarah A. Rankin, director of OSAPR, which is sponsoring the month-long slate of events. “It can be very cathartic for survivors to share their story through artistic expression.”
Shannon E. Cleary ’12, an OSAPR volunteer who helped organize the Project, said that telling stories through artwork can help survivors of sexual violence to “let out all the emotions ranging from guilt to fear, from regret to anger, from helplessness to hope for the future” in an anonymous and supportive environment.
“It gives survivors a safe space to express their stories, gives everyone a way to show their support for ending violence against women, and publicizes to the community that this violence happens here and we want it to stop,” Cleary said.
Julia H. Nunan-Saah ’11, an OSAPR volunteer and an organizer of the Clothesline Project, said that the initiative allows survivors to find support from those around them.
“For survivors, making a t-shirt with their story and having it displayed in a public area with other survivors’ stories hung nearby shows that there is a community of support,” Nunan-Saah said. “It’s important for them to remain anonymous, but still have their story heard.”
The Clothesline Project—a nation-wide program that began 20 years ago—not only offers an important resource and a creative outlet for survivors of sexual assault, but also situates the issue of violence against women (particularly on college campuses) in a public space that people cannot ignore, said volunteers at OSAPR.
For example, a tourist may stop to take a picture of the t-shirts, or students may engage in spontaneous discussions about the laundry hanging near the Yard.
“Once people realize what the project is all about, I think—or at least hope—that they realize the extent of this problem and feel inspired to help,” said Cleary, adding that such help could come in the form of volunteering, talking to friends about the Clothesline Project, or even making the choice not to laugh at a joke that makes light of sexual violence.
“Even walking by the Clothesline Project helps survivors know that they are not alone and have support from their community,” Cleary said.

Harvard Hillel played host last night to “Israel-Palestine: Bridging the Divide,” a discussion that featured speakers representing both sides of the decades-long conflict in the Middle East.
At the event, which was sponsored by the pro-Israel organization J Street, speakers promoted grassroots peace activism and the importance of the commonalities among all people.
Born and raised outside of occupied Jerusalem, Aziz Abu Sarah—a Palestinian activist and the Director of Middle East Projects at George Mason University—explained how the death of his brother at the hands of an Israeli soldier led him to join the ranks of the Fatah Youth Movement—a group built on the idea of Palestinian nationalism.
Kobi Skolnick, who is from southern Israel, shared his perspective from the other end of the conflict. As a teen, Skolnick was part of the fundamentalist Kahana movement. To promote “Jewish power,” he said that he and fellow Kahana members were encouraged to use violence against Palestinians.
But after seeing the suffering of their “enemies,” both Skolnick and Sarah came to question their ideologies.
According to Sarah, who has used the blogosphere to promote the peace process, both men recognized “the connection of one man to another in the face of universally understandable pain.”
The pair now work to spread awareness and caution against the “eye-for-an-eye” ideology that has promoted the cycle of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories. To this end, “the project involves building bridges between Israel and Palestine and also between every human being,” Skolnick said.
“I thought it was very powerful to hear both sides of the story and to hear very personal accounts from people on both sides,” Emily S. Unger ’13 said.
The discussion also shed light on the often misrepresented ideologies of both Palestinians and Israelis.
Sarah noted that according to the latest statistics, more than 75 percent of Palestinians polled were in favor of a two-state solution. Moreover, he added, more than nine in 10 Palestinian youths polled supported using nonviolent means to achieve a solution.
Skolnick explained that there are multiple underground peace activist groups in Israel. But he also said that the groups are often hindered by a lack of funding and the Israeli government’s efforts to arrest members of such groups.
“I could be arrested if I go back,” Skolnick said.
Despite the seemingly insurmountable tangle of issues that define the conflict, both Skolnick and Sarah maintained that peace activism is the best means for securing a solution.
“We’re not asking anybody to be pro-anybody but rather to be pro-solution,” Sarah said. “We want to think pragmatically how we can resolve this conflict—not because we’re pro-one side, but rather because we want both sides to have freedom and security and to be safe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven days ago, sophomore Rachel Brown pitched the game of her collegiate career—a no-hit, no-walk performance in Harvard softball’s Ivy opener at Princeton.
And on Sunday, she did it again.
Brown’s second no-hitter in as many weekends—this one another walk-free performance that gave the Crimson a 3-0 win over Columbia—may not have been so surprising this time around, but it was no less impressive.
“Especially in softball, it’s so easy to just give up a little bloop hit with a little bit of bad luck,” senior Dana Roberts said. “To throw two [no-hitters] against Princeton and Columbia, who aren’t weak teams by any means, really shows a level of focus [that] shows just how strong Rachel is…It’s really an outstanding accomplishment.”
With Harvard a bit discouraged after a 5-4 loss in Saturday’s second game against Penn—its first loss to the Quakers since April 23, 2006—Brown put her squad back on the right track from the get-go in Sunday’s opener.
Though a first-inning fielding error meant that a perfect game was never in the cards, the sophomore didn’t let up. She struck out the side in the second and fifth innings on her way to a 12-strikeout performance and didn’t allow another baserunner in the game.
But through five innings of play, Lions rookie Maureen O’Kane matched Brown pitch for pitch, taking a no-hitter of her own into the fifth and keeping the scoreboard blank until the bottom of the sixth.
The Crimson offense came through in that inning, leading off with a pair of singles that chased O’Kane from the game and eventually staking Brown to a 3-0 lead with an inning to go.
“It’s always nerve-wracking the last inning, trying not to spoil it,” the sophomore admitted. “It [was] definitely running through my head.”
And Brown delivered, closing out the contest with an emphatic strikeout to seal her second near-perfect game.
“She was hitting her spots especially well,” said senior Jessica Pledger, who caught both of Brown’s no-hitters. “She’s able to stay really calm on the mound—she has a lot of confidence on the mound in what she throws.”
But while the sophomore hurler’s two no-hitters were nearly identical, she took her consistency to a new level this weekend.
After her no-no at Princeton, Brown struggled the next day at Cornell, giving up six runs in just 2.1 innings of work against the South Division’s top squad.
She followed that performance up with a complete-game win at Holy Cross on Tuesday, but still fell short of her usual standards, again giving up six runs—including a fifth-inning grand slam.
This weekend, Brown put those struggles behind her.
“The last week after Cornell and Holy Cross, Rachel had a lot of things to work out,” Roberts said. “She did a great job of making those adjustments and coming up strong.”
“She got ahead of almost every batter she faced in her no-hitter against Columbia, which is really key for her to be able to put the batters away,” Roberts added. “Her rise ball was really on, and neither Penn nor Columbia’s batters could even come close to it…It was the best I’ve seen from her in a long time.”
Though the no-hitter was the crown jewel of Brown’s weekend, she finished the four-game Ivy set with two wins, a save, and 14 innings of scoreless softball—allowing just six hits and striking out a combined 26.
“It definitely gives me confidence,” Brown said. “This performance helps me with my mental game, and I feel really confident after these games.”
The sophomore’s mettle is evident in her statistics, as her 1.67 ERA and 131 strikeouts are good for tops in the Ancient Eight.
But the stat most telling about Brown’s importance to the Crimson squad is maybe the least glamorous. Her 9-4 record and two saves mean that the hurler has played a leading role in 11 of Harvard’s 14 wins this season.
“She’s so consistent—you know that you’re going to get a solid start out of her every time,” Roberts said. “It lets the defense and the offense have a no-pressure approach and have fun out there, and I think that’s reflected in the way the bats perform behind her.”
Brown’s already cemented her place in Harvard softball history. But as the sophomore proved this weekend, the best may be yet to come.
“She’s definitely her own harshest critic, but in a way that really makes her strive for excellence,” Roberts said. “She’s never satisfied with her own performance—she’s always looking for ways to get better…I can’t wait to see how she performs in the last [three] weekends of Ivy play.”

There comes a time in every season when a team is forced to make some adjustments when faced with adversity. For the Harvard sailing team, that time is now. Heading into this past weekend without the services of one of its top skippers, junior Teddy Himler, who recently broke his hand, the Crimson tweaked its game plan, competed against some of the region’s top competition, and came away with some encouraging results.
“Not having Teddy obviously hurts us,” junior skipper Colin Santangelo said, “but we performed well this weekend without him. When he comes back in a couple of weeks, we should be able to sail even better heading into the championship portion of our season.”
Harvard’s top sailors competed this weekend at the 29th Marchiando and 50th Friis Trophies Team Races and came away victors of the second fleet of racing, or in ninth position overall. The Crimson also sent a contingent to the Longfellow Bridge Invitational, the fourth installment of the Central Series this spring season, and finished sixth out of 16 teams.
“Everything is coming together nicely as our season really gets going,” sophomore skipper Emily Lambert said. “The team is performing well as we enter the last month and a half of our schedule.”
29TH MARCHIANDO & 50TH FRIIS TROPHIES TEAM RACE
The top squad of Harvard sailors rebounded from a poor performance on Saturday to win 14 of its 15 races in Sunday’s round robins and claim the Lynne Marchiando Trophy in team racing hosted by MIT on the Charles River.
The Crimson finished Saturday’s two round robins with a record of 5-7 overall, which left it in fifth place in its division. The top four teams from each of the two divisions went on to sail for the Friis Trophy at Tufts on Sunday, where the host Jumbos would eventually come away victorious.
“Unfortunately, we were not able to sail well enough on Saturday to make it to the Friis Trophy competition on Sunday,” Lambert said. “It was really windy on Saturday, and we struggled with some of our boat handling. However, we were able to rebound on Sunday, when it was less windy, and take better advantage of some of our team-racing moves.”
On Sunday, Harvard posted a 14-1 record, as the Crimson swept Boston University, Connecticut College, Salve Regina, and Vermont, and lost only one of three races to Dartmouth.
Junior captain Alan Palmer and classmate John Stokes, along with Lambert, skippered for Harvard on the weekend. Seniors Michelle Konstadt and Winston Yan, junior Meghan Wareham, and sophomore Alex Jumper split crewing duties on Saturday, as Konstadt, junior Quincy Bock, and freshman Alma Lafler were the Crimson’s crews on Sunday.
LONGFELLOW BRIDGE INVITATIONAL / CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Harvard had another squad compete locally at the Longfellow Bridge Invitational as part of the Central Series schedule of racing on the Charles River. Competing in a field of 16 schools, the Crimson came away with a sixth-place team finish overall.
In the A division of competition, Santangelo skippered the team to a sixth-place effort, as freshmen Sam Millham and Jin Zang split crewing duties.
“The wind was very variable out there,” Santangelo said. “It ranged from five to 27 miles per hour and was very shifty, which led to a lot of capsizes and meant difficult racing.”
In the B division, freshman skipper Jason Michas had Harvard in first after Day One, but the Crimson finished the weekend in seventh overall in the division.
“The regatta went pretty well for us,” Santangelo said. “I feel that as the team comes together over the next couple of weeks and we enter the home stretch of our schedule, there will not be many teams in the nation that can beat us.”

Sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown has made quite the name for herself in her two years on the Ivy softball circuit. On Sunday, she put another feather in her already-decorated cap when she pitched a no-hitter for the second-consecutive weekend.
You can read all about Brown’s performance—which garnered her Athlete of the Week honors from The Crimson’s sports staff—here. But in the meantime, The Back Page spoke with Brown and her teammates, and here’s what they had to say about the standout sophomore.
Brown on her catcher, senior Jessica Pledger:
“It’s not possible without Jessica Pledger behind the plate, because I think catcher is the most underappreciated position on the field. She blocks everything. I’m completely confident throwing any pitch—she had a great game behind the plate.”
Pledger on what Brown means to the defense:
“Rachel’s a huge part of our team, and a pitcher in general is a big part—pitchers coming up and giving us a solid performance. And when she does that consistently…it gives us motivation to be as strong a defense as possible behind her and work as hard as she does.”
Senior Dana Roberts, the team’s student-assistant pitching coach, on Brown’s team mentality:
“She’s also a huge team player, which is kind of rare for a pitcher of her caliber…Rachel is always willing to give everything she’s got to help the team get a win.”
Brown on her strengths:
“Dana has been working with me on getting ahead on batters, so throwing the first strikes. That is something that I really tried to work on today, and I thought I did a pretty good job. I think as a team we do a really good job of bearing down.”
Roberts on Brown’s ability to avoid the sophomore slump:
“Your freshman year, everything’s so new, and you’re just kind of going out there and throwing. She did feel a lot of the pressure coming off such a great season last year, and rather than caving under that pressure and rather than having a sophomore slump, it just made her work harder…Having a season under her belt, having that experience and maturity has helped her stay strong and be a little more consistent than she was last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a decision that left some in shock, others in tears, and many more in disbelief.
Satinder Bajwa, the men’s and women’s squash coach who served Harvard for 11 years, told both teams Thursday at the Murr Center that despite recent victories—including the 2010 women’s national championship and two individual titles—his contract would not be renewed for the upcoming year.
“I think everyone’s still in the stage where they’re trying to understand it,” freshman Laura Gemmell said. “Obviously people are sad, and they really respect Baj as a coach.”
“This situation sort of came as a shock late last week,” junior Eliot Buchanan said yesterday afternoon. “So we obviously have a lot of questions that deserve to be answered.”
Some of those questions were answered yesterday at a meeting with Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise that nonetheless left several players unsatsified with the rationale, the process, and the decision itself.
THE REASONING
Scalise was unable to be reached for comment, but freshman Charles Gertler said that the rationale for Bajwa’s contract non-renewal was three-fold.
Spurning the chairs the team had laid out for him, the athletic director opted instead to stand—a move that Gertler said set the tone of the conversation—and said that while Bajwa did have a strong record on the court, breaches from administrative protocol, an inability to be a “good community member at the athletics department,” and recruiting deficiencies forced the department to part ways with the squash veteran, according to Gertler.
In an interview, Bajwa called Scalise’s administration-related accusations “very vague” and said that he maximized performance given the constraints of the admissions office.
At the meeting, according to several attendees, Scalise laid the groundwork for future interactions with the team about finding a new coach, which freshman Jason Michas called “ironic” given the lack of communication he said existed leading up to the non-renewal.
“Everyone was nervous going into [the meeting],” he said. “Originally we felt a bit slighted throughout the entire process, because we never found out what happened until quite recently.”
Bajwa was notified of the contract non-renewal just as the men’s squash team completed evaluation forms, according to Gertler, which he said highlights the administration’s omission of the teams’ opinions.
“They claim they made their decision in our interest, but when we’re not even considered, it’s a little upsetting,” he said.
THE RUMORS
Bajwa’s contract non-renewal was colored by rumors regarding alleged racism on the part of wealthy alumni.
Albert F. Gordon ’59, a significant donor to the Murr Center and self-described “business friend” of Bajwa, said that alumni have leveraged their financial influence to engineer the end of Bajwa’s tenure at Harvard.
Bajwa refused to comment on these allegations, and players interviewed for this article said they did not believe them to be true. An e-mail sent by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann to Gordon said that the decision not to renew Bajwa’s contract was not discriminatory.
But Bajwa has not been bashful in his ties to the Indian subcontinent. In January, he took the women’s team on a trip—subsidized by Gordon—to India, where, in addition to playing matches, team members helped underprivileged children and trained them in squash.
Gertler believes that all of these efforts were just the beginning of creating international ties between Harvard and the larger squash community.
“Baj was leaving the program just as it was getting started, just as we were building a relationship with India, just as we were starting to do these humanitarian efforts,” Gertler said. “They’re more interested in having someone who gets along with people in the office than they [are] someone who wins championships and does humanitarian efforts.”
THE RECORD
A previous individual winner of the U.S. National Championships, Bajwa led the Crimson to six women’s and five men’s Ivy League titles during his tenure. This past season, the women’s team took the Howe Cup—the team national championship—while co-captain Colin West and Gemmell won individual national titles.
But these successes came as part of a general downward trend on the part of the men’s team, sliding from second at the beginning of Bajwa’s tenure to fifth this year.
Despite the noticeable drop in Harvard’s national standing, Bajwa called the trend a “cycle.”
“Three years ago my women were number five, and we had an amazing moment, and I felt that the men are in that same moment because right now they’re number five,” he said. “And the way the women three years ago went from number five to undefeated, I really felt that the men were headed in that direction.”
Team members were no less optimistic about Harvard’s prospects, but added that what Bajwa provided was more than just statistics and rankings.
“It’s hard to understand in a sport that sometimes people have to win and people have to lose, and it can’t be about the winning and losing,” junior Alisha Mashruwala said. “The coach is there to be more than just a coach. He’s a teacher. He’s a parent. He’s someone who brings the team together, and looking at the men’s and women’s team to see how bonded the teams are, you realize Baj has done great things for us.”

As the semester zooms towards   its end, so too are the playoff chases heating up in the Ivy League’s  spring sports. Ancient Eight lacrosse is gearing up for its first-ever  conference tournament, and with only two or three games left on each  team’s schedule, the competition for the last few spots is fierce.
Over on the diamonds, the close   of non-divisional play has heralded the emergence of some frontrunners.  Oh, and did we mention Rachel Brown threw another no-hitter? Let’s  take a look around the Ivies.
MEN’S LACROSSE
Though Princeton fell hard to No. 2 Syracuse in its only contest of the week, the Tigers appear  to be a lock for a spot in the inaugural Ivy Tournament. Princeton  remains  the only undefeated team in the league at 3-0, and will host  Dartmouth  (3-5, 1-2 Ivy) on Saturday.
Cornell got itself back on  the right track on Saturday by grinding out a tight 13-12 win over  Harvard—a  loss that puts the Crimson in fifth place and looking up at the four  tournament teams. But luckily for Harvard, it gets to travel to  Philadelphia  this weekend to take on hapless Penn, the only squad who remains winless   in the Ancient Eight.
WOMEN’S LACROSSE
Harvard hasn’t played a game  since last Monday, but while the Crimson was resting, the playoff  picture became much clearer. And judging by the way things look now, Harvard  won’t be playing come tournament time.
Dartmouth has continued its  meteoric rise in women’s lacrosse, and now sits seventh nationally with a 9-1 overall record (4-0 Ivy). But in the biggest game of the  regular season, the Big Green and No. 6 Penn will meet in Hanover on  Saturday to determine, in all likelihood, which squad will grab the  tournament’s top seed.
3-1 Princeton seems to have  assured its place among the top four as well, while a pair of 2-3  teams—Brown,  Yale, and Cornell—will duke it out for the final spot.
BASEBALL
Ladies and gentlemen, meet  your frontrunners—Columbia and Brown.
The Lions asserted themselves  with a 24-1 demolition of Harvard on Sunday afternoon and sit atop the  Gehrig Division with a 6-2 league record after taking three of four  games on the weekend. Meanwhile, the Bears swept Princeton and Cornell  and are riding a six-game win streak into the beginning of divisional  play.
The Crimson sits within  striking  distance at 4-4, having swept Penn on Saturday before being swept by  Columbia on Sunday. Harvard hosts Brown in the first weekend of Rolfe  Division play.
SOFTBALL
Though sophomore Rachel Brown  may have delivered the top individual performance of the weekend—hurling   her second no-hitter in as many weeks as part of 14 scoreless innings  of work—Cornell gets the nod as the weekend’s best team. The defending  Ivy champions stuck it to Yale and Brown to open up a one-game lead  over Penn in the South Division. The Big Red and the Quakers will meet  in Philly for a big four-game series this weekend.
Harvard’s three wins put  the squad at 6-2 in the Ancient Eight and a game ahead of Dartmouth  heading into divisional play, and the Crimson gets to open the North  Division slate against its bottom-dweller. Though Brown did manage to  take a game from reeling Princeton on Saturday, the Bears will arrive  in Cambridge on Saturday riding a three-game Ivy losing streak.

“The older I get, the better I was.”
For some former members of the Harvard women’s hockey team, that might just be true, as six Crimson alumnae were named to the ECAC All-Decade team this afternoon. Harvard was the ECAC squad with the most All-Decade team selections, doubling number of selections awarded to runner-up St. Lawrence.
The Crimson swept the first-team forward selections, as all three spots were given to Harvard alums: Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09. Joining them on the first team was defenseman Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, while forward Nicole Corriero ’05 and defenseman Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 earned spots on the second team.
The team’s four first-team selections all won the Patty Kazmaier Award as college hockey’s top player during their time in Cambridge, with Botterill the only player ever to win it twice. Botterill and Vaillancourt also recently won Olympic gold in Vancouver—the second gold for Vaillancourt, and the third gold and fourth medal for Botterill. The pair’s Team Canada forced Americans Chu, Ruggiero, and Cahow to settle for silver.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little less than a year ago,  the women’s ultimate Frisbee team finished one spot shy of a trip  to nationals, sending its successful season to a heartbreaking conclusion.  But the squad, known as Quasar, earned another chance to reach that  unfulfilled goal this year by qualifying for the regional tournament  with a second place finish at the Metro Boston sectionals this past  weeknd.
“This weekend went really  well,” co-captain Bianca Verma said. “I think we played really, really  well. It seemed like a lot of things [came] together: a lot of people  played up to a higher level. It was really great to see everyone rise  to the occasion when we needed it.”
The team won all its games, save for a tough loss to the Tufts Elephant Women, to position itself ranked  second in its region.
“Because they play really  similarly to us, they’re able to really adjust really to our weakness  and exploit that better than a lot of teams can,” Verma said. “We  got down kind of early and for some reason that got to us. There was  a game against MIT when we got down for a little while but we ended  up coming back.”
But in spite of the loss to  the Elephant Women, Quasar’s performance was good enough to keep alive  its season dream—qualifying for nationals.
“I think that we had decided  that our team goal was to do better than we did last year, which would  mean placing second at regionals, which would qualify us for nationals,”  Verma said. “Just the way that our team has really jelled, we have  a lot of depth and desire to achieve this goal. It’s really about  clamping down and getting better and being able to really deliver when  it matters.”

Oversized shoes, funny hair, and talk of amazing acrobatic feats—it’s all here with the Big Apple Circus, which has come to Boston.
“The Big Apple Circus is a classical European circus, which is very intimate,” said Joel W. Dein, the circus’s spokesman. “No seat is more than 50 feet from the ring, although the tent does seat 1,700 people. It has jugglers, clowns, acrobats, trapeze artists, and this year, America’s best clown, according to Time Magazine, Bello Nock.”
The approximately two-hour circus runs through May 16 at City Hall Plaza in Boston. Tickets range from $15 to $65.
The intimacy is supposed to be the biggest draw though, according to Dein. “This is a circus that you can enjoy because the performers are that close to you and you feel that they are performing just for you.”
Despite the clowns and animals, Dein describes the circus as a “family show, not just a children’s show,” saying that adults and college students could really enjoy it.
“It’s a great date night,” he added.
As an added bonus to the graduating seniors still looking for a job, it’s now even easier to put that Harvard diploma to good use by running away and joining the circus since the Big Apple Circus is hiring! While they’re not using on-campus recruiting, some of the positions offer “salary, housing, meals, tour transportation and vacation.”

What are some places I should try in Central if I'm on a tight budget?
Central Square is the middle child. Towards the River, there's MIT, the genius younger sibling who was able to multiply before uttering "mommy" and sports eyesore architecture. On the other side is Harvard, the overachieving eldest child with a fondness for pastels and boat shoes. Judging by what's cropped up in between, it's a tension that works.
My top pick for Central is actually a glass of lemonade at Baraka Cafe, possibly the best lemonade in the world—or at least the best I've ever had. It's a spice and rosewater-infused ambrosia, complex and full-bodied without overdoing the floral notes. This is a drink that makes powdered mixes pale and lemon juicers ache with newfound aspiration.
After a pitcher of that, you're off to Moody's. Felipe's is to 2 a.m. in Harvard Square as Moody's Falafel Palace is to 2 a.m. in Central Square. Bring cash and stuff your face with lamb shawarma (better than their falafel) for super cheap. Or just go with classic fast food: There's a McDonald's down the street. Rediscover a Big Mac with fries from the place that invented it. Plough and Stars serves a killer Irish breakfast, along with $3 PBRs.
Moving from America and the Middle East to the Far East, the spicy dumpling appetizer called Suan La Chow Show at Mary Chung's is a classic. And though I haven't made the trip yet, the Sichuanese food, and not the Thai offerings, at Thailand Cafe has earned some rave reviews.
Dairy is the best antidote to a burning tongue. Regardless of whether or not their "best ice cream in the world" proclamation holds true, the cold stuff is unquestionably pretty damn good at Toscanini's. It's also inventive, which always scores points in my flavor-tripping book. If you drift farther towards the river, more towards Kendall Square, there's Almond Joy pancakes and cheese fries with spicy strawberry-habanero dipping sauce at Friendly Toast. If all these eating doesn't wear you out, you can always catch a show at the Middle East later.

While midterm elections are still a ways away,  Democrats and Republicans on campus will have a chance to fight it out much sooner.
This Friday the Harvard College Democrats and the  Harvard Republican Club will face off in their fifth annual “Paintball Brawl.”
Approximately twenty members of each camp will head  to Boston Paintball on that fateful day. The Republicans have won the  previous four tournaments.
“I guess we’re just better with guns,” said Mark A.  Isaacson ’11, president of the HRC.
Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, president of the Dems  echoed the sentiment in a separate interview, “To be honest, Republicans are known  to be better with guns.”
Isaacson said the Republicans’ preparation  consisted of recruiting members to sign up to compete for Friday’s battle. “We’ll  win, of course,” said Isaacson. “I have no doubt.”
Coming off a four-year losing streak, the Dems seem  to hope that they’ll be as successful on Friday as they were in November.
“We’ve done some active recruiting to bring in some  new blood. We have some secret weapons,” said Berkenfeld. “I’ve been  training personally. I’ve been running a little bit further everyday to get in  shape for Friday’s event, but I have not imposed that workout regiment for anyone  else.”
Berkenfeld promises that he will shave his head if  the Dems win. And should the Dems be defeated Friday, Berkenfeld asserts that the  Dems could take the competition to a different arena.
“If we challenged the Republicans to a party-off or  a dance-off, I have no doubt that we’d win. Because we’re a lot better at  having fun, to be honest.”

French kissing is an art. It’s been perfected in movies, stories, magazines, and photos, but can often be hard to ace when it comes down to that awkward moment before the kiss begins. Eyes open or closed? Head angled to the right or to the left? Lots of tongue or no tongue at all?
This Saturday, The Boston Babydolls, a popular local burlesque ensemble, is giving you a chance to show your stuff in a kissing competition they’re hosting near Harvard Square. The group is hoping to promote the troupe’s new show “French Kiss,” which will be performed at the Oberon on April 25 and April 26 at 8 p.m.
The kissing marathon will begin at 5 p.m. this upcoming Saturday. The location is Winthrop Square, the romantic grassy area right near Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Upstairs on the Square.
The rules of the game are as follows: to compete, you must be at least 18 years old and enter with a partner. Lips must stay connected throughout the duration of the kiss and no sleeping is permitted. The winners will receive VIP tickets to the show as well as gifts from various local shops. All competitors will get a gift for participating.
If you want to compete, but feel like your kissing skills are a bit rusty, here are some tips to consider.
1. Make sure you know and like your partner. Extended kissing with an unknown or disinterested partner can result in unfavorable results.
2. Brush your teeth and shower prior to the event. No one wants to kiss something smelly, especially for long periods of time.
3. Use the bathroom beforehand. Needing to pee, or worse, is not a good feeling to have while locking lips with your partner.
4. Wear lots of Chapstick and lick your lips before going in for the kiss. Chapped and dry lips are a no for good, soft kissing.
5. Finally, close your eyes, go slow, and remember to breathe.
Both competitors and observers are encouraged to attend the event. It promises to be a steamy, exciting few hours and should be an excellent way to fire up Saturday night.
