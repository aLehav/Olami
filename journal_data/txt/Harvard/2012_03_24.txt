After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After State Representative Alice K. Wolf’s formally declared on Thursday that she does not plan to run for reelection this fall, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker announced her own intentions to run for the seat.
Prior to publicly announcing that she will not seek reelection after her term expires this fall, Wolf informed her supporters of her intentions in an email sent on Wednesday.
“Thank you for your part in enabling me to serve,” she wrote. “I look forward to continuing our work together to strive to make Cambridge and all of Massachusetts a fair, humane, sustainable place to live.”
Wolf, who holds a master’s degree in public administration from the Harvard Kennedy School, was first elected Mass. state representative for the 25th Middlesex District in 1996.
Wolf got her start in politics in 1973 sitting on the Cambridge School Committee. She later served as a Cambridge city councillor for ten years, which included a two-year term as mayor.
In an emailed statement, Decker discussed her interest in running for Wolf’s seat, her desire to solve the issues that Cambridge citizens face, and her relationship with Wolf.
“It has been an honor to know and work with Alice since her days as the Mayor of Cambridge, when I was a student at CRLS, and later as her campaign manager and Legislative aide,” Decker wrote in the statement. “If elected, I will continue to work hard every day to live up to the standard of excellence in public service that [Wolf] has set.”
Decker, a longtime Cambridge resident, managed two of Wolf’s campaigns for state representative.
Wolf praised Decker in an interview with The Crimson.
“I’m not surprised that she’s decided to run,” Wolf said. “She’ll be a great candidate. She’s been a very good city councillor.”
Mayor Henrietta J. Davis also said that she had expected Decker to run for the seat.
“She certainly knows the territory,” Davis said. “This is the only district that’s only in Cambridge, and she certainly knows the issues in Cambridge and has a passion for them.”
Wolf’s decision comes on the heels of two similar announcements from the Cambridge political scene. Longtime City Manager Robert W. Healy announced this week that he intends to retire next year—news which came within a month of former Cambridge City Clerk D. Margaret Drury’s decision to retire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a dozen unification projects are still in the works nine months after Harvard announced the creation of Harvard University Information Technology and are projected for completion by the end of this academic year, according to Anne H. Margulies, University chief information officer.
HUIT merges what were formerly Harvard’s two largest IT groups, Central Administration and Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The single centralized IT system has already enabled the implementation of large-scale projects, including the switch to Gmail for undergraduates and a streamlined student information system currently in planning stages.
But according to Margulies, who was hired two years ago to lead the IT merger, combining the resources of CAIT and FAS IT into one efficient operational infrastructure continues to pose the “biggest challenge” for HUIT.
“Because there were two separate organizations, there were at least two of everything,” Margulies said. “We still have two different email systems, two different ticketing systems, and two different incident management systems” for internal operations of the organization.
Consolidation and streamlining of internal procedures and systems has taken longer than the initial merger because employees must work on the projects on top of their external responsibilities to the Harvard community.
“Serving faculty, students and staff is our first priority,” wrote Catherine Cho Yoo, chief strategy officer and director for the IT Transition Programs, in an email. “Consequently, we prioritize the day to day service delivery ahead of our transition projects and have been fortunate to have so many talented staff working hard to balance the two priorities and move the projects forward.”
The IT merger has been implemented almost entirely without reliance on consultants, according to Margulies. While this has allowed people who best know Harvard’s IT infrastructure to feel ownership over the change and has also saved the University money, it has placed a sizable burden on employees.
“We’re asking people to help design the future organization...while they keep doing everything they would normally do to keep all the systems up and running,” Margulies said.
HUIT employees expressed excitment for the advantages that a more efficient and streamlined system will bring, but they also acknowledged that some of these benefits will not be obvious to the Harvard community at large.
“Folks that aren’t working on [internal projects] don’t see a difference,” said Stephen Jackson, a senior project manager for IT strategy and planning.
Although no official deadline has been set, Margulies said the goal is to complete the transition by the end of 2012.
HUIT has already completed the leadership transition necessary for the IT consolidation, hiring Samantha Earp as managing director for academic technology services last month.
“In a way, that was the last missing piece of the organizational chart,” said Stephen M. Ervin, associate dean of information technology at the Graduate School of Design.
The transition projects represent the final step in the full merger of CAIT and FAS IT, but some administrators feel that HUIT’s efforts to integrate university-wide IT services are far from over.
“What do we mean by finish? This is an enormous organization, with a lot of projects,” said Ervin. “Will they have all of the boxes labeled, people filled, and agendas outlined? Yes. Will it be static? No.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst the buzz over the recently released list of the Phi Beta Kappa “Junior 24,” a panel of students and administrators discussed why students' GPA might not be as important as they think.
More than 50 students crowded into the Office of Career Services basement Friday evening to hear what moderator and Bureau of Study Counsel psychologist Ariel Phillips called a “mixed bag” of personal experiences, as the panelists tried to give the students a taste of the steps and stumbles that define a healthy academic experience.
Alongside their successes, the panelists’ collective credentials included 12 failed grant applications, several C’s, and one “danger of failing” call from the dean’s office.
When it came to GPA, the panelists agreed that being passionate about one’s studies is more important than—and often leads to—a good GPA.
When panelist Taras B. Dreszer ’14, who is also a Crimson news comper, entered Harvard as a freshman, he came in with the perspective that grades did not count for everything, and expected other students to feel the same way. But Dreszer found that few other students shared his view and, by sophomore year, started feeling the pressure to raise his GPA, he said.
“It got to the point where I was just feeling miserable and I didn’t feel motivated,” Dreszer said. “Not worrying about grades isn’t necessarily getting bad grades.”
Being satisfied with a B+, Dreszer said, can allow students to focus more exclusively on what he or she finds interesting both in and outside of the classroom. By resisting the pressure to have a perfect GPA freshman year, Dreszer was free to take private piano lessons and attend campus events more often.
“Don’t be afraid to not be the norm here because the norm here, honestly, is pretty different from the actual norm,” Dreszer said.
The panelists also detailed their experiences with choosing a concentration, a decision that freshmen will begin to consider this week, with the launch of Advising Fortnight on Monday.
Panelist Rory M. Sullivan ’09, who serves in the Freshman Dean’s Office as Director for Residential Education and Arts Initiatives, found herself concentrating in psychology, despite her interest in folklore and mythology. Sullivan said that if she could give herself advice as a freshman, it would be to “listen to the voices that feel silly.”
“Do what you feel is exciting to you because it doesn’t really matter what that extracurricular was, or that class was,” Sullivan said. “If you go to a grad school or an employer, what they’re going to care about is having that passion and those skills.”
Along with two other panelists, Sullivan noted that parental pressure played a role in pushing her away from her interests.
Elizabeth P. Frates ’90, an assistant clinical professor at the Medical School, said she was expected to take over as president of her father’s company. But after taking Economics 10 and hating it, Frates said she realized she would rather pursue a career in medicine.
Frates said her father nearly drove off the road when she announced in seventh grade that she wanted to be a social worker. But later, after suffering a heart attack and stroke—possibly due to stress—at the age of 52, her father loosened his grip on her career choice.
Frates emphasized the importance of having a “growth mindset,” or looking at mistakes as opportunities to grow, when approaching academics.

Tired of hearing "Levels" on repeat while bros play beer-pong, but don't know where else to party? Anna M. Remus '13 has got you covered.
On April 1, she will launch The Neon Underground, an official guide to Boston nightlife. The website will include a calendar of upcoming events geared towards the twenty-something crowd, Remus explained, "so that people can understand exactly what is going on each night."
 Remus hopes it will encourage students to explore Boston's vibrant nightlife by showing that our social scene isn't limited to final club hopping on Mt. Auburn street. The website will highlight other options in Boston that are only T-stops away, like dance parties, nightclubs, and chic bars. "As a Harvard student it is very easy to stay in the bubble and not go anywhere in the city," she said.
If you can't wait until the website's official launch, follow The Neon Underground on twitter and "like" their Facebook page. The twitter feed will post updates throughout the night about the best places to go, bars that aren't carding, and everything else rage-related.
"Harvard students at the core are very ready to party," Remus said. "They work hard and they play hard." The Neon Underground is here to help you put away that pset, abandon your cubicle in Lamont, and release some of that work-week stress.

While some Indie music enthusiasts have voiced their excitement over this year's YardFest performers, Das Racist and The Cataracs, most students have responded with a "Wait...who?" Don't be that person trying to sing along to songs you've never heard. Flyby is here to give you a taste of Yardfest's lineup before the April 15 concert rolls around.
 
As their name suggests, Brooklyn native alternative hip hop group "Das Racist" tries to be anything but politically correct. Das Racist is composed of one "hype man," named Dapwell, responsible for backup rapping and increasing audience excitement, and two MCs known as Heems and Kool A.D. The group manages to include literary references, college culture, and various oddities of contemporary America in their lyrics. They first got attention for their underground hit "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell," an ode to our generation's inability to communicate. Das Racist isn't completely without mainstream recognition, and their music video to "Who's That? Brooown!" was selected to screen at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. (Mad props, yo.) The group's first commercially released album, "Relax", includes the songs "Power" and "Michael Jackson," the video of which parodies MJ's "Black or White."
 
If you've found yourself singing Dev's hit "Bass Down Low," chances are you've heard of YardFest's headliners, "The Cataracs," who are featured in the song. David "Campa" Benjamin Singer-Vine and Nyles "Cyrano" Hollowell-Dhar formed this indie-pop group back when the two were sophomores at Berkeley High School in California. They started off strong, scoring a hit with their very first attempt at a rap single "Blueberry Afghani". They showed their softer side with "Baby Baby," a song that would later be featured on "Keeping Up With the Kardashians". Besides working on collaborations with Far East Movement and New Boyz, The Cataracs have also produced a couple of popular club-appropriate tracks like "Top of the World" and "Club Love."
