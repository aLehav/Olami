After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 11 at the Knafel Center of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, three Harvard professors came together to discuss the importance of and their experience with writing about black lives.
The panelists were Imani Perry, a Harvard African American Studies professor, and Robert Reid-Pharr, a Harvard professor of women, gender, and sexuality and African American studies. Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, served as panelist-moderator.
The discussion material at hand stemmed from the research and writing the panelists had done on 20th century black figures. Perry spoke about the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, the subject of her recent book “Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry.” Reid-Pharr discussed writer James Baldwin, while Brown-Nagin occasionally jumped from her moderating role to talk about lawyer Constance Baker Motley. Both Reid-Pharr and Brown-Nagin have written forthcoming biographies on their respective subjects.
The panel opened with a brief introduction of each historical figure and a discussion of the merits and imperfections of the biography genre. Perry said that a key element of the genre is that biographies “distill a person’s life.”
“They allow you to catch a likeness of who they are in a substantive way,” Perry said.
The panelists then discussed their research processes in the archives, and each selected a few letters from their research to read to the audience. Brown-Nagin spoke about the polar environment Motley faced as a federal judge. She read both a letter congratulating Motley for her ascension to the federal bench, and a letter criticizing her and her accomplishments in racial terms.
As the panelists turned to the ways these three figures had navigated and grappled with black identity in the mid-20th century, Brown-Nagin asked about the intersection of race and gender. Reid-Pharr said that Baldwin consistently struggled with his own identity and with the concept of gender on the whole. Baldwin is a “hard figure to raise as an icon,” he added, “becuase he never used the word gay, he didn’t like it.”
Perry said that Hansberry stood in contrast to Baldwin as someone who saw gender “not as an additive but integral to the struggles of black people.”
Audience members said that they appreciated panelists’ effort to write about black lives and illuminate the internal struggles of these public figures.
“This [event] was very inspiring for me and it should be a continuing process for people like myself and the older generations to see what can be as now people of color take more of a forefront in their own narratives,” audience member George-Angel L. Barreras said. “I think for me it just has to [leave me] a little hungry for more as they talked about the imperfections of these actual writers themselves and the minds that they speak of, really humanizing the perspectives of activists and change makers.”
Some audience members also saw an instructional value to these authors’ efforts to shed light on these three historical figures.
“I think when you tell the story of people’s lives, women who have made a difference and what they were up against and how they dealt with it, it gives young people strategies for doing things that aren’t as conventional or people haven’t paved all the paths really smoothly,” Susan A. Klimczak, who works in youth education, said.

On Oct. 10 at the new WBUR Cityspace, the independent podcast collective Multitude put on a live show featuring segments from the production company’s original podcasts. As the audience members filed in and took their seats for the event, some members of Multitude played the video game NBA Jam, previewing the fun nature of the night.
The show featured Amanda McLoughlin, the CEO of Multitude and the co-host of “Spirits”; Julia Schifini, a co-host of “Spirits”; Eric Silver and Brandon Grugle, co-hosts of "Join the Party"; and Mike Schubert, the host of “Potterless.” “Spirits” introduces listeners to myths and legends that may not be widely known, "Join the Party" focuses on Dungeons and Dragons; and “Potterless” follows a grown man as he reads the “Harry Potter” series for the very first time.
The show started off with a bit in which McLoughlin and Schifini played a guessing game in the style of a quiz show in which Schifini provided details of a Greek mythological story, and then McLoughlin guessed whether or not the story ended in a “trick” or a “treat.” If the story ended with a bad ending, then it ended in a “trick,” whereas if the story ended with a good ending, then it ended in a “treat.” McLoughlin was able to guess all of the story endings correctly, if you don't count the story that ended in both a “trick” and a “treat.”
Many in the audience said they had come to see McLoughlin and Schifini, and a live segment of “Spirits.”
“I really love ‘Spirits’ because it’s a lot of mythology that you don’t normally hear about. Like, they do the Greek stuff that we’ve all heard about, but they also just have a ton different myths from around the world that I’ve never heard of. I love mythology, and that’s very refreshing. There’s a lot of commentary, and it just makes it great,” audience member Sarah Booker said.
Ana Georgescu ’20 also attended to catch a live edition of “Spirits.”
“I was looking for something that I could listen to on the shuttle or other times when I felt I wanted my brain to keep working, but didn’t have the patience to read. I’ve always been a mythology nerd. It was really, really cool that they covered mythology that people don’t really talk about because mythology is such a white European, centrist topic. I was attracted by the fact that it was really diverse,” Georgescu said.
After the “Spirit” segment ended, Grugle and Silver performed a bit where they each pitched a podcast show to McLoughlin. Silver’s podcast was about his love and admiration for Ash Ketchum, the star of the Pokémon anime series, whereas Grugle’s was a dig at Silver, and about how Ketchum is actually the worst Pokémon trainer of all time. Then, Schubert did a live edition of “Potterless,” joined by guest Helen Zaltzman, an English podcaster. The two examined the character of Percy Weasley, and labelled him the worst. Finally, to wrap up the show, Schifini played the role of Jolene (from the Dolly Parton song) as the other members of Multitude jokingly begged her not to steal their man. Only McLoughlin was successful in not having her man stolen.
Reflecting on the show, audience member Shubhi Tandon said she thought the performances translated well to a live format.
“It was great to see it live,” Tandon said. “I think people should listen to the podcast because they’re really funny, and I think I’m going to go home and listen to the rest of them now.”
Correction: Oct. 30, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that "Spirits" co-host Eric Schneider was in attendance. In fact, he was not a part of the show.

When Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston director Jill Medvedow heard that Milwaukee County had declared racism a public health crisis, the news made her pull her car to the side of the road. When the broadcast ended, she made a call to bring this declaration to the ICA — and on Oct. 10, the ICA held a forum discussing the impacts of racism on public health.
The evening featured panelists from the art, journalism, and public health worlds. The four panelists were Nicole M. Brookshire, the Director of Milwaukee County’s Office on African American Affairs; Barbara Ferrer, Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health; Steve Lock, an artist and professor at the Pratt Institute; and Jeneé Osterhedlt, a culture writer for The Boston Globe.
Moderating the panel, Medvedow began the discussion on works of public art that have been used to highlight historical social injustices. This introduction set the tone for the panel which sought both to talk about racism and to present steps people could take to dismantle it.
“Words have the power to bring us to the edge of action, but tonight my hope is to have concrete actions, to focus on collective action,” Medvedow said.
Ferrer, using a PowerPoint full of statistics to substantiate her claims, argued for the necessity of considering racism a public health crisis. Ferrer described racism and discrimination as the most important determinants for the health of an individual and that, as a result, racism should be treated as any other public health crisis.
Next, Brookshire spoke on the issues of racial inequality that affect the health of Milwaukee County — the Wisconsin county with the highest concentration of black residents.
“You will have seven years taken off of your life just living in a specific area,” Brookshire said.
Brookshire brought up other racially-driven disparities, such as that Milwaukee is the second least healthy county in Wisconsin and that the black infant mortality rate is 13.1 per 1,000 for black infants but only 4.9 per 1,000 for white infants.
Lock and Osterheldt then described the role of art in fighting social justice and their own roles in creating that art.
“I am an artist,” Lock said. “The artist is the person in society who can manifest what people are thinking. I am not expressing myself, but my culture.”
Lock described the work he had done as an artist, including his piece the “Three Deliberate Grays for Freddie (A Memorial for Freddie Gray),” an art installation on the exterior of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum meant to address race and violence in America.
Osterheldt also underscored what she viewed her job as a creator to be.
“It’s to hold the space. It’s not to be a voice for the voiceless. You have voices. It’s to attack the system that create the voiceless,” she said.
The panel was especially relevant to audience members Nandini Choudbury and Lucy Burriss. Choudhury is a public health social worker and Burriss is a teacher. While Choudhury’s work directly involves racial and social justice, Burriss saw how important it was for her as an educator to come to the panel.
“I teach English as a second language and many of my students are people of color coming from all across the world. Even though I only have a small role in their lives, I want to be able to understand what else is going on in their lives because that has the ability to affect how they learn and how they work effectively,” Burriss said.
The two also suggested similar ideas on what concrete steps could be taken to dismantle systems of racism and improve public health. They believed that community organizing was integral to taking steps towards change.
“The system is not broken. Racism has been placed within these systems since the dawn of time, so in order to do that, you need to take that out, destroy it, and rebuild it. I think community organizing and working with each other and with white allies can go a long way ... I think that is such a salient point, that the power is in our hands. I think we’ve just forgotten that and I think we need to reclaim it,” Choudhury said.
When discussing how contemporary art could be used as a tool, Choudhury emphasized the medium as the message.
“When there are no words to be spoken, when words are difficult to articulate and put on paper, art does that so beautifully,” Choudhury said. “When you are trying to express complex and multifaceted topics like racism, public health, art, and environmental justice, art can bring all of those things together in an image, in a scene, in a movie — in a way that words can’t do.”

On Sunday Oct. 6, New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall was abuzz. A hustling production crew weaved through the audience as fans of all ages filed into their seats. As the house lights dimmed, the wooden paneling that soared above the stage on all sides took on a warm reddish glow. The creak of a chair. A sprinkling of chatter from the mezzanine. The cavernous theater rustled with anticipation.
Families, students, and aspiring musicians gathered for a behind-the-scenes look into the recording of the 376th episode of NPR’s weekly podcast series “From the Top.” Reaching nearly 500,000 viewers worldwide, the 90-minute live broadcast showcases the talents and journeys of some of America’s premier young classical musicians.
Trumpet fanfare echoed from the speakers on stage and the theater fell to a hush: The show was underway. First to the microphone was a “From the Top” producer, who engaged with the live audience before the broadcast began.
“Music, what is that about?” he asked rhetorically. “It's about mutual understanding. It's about empathy — seeing things from multiple dimensions. Music has the power to transcend borders.”
In accordance with this ethos, Sunday’s program placed a spotlight on musical collaboration and communication, with special performances by its co-hosts — Naumburg winning violinist Tessa Lark and former “The Late Show with Steven Colbert” bassist Michael Thurber — a musical “Moon Landing” skit, and anecdotes shared by eight feautured young performers.
The “Kaliko Quartet,” comprised of violinists Lena-Marie DeMayo Stoger and Cheng Io Lo and twin brothers Kevin and Andrew Wallace on viola and cello, took center stage for the night’s first performance. The group performed Allegro ma non tanto from String Quartet in C minor, Op. 18, No. 4.
Following a smattering of applause, the theater fell to silence. A cough echoed in the audience as the artists set their bows upon the strings. Breathing in unison, the quartet came alive, four bows swaying in unison as passages of Beethoven rose over the audience.
After their performance, Lark lauded the group’s chemistry and musical synchronicity.
“I know there is one set of twins amongst you all, but I would be convinced by your ensemble that you all are quadruplets,” Lark joked.
What did it take to achieve such cohesiveness? The group revealed in a brief interview on stage that they had been rehearsing together for seven years, and practicing their music blind.
“We were playing the Mendelssohn String Quartet, [and there] was a very difficult part that we had to keep together. We had the eye contact but we needed to go to the next level to make it perfect,” Wallace said. “Ching brought up the idea of going in the dark. There are no windows in our practice room so we turned off the lights to practice sensing breath and body language and movements.”
Throughout the night, the audience learned a bit about each of the performers. Following their performances, the hosts allowed each young musician to share a piece of themselves to the audience — jokes, stories, struggles and triumphs that marked their journeys as individuals and performers.
Long-time fan of the show Orlene Hagedorn described that this interpersonal buy in is part of what keeps her coming back. “I love the music, and I love the kids,” Hagedorn said. “I was a teacher before I retired and to see these kids performing so well and to hear their stories is so inspirational.”
Audience member Catherine Baisly said she was especially inspired by the story of Aleksander Vitanov, an 18-year-old trumpet player originally from Macedonia. Without money to afford air fares, Vitanov remained dedicated to his dream of studying trumpet in America.
“I decided I was going to come and that’s it, when I decide something it is very hard to change [my mind],” Vitanov said. “I played in bars with my band, and played folk songs to earn money, and did labor work in my grandparent’s village.”
Finally, Vitanov arrived at Interlochen Center for the Arts on a full scholarship — and there, he felt an immediate sense of community.
“I will never forget,” Vitanov said.“when we had our first rehearsal, even on the tuning note, I [heard] how the band sounded, and I’m like oh my god. This is where I belong.”
After thanking the performers, Thurber and Lark closed out the show with a performance of their original composition, “Cedar and Sage,” accompanied by the Kaliko quartet. Thurber, having performed on From the Top himself years ago, described what it meant to him to support the journeys of this group young musicians.
“I was so excited when I was on the show the first time,” Thurber said. “So to now be able to do that for a new group of young people is really meaningful, and feels really important. Yeah, it was just a blast.”

“I just tried to take interesting photos to entertain my stoned hippie friends,” photographer Henry Diltz said of his career during his Oct. 7 talk with photographer Mick Rock.
The two gave a presentation at Boston’s City Winery as part of their Behind The Lens tour. Sponsored by Morrison Hotel Gallery, the tour featured the two artists discussing their influential work in documenting music from the ‘60s and ‘70s and treating the audience to their images and the stories behind them.
The event started with Diltz, followed on to the stage by his long gray ponytail. A prolific figure in the American folk and rock scenes, Diltz was dubbed “the man who captured it all” by the legends on the other side of his camera.
Diltz spoke extensively of his time in Los Angeles’ folk mecca, Laurel Canyon. He started there as a folk musician and eventually became a photographer in 1966, where, he said, “I picked up a camera by accident.” He then took the audience through various of his most iconic images of bands like Buffalo Springfield (the first group he ever photographed), David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, & Nash with his protegé Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, The Eagles (with whom he drank Peyote tea), Neil Young (and the cows on his ranch), James Taylor, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and The Doors. When asked if he ever “smoked grass” with any of them, he replied in proper hippie fashion that he had smoked with “every single one.”
“These guys were all heroes to me. I got to hang out with and photograph all my heroes,” he said in his talk. In an earlier interview with The Crimson, Diltz expanded on the relationships he formed with the subjects of his photos.
“The people we photographed, even the famous ones, were friends of ours... We were hanging out. Just livin’ the life,” he said.
A story accompanied each image he brought up on the slideshow: stories about drugs, music, and the legends who, more often than not, did both. He also spoke about later endeavors, including his one “magic picture” of Kurt Cobain — magic because it should’ve been too blurry and too dark, but came out perfect.
When he moved on to talk about photographing Woodstock in the summer of 1969, the audience’s fascination grew. As the festival’s official photographer, he captured it all, including a photo of Jimi Hendrix during his rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.
“We were all hippies there who hated the war…. We were peace and love hippies, then he played that song, and we thought, ‘that’s not our song that’s their song.’ But then we realized, ‘Wait, he’s reclaiming it for us,’” Diltz said of Hendrix’s performance.
To end his presentation, Diltz left the crowd with the evolution of the Woodstock festivals in images, ending on an image from Woodstock 1999, where, he said, “there were topless girlfriends on boyfriends’ shoulders as far as they eye could see.”
After a short intermission, Mick Rock took to the stage, donning a denim jacket, a scarf, and dark sunglasses. Armed with stories of British glam and rock n’ roll excess, he spoke of how the era of rock was “a complete revolution and most people ignored it.”
“You’re talking about ‘69. All that sex, drugs, rock n’ roll. All that naughtiness, but it was a good time,” Rock said.
Like Diltz, Rock took the audience through some of his works, such as the album covers for Queen’s “Queen II” and “Sheer Heart Attack” (punctuated by remarks such as “I mean, Freddie [Mercury] was a nice guy, I’ll tell you that…. I mean look at him! Woof! Blistering”). He also showed photographs of Syd Barret, Blondie’s Debbie Harry, and The Ramones. Endless pictures of David Bowie from his time as his official photographer were interrupted by remarks like,“Oh David, so fabulously hot, right?” After a picture of a particularly shaggy-haired Mick Jagger, he said, “I like this one ‘cause he looks like a fuckin’ rooster.”
Rock also touched on the drug use of the ‘80s rock scene. “It doesn’t get in the way of art, but it does a little bit,” he said, referencing his own near-death experience.
When asked in an earlier interview what started his career, his answer was simple. “LSD,” he said. “I was on an acid trip and I picked up a wealthy friend’s camera and started playing, and that got me kind of intrigued. Especially the little explosions every time I press the button.”
Though Rock’s talk was riddled with obscenities and stories of debauchery, he ended his section of the event with some vulnerability. “Anyway, that’s your lot…. I did the best I could, and I hope it wasn’t too fucking dull,” he said.
The two photographers then joined fans for a meet and greet, selling signed prints of some of their most famous photographs.
“My passion has always been music and I’ve been lucky enough to be around music all my life,” said Peter Blachley, the producer of the tour and one of the founders of Morrison Hotel Gallery. “That’s what we’re doing and I hope to do more of them,” he said.
Audience member Beyer E. Bullard said her favorite part of the evening was learning about the stories behind the images.
“I mean, you look at it, just as an outside viewer, and you don’t know that there’s a story behind it,” she said, citing one of Diltz’s many anecdotes. “It’s that kind of story and detail that creates more of an experience. It makes it more than a photo.”

As the leaves change color throughout October, the perky melody of “The Addams Family” theme song and its contrasting sinister lyrics play as people get into the Halloween spirit. There’s no denying that The Addams Family is a household name — transcendent of the page and screen, the macabre clan has a perennial place in American pop culture. With this history in mind, any adaptation has a great deal to live up to. With an at-times clever script elevating a derivative plot, 2019’s animated adaptation of “The Addams Family” meets expectations by modernizing a classic story for the 21st century, creating a sufficiently amusing narrative that’s appealing to both children and parents alike.
“The Addams Family” follows Morticia (Charlize Theron) and Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac) as they raise their children, Wednesday (Chloe Grace Mortez) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard), in suburban New Jersey. Tension ensues when the overly perky and performative realtor and reality show star Margaux Needler (Allison Janney) wants to renovate the Addams’ haunted mansion because it lowers the neighborhood’s property value. At the same time, the family must deal with the imminent arrival of their relatives for Pugsley’s coming of age “mazurka” celebration. The story does not particularly stand out among other animated children’s comedies, but the humor is accessible to both children and adults and sustains the hour and a half duration of the film.
Wednesday, a disenchanted adolescent preoccupied with morbid thoughts, begins a rebellious phase when she meets Parker (Elsie Fisher), the daughter of Margaux Needler. When Parker asks why she doesn’t have a cell phone, Wednesday deadpans, “I may not have a cell phone, but you don’t have a crossbow.” Parker and Wednesday become close friends, and realize that they both feel suffocated under the strict expectations their mothers impose upon them. Wednesday begins wearing more cheerful and feminine clothes, much to Morticia’s dismay — “Everyone knows pink is a gateway color," she chastises. Morticia and Wednesday’s clever and sarcastic one liners are frequent, making an average storyline more entertaining.
“The Addams Family," despite being a children’s movie, also critiques suburban conformity and conventionality. The development where antagonist Margaux Needler sells homes is called Assimilation, a not-so-subtle jab at the cookie-cutter lives of the typical American family. In one scene, the young girls of the town perform a song with the lyrics “Why be yourself when you can be like everyone else?” To further drive home the point, Margaux says, “It’s my calling to make everyone the same!” The unabashedly quirky Addams Family is starkly juxtaposed with the people of Assimilation, underscoring the rigid nature of societal expectations and conformity.
As the extended Addams family arrives in town and resists Margaux’s renovation plan, tension builds between the Addams and their fellow New Jersey suburbanites. Intolerant townspeople attempting to push out a nonconforming family is far from a new concept, but “The Addams Family” utilizes 21st century references to try to breathe life into an unoriginal plot. Throughout the movie, technology has an omnipresent role in the characters’ lives: The people of Assimilation keep tabs on one another with an invasive app called Neighborhood Peeps. Furthermore, when Margaux rallies the townspeople against the Addams family to demolish their home, they have images of torches on their smartphones, rather than holding physical ones — which perhaps makes subtle commentary on how technology and the Internet can help foster mob mentality.
Despite the social critiques, “The Addams Family” never really rises above ordinary. There are still frivolous action scenes, like the extended sequence documenting Pugsley’s adventures with explosives. As for the Addams’ extended family members, they are quirky but not necessarily likeable or humorous characters, making them feel like unnecessary additions that divert from the plot. Moreover, the overarching moral of the film is a lesson on tolerance, and it is laid on a bit too cloyingly by the final scene, which involves an implausibly fast resolution between the Addams and their antagonizers.
Taken as a whole, “The Addams Family” is an adequately diverting and at times witty, if ultimately forgettable, modern spin on the iconically macabre family that Americans have loved for decades.

Ah, modern love. It is, to put it mildly, a mess: Dating apps abound while communication skills do not. It began as a New York Times column that debuted on Halloween in 2004, became a podcast, and is now a TV show that Amazon will soon bring to a laptop screen near you. The New York Times, in conjunction with WBUR Cityspace, held a preview in Boston on Oct. 6 to showcase one of the eight episodes to be available. Each episode is about 30 minutes long — the one previewed, “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive,” stars Tina Fey and John Slattery as Ann and Denis Leary. Ann Leary submitted the essay upon which the episode is loosely based — very loosely, as she said during the panel discussion following the episode. If the rest of the season will be like this episode, audiences will be lucky: The cinematography is excellent, and the metaphors are abundant.
What metaphors, you ask? A key feature of “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive” is a repeated tennis match that winds up anchoring the couple together and patching things up, at least for the duration of the episode. At the start, they are novices and wear dark, mismatched colors, while by the end both are wearing white and playing the game according to the rules.
While some of the lines are a tad cliché — “I hate who I am with you now” — and the symbolism is plainly obvious, this episode, and hopefully the rest of the season, has important things to say about love. They may not be new, but that’s really how love works: At our core, we’re still dealing with the same feelings, ideas, and difficulties that our predecessors grappled with at one point too. It’s just that now, the format is different — podcasts, online columns, and TV shows, anyone? — and the audience is perhaps wider.
The discussion after the 28-minute episode focused largely on production of the show and how it came to be. Translating an essay to the small screen is not necessarily the same thing as adapting a work of fiction; there’s less descriptive prose, more narratorial interiority, and, of course, the fact that the original text deals with real, living people who may end up watching the episode themselves. As Leary explained to Daniel Jones, editor of the column, seeing the episode for the second time was a strange experience.
For those familiar with the column, perhaps watching will be strange for them, too: There’s something unique about the format of an essay, which can zoom in and out of the narrator’s point of view, focus on the interiority of another character, become prose-like, and meditate on the self. It’s non-fiction but creative, and some of the genre’s beauty comes from the reader’s ability to fill in the gaps. As a TV show, however, there aren’t necessarily any gaps to fill, since the director and costume designer have taken care of many of the details. That’s not to say that the TV adaptation of “Modern Love” won’t be a success, but some of the joy of the written version has dissipated.
Of course, for those who will end up loving the show and can’t get enough (‘Tiny Love Stories,” 100-word mini love tales that are an off-shoot of “Modern Love,” is incredibly addictive), there will be, at one point, merchandise for those who want to wear their love publicly, featuring removable tattoos, clothes, and pajamas.
If you’re taking notes or desperate for love advice — and thought this episode would have some concrete takeaways — Jones and Leary had some to offer at the end of the discussion: Some keys to marriage include having a good sense of humor, being as kind to your partner as you are to others, and playing tennis with them — not against them. Problem solved?

Lewis Capaldi began his set at the Boston Royale on Oct. 9 with drama — drowning the empty with red light, throbbing, chaotic drums, and rippling energy. But then, in a flash, the lights ended, the stage went dark, and a quiet man with a boyish grin and a dark green sweater loped onstage. The sweaty crowd laden in eyeliner and leather jackets had lined up outside the Boston nightclub to see a sad, goofy Scottish boy play his guitar.
Swaggering and silly, Capaldi sauntered on stage making peace signs and pointing at the crowd like a parody of his own genre. “You like rock concerts?” he asked with mock-seriousness. “Then you’ll fucking hate this one.” It’s the kind of joke that would fit right into his notoriously self-deprecating social media. But in an abrupt pivot to his off-Twitter persona, he grabbed the mic with a vengeance and launched into “Grace,” the opener to his new album “Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent.” “I’m not ready to be just another of your mistakes,” he yelled, before quieting down for the first verse. With instant, second-nature vulnerability, he swayed back and forth to the music, an open-book grin on his face. On stage, he looks and sounds like the same kid who achieved notoriety via a SoundCloud recording on his iPhone. Strip away most of the lights, tech, and gimmicky comedy and little is lot — the main event is his powerhouse, effortlessly expressive voice.
Thankfully, Capaldi’s voice as rich and emotive live as in the studio, each syllable articulated with an undertone of desperation. That desperation runs through his lyrics — on his next song, the lingering “Forever,” a mournful, swelling melody makes a well-matched backdrop to lyrics with unadorned longing. In front of an enveloped audience, the song played like an “anti-ballad,” a chorus of shared desire and regret to bring people together. The crowd screamed while he held on to the next-to-last note, until he finally capped it off with the song’s final, soaring “forever.”
After “Forever,” Capaldi stopped to introduce himself. “Boston, how ya fucking doin?” he asked in his thick, drawling accent, before telling us, “I just turned 23 two days ago.” The crowd broke out into an impromptu chorus of “Happy Birthday” but, oddly enough, it didn’t break up the seriousness of the show. Somehow, Capaldi can still make “happy birthday” sound like a break-up ballad. There’s something in the fundamental structural rawness of his voice that inevitably commands attention, signaling, even before the words, that he’s about to pour his heart out.
Watching Capaldi on stage, his vulnerability is instantly compelling. But beneath the gripping performance, it’s easy to forget the almost-dangerous undertone of what he’s actually saying. As he transitions to his next heartbreak song “Bruises”, he belts out, “Counting days / Since my love up and got lost on me,” then “And if only I could hold you / You'd keep my head from going under.” On “Hold Me While You Wait,” later in the night, he sings, “So tell me, can you turn around? / I need someone to tear me down” and on Someone You Loved: “And you're not here to get me through it all / I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug.”
That theme — of complete emotional reliance on another person, and an onslaught of anger and bitterness when they change their mind — was present in nearly every song he sang that night. It would be wrong to draw parallels from everything he writes to who he is as a person, but that edge of entitlement to the emotional support of someone else is certainly present in his music. The kind of over-reliance he writes about can go both ways, but there seems an echo of the particular privilege of masculinity in the way Capaldi sings it. How many women feel entitled to the emotional support of others, so much so that they feel comfortable demanding it from someone even after a breakup? As beautiful as they are, Capaldi’s heartbreak ballads still seemed to unite listeners around an uncomfortable one-way sense of entitlement.
Following “Bruises” with several songs off his new album, Capaldi told the audience he would be closing out out the night with his second-biggest hit, “Hold Me While You Wait.” In one of his many resemblances to Ed Sheeran, a fellow fan of heart-break ballads, “Hold Me While You Wait,” alongside reigning chart-topper “Someone You Loved,” made Capaldi the only artist other than Sheeran to have two songs in the top 5 of the UK Singles Chart.
“Hold Me While You Wait” is incredibly compelling live, each swelling repetition of “Won’t you stay awhile?” more earnest than the last. Its final drum solo made an utterly cathartic culmination of the concert, the singular piano chord at the very end like a collective exhale. After the song’s end, Capaldi shrugged his shoulders, mimed an exaggerated clap, and put on a pair of ridiculous, bedazzled John Lennon glasses. Convincing as he was, it was hardly believable that he was about to walk off stage without singing the song that made him a household name. Halfway through his exit, he laughed, turned around, rolled his eyes, and finally capped off the night with an unforgettable finish — the seven-week reigning single on the UK Singles charts, “Someone You Loved.”

It is almost November in Cambridge, which can only mean one thing for those who frequent Lavietes Pavilion — the start of the Harvard Basketball season. Fans were treated to an entertaining Friday night at the Crimson Madness fan event as excitement continues to build around the men's basketball squad.
As always, head coach Tommy Amaker began the festivities by welcoming all who came out on the chilly Friday night. This season will be Amaker's 13th at Harvard.
First-year Chris Ledlum and junior Danilo Djuricic were among the participants in the slam dunk contest and impressed the crowd with acrobatic finishes. 
A few special guests were in attendance from the hometown Boston Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Grant Williams, and Tacko Fall. The trio served as guest judges during the slam dunk contest alongside recent graduate Robbie Feinberg '19.
Ultimately, senior forward Robert Baker defended his title and capped his night off with a near-free-throw-line jam.
