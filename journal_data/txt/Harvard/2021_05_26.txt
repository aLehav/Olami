After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will expand its undergraduate housing capacity on and near campus to accommodate “normal housing density” in fall 2021, even as it anticipates the largest matriculating class in its history, administrators wrote in an email to Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates Tuesday afternoon.
The administrators — University President Lawrence A. Bacow, FAS Dean Claudine Gay, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench — also shared that all graduate and undergraduate instruction will take place in the classroom, with the option of online supplemental instruction.
Gay first shared in a March interview with The Crimson that the University was “charting a path to a full return for our students, our faculty, and staff.” Weeks later, the College announced a planned return to “in-person learning” in the fall semester.
The administrators wrote in the email that both graduate and undergraduate residential programs will “return to normal campus operations” in the fall semester, including both full housing density and in-person dining for students in the College.
“Harvard College is anticipating the largest entering class in its history, having admitted a normal class size in addition to the large number of deferrals from last year,” they wrote. “To accommodate this larger student body, the College has expanded the undergraduate residential program and support system to include additional housing on campus and adjacent to campus.”
The College’s fall plans feature a staggered return to campus. The class of 2023 — the only class unable to return as a full cohort to Cambridge this previous year — will be the first class returning to campus, with move-in beginning Aug. 20. Meanwhile, first-years will be invited to campus starting on Aug. 25, with orientation held the following weekend. Classes will begin on Sep. 1.
International students “whose arrival has been delayed by visa processing or other barriers” may enroll as long as they can arrive on campus by Oct. 4. Some international students have expressed concern that they will be unable to obtain visas in time for the fall semester.
“The Office of International Education will contact these students and advise them in selecting courses that they can begin remotely and then join in person after arrival,” they wrote.
In the email, the administrators also wrote that instruction — including sections — will be hosted in person in the fall semester. Nonetheless, they acknowledged certain teaching approaches that could be carried over from a virtual year.
“The experience of the past year has demonstrated that technology can be a powerful pedagogical tool and instructors may use some pre-recorded materials to supplement their in-person teaching,” they wrote. “Instructors may hold office hours online if they feel this will better meet the needs of their students.”
Libraries and museums will be open for the fall semester, and all co-curricular events and programs, including athletics, are expected to resume.
Earlier this month, Bacow announced that Covid-19 vaccination would be required for all students on campus this fall. In Tuesday’s email, the administrators wrote that Harvard will help vaccinate anyone who has not been able to access the vaccine.
“We understand that access to the COVID-19 vaccine is variable across the world,” they wrote. “Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) will provide vaccination to any enrolled, full-time student who has not been vaccinated.”
In addition, the administrators shared that students living on campus “should expect a short arrival quarantine period.” However, the College will no longer operate under the color-coded reopening levels established this spring semester. Following the quarantine, all students will “move to regular campus access.”
Nonetheless, they acknowledged the volatility in public health guidance, as well as the continued effects of the pandemic. Detailed safety precautions “will be set closer to the start of the fall term,” they wrote.
“Harvard will establish public health protocols to keep the campus community safe and to protect against disruption of the academic mission,” they wrote. “These protocols are likely to include, at a minimum, regular viral testing and contact tracing.”
The administrators closed by calling upon staff, faculty, and students to bring a “spirit of experimentalism” into the fall semester to build “our way to a new normal.”
“Your unbridled academic ambition defines us as a learning community, and we welcome that ambition, along with your boldness, passion, and energy as we create a post-pandemic Harvard that honors our past while delivering on the full promise of our mission for the 21st century and beyond,” they wrote.
“We are truly excited to be with you this fall and invite you to view this short message of welcome as we eagerly await your arrival,” they concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty-nine Harvard student groups and nearly 900 students signed a statement condemning Israel’s use of force against Palestinians and calling on the University to “end its complicity with Israeli apartheid policies” by publicly rebuking Israel’s “excessive use of force against civilians” and removing the endowment’s investments in companies supporting the “Israeli settlement enterprise.”
The May 12 statement, which as of Wednesday had garnered 899 student signatures, also urges the student body to organize, speak out, and educate others on the ongoing violence in Gaza and the history behind it.
Eighty Harvard faculty members also signed a statement in support of Palestinian liberation that pointed out an alleged suppression of support for Palestine within academia. The statement similarly calls for an end to U.S. support for the “apartheid regime,” and for scholarly action and solidarity against Israeli aggression.
The conflict in Israel and Palestine reached the worst violence since 2014 this month after Palestinians protested the anticipated eviction of eight Palestinian families living in East Jerusalem. The confrontation escalated when Israeli police clashed with Palestinians at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, leaving 300 Palestinians injured. Islamic militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, launched rockets into Israel, and Israeli forces responded with airstrikes into Gaza.
A cease-fire took effect Friday after 11 days of airstrikes, which killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and left thousands injured or homeless. Twelve Israeli civilians and one Israeli soldier were killed in the fighting.
The Palestine student groups’ statement alleges that Israel has “implemented several forms of hegemonic rule” over Palestinians.
“As an occupying force, and against international law, Israel has erected a web of discriminatory laws that pervade every aspect of Palestinian life and exceeds the forms of direct violence we are witnessing these days to include structural and cultural forms of violence,” the statement reads.
The statement also argues that Harvard is “not an innocent bystander when it comes to the occupation of Palestine,” pointing to an analysis by The Crimson last year which found Harvard Management Company invests nearly $200 million in companies the United Nations has tied to Israeli settlements in Palestine.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the statements Friday.
Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, which co-signed the statement, wrote in an email to The Crimson that Americans “have only begun to notice the severity of Israeli occupation.”
“While PSC acknowledges the recent de-escalation within Gaza, a codified ‘ceasefire’ does not denote justice and equality within the occupied lands, the West Bank, and Gaza,” PSC wrote. “PSC will continue to build off of this momentum in the coming months to demand justice for all oppressed communities worldwide.”
The statement by Harvard faculty, a joint effort by five professors in the Anthropology, History, and Music departments — Ajantha Subramanian, Steven Caton, Vijay Iyer, Walter Johnson, and Kirsten Weld — also notes the “unwavering US financial, military, and political support” that “institutionalizes the domination and repression of Palestinians.”
The faculty statement argues that “scholarly criticism of Israeli human rights violations” has been suppressed over concerns of antisemitism; meanwhile, the Israeli government clamps down on academic freedom at Palestinian universities, the faculty alleged.
In a joint statement Sunday, the five faculty who authored the statement wrote that they believe it is important to incorporate Palestinian scholars, and activism into U.S. higher education.
“Our hope is that this leads to a more robust commitment to teaching about Palestine, to incorporating work by Palestinians into our syllabi, to inviting Palestinian scholars and community members to speak at university events, and to supporting campus activism for Palestinian liberation,” the five faculty wrote. “We also hope that more faculty sign on to the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which urges non-violent pressure on Israel until it complies with international law by ending its occupation of Palestinian land, respecting the equal rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, and promoting the right of return of Palestinian refugees.”
Independent of the faculty statement, Subramanian, Caton, Iyer, Johnson, and Weld demended the Harvard administration divest from “companies doing business with the apartheid state in Israel.”
“Although too late to be a moral exemplar, Harvard did eventually divest from companies doing business with apartheid South Africa,” they wrote. “For decades, Palestinians have been pointing to the parallels between legalized discrimination in South Africa and Israel. Now, Human Rights Watch and the Israeli human rights organization, B'tselem, have recognized the reality of apartheid under the fig leaf of democracy in Israel.”
“It is time for Harvard to take account of this reality and divest from companies that aid in Israeli colonization, occupation, and war crimes,” the professors wrote.
Samuel K. Meyerson ’22 said that while he supports Palestinian and Israeli statehood, he believes the statements by the student groups and the faculty echoed language from the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which Meyerson said is “explicitly anti-Israel statehood.”
“It’s really important to separate the government of Israel from the state of Israel and that while we can criticize one, we should not delegitimize the other, because I think that that creates a very hostile campus environment for the Jewish community,” Meyerson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life hosted its annual Lavender Graduation — a ceremony to honor the achievements of BGLTQ students — for more than 40 graduating seniors Sunday evening.
This spring also featured the inaugural University-wide Lavender Graduation, which occurred on Monday and celebrated the accomplishments of BGLTQ students from Harvard’s 12 schools.
The College’s Lavender Graduation featured remarks from senior director of the Harvard Foundation Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, director of the Office for the Arts at Harvard Jack Megan, and recently appointed Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro, who discussed the resilience of the Class of 2021.
The ceremony featured an address from Miss Peppermint, a transgender actress and activist. Peppermint, who was a runner-up on the show “RuPaul's Drag Race,” called on graduating seniors to be empathetic and use their Harvard education to help others.
“When you leave Harvard, you’ll be able to walk through just about any door there is,” Peppermint said. “But what will you do inside? Shut it tight for safety? Or hold it open for others to walk the trail that you blaze?”
In an interview following the ceremony, Chandler W. Houldin, a Graduate Assistant in the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, emphasized the importance of a special commencement ceremony for the “tight-knit” community of BGLTQ students at Harvard.
“This celebration allows for that community to come together and celebrate their accomplishments as folks who have traditionally been marginalized in society and within higher education,” he said.
The University-wide Lavender Graduation was a separate ceremony which took place the next day, though students from the College were welcome to attend both events.
Divinity School Assistant Director of Student Services Katie Caponera opened the event, followed by an address from Sherri A. Charleston, the University’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.
Charleston told members of the Class of 2021 that each of them had a “great responsibility” to become leaders in the world.
“This world needs you. We need your discoveries, we need your differences of opinion and perspective. We need you to ask the hard questions,” Charleston said. “We need you to teach, and to think about new questions in new ways and old questions in different ways.”
History of Science and African and African American Studies professor Evelynn M. Hammonds, who helped establish the Office of BGLTQ Life in 2011 as the Dean of Harvard College, spoke to the virtual audience about intersectionality.
“A community built on the affirmation of difference is one that looks forward to a better future for all of us,” Hammonds said. “We expect you all to remain part of our community, and engaged in the work to build a better community and a better future for all of us here.”
During the ceremony, a new honor named for Hammonds — the Evelynn Hammonds Award for Exceptional Service to BGLTQ+ Inclusion — was awarded to Harvard University Health Services’ BGLTQ Treatment Team, which is led by Bruce Churchill. The team has provided support for and worked on health issues of BGLTQ patients for the past decade.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Elizabeth W. “Liza” Tarbell said she appreciated the new University-wide Lavender Graduation at a time when the pandemic has made building community “much more difficult.”
“Just being able to stretch across campus and join hands with the College and all the other graduate schools was particularly meaningful as we strive to build an intergenerational queer community and one that’s as inclusive as possible,” Tarbell said.
MBA student Carter E. Frazee said in an email that the University-wide Lavender Graduation was the “highlight” of his graduation experience and that he was “unbelievably thankful” for the ceremony.
“I had never met the vast majority of graduates being celebrated today and yet I found myself connected to and rooting for each and every one of them,” he said.
