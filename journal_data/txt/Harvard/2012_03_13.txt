After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Though educational achievement often tracks family income, a report released by a Harvard Kennedy School program last week suggested that income likely does not directly influence students’ classroom performance.
“It is unclear whether or not there is a causal connection, and the best evidence we have says that the causal evidence is very weak,” said Paul E. Peterson, the director of the Kennedy School’s Program on Education Policy and Governance, who wrote the report. “There’s a correlation between the sun rising and roosters crowing, but that does not mean the roosters are causing the sun to rise.”
In his report, published by Education Next, Peterson cited a 2011 Brookings Institution study that found that the direct impact of family income on math scores, once factors such as race and parental education are factored out of the equation, is just 6.4 percent of a standard deviation.
Peterson’s article, entitled “Neither Broad Nor Bold,” questioned the Broader, Bolder Approach, a proposal recently advised by a group of education professionals and advocates that calls for a focus on eradicating child poverty, rather than improving schools, in order to promote educational attainment.
Peterson’s study recommended prioritizing teacher quality, school choice, and graduation standards.
“We need a much clearer set of expectations of what students need to know in order to graduate from high school,” Peterson said. “We don’t have central examinations of the kind that a lot of European and Asian countries have, which leads to teachers and students not knowing what they’re expected to learn.”
Elaine Weiss, national coordinator of the Broader, Bolder Approach, said that she feels Peterson’s comments have misrepresented the goals of the BBA, and called his treatment of the organization “unprofessional” and “disrespectful.”
“BBA doesn’t deny the quality of the teacher or any in-school factors,” said Weiss. “But research continues to affirm that the majority of the factors that drive the achievement gap are outside of school walls. Professor Peterson mischaracterizes us by suggesting that we don’t understand all the factors that go along with low income that make it so difficult for children to learn on an even playing field.”
Peterson also recommended government actions targeted at increasing the stability of two-parent families, such as tax breaks for married couples.
He pointed out that the median two-parent family income is more than double that of a single-parent family, which harbors benefits for the education of two-parent family children.
“Much more should be done in terms of public policy to provide incentive to keep two-parent families intact,” Peterson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maurice M. Pechet, a Lowell House Senior Common Room member for nearly seven decades and a beloved mentor to generations of pre-medical students, died in his sleep on March 5. He was 94.
 
 A celebrated doctor and chemist, Pechet graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1948 and was once considered for a Nobel Prize for his research, according to his wife Kitty Pechet.
“He wanted to find cures for diseases for which there were no known cures,” Kitty said. Pechet’s research on the metabolism of vitamin D led to the development of new treatments for nutrient deficiency. He also helped create prednisone, a widely used steroid, and 5-Fluorouracil, a drug used to combat many kinds of cancer.
 
 Kitty attributed his success in medicine to the resourcefulness he acquired as a child in the “wilds of northern Saskatchewan.”
 
 “His father ran a hardware store. People who needed something had to make it. If you were cold, you had to figure out how to make a stove,” she said. “And it was the figuring things out that allowed him to, I think, contribute to medicine. “ 
 
 Family and friends remembered Pechet for his meaningful influence far beyond the laboratory or the clinic.
“He was omnipresent,” said Tamin M. L. Pechet ’00, one of Pechet’s four sons who all attended Harvard College and one Harvard graduate school apiece. “He was available and present for commitments to students, the Medical School, his research institute, boards—and yet he was always home for dinner and at my hockey games…. I don’t know where my dad got the time.”
 
 Pechet was also devoted to his other home, Lowell House. He attended Masters’ teas and Senior Common Room lunches weekly and threw dinners at his home for the cast of the Lowell House Opera.
 
 At Commencement each year, Petchet led the Lowell House procession. Two years ago, Lowell House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, worried that the walk would be too tiring, rented him a special rickshaw. 
 
 “He dressed in a Harvard tie, looked just fabulous,” Eck said. “Here’s the man, 90 years old, with his baton, stopping traffic.”
Austin remembered, “He would call me up and say—I will miss this voice—‘Dooooorothy, Maurice here.  Do you need anything?’” 
 
 And he always tried to provide for those needs. “He would show up at the front door sometimes with a case of wine for the SCR,” Eck said. “Or a bottle of sherry which he told me I should have a teaspoon of before going to bed.”
Pechet first came to Harvard to pursue a doctorate in chemistry after a job leading cattle across the plains of Canada. Elliott Perkins ’23, then the Master of Lowell House, offered him a spot as a chemistry tutor.
 
 “He came, like so many students, to Harvard from nowhere, with nothing but his fine mind,” said Kitty, who as Pechet’s wife was the first woman to live in Lowell House. “Basically he came on a one-way ticket.”
 
 Pechet remained a Lowell House affiliate for the rest of his life, at one point serving as senior tutor, the equivalent of today’s resident dean.
The echoes of his zest for life were felt as far away as Russia. After his death last week, the Danilov Monastery in Moscow—which has maintained ties with Lowell since the House returned its historic bells in 2008—sent a fax saying that “‘separation from a kind person with a beautiful soul is a double loss.’”
Pechet offered much-needed advising to students aspiring for medical degrees at a time when the College refused to acknowledge the existence of pre-med students. He offered aid to students in and out of Lowell, according to Eck.
“He always kept up in his field,” said Austin. “He would say to pre-med students, ‘Look, you have to do something in engineering, because this is going to be very important in medicine.’”
Pechet embraced his role as a mentor throughout his many decades as a Lowell House Senior Common Room member.   
 
 Xiaolong Zhou ’06—a current medical student at Duke University who came from Durham to attend a memorial gathering for Pechet at Lowell House on Friday—said that Pechet would leave a journal article in his mailbox almost every week. Since Pechet believed students learn best by presenting material to others, Zhou recalled, he would meet Pechet in C-entryway to describe the material from the article to him.
“It was a fantastic way of learning anything from sickle cell anemia to the hormone synthesis pathways,” Zhou said.
Pechet is survived by Kitty and four sons—Tamin, Taine T. V. Pechet ’87, Tavan L. R. Pechet ’93, and Tiron C. M. Pechet ’85.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 16, 2012, at 4:05 p.m.
Israeli border security personnel placed 55 Harvard students in police custody Tuesday during a trip to al-Walaja, a Palestinian town in the West Bank, which was organized by students at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Shireen Al-Araj, the students’ guide and a coordinator of al-Walaja’s local Popular Committee Against the Wall, was arrested by police and released after the incident, according to a trip participant, an organizer, and a photographer who witnessed the arrest.
No charges were levied against anyone involved in the Harvard trip.
The students’ bus was boarded by armed Israeli military personnel and the riders were told that the road they were traveling on was a military zone, according to one of the trip’s organizers.
The organizer, a Palestinian teaching fellow at Harvard, is not traveling on the trip and asked to remain anonymous to avoid trouble with authorities when he returns home to Palestine.
Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote in a statement that the students were detained because “some of the participants in the program took pictures of areas they weren't supposed to photograph (military installations, etc.).”
The organizer said that the IDs of the Palestinians on the bus, including the bus driver and a Harvard tour organizer, were confiscated by the police.
The trip through Israel and Palestine, organized annually by the Palestine Caucus at the Kennedy School, is led by Kennedy School students. About 30 Kennedy School students and several Harvard undergraduates are on the trip, according to Kennedy School Dean of Students Chris Fortunato.
“Harvard has been in touch with the U.S. State Department in regards to this matter to express its concern for the students’ safety,” Fortunato said in a statement.
The Palestinian organizer complained about the Israeli security officers’ behavior during the incident.
“There was very little communication from the security officials, and [the students] didn’t know where they were going,” he said. “The students and organizers were peaceful and cooperative—they didn’t break any laws, but they were treated in this way.”
An English website of the Palestinian News Network reported about an hour after the incident that the 55 students had been arrested. In fact, the students were redirected to a nearby Israeli checkpoint with at least two armored vehicles escorting them but were not charged.
However, rumors circulated online that trip participants were under arrest. Upon learning about those rumors, one participant told The Crimson by text message, “This isn’t true. Our tour guide got arrested and our bus was redirected after it was boarded by Israeli soldiers.”
Al-Araj, whose organization protests the security wall that the Israeli government is constructing in the West Bank, has led visits to al-Walaja to show international travelers the wall’s impact on Palestinians in the past, without incident.
“I think this is the first time that Shireen and the group were taken by the Israeli army,” said Anne Paq, a friend of Al-Araj and a French photographer living in Palestine who published photographs of the incident on Activestills.org. “[Al-Araj] is very active in trying to raise awareness of al-Walaja village, so I’m not surprised that they are trying to put pressure on her, to intimidate her—to prevent internationals from coming to the village.”
“They said that she would be fined 5000 shekels [about $1325.52] if she does it again—but we are not sure what they mean by ‘do it again,’” Paq said, adding that she did not think Al-Araj did anything illegal to warrant interrogation. “For me, it’s a sign that the Israeli authorities are trying to prevent people from coming, from knowing what is happening [in al-Walaja].”
Israeli authorities could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t easy, but we survived another Boston winter. As the season, which included its fair share of scandal and controversy off the field, draws to a close, we look back on the true bright spots for Harvard athletics. From Linsanity’s explosion onto the front pages of the New York Post and Sports Illustrated to three national squash championships to the men's basketball team reaching the biggest stage in college sports for the first time in 66 years, it was a great few months for Harvard sports.
In such a wonderful winter, there were a number of distinguished nominees for each of the season's awards. After much debate, here is the best of the winter in Harvard sports.
Most Valuable Player: Amanda Sobhy
It is not often that a world champion comes to Cambridge. But then again, nothing about Amanda Sobhy’s season here has been typical. After making history by becoming the first 16-year-old to win four professional tournaments, she easily handled the college circuit and emerged victorious in the CSA Individual Championships. Harvard coach Mike Way said of the accomplishment, “I think that [Sobhy and Ali Farag, her counterpart on the men’s team] are probably the two strongest players ever to play in college squash.”
Most Improved Team: Men’s Hockey
Last year's losses were converted to ties and wins for this group. After starting 0-2-1 in regular season play, the Crimson found its groove behind freshman goaltender Steve Michalek and veteran forwards Alex Killorn and Marshall Everson. After being picked to finish last in the ECAC in one preseason poll, the team finds itself in the ECAC’s final weekend after crushing Yale in a deciding Game Three.
Most Improved Player: Lyndsey Fry
The sophomore nearly doubled the 22 points she had accumulated entering the month of February and finished with 42 points on 20 goals and 22 assists. In doing so, Fry surpassed all teammates in the points column except junior Jillian Dempsey. Fry put the exclamation on her progression in the squad’s final regular game when she accounted for all of the scoring in a 4-0 shellacking of Yale. Alongside Dempsey, Fry’s efforts were recognized as she made the All-ECAC Third Team.
Rookie of the year: Amanda Sobhy
Did we mention she's a freshman?!?
Stay tuned for biggest surprise and play of the winter, among others. The answers may surprise you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the entire campus caught up in March Madness fever, another Crimson team paved its way into the NCAA postseason with its performance this weekend.
The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams each delivered strong performances at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships, hosted by local-rivals Boston College at Chestnut Hill, Mass.
For the No. 6 Crimson men’s fencing team (12-6), this past weekend’s outing was an especially fruitful one, as the epee and saber squads secured three medals and seven top-10 finishes.
“We  have a very, very deep team, and in multiple weapons, we had more than  two people perform well enough to potentially qualify for the NCAA  championships,” said junior saber fencer Thomas Kolasa. “That just shows  the consistency of our team overall. We’ve had some ups and downs  throughout the course of the season, but everyone knew that this past  meet was one where everyone had to be at their best.”
Leading the Harvard men were freshman Peregrine Badger and sophomore Eric Arzoian, who captured gold medals in the epee and the saber, respectively.
In the epee, sophomore Michael Raynis also delivered a stellar showing on the day to finish third and claim a bronze medal while senior co-captain James Hawrot finished the tournament in fifth.
In the saber, although Arzoian stood alone on the podium for the Crimson, his teammates senior co-captain Valentin Staller and junior Thomas Kolasa finished in the top 10, placing sixth and eighth, respectively.
Rounding out the tally for the saber squad was freshman Alexander Ryjik, who finished 12th.
In the foil, sophomore Lucas Lin, freshman Brian Kaneshige, and junior Thomas Snell finished fifth, 12th, and 23rd, respectively.
The story was equally positive for the No. 9 Harvard women's fencing team (15-6), which closed out its NCAA regionals campaign with three medals in all three weapons in addition to five top-10 finishes.
The highlight of the day was freshman Emma Vaggo's charge to the top of the epee podium. Vaggo finished the day with the gold medal in the epee, coming in ahead of the formidable St. John’s duo of Isis Washington and Zsofia Fath, who finished second and third, respectively.
Junior Nadia Eldeib also represented the Crimson squad and finished the day in ninth in the epee field, while co-captain Felicia Sun placed 12th.
For the women’s saber squad, co-captain Caroline Vloka took home the bronze medal. Teammates freshman Kara Lee and senior Hayley Levitt finished 14th and 18th, respectively, in the event.
In the foil, sophomore Alexandra Kiefer ended the day in second. Teammate junior Kathy Chou finished seventh.
With these wins, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams look poised to qualify the maximum number of entrants for the NCAA championships, held later this month in Columbus, Ohio, on March 24.
“Looking  forward to the NCAA Championships, one thing that we have [going] for us is  that we have a very experienced team,” Kolasa said. “The most  important thing that we need to be aware of though going into it is  that we need to have the right attitude and be rested enough. We are all  experienced tactically, so it’s just a matter of putting everything  together on the days of the competition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time this season, Jeremy Lin ’10 and the New York Knicks have found themselves on a six-game losing streak.  On Monday night it was the Chicago Bulls to whom they fell victim, losing, 104-99, in a game in which hardly anyone shined for either team.
Lin, adhering to his recent trend, did not shoot well; once again, his field goal percentage was under 50 as he finished the night 4 for 11 from the field. The Harvard alum also committed five fouls on the night along with a slightly improved three turnovers.
Lin’s counterpart on the Bulls, Derrick Rose, torched the Knicks’ PG for 32 points. But despite that stat, the reigning MVP did not shoot well either. He, too, shot below 50 percent, making only 12 of 29 shots throughout the game.
The tone for the Knicks after the game was, simply put, one of disgust. Forward Amar’e Stoudemire attributed his team’s unfocused play to the too-casual attitude in the locker room.
“The joking around has to stop at some point,” Stoudemire told reporters after the contest. “We’ve got to take this game very serious, especially in a time where now we’re in the eighth seed and we’re not playing well. So the time is now.”
Carmelo Anthony agreed with his teammates, emphasizing his frustration in clear and unmasked terms.
“It sucks,” Anthony said. “The situation we’re in right now, it sucks losing basketball games. The way we’re losing at the end of games, it sucks. It’s not a good feeling right now. We need to get our act together and start winning.”
Currently, the Knicks are tied for the final Eastern conference playoff spot with a record of 18-24. To give perspective, if a team had that record in the West, not only would it not be in the hunt for playoff positioning, but also it’d be third to last in the conference.
Somewhere within the last couple of weeks, both Linsanity and the Knicks’ successful play came to a halt. Until the team begins to rekindle its cohesiveness from the long-lost days of February, it seems that the times of puns plastering the headlines are over, replaced by tick after tick in the loss column.
