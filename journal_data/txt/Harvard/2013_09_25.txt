With apologies to T.S. Eliot
 
UNIVERSAL CITY, TX –
Do I dare to eat these gummy peach rings? What about this Code Red Mountain Dew, these powdered donuts, this Big League Chew? Here are cakes and teas and ices, beef jerky and candy bars and Dos Equis. I stalk their stock, ruffle their wares, leave not a rack behind. Shaq smiles mirthfully from the pastel can of a new line of cream sodas by the Brooklyn-based Arizona Beverages Company. It feels vaguely oppressive. What kind of vittles are these?
 
I settle for a “deliquorish” candy called “Kazoozles” from the Wonka brand. Behind the counter are dip and cigarettes, and I realize that nearly everything you can buy from a gas station at 12:30 a.m. will only hurt you. It will kill your brain cells or raise your blood pressure or leave you pinned and wriggling with the rot of tobacco. If one must really spend a dollar or two, your best option might just be a benign lottery ticket.
 
“I’ll take a dollar scratch-off too. Thanks.”
 
In playing the lotto there is a sense of giving yourself up to the unknowable machinations of the world. I become an agitated fatalist when I have a card in my back pocket. Yes, my odds of winning anything significant are virtually nonexistent – yes, I’m more likely to be crushed beneath an errant jet engine – but yes the winners are out there. That instant grand or quarter million dollars could be destined for David alone. This is my license to dream, my flickering greatness.
 
 
Some folks will grab a penny from the clerk’s courtesy tray and force the moment to its crisis at once. I prefer to savor my fix, to bring the card home and make a ceremony of its sober scratching. Each game of “Fantastic 5’s” or “Find the 9’s” could be a threshold to radical change—so tread softly and unfold delicately. Is it merely a minor abrasion that could open the door to outrageous fortune? Is it only a thin layer of latex that separates you from a new life? These questions soon dissolve into air, into thin air; your ticket is a dud or pays a lousy couple bucks that you’ll sink right back into more tickets. But at least your money is going to Texas Public Schools!
 
The lottery is not unique to Texas, of course. In fact, it was Massachusetts that first came to sell instant tickets back in 1974. Cantabrigians and the rest of the Commonwealth responded so well to this outlet for instant gratification that scratch-offs soon became a staple along with chewing gum and coffee. My experience in the Bay State reflects something different; there is little opportunity to play the numbers in Harvard Square. Maybe that’s more of an MIT thing.
 
My preferred campus haunt is instead the CVS, that retail giant borne circa 1963 in Lowell, MA.  Sharing a place of origin with Kerouac and Milton Bradley, this Consumer Value Store speaks to us students’ own manner of free association and youthful games. In other words: the insulting juxtaposition of red solo cups and ping-pong balls; the aggressive Red Bull displays; the upstairs pharmacy that is too often closed when it really ought to be open. Meanwhile the students come and go, talking of Michel Foucault. 
 
During freshman fall my roommate and I liked to go through those well-deserted streets at night and scour the store’s supply of a certain Hostess snack. Over time they seemed to increase in inventory according to our reliable patronage. Microeconomics in action. We do dare disturb the local universe. Weeknights melted from one food run and study break over a TV show to the next. Introductory classes and the desperate effort to justify our presence here: it’s disorienting. 
 
Hostess is under new management since bankruptcy. Twinkies are back but they’re smaller and less calorific, or as Yeats would have it: “changed, changed utterly.” We are no longer those wandering freshman and certainly not the bright-eyed high schoolers who came in April 2010. The stakes were low and our world was more oyster than shell; it was acceptable to delay that quarrel with tomorrow’s p-set iin the endless hours of an all-nighter. We were faced, newly, with opportunity so boundless that it was nearly paralyzing. Our lotteries were of birth, college admission, and Eliot House. What becomes of fantasy and terrific luck when it’s finally in your lap?
 
Sometimes that somnolescent eternity watching reruns of “The Twilight Zone” is as distant from the inevitable dawn as the gap between your lotto numbers and the winning digits. We measured out our lives in Sno-balls™ and Cherry Coke. But how delicious it is, on an ether of marshmallow and coconut, sprawled on a cheap futon, to drift away in self-deception. To sleep, perchance to dream. Like another restless youth before the unanswered possibilities of a lottery ticket.

“People, the revolution will not be televised / the revolution is in your mind / the revolution is here / this is my coup d’état,” raps hip-hop artist G-Dragon in the title track of his sophomore album, “Coup D’état.” A collaborative effort with famed producers Diplo and Baauer, the eerie, thumping song takes listeners by surprise, devoid of the frenetic beats fans have come to associate with these producers. And indeed, G-Dragon delivers what he promises, becoming one of the first Korean artists since Psy to not only top Korean chart records, but also to break into the U.S. Billboard Top 200.
There have been numerous efforts, collaborations, and concerts by other Korean pop artists to reach out to the U.S. audience. Sadly, many efforts have come and gone like a one-hit wonder, such as girl group f(x) and their brief stint of fame with their performance at the 2013 SXSW festival and their “Funny or Die” skit with Anna Kendrick. Still other attempts have failed entirely. So how is it that G-Dragon – a slender man of 5’8” build who cannot speak fluent English – has been able to create a name for himself in the U.S. music scene and even amongst acclaimed artists like Pharrell or Diplo?
Consider K-pop girl group T-ara and their recent performance in Las Vegas. In a poor attempt to gain U.S. recognition and fans, the girls were flown to perform at a Las Vegas resort alongside Chris Brown, who they publicized as their “close friend” in the U.S. pop industry. When the girls began their performance, however, they were cut off midway by Brown himself, who decided to take center stage. They were completely humiliated in the U.S. and even mocked by their fans back home, for their attempted and failed foray into the U.S. market. There was clearly very little substance behind this “friendship” between the artists, and moreover, the gig seemed completely irrelevant with the other aspects of their comeback promotions at the time.
Contrast this experience with G-Dragon’s collaboration with the likes of Missy Eliott on the song “늴리리야 (Niliria)” and with Sky Ferreira on the song, “Black.” Instead of trying to piggyback off of the fame of other artists, G-Dragon selects artists whom he personally respects—even if they may not be the most popular artists at present—and then collaborates with them. As opposed to other collaborations in which featured artists often barely have air time, G-Dragon splits the track evenly with his collaborative partners, even writing each song to suit their respective styles, while remaining true to his own flavor. The result of this process is an authentic track that does not seem forced or reminiscent of blatant noise marketing. Additionally, G-Dragon’s native fans enjoy the experience of being introduced to Western artists whom they might not necessarily know. This only elevates G-Dragon’s status as one who goes against the grain within the greater K-pop industry, and thus his status as an “icon.” It’s a win-win situation.
Furthermore, whereas the over-zealous obsession with “Gangnam Style” ended up reducing Psy’s artistry to comedic gimmicks, G-Dragon’s carefully styled music videos, choreography, and even attire for each new release exude a sense of artistry. In other words, while both Psy and G-Dragon were most likely perceived as “others” by a vast majority of the general U.S. public, G-Dragon harnesses this “otherness” into fresh intrigue, with his avant-garde wardrobe boasting high-end designers (often photographed in Saint-Laurent) or overly loud, nearly bizarre styles. This is in sharp contrast from the bubblegum colored suit jackets, sunglasses, and over-the-top behavior that reduced Psy’s “otherness” to strange comedy. Both are solo rappers who write their own lyrics—and under the same entertainment agency no less – but this different method of packaging their music creates an ever-widening gap between the two artists.
But perhaps most notable is G-Dragon’s ability to separate his artist persona from his real self, Kwon Ji-Yong. He wears many hats, and with a loud boldness each time. Whether he plays a b-boy with dreadlocks, a psychedelic clown, an angst-y urban teen, or even a reincarnation of himself, he continues to keep fans intrigued and on their toes. This constantly evolving style fascinates viewers similar to the way Lady Gaga’s constant transformation keeps fans wondering how she will present herself next. Perhaps it is this elevated element of carefully crafted performance that allows for a foreign artist to gain intrigue in the U.S. music scene, without having to bare all on a wrecking ball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A few weeks ago, I got a really clever Snapchat from a friend—head artfully posed in silhouette, with two words of text and some beautifully drawn additions, detailed enough to be in a portrait and so well-placed that a single glance, in the context of the Snapchat conversation, was enough to make me literally “lol”. In response, I could only muster “you, sir, are truly a Snapchat artist.” A comical conversation ensued, in which I began to think—what, exactly, would a Snapchat artist do?
When one’s artwork only lasts for a few seconds, how much time and effort are you willing to put into the small piece of your soul that is about to make its way to your friend (or, in everyone’s nightmare, your enemies)? Though the act of simply pressing a button to save the moment takes almost no effort at all, the text and drawing portions of the app add more complications to the usual framing and lighting conundrums. Possibly because there is such a wide range of effort possible in the composition of snapchats, there seems to be no general consensus on what is expected from a snap. The same situation applies in other forms of new technology, as tweet content is expected to range widely from Kanye’s oversharing to Obama’s policy suggestions. These are wonderfully versatile technologies, and users have responded in kind.
Mostly, you can tell what exciting 10-second-or-less shot you are about to receive by checking who send it. There are those artists who have decided that Snapchat is their medium, and their best friends, the consumers. These are the beautifully lit shots, with scribbles galore. A hat and facial hair is simply the beginning; there is no end to their creativity and ability. Then, of course, there is the “crafty snapchat.” This is the girl who always knows just what to say and has continued the trend to Snapchat. A sneaky picture of your TF with devil horns and tail? That’s her.
Of course, where would we be without the trolls of technology? Beyond the usual annoyances (no, I do not need 14 selfies of you within 20 minutes), instant communication lends itself to some spur of the moment decisions, some more advisable than others. Sexting, of course, is the quintessential use of an app that supposedly deletes those risqué photos after a titillating glance by the lucky recipient. Our generation of technology users, a group semi-educated enough in tech privacy and the ultimate repercussions of our digital choices, has gravitated to more “private” channels like Snapchat for our more risque actions. Snapchat is only one in a long (continuing) line of new channels for us to express ourselves without being forever held accountable for something that our future boss might not approve of. Is this art, as well? Or simply a means to excite that special someone(s)?
Appropriateness has never defined art, so sexting of an appropriate quality would unquestionably qualify. What defines “Snapchat art” could possibly be the same qualities that distinguish our favorite photos and videos, the ones we share and keep. The real beauty of Snapchat, however, is how it both captures life and allows one to elaborate upon the image with text and scribbles—an instant, then gone. The art of Snapchat is that these quick snippets are similar to those moments we have never been able to properly share, because you either had to “be there” or be sent a photo, which could be looked at with different eyes over the years, or glanced at knowing that “I can see it later.”
The difference, here, is that we are able to share that instant, elaborated upon as it would be in our minds. Snapchat has elevated our ability to share pieces of our lives with others as we experience them. There is something beautiful about the lack of long-term accountability as well—when the worry of posterity is gone, propriety also flies out the window. Though many might view that as an open invitation to get aboard the sexting train, what about those silly moments that would never elsewise be shared? The unflattering picture that is wonderful because of who else is in it, or that hilarious ad that you must show your friend but keep to yourself because her phone will have a record of you having sent it? Now you have a channel, a means by which you can share that moment of life that could be expressed no other way. So create, my friends, and snap away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early this summer, the HBO television series “Game of Thrones” further strengthened its mainstream success with “The Rains of Castamere,” an episode that simultaneously traumatized viewers with its deftly executed plot twists and impressed them with its departure from standard television convention, cementing the show to many as one of the best television series ever produced. Facebook exploded, while Twitter and Vine were immediately overwhelmed with audience reactions.
 
Yet all of the fervor surrounding “Thrones” lacks the intense fan scrutiny present in the culture surrounding “Breaking Bad,” an AMC drama about a middle-class chemistry teacher named Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who transforms into a drug kingpin. Showrunner and creator Vince Gilligan famously described Walter White’s character arc as “Mr. Chips into Scarface,” but to view “Breaking Bad” as a mere character study in morality would be to overlook what makes it such a paradigm-changing show, arguably more so than any of its contemporaries.
Critics and audiences alike have spent the past five years deconstructing and analyzing “Breaking Bad,” with some calling the series a recession-era indictment of the failed American Dream while others have drawn comparisons to Shakespearean tragedies such as “Hamlet.” No specific interpretation necessarily carries more weight than another—what truly distinguishes this show is simply that so many different analyses exist.
 
“Breaking Bad” stands as one of a few television series that actively reward attentive viewing because of its cinematic production value and expert use of narrative techniques. The show is unfailing in its carefully crafted artistry and unparalleled attention to detail come as no surprise, and both television veteran director Michelle MacLaren (“Game of Thrones” and “The Walking Dead”) and “Looper” director Rian Johnson have directed episodes.  Gilligan spent hours simply searching for a shirt that matched a specific shade of olive green. Color serves as one of the series’ most important recurring motifs, with different colors foreshadowing specific events and serving as symbolic representations of entire character arcs. Another humorous anecdote from the show’s writing team revealed they were limited to one censored F-bomb per season, forcing them to be very careful about each expletive’s placement (the most memorable being the episode “I.F.T.”—revealed at its end to stand for “I Fucked Ted”).
 
Devoted fans have obsessively monitored characters’ costumes and factor such analyses into their theories—will a certain character die because she’s wearing pink, a color Gilligan often associates with death? One blog even developed a comprehensive infographic entitled “Colorizing Walter White’s Decay,” which traces the color of every major character’s clothing across the show’s first 54 episodes and relates each palette to key character and plot developments. One recent conspiracy theory about the show’s ending—which has been so carefully hidden that AMC refused to provide critics with screeners of the final three episodes—analyzes a single frame from one of the final season’s flashforward sequences. Fans have speculated that one small detail of Walter’s outfit, (a conspicuous microphone wire visible under Walter’s shirt) which only appears on screen for seconds, could completely reveal the ultimate outcome of the show.
 
And such theories are entirely believable, too—Gilligan adheres to the dramatic principle of Chekhov’s gun, which holds that every aspect of a narrative should be essential in some way. A seemingly inconsequential bullet in season three and a nondescript box cutter in season four both ultimately become surprisingly critical plot devices and highlight Gilligan’s love of foreshadowing.
 
Gilligan very consciously relies on symbolism throughout the series as well. The third-to-last episode of the series, entitled “Ozymandias,” features a two-second shot of a chessboard, with a white king in the corner of the board. The chessboard only appears at the episode’s end for a single moment, but the image of the cornered white king speaks volumes about Walter’s current situation. The title’s literary allusion to Percy Bysshe Shelley’s poem of the same name also serves as an indictment of Walter’s hubris—a key element of this episode and the entire series. Shelley’s poem concludes: “Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”
And despair we have. As “Breaking Bad” draws to a close, the dramatic stakes have never been higher. Audiences have waited an extra year for the final half of season five, and these last eight episodes have successively outdone one another in artistry, writing, and acting. The most compelling aspect of “Breaking Bad” is the constant progression of character development and plot, as the show avoids modern television conventions of static characters by building a universe in which Walter White and the people around him are forever and irreversibly changed by their actions. Walter’s wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), former partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and his DEA brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) now must finally face the consequences of the situation Walter has thrust them into. All of the skeletons (literal and figurative) in Walter’s closet have come knocking, and no longer is Walter “the danger” or “the one who knocks,” as he proclaims in season four.
 
Regardless the outcome of the finale, “Breaking Bad” has slowly but undeniably redefined the way audiences watch television and exponentially raised standards for what good television can be. The show might provide carefully telegraphed shocks similar to “Game of Thrones,” and it also has obsessive fans analyzing the cinematography as is the case with “Mad Men”—but “Breaking Bad” truly distinguishes itself with its detail. Gilligan crafts his show with the same finesse and meticulousness that Walter brings to the laboratory, and the resulting product is the best on the market.

One early morning, two weeks after completing my freshman year, I was on my way to a Los Angeles airport to catch a plane bound for New York. I had no idea what to expect. Along with my luggage, I carried a burdensome worry. I worried that I was not cut out to be a Legal Aid Society intern in New York, more specifically in the Bronx. But the next day, that feeling disappeared. Walking into the Bronx Family Court for the first time reminded me exactly why working at this legal nonprofit was so important to me.
I am a young black male. And I quickly learned that the Bronx Family Court lobby is full of other young black males, not much younger than I. During my freshman year, I had an opportunity to talk about many issues facing the black community with my professors and peers—access to a higher education, high unemployment rates, kids being stopped and frisked 60 times by the time they are 18, mass incarceration, and the “New Jim Crow.” But just discussing these issues always seemed to fall short on some level for me. Working as an education advocate at the Legal Aid Society this past summer gave me an opportunity to turn my passion into action. 
I attended public schools in inner-city Los Angeles my entire pre-college life. I realize now that the main reason I did not fall through the same cracks that many of my peers fell through is because of the support system that my parents fostered at home since the day I was born. The reality of America is that many children get in trouble with the law and embark on the road to serious crimes because they do not have the basic support at home that so many of us take for granted. 
During the summer, I worked with one particular 11-year-old who had already been locked up in juvenile detention. It is easy for some to come to the conclusion that he is just a bad apple that needs to be locked away. But that’s before they realize that his mother abandoned him, his father was deported to the Dominican Republic, and his grandmother continues to neglect him because she has five other kids to raise. 
Society may not have the power to mend every broken family, but it does have the power to make sure every young person has access to a quality education. Every one of us can think back to that one teacher, or that one coach, or that one principal who made a difference. My heart broke every time I visited a client’s school this summer. I could see the school-to-prison pipeline at work. Children were being suspended day after day, and in order to avoid going through the entire process required for lengthy suspensions, principals turned certain classrooms into pseudo prisons. Students that acted up too much were just sent to a classroom for the entire year. Absolutely no learning happened in that room, just “detention” for seven hours a day.
That 11-year-old attended a school just like this. Instead of providing the special education services he was entitled to on his Individualized Education Program, the school continued to suspend him. In other words, the school adopted the same philosophy of punishment over rehabilitation that our current prison system embraces.
I helped this child find an alternative school; one that would address his special education needs and help him get back on track to graduate. The next best thing to having a supportive family is having a supportive school. There is no doubt in my mind that for many of the children in America, the difference between being in juvenile detention on the path to prison and graduating from high school on the path to college is the presence of a support system, at home or in school.
Unfortunately, not everyone involved in criminal justice understands that criminality is not born, but made through lifetime experiences. My childhood experiences allow me to see this truth. Many children in my neighborhood were smart and capable students, but they ended up on the wrong side of the law because they did not have anyone at home or at school that supported them. I did not want that to happen to the young people I was working with this summer. I made a promise to myself in June: For the next 2 months, I was going to take maximum advantage of my unlikely presence as a Legal Aid Society intern from Harvard College. When people look at me, they don’t expect me to be working alongside judges, lawyers, and social workers. They expect me to be on the other side, behind metal bars. I truly believe that my very presence in these kids’ lives made a difference. Most of them did not say it directly, but I could see it in their eyes.
I’ll never forget the day, towards the end of my summer in New York, when that 11-year-old expressed his appreciation for the work that his lawyers and I did, helping him get into another school.
“I want to be a lawyer when I grow up because I want to help people too,” he said. 
This child understood that the prison system is not his destiny. I challenge the rest of America is realize this too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s punch season, the time of year when sophomore guys, convinced that the only way they will ever gain access to the social capital they have heretofore been denied on campus, roam the streets of Cambridge in suits and other strange costumes. Final clubs, the centuries-old single-gender institutions whose facades dominate Harvard Square, are not only spaces where club members can eat, relax, and network with well-connected alums. Along with a few other Harvard-affiliated institutions, they also host the largest and most visible parties on Friday and Saturday nights in Harvard Square. They are just one example of how sex and politics are inextricably and destructively linked on Harvard’s campus.
Final clubs have been lambasted by some activists and journalists for their reputation as sites of sexual assault. For example, a 2010 Crimson scrutiny notes, “Phoenix president Byron T. Lichtenstein ’11 says he believes that the clubs are tied to the issue of sexual assault because the College depends on them to host parties for undergraduates. ‘The clubs are a social space, and until Harvard has more social spaces there’s always going to be an association between the final clubs and being afraid of sexual assault,’ he says.” But although the potential of high sexual assault rates at final clubs is alarming, it’s not the topic of this article. Instead, I’m interested in the fact that final clubs are sexual spaces at all.
Final clubs are best known to the majority of campus as buildings, owned and controlled by men, which admit women only for certain events—most commonly, parties. If Lichtenstein was right when he said that the clubs are now a predominant social space on campus, then one of Harvard’s main social spaces is one which only men have ownership over, and to which women are only welcome as guests.
Importantly, final clubs are also one of the most powerful cultural institutions on campus. Because of their histories and financial privilege, they lodge much of the remaining power of old-boys’-club Harvard. It is not a coincidence that the space on campus in which sex and power intersect every Friday night is also the space in which male members gain access to some of the most powerful Harvard alums and traditions. Members pay dues to be part of an exclusive club of political, economic, and sexual power.
Yet final clubs are not the only institution at Harvard that mixes power, privilege, and sex. The spring before I arrived at Harvard, Martabel Wasserman ’09 wrote a resoundingly powerful piece for Perspective Magazine entitled Conquering Space: Opinions on Sex at Harvard.  Wasserman notes that exclusive social clubs-slash-publications with extensive off-campus space, as well as exclusive social clubs with no intent to publish anything, contribute to a culture that vests social power at Harvard in historically white, male institutions. She argues that since the comp and initiation processes of Harvard’s most elite student organizations involve parties and sex, “competitive hierarchy is inextricably linked to the sexual landscape of our campus.”
It’s been four years since Wasserman’s important piece was published, and so I want to quote extensively from her here. Wasserman writes: “The idea of standing outside in the New England winter waiting to be judged on my appearance to determine whether I could enter a male-dominated, heterosexist space to grind with some entitled fuckers was never appealing to me. The fact that most of our social spaces on campus are old boys’ clubs that act as if there is a virtue in partaking in outdated traditions is patently absurd… Whether it be the Lampoon, the Advocate or the Spee, Harvard social life is structured around exclusivity. Our sense of community is hierarchical: men choose which women can come into the final clubs and comp processes degenerate into incongruous exercises in ego and domination.”
Harvard’s venerated publications and other comped student organizations are known for their social scenes as well as their stated missions. Those running the comp, whether consciously or not, may be choosing not only who they’ll be running events with, but also who they’ll be partying with. In my experience, this has influenced the culture of The Crimson and the Harvard Political Review. Wasserman wrote about an experience of non-consensual sex after being given “lethal amounts of alcohol” as part of  the initiation process for the Advocate.  I don’t mean to defame these particular organizations, but simply to point out that sexual politics at Harvard doesn’t end with final clubs. Students who’ve been questioning their vague feelings of discomfort in comped organizations should know that their experiences are not isolated and they are not apolitical.
Mixing social capital and sexual politics in a campus environment dominated by rape culture—a culture that systematically legitimizes and excuses sexual violence and relies on heterosexism—is not only disempowering for women and queer students, it’s dangerous. It’s not that student organizations should have no social aspect—I’ve certainly valued the community I found in The Crimson editorial board—and it’s not that I have anything against sex. But it’s possible to have a community not built upon drunken, debatably-consensual grinding and hook-ups. Shuttering final clubs would be an important first step to redistributing power at Harvard. But even that won’t solve the much larger problem: that, across campus, political power is vested in organizations which also value a certain kind of sex.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does $6.5 billion buy? For Harvard, it buys House renewal, campus expansion in Allston, a larger engineering school, more common spaces, more financial aid, and new courses on edX. At the Against Malaria Foundation, one of GiveWell’s top-rated charities, it buys 2.6 million saved lives.
For the American people, it buys an election.
Yes, the 2012 congressional and presidential election, the election that culminated in 90 percent of incumbent representatives and 91 percent of incumbent senators returning to the Hill and the same man remaining in the Oval Office, cost $6.5 billion dollars. And that does not even include the hundreds of millions spent by “issue-advocacy” groups, whose political activities and donors go completely undisclosed.
Indeed, in the wake of Citizens United and years of weak campaign finance laws, there is a lot we do not know about how our elected officials reached our TVs, our YouTube videos, and our ballots in the endless campaign leading up to Tuesday, November 6. What we do know is that 61 Super PAC donors, contributing an average of $4.7 million each, spent as much on the 2012 election as the 1.43 million ever-touted small donors to the Obama and Romney presidential campaigns. We know that 132 individuals, giving at least $1 million each, covered 60.4 percent of Super PACs’ $600 million investment. We also know that it would take 322,000 average American families to match Sheldon and Miriam Adelson’s 2012 election spending, assuming each family gave the same share of its net worth as the couple did.
Finally, we the people—the voters, donors, politicians, lobbyists, CEOs, and citizens—know, or at least cannot help but suspect, that all this money has corrupted our political system. When we hear the above facts, the sacred democratic ideal of “one person, one vote” sounds like a sick delusion. When we know that our representatives spend hours each day fundraising as corporations and special interests spend $3.3 billion a year lobbying, our measly marks on a ballot feel like a pittance in the vast economy of influence that runs our political system. And when we know that the president who promised to take back Washington from the “stranglehold” of special interests now has his own issue-advocacy group playing the same old game, we just sigh, disappointed yet not surprised.
But as students and future leaders, those charged with making the world a better place, we cannot let this legalized corruption continue. A vibrant and growing movement has emerged to finally take back our democracy, and this year you can join that movement right here on campus. If this corruption concerns you, and it should, I invite you to join Democracy Matters this fall.
DM here in Cambridge is one of 50 campus chapters throughout the country affiliated with the campaign finance reform advocacy group Common Cause. By building a coalition with political groups of all stripes on campus, DM will offer many opportunities for students to learn about the issue of campaign finance, take on leadership roles, engage with the national movement, and create change at the campus, local, state, and federal level. The goal, publically financed elections nationwide, is simple. Getting there is the tough part.
DM is a home for those of us fighting for our political goals, be it environmental protection or more efficient government, but getting drowned out by those with more sway in Washington. But just as important, it is for those of us so fed up by the absurdity of politics today that following the political debate feels like a complete waste of time.
Like many students here, I have spent countless hours outside of class on activities and causes I care about, and I know how difficult it is to take on yet another one. But I am convinced that our broken campaign finance system lies at the heart of so many problems we devote our time to, and so many others we give up on because they seem impossible to solve.
Campaign finance is not a story of heroes and villains, or of bags of money passed under the table. Rather, it is one of mostly well-intentioned people caught up in a corrupt system. And while it is certainly a daunting task, ending this corruption is possible if we make our voices heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixteen months ago, Stone Hall was still Old Quincy. Some Quincy sophomores still had to walk through each other’s rooms to get to the bathroom. Others had to climb over their roommates to get to the door. Nobody is nostalgic for the cramped quarters of a couple years ago. Stone Hall today is a beautiful building worthy of Harvard.  But administrators billed Old Quincy as a test project, and they should continue to see it that way. The renovation is a vast improvement, but it is far from perfect. The loss of the suite-style arrangement that is integral to upperclassman life is especially troubling. The final cost of the renovations will likely be over $1 billion, so it is crucial to get it right. As renewal proceeds, it is important for Harvard to consult with students to apply lessons from Stone Hall to future renovations.
The architects of the renewed buildings have admirably tried to develop community in the Houses by creating “cluster common rooms” for students and tutors, but the cost has been the phasing out of the private common rooms. These cluster common rooms make it impossible for students to socialize privately among close friends. Having a private common room is one of the privileges of upperclassmen life, and it is also one of the most important social spaces on campus. While it is an admirable goal to encourage mingling among neighbors, cluster common rooms will likely do more to reduce comfort and privacy. It would be a shame if, in the process of seeking to establish community, Harvard eliminated as important a part of the undergraduate experience as the suite common room.
There is also a danger that all of the Houses will begin to feel uncomfortably similar. Stone Hall is beautiful, but if every House feels the same on the inside, the Houses will become like dorms. It should be possible for a student to tell which House they are in simply by standing in the hallway or in a student room. And within the Houses, if every room feels the same, the fun of quirky, special rooms will be lost. If Eliot loses the Cockpit or Currier loses the Ten Man, a great deal of character and individuality will disappear.
These are the major issues that must be addressed in future plans. There are also minor issues—the lack of peepholes on doors and the lack of gender-neutral bathrooms, for example—but those are easily resolvable. It is more important for Harvard and the architects to resolve the big problems. That can only happen by consulting with undergraduates.

Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit by President Barack Obama on Tuesday.
Barron, a former Crimson president who went on to graduate from the Law School two years before Obama, must have his confirmation approved by the Senate before he can take a seat on the First Circuit bench.
“David Jeremiah Barron has displayed exceptional dedication to the legal profession through his work, and I am honored to nominate him to serve the American people as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals,” Obama said in a White House press release. “He will be a diligent, judicious, and esteemed addition to the First Circuit bench.”
When asked for comment Tuesday evening, Barron’s colleagues at the Law School said that the public law professor was an apt choice for the appeals court nomination.
“David Barron is a superb lawyer with deep experiences in federal, state, and local government,” said Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow. “He will be an outstanding judge as he has great judgment as well as wide expertise. He is such a valued member of our community, but for the greater good, I hope the Senate promptly confirms his nomination.”
Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who taught Barron when he was a student at the Law School, said Obama’s nominee would make a “superb circuit court judge.”
“He is a brilliant and unusually imaginative legal analyst and a distinguished, universally admired scholar,” Tribe said. “He thinks deeply and writes both elegantly and with great care, going out of his way to formulate as strongly as possible the best available arguments against whatever position he ends up defending and to examine broadly the human and institutional consequences of each option under consideration.”
Tribe also said Barron was one of Obama’s best choices for a judicial appointment of his entire presidency.
“He should be confirmed with ease and is destined to be a truly great appellate judge,” Tribe said. “Professor Barron has everything it takes to be among the greatest jurists of our time.”
While Barron was at the the Law School, he served on the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he clerked for Stephen R. Reinhardt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and later for U.S. Supreme Court judge John P. Stevens, who was succeeded by former Law School Dean Elena Kagan in 2010.
After joining the Law School faculty in 2004, Barron took a leave from his position in 2009 to serve as acting assistant attorney general under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Barron’s nomination comes after he was selected by President Drew G. Faust last spring to head a task force reviewing the University’s email privacy policies. Email privacy rose to the forefront of University scrutiny in March when a secret search by Harvard administrators into resident deans’ accounts in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal became public.
Barron’s group is charged with determining whether a University-wide email policy is necessary to address potential policy discrepancies across schools. The group is scheduled to complete its review this fall and issue an official recommendation to Faust by January.

The National Science Foundation has approved $45 million in grants over the next five years to open two new interdisciplinary research centers in Cambridge—the Center for Integrated Quantum Materials at Harvard and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines at MIT.
Of the $45 million, up to $20 million will go to the center at Harvard, which will be under the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the MIT-based center will receive up to $25 million.
The Harvard-based center will be designed to enable collaboration between Harvard, MIT, Howard University, and the Museum of Science in Boston. The center will not occupy a physical space at the University, but rather serve as an intellectual group that comprises many top researchers from the collaborating institutions.
The grant for the Harvard-based center starts on October 3 and will include $20 million in the first five years, with the possibility for renewal for an additional five years, according to SEAS professor Robert M. Westervelt, who will lead the venture at Harvard.
Westervelt said the center provides a new opportunity for Harvard to increase its involvement in materials science and electrical engineering.
“Traditionally, Harvard has [been] thinking of being Ivy League and very abstract and high level-abstract ideas, as opposed to MIT, which is probably number one in electrical engineering,” Westervelt said. “The question for SEAS [is] ‘What do we do at Harvard?’ How do we really make an impact on electrical engineering and photonics and the like?”
To this end, Westervelt said, SEAS has recently placed greater emphasis on redefining the boundaries of electrical engineering, conducting research about new and applied physics, and looking into new devices that are based on quantum, rather than classical, mechanics.
Westervelt said that much of the research at the Harvard-based center will deal with surfaces such as graphene that are only one atom thick.
Other materials likely to be investigated at the center include nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which, at room temperature, can store information for milliseconds. Westervelt called Harvard a hub for the study of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds.
Westervelt compared the current excitement surrounding these materials to the impact of silicon in the 1950s.
“People had the idea that silicon was the right material to use back in the mid-1950s, and they worked very hard to make that go,” Westervelt said. “But it wasn’t until 1971 that Intel actually made the first microprocessor [that] you hit that terrific exponential growth.”

Two candidates—Martin J. Walsh and John R. Connolly ’95—emerged Tuesday night as the first- and second-place winners, respectively, of a hotly contested preliminary round of voting for the Boston mayoral race. They will face off in the general election on Nov. 5.
Walsh, a state representative who lives in Dorchester, finished with 20,838 votes, 18.5 percent of the vote. Connolly, a City Councillor from West Roxbury, carried 19,420 votes, 17.2 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results released by the Boston Election Department.
The election has been the most competitive race that Boston has seen for years, in large part because Thomas M. Menino announced in March that he would not seek a sixth term after more than 20 years as city mayor, opening the door for an influx of new candidates. Twelve names were on the ballot Tuesday, including six minority candidates.
Extensive field teams likely helped Walsh and Connolly turn out voters to the polls.
Field organizers and volunteers have made a “very, very aggressive” push to contact Connolly supporters since Saturday, said Krishna Ghodiwala, deputy field director for the Connolly campaign.
Volunteers at a Connolly office in downtown Boston on Tuesday gathered at a windowless office suite strewn with empty pizza boxes, Dunkin’ Donuts cartons, and sheaves of paper to make calls and prepare for canvassing.
Both Walsh and Connolly have sought to differentiate themselves from a crowded field of candidates that often espouse similar stock and trade Democratic stances on social issues to cater to predominately progressive and liberal Boston voters.
Connolly has campaigned on a platform that revolves primarily around education.
A former schoolteacher, he has advocated for extending the school day and lifting the current limit on charter schools.
Ross Levanto, Connolly supporter and chair of the Ward 5 Democratic Committee, said that Connolly has managed to create a unique message that has pushed him ahead of his competitors.
“He has a message that really resonates with people who want to raise their families in Boston,” Levanto said.
Ghodiwala also claimed that Connolly was the first candidate to advance a comprehensive platform.
“He is as much a visionary as a nuts-and-bolts kind of guy,” Ghodiwala said.
For his part, Walsh’s campaign has been bolstered by union support. Walsh—who previously served as head of the Boston Building Trades, which represents ironworkers, electricians, and other unions—secured campaign supporters from labor groups and solicited donations from several union groups. He was endorsed by the Greater Boston Labor Council in June and later the United Steelworkers District 4 in September.
Walsh proposed in September a plan to sell City Hall Plaza in an effort to revitalize the area to generate funds from private resources and move the government services elsewhere. Walsh suggested the money gained could then be used for investment in education and parks in the city.
Walsh has also made housing issues a priority and plans to work with developers to expand affordable housing options in Boston’s neighborhoods.

Six months after Congress approved cuts to the funding of the National Science Foundation Political Science Program, political scientists at Harvard said that their field has already begun to suffer from the loss of funding. Faculty members expressed concern at the precedent set by a Congressional decision about what research should be conducted.
The budgetary cutback was proposed by Republican Senator Tom Coburn, who argued that political science research rarely benefits society in a concrete way. He argued against NSF funding for political research unless it was “promoting national security or the economic interests of the United States,” according to Slate.
Jane J. Mansbridge, a Harvard Kennedy School professor, said the financial loss that the Coburn amendment has caused the Government Department and the Kennedy School is hard to quantify, but she said that she personally has felt the impact of the cuts.
Because the NSF responds to specific proposals, Mansbridge said, it is difficult to know how many faculty members would have applied this year if the regulations had not changed. Back in March, however, The Crimson reported that the Kennedy School received almost $1 million in NSF funding in FY2012.
Mansbridge, who served as president of the American Political Science Association last academic year, reported that the NSF withdrew expected funding for her research project on negotiation in the political arena following the passage of the Coburn amendment.
“I was particularly sorry about this because negotiation is such a large part of politics and yet it has been relatively unstudied,” she said. “It is particularly sad not to have funding for this work when Congress today is having such a hard time negotiating.”
According to University professor emeritus Sidney Verba ’53, a former APSA president, the NSF cuts are slowing down or holding back several research projects in the government department. Verba said that in the past many members of the government faculty members have had successful research programs funded by the NSF.
Kennedy School professor Robert D. Putnam, who penned an editorial defending political science research, is among the Harvard faculty members who have benefited from NSF funding. In the article, which was published in Politico in July, Putnam wrote that under the new regulations he would not have received NSF funding for his groundbreaking work on civil society and democracy.
“Somewhere in America at this moment, young political and social scientists early in their careers are pursuing ideas at least as promising as mine 40 years ago, ideas that eventually could contribute to our national well-being,” Putnam wrote. “The Coburn amendment has the effect of turning off the oxygen in the incubator for those ideas.”
Harvard professors also shared their concern that the Coburn amendment has set a dangerous precedent.
“If we move toward an approach in which the elected representatives decide what kind of research they want to have done that research will be deeply politicized,” Mansbridge said. “I think we found over the course of many centuries that that’s not a good idea.”
Verba, who has received NSF funding in the past, described the Congressional approval as an attempt at “blackmail.”
“The NSF people in a way have no choice,” he said. “Either they will go along with [Senator Coburn] in this particular act, or they will block the work of the whole foundation.”
The issue also is on the minds of political scientists nationwide. Members of the ASPA discussed the impact of the funding restriction during their annual meeting in Chicago in early September.
Arthur P. Spirling, associate professor in the government department, said that political scientists broadly have united in opposition to the cuts by showing the value of past research conducted through NSF funding.
“I wish we were able to make the case to members of Congress in ways they would hear,” Mansbridge said.

Members of Harvard’s Jewish and Muslim communities chatted over plates of sushi and falafel in the courtyard of Harvard Hillel Tuesday night to celebrate the beginning of the Jewish holiday Sukkot and belatedly celebrate the close of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting that ended in August.
The annual Sukkat Salaam dinner tradition—started nine years ago and sponsored by Harvard Hillel and the Harvard Islamic Society—is part of an ongoing effort to encourage dialogue between the two communities.
“It’s an opportunity to get folks around a table who may not always have the opportunity to talk to one another,” said Nuri Friedlander, associate chaplain for the Islamic Society. “The dinner is a fixed part of the yearly events for both faiths.”
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director of Harvard Hillel, said that sharing a meal and making personal connections is vital for strengthening the relationship between the two communities.
“The dinner is so important because at the end of the day, there is nothing quite like friendship,” said Steinberg. “We can try to connect the two communities in different ways and achieve dialogue and recognition and respect and tolerance…but none of these things are a substitute for friendship.”
Asmaa Rimawi ’14, president of the Harvard Islamic Society, stressed the importance of creating and maintaining a bond between the two groups since relationships between Jewish and Muslim communities outside of Harvard are sometimes tense.
“The event has the aim of maintaining Muslim-Jewish community relations on campus, in light of everything else going on in the world,” Rimawi said. “A lot of people who don’t usually come to Hillel for dinner come just this one time a year simply out of respect for that bond of the two communities.”
Around tables seated under a makeshift awning, Muslim and Jewish students and community members shared personal anecdotes and discussed the role religion played in their lives.  At the informal kosher dinner, leaders of both faiths gave notes of solidarity between the two faiths, with Steinberg harkening back to the origin of the Jewish holiday and comparing the gathering to a “family reunion” of sorts.
David F. Sackstein ’14, president of Hillel, noted that the turnout of the crowd was especially robust this year.
“I’ve never seen it quite like this, and I helped plan it one year,” said Sackstein.
The dinner is just one of many interfaith events anticipated for the 2013-2014 academic year.
According to Hassaan Shahawy ’16, director of Islamic learning for the Islamic Society, the group plans to host a monthly dinner series with the Harvard College Faith and Action group later in the semester.

As war continues to rage in Syria and nearly one-third of the country’s population finds itself displaced, three political strategists speaking at a panel discussion at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday night all agreed that Syria has become a complete sectarian war zone.
Beyond that, however, the panelists could agree on little more.
The round-panel discussion, entitled “The Syrian Tragedy: Ending the Bloodshed,” was moderated by Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan.
Much of the evening’s discussion focused on different strategies that could be employed to lessen the amount of bloodshed in Syria.
“The jury is out that this conflict will only be solved through political negotiations,” said Mona Yacoubian, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, D.C.
“We are at a point where if we leave Syria to its own devices, we will see civil war for years to come.”
Joseph Bahout, a professor at the Parisian education and research institution Sciences Po, expressed skepticism about the efficacy of diplomatic negotiations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “The Assad regime since its establishment in the 1970s has never negotiated without a pistol to its head,” he said. “A political solution is necessary, but I don’t see how we can reach a solution right now.”
The role of the United States in the conflict also dominated much of the discussion, especially in light of President Barack Obama’s now-stalled proposal to Congress to carry out military strikes in Syria.
“I saw no effort to define objectives or a systematic American strategy in Syria,” said Frederic C. Hof, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center in Washington, D.C.
“To the extent the U.S. considers a military option, we should go after the artillery and aircraft of the regime,” said Hof, who is also a former special adviser to the Obama administration on Syrian affairs.
Yacoubian, alternatively, talked about the importance of viewing changes in the Middle East as a gradual process.
“I don’t call recent events in the Middle East the Arab Spring,” she said. “This is an Arab uprising. You can’t have decades of authoritarian rule and then establish a democracy in a few years.”
The panelists did agree, however, on the importance of humanitarian aid in American responses to the conflict.
“Students here should go and seek out local NGOs that provide humanitarian help in Syria,” Hof said.
“We’re seeing an entire generation of kids being driven to violence,” added Bahout, who previously volunteered in a refugee camp in Jordan. “Going and simply teaching courses in the refugee camps can provide an alternative to that.”

Come October, the books and carrels of traditional scholars at Widener Library will be joined by a more contemporary educational tool.
A state-of-the-art video production studio to be managed jointly by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and HarvardX, Harvard’s subset of the larger edX online learning initiative, will open next month on the concourse level of Widener Library. The new space will aim to provide faculty with an opportunity to create digital material for Harvard courses online and on campus.
Christened the Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser Digital Teaching and Learning Studio, the new studio will feature green screens, high-definition cameras, and an LED light grid that will give a physical presence to Harvard’s foray into online education. Among other initiatives, highlighted by Harvard’s launch of edX and growing efforts to integrate technology into the classroom, the creation of the new studio indicates that what began as an experiment in digital pedagogy has increasingly become an institutional priority.
“The Hauser studio is a significant step toward the goal of supporting teaching innovation broadly across the faculty,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in a statement. “Widener, Harvard’s icon for the dissemination of knowledge, is a fitting location for a new resource that will encourage innovation at the heart of our teaching mission.”
Led by Smith, administrators first began discussing the recording and production facility last winter, according to Robert G. Doyle, associate dean for instructional media services. Construction began in early July and has involved repurposing a former storage space into a studio setting. Doyle, who oversaw the project’s development and will co-manage the studio when it is complete, said he expects the facility to have a soft opening by the end of October.
Video data will be transferred for post-production by direct cables wired underground from the Hauser Studio to the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Media Technology and Services, and the Maxwell Dworkin staff office for CS50: “Introduction to Computer Science.” The online version of the popular campus course is the most-enrolled HarvardX class, with more than 150,000 registrants.
The Hauser family previously made a larger gift to Harvard in fall 2011, establishing the President’s Fund for Innovative Teaching. The $40 million gift, which also endowed the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, was broadly aimed at integrating technology into the classroom and funding research on improved pedagogy. It could not be confirmed whether a connection exists between the Hausers’ 2011 gift and their funding for the new production studio.
"At an institution well known for innovative research facilities, it is wonderful to see that same level of physical support being made available for faculty to push the envelope in teaching and learning,” Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX and of the Bok Center, said in a statement.
While the CS50 staff and the Bok Center will have complete access to the studio at all times, all faculty will have the opportunity to utilize the facility on a first-come, first-serve basis. A full-time video specialist will be on hand to coordinate production.

CLARIFICATION: Sept. 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that funding for the new Hauser Sstudio came from a $40 million grant given by the Hauser family in 2011. To clarify, it could not be confirmed whether a connection exists between the Hausers’ 2011 gift and their funding for the studio. Earlier versions of photo captions accompanying this article stated that the studio is located in the basement of Widener; to clarify, the studio is situated on Widener’s concourse level.
CORRECTION: Sept. 26, 2013
Earlier versions of photo captions accompanying this article incorrectly described the new Hauser Studio as an edX initiative. In fact, it is meant to broadly support digital pedagogy at Harvard.

A study by researchers from Harvard Medical School has found that women should have mammograms performed yearly beginning at age 40, contrary to government recommendations that state the screenings should occur biennially beginning at age 50.
The study, published in the American Cancer Society’s “Cancer” journal on Sept. 9, found that most breast cancer deaths occur in young women who do not receive routine mammogram screening.
“Annual screenings started at 40 increased mortality reduction by almost double,” said Blake Cady, one of the study’s co-authors and a professor emeritus at the Medical School. “A 70 percent mortality reduction equals 22 more lives saved per thousand.”
The study analyzed data on breast cancer diagnoses at the Partners HealthCare hospitals in Boston between 1990 and 1999 and followed each case through 2007. The study’s results showed that 29 percent of women who died from cancer had received prior screening, while the remaining 71 percent had not.
“It’s a very controversial topic,” said Matthew L. Webb ’09, the lead author of the study and a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Something like one in eight women in their lifetime will get breast cancer.”
The study’s recommendation challenges a report from the United States Preventative Services Task Force, or USPSTF, which suggests women get screened for breast cancer every two years between the ages of 50 and 74.
According to Daniel B. Kopans, one of the study’s co-authors, the USPSTF made their recommendation in spite of evidence that most lives were saved through screenings beginning at age 40 in order to reduce false-positive test results.
“They didn’t know the data and came to faulty conclusions,” said Kopans, who is also a radiology professor at the Medical School.
Though Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a foundation devoted to breast cancer research, said the risk of false positives among women who receive yearly mammograms could cause long-term psychological harm, Cady said yearly mammograms are still critical.
“Paradoxically, if you do mammography every year, the rate of false positive is much less than if you do mammography every two or three years because radiologists can look back a year ago and if they see something consistent, they don’t have to call for extra film,” Cady said.
Kopans said he and his colleagues hope their findings will underscore the importance of mammography.
“My only goal is to provide women and their physicians with accurate information,” Kopans said. “There has been a large amount of misinformation that has been disseminated, and I hope this latest information will dispel the non-science.”

Sarah E. Thomas, the recently appointed vice president of the centralized Harvard Library, will also lead the Faculty of Arts and Sciences library systems as the FAS Librarian, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced in a letter to the faculty on Wednesday.
Thomas will maintain her position administering the Harvard Library, which means that she will hold a position in the central administration answering to the Provost, as well as her new one in FAS reporting to Smith.
“Sarah’s two posts will be separate and independent,” Smith wrote in his letter, adding, “I believe that we will benefit significantly from Sarah’s simultaneous leadership of both organizations.”
Thomas was appointed as the Harvard Library Vice President in May, nearly 10 months after the completion of a reorganization which consolidated many of the libraries’ services into one central organization. In that position, Thomas leads the shared services segment of the unified Harvard Library, whose goal is to connect Harvard’s 73 individual libraries, including the library systems of FAS and Harvard’s other schools.
“Sarah’s goals are to create library services that have a foundation of strong print and digital collections, to develop expert staff who focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of faculty and students, and create a welcoming and productive environment for library use,” Smith wrote in his letter. “She will be consulting broadly with the faculty as she develops plans to accomplish these goals.”
In her new role as FAS Librarian, Thomas will take the reins of libraries that fall under FAS, such as the Harvard College Library. According to Smith’s letter, the Harvard College Library had been led for the past two years by Susan M. Fliss, who will continue in her role as Associate Librarian for Research, Teaching, and Learning for the Harvard College Library.
Before coming to Harvard, Thomas oversaw the Bodleian Libraries at Oxford University and served on the Harvard University Library’s Visiting Overseers’ Committee. Her former posts also include University Librarian at Cornell, a position she held for 11 years, and President of the Association of Research Libraries.
Speaking to the Harvard Gazette, University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 said that Thomas’s extensive experience with Harvard’s libraries and others made her the “best conceivable choice” for the position. Darnton also said that Thomas would play a key role in fundraising for the libraries.
“She will be instrumental in helping the library to have an adequate place in the capital campaign,” Darnton said to the Gazette, referring to Harvard’s ambitious fundraising drive which launched publicly last weekend.

Harvard Medical School researchers have identified genomic regions that contribute to schooling behavior in cavefish, offering new insight into the genetic foundations of the evolutionary pathway of a complex social behavior. This knowledge may ultimately impact scientists’ understanding of similar social behaviors in other species.
The experiment, directed by Johanna E. Kowalko, a graduate student in the Department of Genetics at HMS, sought to explain the evolution of complex social behaviors exhibited by Mexican Tetra, a fish that exists in both a sighted surface-dwelling form and a blind cave-dwelling form.
The latter form of the fish is distinct from the first in both its lack of its eyes and of schooling behavior. These characteristics, according to Tess A. Linden ’15, who co-authored the research, would seem to suggest that the cavefish lost schooling behavior due to the loss of eyesight.
But statistical analysis of various crossbred generations of the fish showed a correlation between schooling and two genomic regions, one linked to eyesight and one entirely independent of eyesight.
This finding suggests that a gene might lead to a change in social behavior without impacting sensory reception.
“It is possible that the organisms are receiving exactly the same sensory inputs, but some individuals choose to respond in one way while others respond in another,” Linden said. “This difference is determined at least in part by their genes.”
The study, already online, will be published in the October edition of “Current Biology” and will be paralleled by another article exploring genetic correlates to schooling behavior in a species of fish called the Benthic Stickleback.
Abigail Wark, a research fellow in genetics at HMS, noted that these are some of the first instances in which researchers have been able to identify genetic loci that are affiliated with behavioral evolution in vertebrates.
While the study illuminated the genetic basis of a social behavior in fish, identifying the genetic basis of social behavior in more complex organisms like humans is likely to take much longer.
Clifford Tabin, director of the HMS lab that hosted the research, cautioned that such a jump is nowhere in the near future. Interest in questions regarding human social behavior might lead researchers to attempt to identify the specific gene potentially impacting the motivation to school. But as Tabin jokes “people don’t school.”
“If there’s any link it’s a long term link,” Wark agreed.
The experiments, according to Wark and Tabin, are directed at answering the nature of species’ evolution.

Five Harvard Law School affiliates could not reach a consensus about whether the right to peaceful assembly is in fact an inviolable human right during an event at the Law School on Wednesday.
During the panel, entitled “Peaceful Assembly: From Occupy to Taksim Square,” the legal scholars debated whether obstructions to peaceful assemblies were beneficial to the democratic process, in light of large-scale protests like Occupy Wall Street and the demonstrations that unfolded in Istanbul’s Taksim Square in May.
Gerald L. Neuman ‘73, law professor and co-director of the Human Rights Program at the Law School, opened the discussion by providing a historical overview of the right to assembly. Drawing from excerpts from the Constitution and other sources, Neuman said that the perceived ubiquity of the right to assembly in international documents was in fact misleading.
“A lot of international action on the subject of peaceful assembly has been raised, but there are still a lot more questions than answers,” Neuman said.
The discussion was framed around a question posed by Neuman on whether the constitutionally protected right to assembly could become “punishable civil disobedience.”
Deborah A. Popowski, a lecturer at the Law School, said the United States had weaker legal protections for the right to assembly than the international human rights framework would suggest. Popowski said that the permission construct, or the requirement of assemblers to receive a permit before action, was an affront to the spirit of the right.
“The idea to ask for permission to express a human right is contradictory to the fundamental purpose of human rights,” she said, adding that 7,762 arrests were made in 122 different U.S. cities from the Occupy Movement.
“It essentially stops the spontaneity, the momentum behind the protest itself.”
Not all of the panelists echoed Popowski’s sentiments.
“The reason you need permits is because you have competing rights,” Law School professor Charles Fried said. “And we need to adjudicate between those rights. That’s what the law is for.”
Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 noted that peaceful assembly rights may also be dangerous.
“For example, with Mubarak’s regime, we had assemblers dismantle a dictatorship, an easy victory for those who value democratic values,” Feldman said, referring to the ousted Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak.
“Well, an overwhelming amount of the same people at the same place and time brought down Morsi’s democratically elected regime one year later.”

People who own guns are more likely than non-gun owners to die by suicide, according to a study published last month led by Harvard School of Public Health professor Matthew Miller.
The study, entitled “Firearms and Suicide in the United States: Is Risk Independent of Underlying Suicidal Behavior?”, examined data on suicide rates and gun owenership from across the United States.
Miller said that the purpose of the study was to attribute increases in overall rates of suicide to differing gun laws by controlling for other variables.
“What we did in this study was address...potential confounding variables,” Miller said. “Maybe people are just more suicidal in high gun-ownership states, but we found that this is not the case.”
The vast majority of people who attempt suicide and fail, Miller said, do not go on to die from suicide. Miller argued that suicide rates could be lowered by simply taking away the option of guns, because guns are so much more lethal than other methods of suicide.
According to Miller, the recently published study is not intended to make any policy recommendation regarding the issue of gun control.
“This is a paper that underscores prior work showing that a firearm in a house puts the entire family at a greater risk of suicide,” Miller said. “People should keep that in mind when making the decision to buy a firearm.”
Miller’s study adds to an already large and controversial literature on gun ownership rates and violence, which includes studies documenting both positive and negative associations of gun ownership and violence. For instance, a 2007 paper published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy entitled “Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?” found a negative correlation between legal access to firearms and homicides across countries.
According to the study’s co-author Gary Mauser, criminology professor at Simon Fraser University, the study isolated the causal effect of gun ownership on violence by comparing countries with similar cultures and geographies.
“For example, Luxembourg has virtually no gun owners, but has significantly higher murder rates than neighboring countries without gun bans,” Mauser said.
David Hemenway ’66, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, criticized the research methods used in Mauser’s study, expressing skepticism about the broader significance of the findings.
“They didn’t do a ‘study’—they just put out some data,” Hemenway said, claiming that Mauser’s paper suffered from methodological errors.
Hemenway added that other international comparisons have found that gun ownership is positively correlated with homicide rates.
Mauser, however, wrote in an email that Hemenway’s claim about the correlation between gun ownership and homicide only reflects the medical literature.
“He ignores the many studies by criminologists and economists that find [that stricter gun control laws are correlated with higher rates of homicide], and employ much better methodological designs,” Mauser wrote.

After a winless first five games, the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-4-1) walked away with its first win of the season against The University of Massachusetts (0-7-1) and will be looking for a two-win streak when it takes on Boston University (3-3-0) Wednesday night at home.
“The guys worked really hard in the last game,” Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer said. “I think that’s a testament to what they’ve been doing this whole time. The team is improving little by little and they’ve become more disciplined. It’s a really good crew.”
According to Friedman, the team improved on things it had been working on in practice in its last two games against Hartford and UMass.
“We really were very happy with this weekend,” co-captain Ross Friedman said. “We feel as though we’ve grown and we’re improving on the things we were focusing on. For example, we really focused on blocking shots and crosses, which helped us prevent three or four attempts on goal.”
Harvard hopes to carry these adjustments into the rest of its season, particularly the upcoming BU game.
“I think they’re moving forward and they’re looking at things they can improve,” Lehrer said. “There’s a constant focus on the process of just being a better team and I think that’s eventually going to produce the results that they’re looking for.”
According to Lehrer, the Crimson will be tested against the Terriers. While Harvard’s last opponent, UMass, entered Sunday’s game winless on the season, the Terriers are a much better squad and have won half of their first six games.
“They’re a pretty talented team,” Lehrer said. “They have a couple players up front that are very dangerous, and they’re very organized. I don’t think they’ve put their team together fully yet, but they certainly have a lot of weapons.”
Furthermore, the Terriers have an early-season advantage over Harvard in a few key statistical categories. The overall shooting percentage for BU is 10.9 percent, compared to the Crimson’s 9.1 percent. The save percentage for each team is 84.6 percent and 68.4 percent for the Terriers and Crimson, respectively. Comparatively, UMass’s statistics indicate a shooting percentage of 3.5 percent and a losing record of zero wins and seven losses.
According to Lehrer, the team knows it will face a stiffer challenge going into the next game, but it is focusing on being the best team it can be instead of who it will be playing.
“I think we just need to improve on how we can get forward and keep pressure a little better when we get into the attacking area,” Lehrer said. “We [need to] have a little more killer instinct while we’re in front of the goal and put the ball into the net.”
BU has won two of its last three contests against Harvard, but in the all-time series, Harvard leads, 24-16-6. Last year’s meeting resulted in a Crimson overtime victory, 2-1.
The average shots per game for each team in 2013 also comes out in favor of the Crimson, with 10.7 for BU and 11.0 for Harvard.
Friedman said he is looking forward to the matchups of some of BU and Harvard’s star players.
“It’s been pretty great how on each game we focus on a few things and it keeps adding up and we keep seeing real results,” Friedman said. “Obviously, it was great getting a win against UMass, but there are still other aspects we have to work on. We haven’t really looked at BU yet, but they’re always a great team because they always have great talent.”
Junior Dominique Badji and senior Anthony Ciccone have led the Terriers in shots attempted and assists made, respectively. Harvard will need to pay particular attention to Ciccone, who has assisted on more than half of the Terrier’s seven goals this season.
Ciccone and Badji will face off against the Crimson’s co-captains, Kevin Harrington and Friedman, who lead the team in both the goals and assists categories.
The team’s freshman class has also made an impact thus far this season. Rookie forward Ashi Geberkidane chipped in a goal for the team during its 2-1 loss against Davidson, and his classmate, defender Alex Leondis, also contributed one of the squad’s six goals this season.
While Harvard is looking to extend its one-game win streak to two, Friedman said that the team is concerned primarily with its own development and improvement throughout the year, reiterating a year-long focus for the team on the process of getting better. Despite just one victory on its schedule thus far, the veteran indicated that the team is pleased with ceratin aspects of its play, and is ready to battle its crosstown foe.
“We’re just focusing on ourselves and focusing on our process,” Friedman said. “We have things we can keep since we’re doing them well, and things we definitely need to improve on. Every year, you know, it’s a rivalry. You want to be the best team in Boston, and so it’s always a great game to watch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year when the Harvard women’s volleyball team and the University of New Hampshire met on the court, the Wildcats took a close game in five sets, 3-2.
Tuesday night at the Malkin Athletic Center, history repeated itself with New Hampshire taking the game once again in a back-and-forth contest that stretched into five sets.
On paper, it should appear that the Crimson would have emerged victorious from the contest. Harvard (5-4) had more kills, digs, assists, blocks and attacks than the Wildcats (6-10) along with a higher attacking percentage and fewer attacking errors, yet could not pull off the win, losing the final set of the match, 15-13.
Tuesday night’s match was the third five-set contest that the Crimson has played this season, but it was the first time that the squad dropped a five-setter.
“I think tonight was not one of the bright spots in our preseason,” junior co-captain Kristen Casey said. “This is, in a way, a gift because we can reevaluate our team goals and make sure we’re sticking together…. No one’s going to go through the preseason without challenges.”
Both teams remained competitive throughout the entire five sets of the game. No team held a lead of more than five points all night and each game had at least four lead changes, with the first set ending in a 26-24 Crimson win.
For New Hampshire, senior right side hitter Morgan Thatcher was the lead scorer of the game with 15 kills and eight blocks, followed closely by sophomore outside hitter Tori Forrest who had 14 kills. The duo was effective throughout the contest and kept the Harvard defense on its heels.Junior setter Taylor Dunklau contributed the most assists to the game, aiding in 51 of the Wildcats 58 kills.
Key contributors in the game for Harvard were sophomores Caroline Holte and Jennifer Shults, who each had 12 kills on the night. Freshman setter Corinne Bain continues to lead the team in assists with a career-best 42 and added five out of the team’s six service aces of the game. Holte and Shults have been offensive forces for the Crimson all sesaon, with team-high totals of 57 and 56 kills, respectively.
Junior Sindhu Vegesena started the game as libero in place of co-captain Natalie Doyle and led the team with 25 digs, the most for any player on the court.
“We just want to make sure we’re a team that can win in close games,” Casey said. “We don’t want to come off on the losing end of close games. It’s easy to win if you’re up, 15-5, but when it’s 18-18 or 19-19, those are the times when we really want to know what we’re going to do to make sure we come out on top.”
In the game’s first set, the Crimson squeezed out a win by a score of 26-24. The game saw the teams tied at 14 before Harvard went onto a 22-20 lead. The Wildcats came back to tie the set at 22, then at 24, before the Crimson sealed off the victory with a kill by Bain.
But New Hampshire rallied back in the second frame with a 25-22 victory. The set started with an ace by the Wildcats, who continued to lead the set until Harvard’s timeout at 15-11. Coming out of the timeout, New Hampshire junior Sam Henke missed a serve that led to a 5-0 run by the Crimson squad, which rallied and eventually took a 17-16 lead. Despite the thin lead, the Wildcats pushed through to edge Harvard.
The third set started with one of Bain’s five aces of the night. The score was back and forth the entire game, seeing the lead change 10 times, along with five ties. Later in the set, Bain’s serving came in clutch once again, as she went on a 7-0 service run to bring the Crimson to match point. Although New Hampshire came back with two points to bring the score to 24-22, Harvard was able to come up with a kill to win the set.
But once again, the Wildcats were able to come back from a set loss to tie the game at two sets apiece. Staying true to the night’s theme of lead changes, the fourth set of the match had another 10. New Hampshire stayed on top for the latter part of the set and was able to close Harvard out and send the game to a decisive fifth set with a 4-1 run.
In an intense final stanza that included a tie at 12, the Wildcats claimed the match on a kill by Thatcher, sending the Crimson home with a heartbreaking 15-13 loss.
“We need to make little adjustments in order to be competitive in tough games,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “Tightening up and smoothing out the little things will make us a better team…one that can be competitive in the future.”

As any seasoned Law School student knows, the key to surviving the Socratic method and the mountains of reading assigned weekly is a study group in which you can bounce ideas off of some of your peers who were also brilliant enough to get into Harvard Law.
But when Senator Ted Cruz—a 1995 Harvard Law School graduate and Republican from Texas—was a student at HLS, his own study groups had an admissions standard almost as inflated as his own ego. According to one of his colleagues, the now-infamous senator refused to study with any student who did not attend college at Harvard, Princeton, or Yale. "He said he didn't want anybody from 'minor Ivies' like Penn or Brown," Damon Watson, one of Cruz's roommates at the time, recently told GQ.
Yet Cruz did make at least one exception to his HYP-exclusive club, and not even for a "minor Ivy" but a graduate of Northwestern.
Cruz made headlines at Harvard Law School earlier this year when he called out the faculty here for having a starkly communist streak.
Before wannabe-senators begin checking diplomas before allowing students into their study groups, let's not forget that the 15.6 percent of applicants admitted to the Harvard Law School Class of 2016 have a 3.88 average GPA and a 173 average on their LSATs, representing 171 undergraduate institutions. The takeaway? They are probably all smart and worthy study companions. And do you really want to be a senator that GQ calls a "wacko bird" anyways?

To all of you bookworms sweating in Lamont at 2:00 a.m., wouldn’t you rather find some real apples to burrow into? Autumn is the perfect season to fall into the habit of apple and pumpkin picking, and this weekend is the kick-off! If you are a freshman, RSVP to the Freshman Dean’s Office’s invitation to go apple picking at Carver Hill Orchards this Sunday, September 29 from 12:30 – 4:30pm. If you are a year or two riper than a freshman, check out an orchard or two on your own! Here are some suggestions, updated from our last guide.
Wilson Farms in Lexington, MA, serves fifty-cent apple cider donuts as well as their famous caramel apples for $2.50 each, every weekend through the end of October. Taking the Red Line until Alewife Station then hopping on Bus 76 will drop you here in 28 minutes, not too far from the tree!
 
If you are willing to stem off a bit further from campus, Doe Orchards is a 43-minute drive on Route 2 from Harvard Square. Doe boasts twelve apple species, and an accompanying picturesque red farm stand sells local cider, syrup, and honey. As the season gets crisper, their supply rounds out with the addition of pumpkins and gourds.
 
Roll over to a pumpkin patch at Brooksby Farm, a 33-minute drive north of campus. Wagon rides, apples, and pumpkins are just a few of the crunchy commodities that this Peabody, MA farm has to offer.
 
Finally, every weekend in October, Chris’ Farm Stand hosts a Pumpkin Festival at Silsby Farm in Bradford, MA, ripe with a corn maze, hay rides, pony rides, and a massive selection of orange beauties for your pumpkin collection. If you can spare the time, it’s worth the fifty-minute drive. This could be a perfect Columbus Day weekend outing—by then, the leaves will have changed, and it'll be about time you got off campus!

After Ted Cruz, the Republican Senator from Texas, completed his more than 21-hour speech slamming the Obama administration's healthcare policies, an online petition was started urging Harvard to rescind the Senator's degree. Cruz, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1995, recently made headlines when news broke that he preferred to study only with graduates from Harvard, Princeton and Yale while he worked towards his J.D.
Yet according to the petition, Cruz's speech "has proven that he is not Harvard material." The petition, which is addressed to University President Drew G. Faust, accuses Cruz of embarrassing Harvard, leaving the school no choice but to rescind his diploma and "make a statement that his Harvard education had no effect on him."
For all those Cruz-haters out there, however, do not get your hopes up. The petition has not yet garnered its stated goal of 100 signatures (in fact the number of signatures appears to be decreasing), and we suspect that many of the collected names are fake.

Have you ever wanted a no holds barred, 100 percent honest look at one year of attempted college admissions? Then this may be the series for you. I can’t promise many insider tips or quick-fix personal statements, but I can make you feel a little less alone. Are you along for the ride? Then join me once a week for the rest of the semester as I recount in excruciating and hopefully cathartic detail my College Campaign of 2010. Let us begin.
VITAL STATISTICS
Race/Ethnicity: White, Jewish (once upon a time, I thought this constituted diversity).Location: New England, cityGPA: 4.3SAT: 2190High School: Public, MagnetExtracurriculars: Track, Piano, Tutoring, Community Service (how original!)
In summary: The perfect candidate in every way.  Or so I thought. At my high school, we were constantly reassured that an indefatigable work ethic and a good package of grades, boards, and extracurriculars would guarantee our admission to a wonderful college. I was boundless. I had so much potential I didn’t know what to do with it. Any college would be lucky to have me! How would I ever choose when April 1 finally arrived?
I began to compile a list of schools to visit. First up: nearly every Ivy. Dartmouth and Cornell were nixed off the bat—I wanted to be in a more urban environment. But Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Penn, and Columbia made it on, along with top liberal arts college Amherst. Next were the mid-levels, schools where I had a better-than-not chance of acceptance. I picked Washington University in St. Louis, Wesleyan, New York University, and Tufts. Three safeties rounded off the bunch: Boston University, Brandeis, and George Washington University.
I put little thought into which colleges I’d visit. I essentially checked off a laundry list of the top colleges in nearby vicinity—only two were far enough away to necessitate a flight. My mom planned our visits while I stressed about AP tests, retook my SATs, and perfected my side-swept bangs.
Yet nascent beginnings of my greatest college application mistakes were beginning to show. I was so hopelessly self-assured that I never stopped to consider the obstacles I might face along the way to my “perfect college.” I naively believed that having the median SAT and GPA for a given college immediately made me a desirable candidate. I underestimated how highly colleges value “leaders,” and most of all, I overestimated myself. But more of that will come later.
It was April, 2009, and I was ready to visit some colleges.
The second installment of the College Campaign of 2010 is here. Read it now.
