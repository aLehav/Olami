After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Nature’s first green is gold,” writes Robert Frost in “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” admiring in tandem the beauty and the transience of changing autumn leaves, “her hardest hue to hold.”
Few poets wrote more eloquently about New England fall than Robert Frost. His most famous poem, “The Road Not Taken,” nestles the speaker’s introspection into a “yellow wood,” amid the pensiveness of the fall foliage. And not to mention his ode “October,” which sings the season’s praises: “O hushed October morning mild [...] Retard the sun with gentle mist; / Enchant the land with amethyst.”
Indeed, the “amethyst” and “gold” of a Harvard fall is an experience like no other. Frost’s ideas capture it seamlessly: the wind that stirs the branches of the yellow and red trees outside your window, the seeds and leaves that tumble onto your shoulders as you hustle across the Yard, the evenings when the sun stretches and shimmers across the Charles River. Fall settles into Harvard just as we settle into the rhythm of our classes, somewhere just before the first midterm week, when we’ve both revived our relationships with old friends and maybe broached nascent connections with new ones. It catches us at a moment when we’ve embraced the new year of classes and all it has to throw at us, but also when we can turn around and smile at our past selves too.
So autumn, as Frost’s poems all agree, is a time for reflection, a vantage point from which we consider the roads we’ve taken. And never has that been the case more than this year, when the vast majority of us will not be on campus in the coming months. Even those of us still in the Northern Hemisphere, like myself, recognize a dissonance between this coming season and our usual Harvard fall. Fall encompasses more than a set of seasonal changes; it’s the contented relief of returning to a place and to people we know and love, set against the cool breeze and changing leaves. And without those social cues, whether we’re in Boston or Beijing, Maryland or Melbourne, we feel disconnected from the course of our seasons and of our lives. How can we be expected to have a fall semester without, well, a fall?
It appears that this coming fall, then, is one of loss, of feeling cut off from the place that brings us so much fulfillment, of being cast far away. And, when you look at the science of the season, that actually makes us not too dissimilar from those yellow and red leaves dotting the Yard; just as we’re experiencing this sense of loss and exile, those leaves have also been stripped from their verdant past, the source of their vitality.
Leaves begin as nothing more than the energy-gathering appendages of a deciduous tree, through which the plant metabolizes the sun’s energy in photosynthesis. In high summer, leaves absorb the energy from sunlight to allow the tree to prosper and flourish green. That’s because during the first set of photosynthesis reactions, the energy from sunlight strikes the electrons in each plant cell’s chlorophyll molecules, causing them to leap between molecules and through the rest of the photosynthesis chain. But not all the sun’s light energy gets used in these reactions; only longer wavelength photons (light molecules) on the red end of the visible light spectrum and shorter wavelength photons on the blue end power photosynthesis. The photons that vibrate a little more frequently bounce off of the leaves instead, where our eyes perceive them to have the complementary color to red: green.
But around September or October, the days get shorter, the nights get longer. There simply isn’t enough sunlight to justify the tree’s expending energy to undergo photosynthesis. As a result, the tree forms a thick, cork-like barrier between the branch and the leaves, which both protects the branch’s vulnerable future state and cuts the leaf off from receiving nutrients from the heart of the tree. Effectively choked, the leaves cannot renew the chlorophyll they need to maintain photosynthesis, and other, weaker pigment molecules reveal themselves. Carotenoids reflect the yellow-orange hues, and anthocyanins the reddish-pink. Though these pigments, too, break down without sunlight, eventually leaving only the glum brown tannins in the cell membranes to tint the leaves as they fall from the branches above.
Thus fall, in all respects, is a season of loss and mourning for our arboreal friends. One that I’m sure we all sympathize with from our little corners of the world, as this so-called fall semester commences. But the question I ask myself is why, if fall brings so much loss to the plant life, do we find so much continual wonder and enlightenment in its beauty? Frost’s autumnal poems use the wide world around us to draw lessons for each of our own little worlds; they teach us the value that reflection plays in our perpetually-moving lives. At Harvard, fall doesn’t make us hopelessly sad, it allows us the opportunity to view the past and the future in close contrast — to feel that strange mixture of appreciation and disappointment, hope and regret through which we find gratitude for the life and community we have.
So maybe, though we find ourselves scattered among the grasses and a deep sense of loss, we can try to afford our coming semesters the same bittersweet regard we do the fall foliage. What we have lost, whether it be summer skies or the vibrancy of a dining-hall dinner, reminds us painfully of what we love. There is no better time to pause, give a gentle sigh, and be thankful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was raised not to wear words on clothing. I don’t remember my parents specifically caring or my public school having a policy against them. Perhaps it was the result of modern fashion trends? I wasn’t sure — but, for my entire adult life, I’ve met this unspoken rule without questioning it.
Lately, however, I’ve found myself intentionally breaking this rule — and tangling with the ensuing cognitive dissonance.
As I left the suburbs of Westchester for college and the working world, it quickly became obvious why “polite society” has internalized the norm. Branding yourself can be alienating and limiting.
Companies have long understood this. The president of the United States, for example, recently called for his followers to boycott Goodyear upon reading a tweet claiming it had a policy allowing its 60,000 employees to wear “Black Lives Matter” apparel, but not “Blue Lives Matter” or MAGA gear. The information was false. Goodyear has a policy against any campaign attire in the workplace. Amid public pressure, though, other mega-corporations like Starbucks that have previously demonstrated a desire to prohibit divisive labels at work are starting to relax their rules.
Neither retailers nor ambitious people want to limit their customer base. Discussion of politics or religion is particularly frowned upon in white collar settings. Wearing the name of your alma mater across your chest pigeonholes you — elitist, fratty, poor, dumb, stoner. To some eyes, designer clothes with brand names on them read “foreigner,” “new money,” or “obnoxious,” while plain, textless purchases from the same stores are considered the height of class.
To wear a label has always felt gratuitously restricting, as if to shout to the whole world, “I am one thing and not the other.” Nevertheless, I have made a notable departure from this convention in past weeks.
Every time I wear my Biden mask out, I am painfully aware of it. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, brands, including campaigns, have turned face masks into their latest billboards. I got the mask as a gift last month. It’s not bright red, but still, people stare. Paying at the checkout counter, walking past others in the street — I feel physically uncomfortable. The mask is on my face, but I’m shoving my perspective in your face. We’re all trained not to “judge a book by its cover,” yet in expressing my opinion so blatantly before we’ve even interacted, if we ever do, I’m forcing you to judge. Given the reports of confrontations by Trump supporters and the president’s sharing of a video that says “the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat,” I admit I’m also nervous about where I wear my Biden mask.
The Biden mask has become a counter-symbol to the MAGA hat. Its impact, however, is both similar and disparate. In his book on mass movements, “True Believer,” social philosopher Eric Hoffer explains that those vulnerable to populist fervor “crave to be rid of an unwanted self.” Supporters discard their personal identity for that of the mass identity. This is a key function the MAGA hat has served since its adoption by Trump supporters, many of whom are rightwing populists. The primary function of my Biden mask, however, is to help me do my part to limit the spread of COVID-19, a deadly virus that has already killed nearly 200,000 Americans.
Yet, in a pandemic of loneliness as the safeguards of our democracy fail, my Biden mask, like the MAGA hat, reveals that I too am in a cult.
“I like your mask,” one lady remarked in an otherwise pin-drop silent checkout line at Bed Bath & Beyond. “We’re definitely letting you in with that mask,” the manager of the local Cambridge spa I frequent told me. Later, the esthetician and receptionist each made a point of telling me they “love the mask.” I’m a private person in my day-to-day interactions and it’s initially jarring to have people react so directly and immediately upon a first interaction. Once I realize this reaction is enthusiastic and blind acceptance from my fellow cult members, however, I feel strangely safer than normal. In a gaslit nation, our cult of decency listens to scientists, supports democratic norms, and knows none of the past four years have been normal. Wearing labels may be limiting, but in this moment — I suddenly want to draw those boundaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Extension School unveiled a slew of new programs in June, including a new Academic Gap Year and undergraduate certificates, which were designed for its ever-increasing remote-learning student base, according to the school’s website.
The two programs join Harvard Extension School’s wide variety of programming which, even before the coronavirus pandemic forced many Harvard students to learn remotely, included hundreds of online courses each semester.
The Extension School designed the Academic Gap Year program for students of a typical undergraduate age to explore academic interests through Extension School courses. Candidates for Extension School degree programs must have graduated from high school at least five years prior to matriculation into the Academic Gap Year program.
Extension School spokesperson Harry J. Pierre said the Extension School developed the program after it “recognized the need to kind of help a whole different set of learners during the pandemic.” Nearly 500 students have enrolled in the Academic Gap Year program, which also offers career mentorship and personal development opportunities, Pierre said.
“We saw it as an educational opportunity for the traditional four-year college students who were disrupted by the global pandemic, but we still wanted to maintain a high academic term-time commitment on a part-time basis,” Pierre said. “We essentially saw this academic gap year as an extension of DCE’s tradition of accessible, affordable quality education.”
As part of the program, students spend a semester “engaged in challenging online courses with Harvard faculty and industry experts,” per the Extension School’s website. The program’s website features personal development seminar topics such as “Getting Your Groove on as a Student” and “The Not-So-Secret Secrets to Successful Online Learning.”
Students have the option of enrolling in courses for credit or opting out of college credit at a reduced cost. Students who participate in the Academic Gap Year program are not eligible, however, to transfer their earned credits to Harvard College.
Also new this year is the undergraduate certificates program, which allows nontraditional students to obtain certification in coding, web development, communications, or social justice by completing just three course credits. Pierre said the Extension School chose the four initial fields for their relevance and high demand.
“The social justice certificate, right now, is a way to empower students to really look at and actively engage in the important social movements of our time,” Pierre said. “Information technology has big interest and huge demand at Extension. So we’re always looking at ways to meet that demand for people who are asking for more and more courses in those fields.”
Pierre added that it is too early to predict what the level of interest in the certificate program will be, noting that 1,500 students are enrolled in graduate certificate programs, which cover 40 different fields of graduate study.
Regardless of which program a student is enrolled in, Pierre said, the Extension School is committed to creating camaraderie among students.
“We’re always looking to foster a sense of community amongst all of our learners, so whether they're abroad or on campus, we have a multitude of various different offerings and programs and services that we have for our students so that they can feel the sense of community,” he said.

One week after classes resumed for the fall term, Harvard Law School students report a positive online learning experience and an improvement over the virtual spring semester.
The Law School announced June 3 that it would hold its fall term online due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The decision received immediate backlash from hundreds of students who petitioned Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 and University President Lawrence S. Bacow for a hybrid semester plan, which would offer both online and in-person classes simultaneously. The petition argued remote learning would result in a lower quality legal education.
But now, having started the semester, students share a different perspective.
“In some respects, I actually prefer online classes, since it relieves me of the burden of commuting to school and allows me to spend more time with my family,” third-year student Davis B. Campbell wrote in an email.
Campbell noted the online format makes social events more difficult but has not significantly degraded his educational experience.
“Professors have done a good job adapting to Zoom, and the quality of class discussion is just as high as when we were in person,” he wrote.
First-year student Daisy Almonte also commended the efforts of Law School professors in utilizing online resources. She wrote in an email that she enjoys when professors use the polling function on Zoom to measure class opinions on court rulings.
“Overall, I think it’s clear that the professors have put in work to make sure that we are obtaining a rewarding learning experience despite it being online,” she wrote. “I am definitely engaged in the material we are covering in all of my courses.”
Almonte also noted, however, that the increased screen time pushed her to be more mindful of her screen settings and to begin weaning glasses as a precaution.
“Zoom fatigue is real, and it’s been taking a toll on my eyes,” she wrote.
Christopher Hall — a second-year student who authored the June petition against a fully remote semester — questioned why Harvard Business School was able to adopt a hybrid semester plan while the Law School was not. But he, too, acknowledged the faculty’s work in planning for the unorthodox fall semester.
“I am impressed by how the professors and staff have worked to create a learning experience that is as good as virtual school can be,” he wrote in an email.
Second-year student Madelyn Chen echoed Campbell’s concerns about networking over video calls.
“It's strange seeing classmates reduced to a screen and having classes with people I'll probably never meet in person or get to befriend,” she wrote in an email.
Chen also shared that her professors have attempted to improve the situation by staying after class to answer questions and planning small virtual group lunches. The Law School also adopted a new policy that requires students to keep their cameras on during class, which Chen claimed has resulted in more engaging discussions than in the spring semester. Technological issues have also decreased this semester, according to Chen, which she attributes to the increased involvement of teaching fellows.
“In my experience, more students are voluntarily participating and asking questions in my fall classes, now that we've adapted to the initial shock of online learning,” she wrote. “Hopefully classes continue to run well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School researchers have shown that a new X-ray imaging technique could help construct a comprehensive map of the circuitry of the brain.
The labs of Wei-Chung Allen Lee, assistant professor of neurology at HMS, and Alexandra Pacureanu, a co-author from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, conducted the research, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Neuroscience.
Scientists currently use light microscopes and electron microscopes to visualize the circuitry of the brain. But these techniques have limitations, according to Jasper S. Phelps, a first author on the paper and graduate student in the Lee lab.
Visible light microscopy cannot clearly identify individual neurons, while electron microscopy has higher resolution but can only see a few neurons at a time. The HMS researchers’ new technique — called X-ray holographic nano-tomography, or XNH — can do both.
“XNH hits the sweet spot where it can image large enough pieces of brain to capture whole circuits of neurons, but while still seeing all neurons, and with enough resolution to trace most of their branches,” Phelps wrote in an email.
In the XNH technique, researchers shine X-rays through a rotating piece of neural tissue and observe phase changes as the X-ray waves pass through the sample.
Lee emphasized the difficulty of understanding the “incredible computational machine” that is the human brain, given the sheer number of neurons and synapses it contains.
“The human brain has about 86 billion neurons, and each of those neurons has 1000 connections, and so that's a network with like 100 trillion connections,” Lee said. “So trying to understand such a complex network is difficult if you don't have a decent roadmap, or in our case what we'd want is something called a wiring diagram, of how these neurons are connected together into these complex networks.”
Echoing Lee, Phelps wrote that the dense mass of neurons in the brain “looks like a ball of spaghetti that extends for miles and miles.”
Using the XNH technique, the researchers generated high-resolution, cross-sectional images of neural tissue from fruit flies and mice. They then used artificial intelligence algorithms to trace individual neurons from these images.
Despite the success of this approach, Aaron T. Kuan ’09 — a first author on the paper and postdoctoral fellow — acknowledged that XNH has some drawbacks. For instance, the technique cannot be applied to live tissue.
Also, while the researchers could identify individual neurons, they were unable to achieve high enough resolution to visualize the synapses between neurons in postmortem tissue. Kuan, however, believes that “further advancements in the technology” could solve this problem.
“What's really exciting to me is how applications in neuroscience can help drive further advances in X-ray imaging,” Kuan added. “I think this synergy can get us to a point where we can realistically generate synapse-level circuit maps of the whole brain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks ago, leaders of the alumni group Harvard Forward were “thrilled.” After months of petitioning and campaigning, they had elected three candidates to Harvard’s Board of Overseers, its second-highest governing body.
This week dimmed their moods.
On Tuesday, William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — the highest governing body, and R. Martin Chávez ’85, the president of the Board of Overseers, announced that no more than six candidates who have been nominated by petition may be elected to the Board of Overseers at any given time.
Harvard Forward co-founders Danielle O. Strasburger ’18 and Nathán Goldberg Crenier ’18 wrote in an email that they were “alarmed” by the change, which will limit their ability to elect more than three petition candidates to the Board in the next five years.
The Corporation and Overseers approved the changes as an outgrowth of a report by the Board of Overseers’s Election Working Group. Though the report was completed on July 31, Strasburger and Crenier alleged that the change in policy was “in response” to their victory.
“It is appalling that Harvard would respond to an electoral outcome it dislikes by subverting the democratic process itself,” they wrote.
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy emphasized that the change was not in response to the outcome of the election, the results of which Harvard announced on August 21.
In their email, Strasburger and Crenier also accused Harvard of making University governance less democratic.
“By limiting the number of petition candidates allowed on the Board, the Board has decided to actively undermine the democratic nature of its elections,” they wrote. “Instead of using this year’s historic election as an opportunity to take positive action, Harvard’s leadership has instead doubled down on shielding those in power from accountability to the community they are supposed to serve.”
Even with the change, Hennessy wrote that Harvard’s process remains more democratic than any of its peer institutions.
All 30 members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers are elected by alumni, though members of the Harvard Corporation are not. By contrast, just six of 16 trustees of the Yale Corporation — their sole governing body — are elected by alumni.
The Overseers’ committee report cited Harvard’s direct election system as a reason that the majority of candidates should be vetted by the nominating committee. Strasburger and Crenier called that argument “paternalistic.”
“Alumni are fully capable of thoughtfully electing the leaders Harvard needs: when petition candidates ran in ​2009​ and 2016​ on platforms antithetical to Harvard’s values, not a single one was elected,” they wrote. “Paternalistic limitations on petition candidates are unnecessary, and Harvard should have more faith in its alumni community.”
While Harvard Forward is the only petition campaign to successfully elect candidates to the Board of Overseers, it was not the first such effort in recent years.
In 2009, Robert L. Friedman ’62 and Harvey A. Silverglate ’67 ran a campaign based on reforming the College’s disciplinary system and advocating for free speech on campus. In 2016, a slate of candidates known as “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ran on the platform of eliminating tuition and affirmative action.
Despite the limits on petition candidates, Strasburger and Crenier said they were not entirely unhappy with the special committee’s recommendations. The University also committed to including more recent alumni in University governance, a central plank of Harvard Forward’s platform which they hailed as a “very significant victory.”
“As a group, recent graduates are more diverse across virtually every metric than previous generations of Harvard alumni, and they will bring fresh, necessary perspectives into deliberations that will impact the University for decades to come,” Strasburger and Crenier wrote.“But recent alumni involvement is just one element of creating a Harvard that is more just.”
“This past election has already proven that alumni believe Harvard must do more to be a leader on climate action, inclusive governance, and racial justice,” they added. “Changing the election rules does not change that fact, and we look forward to nominating and electing petition candidates again in 2021.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly half of the 40 department chairs in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences received tenure within Harvard and nearly three-quarters have been teaching at the University for more than 15 years, an analysis by The Crimson found.
Department chairs are responsible for developing undergraduate and graduate curricula, overseeing faculty recruiting and promotion, managing departmental budgets, and resolving disputes, according to an FAS handbook distributed to chairs.
FAS department chairs typically serve three-year terms. Near the end of a chair’s appointment, the dean of their FAS division requests recommendations for the next chair from all departmental faculty before extending an offer to a senior faculty member.
Each department has different norms for the number of terms department chairs typically serve, according to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology chair Elena M. Kramer.
“In our department, chairs usually serve two terms, and occasionally three,” Kramer said. “In other departments, the culture is different. They only ever do one.”
Department chairs tend to be well established in their careers and many have spent much of their academic lives in Cambridge, according to The Crimson’s analysis.
The Crimson used publicly available biographical data and inquiries with chairs to compile the data. The majority of chairs verified their information in response to inquiries; not all chairs responded to requests for data or had information available online.
The average department chair received tenure over 19 years ago and has served as a faculty member at Harvard for 18 years, The Crimson found. Nineteen were tenured at Harvard, and another five were tenured at MIT. Six of the chairs earned their doctorates at Harvard, and five attended the College for their undergraduate degrees.
Human Evolutionary Biology chair Joseph Henrich — who arrived at Harvard only five years ago and became chair two years ago — said he recognized why experience at Harvard is a boon for chairs.
“It's really valuable if you’ve been around the University for a long time because Harvard is a byzantine organization,” he said. “Just knowing your way around the byzantine bureaucracy, then, oftentimes, having personal relationships with other people can really help you get things done.”
Faculty may also be compensated for the additional work they take while leading their departments. In the FAS’s Sciences Division, chairs receive a bonus, as well as a choice between a reduced teaching load or a research stipend, Kramer said.
But many faculty see the role as a service to the University and their department rather than a prestigious position or stepping stone for advancement, several department chairs said. They noted that the position entails a significant load of administrative work which siphons time away from faculty members’ research pursuits.
“It’s a lot of work, so often when people are appointed chairs, you’re torn between, should I congratulate you or offer condolences?” said Music chair Ingrid T. Monson, who led her department from 2005 to 2008 and stepped into the chair role again in 2019.
“Sometimes it’s the case that departments don’t have many people who are willing to be chair, and partly people would rather do their research,” Monson added. “I get it, and I’ll be looking forward to having more time for my research when this is over too, but part of agreeing to be a chair is being a good academic citizen.”
Henrich said some departments struggle to find interested professors to fill the positions, given the degree to which Harvard faculty tend to value their research.
“Just to become a Harvard professor, you’ve got to spend this large amount of time and intensity and love for your research,” Henrich said. “For many people that often goes on well past tenure and then there’s always this push-pull between allocating away from that research focus.”
Some faculty’s preference for research over administration may be reflected in the relatively small degree of crossover between the ranks of FAS’s department chairs and Harvard’s University Professors — the University’s highest faculty honor, which is primarily granted to recognize outstanding cross-disciplinary research. Only one University Professor, historian Ann M. Blair, currently serves as a department chair; she started in the role in July.
Philosophy chair Edward J. “Ned” Hall agreed that professors tend to self-select into or out of the department chair role depending on their focus on research, adding that their degree of comfort with conflict resolution and problem-solving also factors into the decision.
“It does come at a cost. I can’t get as much research done,” Hall said. “You have to deal with situations involving conflict. At some point, that’s inevitable.”
Hall added that, while he does have less time for his research, he is glad to have the opportunity to serve his department.
“I won’t be sorry to stop being chair, but I’m happy I’m doing it,” he said. “When I say it’s a lot of work, that sounds negative. It’s a lot of meaningful work.”
“You can sense that you’re able to make a difference in people’s lives, at least a little bit,” he added.

While Harvard is fully online this year, establishing rapport with professors is still an essential aspect of the college academic experience. But what do you do when you cannot pop in spontaneously to in-person during office hours anymore? Don’t worry, Flyby has you covered with some insightful tips on how to create meaningful connections with your instructors through a computer screen.
Office Hours: Virtual, But Still Functional
Sure, maybe you can’t wow them with your in-person aura anymore, but that doesn’t mean you should skip their online office hours. Try to show up every week, and don’t be afraid to talk about topics beyond the classroom. Even better, you don’t have to trudge for 15 minutes through the Cambridge streets to show up!
Classroom Participation
It’s never easy to speak up in front of the whole class, but the students who do will stick in the professor’s mind, especially if they do it consistently. Thanks to the Zoom format, you will feel a lot less pressure while voicing an insightful comment or a thought-provoking question during the class session.
Unique Backgrounds
While your thoughts and conversations will be the most enticing for your professor, there’s no reason not to bring in some visual prowess and spice up your Zoom background. A bright student with a unique sense of style? Double points.
Send Memes in Your Emails
This depends on your instructor’s sense of humor, but if you sense a meme spirit in them, go for it. Think about how many boring, “I hope this email finds you well” emails professors get from their students every day. Drop a customized meme that relates to a course quirk or trend, and you will definitely receive some appreciation along the way.
So, don’t despair! Whether you’re trying to secure that solid recommendation letter or make a new friend, don’t be afraid to use the full range and potential of an online education to build a strong relationship with your professors.
Sections
After months in quarantine, we’ve grown a little tired of seeing our friends through Netflix Party, Skribbl.io, and Houseparty. Looking for a new way to communicate with your friends that doesn’t involve a screen? Read on to discover the art of the letter.
Who do you send it to?
Maybe you’ve been writing secret love letters that you hide in your closet, or you haven’t written a letter since elementary school. The great thing about letters is that they never go out of style, and can be sent to everyone. Send a future note to yourself, write a fun letter to your friends, or let your family know you care about them. If you’re adventurous and want to make a new friend, you can find a pen pal here!
How do you mail it?
Like us, mail comes in all shapes and sizes. Buy a local postcard for a little personal flair, or browse the Target aisle for the funniest card and stick a stamp on it, which can be found at your local mail center. If you’re feeling extra nice, you can even get a box and fill it with your favorite snacks to show your letter recipient that you love them. You can also buy a gift from Etsy and add a personalized note.
What do you write in it?
A blank piece of paper is a lot more daunting than a blue text bubble on a phone screen. But this empty canvas also holds so much opportunity to let your mind run free. If you mess up, you can just start over with a new sheet of paper instead of agonizing over that text you accidentally sent to the wrong person. If you’re writing to your family, they really just want to know you’re okay, so let them know every detail of your day, from what you ate for breakfast to your horrible Zoom class, and make sure to note how much you miss them for extra brownie points. If you’re writing to a pen pal, add some questions at the end to spice up the conversation and learn more about the receiver.
What else could you put in the package?
Don’t feel like writing? Send small gifts instead. For a friend group, you could thrift a cute jean jacket and send it across the country from friend to friend, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants style. At each stop, someone can add a patch or pin to it, and by the end of the year you’ll have an adorable memory. If denim isn’t your style, share some photos for wall decor, or send non-perishable snacks to your quarantine cutie.
As classes start and the stress follows, sending and receiving letters are the perfect way to add a little slice of joy and excitement to your day. Reconnect with old friends, spice up your Zoom call with a surprise package, or meet a new friend from around the world.
