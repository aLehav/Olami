After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Muhajiriya, Sudan, the site of massacres in 2007, is in flames once again. In this South Darfur town, more than 30,000 people have been uprooted from their homes. New York Times columnist Nick Kristof has cited reports that the Sudanese government has resumed the lethal trifecta of aerial bombardment, Janjaweed militia attacks, and ground invasion that prompted the American government to deem the Darfur conflict a genocide in 2004. Yet, at this moment, a confluence of several independent events may produce a resolution that was not possible before.
Last week, the Times reported the impending indictment of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir by a pre-trial panel at the International Criminal Court. Having received Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo’s application for an arrest warrant in July 2008, the panel will likely issue the warrant within the next two weeks. At the same time, the Kenyan government is deliberating over whether to try suspected perpetrators of last year’s post-election violence or to ask the ICC to open an investigation. Likewise, the Palestinian Authority has asked the ICC to open an investigation into the situation in Gaza, forcing the court to evaluate the Palestinian claim to statehood. 
For people concerned with justice for the worst crimes, it is time to capitalize on this unusual moment of convergence. Even those for whom justice is secondary have reason to pay attention. Nothing less than the authority of the United Nations Security Council is at stake. At this extraordinary moment, the ICC’s promise of international justice has captured the imagination of national actors with divergent agendas, interests, and loyalties.
A flashpoint in global politics since its creation in 2002, the ICC initially exposed the internal contradictions of American foreign policy. When the ICC’s founding treaty, the Rome Statute, entered into force in 2002, Congress responded by passing the American Service Members Protection Act, also known as the “Invasion of the Hague Act,” which authorized the president to invade the ICC’s headquarters in the Netherlands to release any hypothetical U.S. or allied military personnel detained by the ICC.
A cursory examination of the Rome Statute reveals the ludicrous nature of this legislation. The treaty in question belied the fears of the act’s supporters; by operating on the principle of complementarity, the ICC will only investigate cases in which the state with jurisdiction over it is unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute. Yet on March 31, 2005, when the United Nations Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in Resolution 1593, the U.S. was left in the embarrassing position of having to abstain from a resolution calling for an investigation into a situation it had deemed a genocide. Since then, the U.S. government has pledged to support the ICC proceedings on Darfur.
Just as the U.S. learned, other states, too, must realize that they cannot selectively apply the law. For example, the African Union, the Group of 77, and the Arab League all oppose the impending indictment of Sudan’s president. But a country like Libya, whose president heads the African Union, cannot object to the impending ICC indictment without diminishing the already difficult case of the Palestinian Authority, one to which it is more sympathetic. And Russia, which voted for Security Council Resolution 1593, cannot now ignore the arrest warrant simply because it disputes the results of the investigation it authorized. Once the ICC’s pre-trial chamber issues the indictment, the onus falls on the Security Council to act. The Court cannot enforce its own arrest warrants. The council, however, can either choose to defer the prosecution for a year under Article 16 of the Rome Statute, or it can act to enforce it.
If the council’s members fail to act once the arrest warrant has been issued, then they will set a precedent that diminishes not only the deterrent potential of justice but also their own authority. If the Security Council allows a sitting head of state to remain in power after the ICC has indicted him for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and perhaps even genocide, then it will have ceded a bit of its own power.
The ambassadors of the 15 nations on the Security Council—most importantly, the Permanent Five—may not realize this danger. To that end, concerned citizens would do well to inundate their offices with phone calls and petitions as soon as the indictment is announced.Admittedly, even prominent American academics and human-rights activists are divided over the implications of the indictment. Alex de Waal, a senior fellow at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, has argued that an indictment could derail peace negotiations and lead to reprisals against Darfur’s civilian population. But, given the failure of all previous peace negotiations and the already dire situation on the ground in Darfur, this may well be a risk worth taking.
This is new territory for the ICC, the international community, and, above all, the people of Sudan. At this exceptional moment, the interests of peace, justice, and power converge. It’s time to start calling those ambassadors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days after President Barack Obama announced the details of his stimulus package, Obamaphiles everywhere praised him not only for what they saw as urgently needed legislation, but also for what they perceived, at the time, as a bold foray onto a new political path. Through overtures to Republicans in Congress and perceived concessions in the stimulus package, Obama had given the opposition an offer they couldn’t refuse. Hope had indeed won a mandate. It was only a matter of time before everyone in Washington started seeing the world in a purple hue. 
Or so the thinking went. But, by the time the bill cleared the Senate with the minimum 60 votes last Friday night, at least some members of the Obama camp were wondering where all the bipartisanship had gone. Not a single House Republican had voted for the bill. It barely cleared the Senate, where only two weeks before some in the administration thought it might garner 80 votes. 
But why should anyone be surprised that it happened this way? It’s not every day that circumstances allow you to co-opt your opposition. The New Deal and the Great Society were not bipartisan initiatives. Look at it from the Republicans’ point of view. What do they gain from bipartisanship? If Obama successfully builds bipartisan support for his agenda, who gets the credit? John Boehner and Mitch McConnell? 
The nature and timing of the stimulus package also made it a peculiarly inopportune occasion for the inauguration of a post-partisan era. Politicians are bipartisan either because they don’t think anyone (in particular Rush Limbaugh) is noticing or because there is overwhelming public support for something. Seduced by the fervor of the inauguration and the unprecedented nature of the economic crisis, many of us assumed there would be overwhelming public support for the stimulus package, as indeed there was before the Republicans got in their licks. But we should have learned from the pre-election bailout package that the mere fact that the public is in a panic about economic conditions doesn’t mean that Republicans will easily sign on to remedies that cost unfathomable amounts of money. The October bailout package, indisputably and critically necessary, was opposed by a solid majority of Americans and by a majority of Republican congressmen even though it was being proposed by a Republican president. As a Republican senator vividly observed, if you gave someone a million dollars every day since the birth of Christ, you wouldn’t reach a trillion dollars until sometime after the year 2700. A stimulus package priced somewhere between $800 billion and $1 trillion was not an easy thing to grasp. By its nature, it was the biggest target that any simple-minded or cynical politician ever had to shoot at in the entire annals of American domestic spending.
And then there was the timing. It was being proposed at a time when a humiliated GOP base was being asked to sit and watch a “transformative” Democratic president walk on water. How many details of a $900 billion spending bill would it take to provoke a furious negative response from the Republican base? 
Lastly, the upside for being a naysayer was just too sweet. At any point in time, what will be the measure of success for the stimulus package? The Republicans knew that this legislation was going to pass with or without their support and that, in so far as anyone would receive credit for its perceived success, it would be Democrats. As the party out of power, the Republicans are relegated to arguing that, whatever our economic circumstances will be in the future, the glass is half-empty. Why not drum it into everyone’s head from the get-go that the reason the glass is half-empty is that the Democrats only want to spend money on things like the National Endowment for the Arts and upgrades to the National Mall? 
Is this, then, an equivocal triumph for Obama? I don’t think so. In the final calculation, what passed on Friday night was a somewhat reduced version of what Obama first submitted to the House. The bill that Obama will sign reflects his own policy priorities, not any significant effort to placate Republicans. Things were cut, but nothing significant was added to get it past the Senate filibuster. You can argue with Obama’s priorities, but you can’t argue that his effort at bipartisanship reshaped the final product. 
In spite of its unfathomable cost, 51 percent of the American people still support the stimulus package. And the faux drama about bipartisanship played well for the president. A healthy 61 percent of Americans blame Republicans for the lack of bipartisanship, while a still greater majority, 66 percent, continues to believe that Obama is bringing “a new approach.”  With no serious concessions on principle, Obama is now being given credit for having walked the walk of his post-partisan talk, and his failure to achieve it thus far is being blamed on the other guys. He has no reason to abandon the approach he has taken. His effort to lay the groundwork for political pressure on Republicans to join bipartisan coalitions on issues like health care, energy policy, and entitlement reform has had a good beginning.  
Republicans drawing blood from Obama make a better story for the press, but there should be no question that Obama won the first round in his presidential confrontation with the Grand Old Party.

After a decade of tedious negotiations and delays, the former Khmer Rouge officer Kaing Guek Eav—known to the world as “Duch”—has finally been brought to trial.While in charge of a notorious Khmer Rouge prison camp in the late 1970s, Duch oversaw the systematic mass murder of approximately 15,000 inmates. Now he sits in a Phnom Penh courtroom, watching his own fate unfold.Some might say that the actions of an evil but long-gone Cambodian regime 30 years ago have little bearing on the world of today. But the Khmer Rouge’s brutal genocide, which eliminated about one-fourth of Cambodia’s population, deserves to be prosecuted accordingly. Even though Duch himself cannot possibly account for more than a small fraction of Khmer Rouge atrocities, it is important to recognize the regime’s crimes on an individual basis through international law. While the 10 years of disorganization between Duch’s discovery in 1999 and the beginning of his trial this past week leave much to be desired in terms of legal procedure, it is comforting that the tribunal prosecuting Duch in Phnom Penh has been organized with the support of the United Nations. Though it might be difficult to determine proper punishment for a man who killed and ordered the deaths of so many fellow citizens, we are glad to see that the death penalty will not be an option. Fortunately, in the system that will try Duch and other former Khmer Rouge officials, criminals will be brought to justice with the humanity and due process that their victims were denied.In this vein, it is essential that Duch be offered a fair trial. This week, there has been much debate as to whether to allow Norng Chan Phal, a rare survivor of Duch’s infamous S-21 camp, to be part of the prosecution, even though he missed the filing deadline by two days. While it may seem harsh, Phal should be excluded. The rules—trivial as they may seem— must be upheld above all else. The trial must be conducted with meticulous attention to legal procedure as a tribute to Duch’s prisoners, who were never given such an opportunity. There is no way to truly make amends for the cold, calculated murder of one-fourth of a nation’s people. But the trial of Kaing Guek Eav allows at least some measure of justice for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge.

It’s hard to say which is more famous, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s radical socialist policies, or his notoriously exaggerated personality. Chávez’s constant interruptions of the Spanish prime minister in late 2007 at a summit in Chile brought the king of Spain, a normally soft-spoken man, to shout, “Why don’t you shut up?” Yet Chávez will not be shutting up any time soon. On Monday, Venezuela passed a national referendum that removed term limits for public officials, allowing Chávez and his appointees to potentially remain in power for life.
While he could theoretically lose the next election, it is unlikely that a viable democratic opposition will emerge with enough support to topple Chávez, who still enjoys a fair amount of popular support despite pursuing economic policies that cause hyperinflation and widespread shortages. 
Eliminating term limits brings Venezuela further from democracy and closer to a one-party socialist dictatorship. In any country, incumbents enjoy a huge advantage in name recognition and free media coverage that puts legitimate challengers at a disadvantage. Term limits also help prevent a trend toward career politicians who can grow complacent or unresponsive to public need. 
Of course, term limits are not necessary for democracy to function. In the United States, it took until the 22nd Amendment in 1951 before there were term limits on the presidency, and congressmen and senators continue to face no term limits at all. Parliamentary governments like Britain potentially allow a prime minister to serve indefinitely. Often the best person for the job is one who already has the skills and experience, especially during a national crisis, as with the case of President Roosevelt during World War II. 
Similarly, the existence of term limits alone does not ensure free and fair elections. Few would dispute that Russia’s Vladimir Putin, despite leaving the office of the presidency because of term limits, does not still retain a great deal of control over his country. 
Yet the issue at stake is not term limits in a general sense, but the mechanism by which they were removed. It is theoretically possible to democratically eliminate term limits with a fair election; however, it would be naive to call Venezuela’s recent referendum on term limits a fair election. Though the domestic opposition has not challenged the election results, Chávez has gained such a firm grip on the media during his decade in office that he can readily warp the democratic process to suit his ambition. 
In this election, Chávez has used the entire government apparatus to promote the referendum. Pro-Chávez propaganda adorned government vehicles and public buildings, while state radio and television channels promoted the referendum night and day. Passengers on the subway in the capital had to listen to campaign jingles during their commute. 
The pre-referendum promotional blitz only compounded the advantages Chávez typically enjoys. The president hosts a talk show for about five hours each Sunday broadcast on state media, addressing current events and showcasing copious on-location footage of Chávez’s social-welfare programs in action. In 2006, Chávez refused to renew the broadcasting license for Venezuela’s second largest TV station, which had voiced opposition to Chávez’s policies and may have endorsed a coup against Chávez in April 2002. There are also reports of Chávez sending gangs to harass journalists critical of his administration and laws that require all media outlets to broadcast his speeches in full.
Add to that the fact that Chávez’s earlier attempt to end term limits, which was bundled with a group of other minor constitutional changes, failed in a national referendum in late 2007, and a picture emerges of a Venezuelan dictator using a hollow patina of democracy to legitimize his aspirations to hold power for life. Since his victory, Chávez has already revealed his wish to remain in power until 2049, when, at 95, he would be older than his inspiration, Fidel Castro, is today. We’ll see if Venezuela’s oil wealth can last until then. For the moment, it’s clear that this new referendum is a step backward for Venezuelan democracy.

Harvard College tuition will rise 3.5
percent for the 2009-2010 school year—a substantial real increase in light of
nearly zero inflation last year.
The increase to $33,696—announced
by Harvard yesterday—mirrors a 3.5 percent tuition hike for the previous
year, but that rise had little effect on the
real price of tuition because it coincided
with higher inflation.
The total tuition package including
room and board will reach $48,868 from this year’s $47,215. Financial aid assistance
is expected to increase 18 percent
from $125 million in total financial aid
output in 2008-2009 to a record $147
million in 2009-2010.
The projected expansion in financial
aid is a response to both a five percent increase in the number of financial
aid applicants in the class of 2013 and
the likely greater need of current Harvard
students affected by the economic downturn, said Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons
’67. This year, 78 percent of applicants
to the class of 2013 applied for financial
aid.
“It was only a few years ago that fewer
than 50 percent of students were on grant aid,” Fitzsimmons said, “This year
almost 60 percent of the current class
is on some form of grant aid… given
unprecedented economic challenges we
could have an even higher percent [of
the class of 2013] on financial aid.”
The expansion will increase the average
financial aid package from around
$38,500 to over $41,000.
The Financial Aid Office is anticipating
the same amount of funding from
the endowment next year as they did for
the 2008-2009 school year, said Fitzsimmons.
The increase will come from unrestricted
gifts to the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has
pledged to make up any shortfall resulting
from potentially reduced endowment
income, Fitzsimmons said.
“Harvard’s commitment to stand
firm on financial aid has been an enormous
help in attracting applicants this
year,” Fitzsimmons said. “Financial aid is
never more important than when times
are tough.”
Fitzsimmons said that he believes
President Faust and Dean Smith’s firm
commitment to financial aid will benefit
this year’s yield and attract strong applicant
pools in the years ahead, regardless
of the tuition increase.
Several other Ivy League schools recently
announced increases in tuition.
Cornell’s and Dartmouth’s tuition will
rise by 4.9 and 4.8 percent respectively.
Princeton’s will increase by 2.9 percent.
Yale has not yet approved a final decision
on tuition, but will likely increase it as
well, according to the Yale Daily News,
which reported that Yale will try to keep
admission affordable during this time of
economic trouble.

James L. Frazier, an assistant strength coach for University of Iowa football, will become the director of Harvard’s strength and conditioning program, Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise announced yesterday.
Frazier, a 2006 graduate of Brown University, will fill a month-long vacancy created by the departure of former head strength coach Craig Fitzgerald for the University of South Carolina. The former Brown defensive end and linebacker will begin overseeing all 41 Crimson varsity programs on March 2. 
Frazier’s hiring comes at an opportune time for the Crimson. Fitzgerald’s January departure was followed closely by assistant strength director Daniel Perlmutter’s decision to take a position at Duke, leaving assistant director Timothy Mullen, coaching assistant Shauna Forsyth, and two full-time interns with the daunting task of providing equal attention to every squad without an administrative head.
“I’m definitely looking forward to [working at Harvard],” Frazier said. “As somebody that graduated from an Ivy League school, I know what [the athletes] are going through mentally and physically...I’m coming into a blessed situation by joining a pretty experienced staff.”
Frazier has shown versatility to this point in his career, interning with the NBA’s Chicago Bulls prior to his two years with Iowa’s football staff. In a short stint training the Hawkeyes, the two-time All-Ivy selection left a notable impression.
“[Frazier] is very progressive and very intelligent,” fellow Iowa football strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle said. “I think he takes a comprehensive approach to training the athlete...[He] is a great get for Harvard.”
Frazier was a highly recruited high school athlete when he decided to attend Brown, said Bears’ defensive coordinator Michael Kelleher, who coached Frazier throughout much of his collegiate career.
Frazier was captain of the team and a four-year letterman, leading Brown to an Ivy League title in 2005. In college, he showed the makings of someone who would make his living from athletics, Kelleher said.
“I always thought he would be a great coach,” Kelleher said. “He loved all the behind-the-scenes aspects of football.”
Frazier—who earned his degree from Brown three years ago—refused to state his age in an interview with The Crimson.
“As far as the age and that kind of stuff, it is neither here nor there,” he said. “It’s about what you bring to the table—the knowledge and background you have.”
Kelleher supported his former player’s leadership ability, citing his maturity despite his youth.
The newly hired coach’s tender age will create an interesting dynamic in the weight room next year. Current Harvard football captain Carl D. Ehrlich ’09-’10 and a few other players were on Harvard’s team at the same time Frazier was playing for Brown, Ehrlich said.
But Ehrlich added that he thought his new coach’s age would be a boon.
“I think it will be good to have a young strength coach who is hungry to learn,” he said.
“We are pleased to welcome James to our community,” said Scalise in a Harvard Athletic Communications announcement. “Our strength and conditioning staff is known for its high energy and James is no exception.”
Although he is only a few years removed from competing on Saturdays, Frazier’s allegiances have changed now, he said.
“When it’s all said and done, I’m with Harvard,” Frazier said. “I’m for Harvard. I want to train them to beat Brown the best way I can.” 
His old coach Kelleher saw it the same way.
“He is the enemy now,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard Extension School student who obtained admission through an adopted identity was sentenced to four years in prison earlier this week in a federal court in Greenville, S.C.Esther R. Reed—who sporadically attended Harvard between 2002 and 2005, according to the New York Post—was charged with stealing at least six identities and using such disguises to forge her way into the Extension School, Columbia, and California State University, Fullerton. A federal judge in Greenville characterized her as a scheming manipulative criminal, according to the Associated Press.Reed’s scam was unveiled in 2006 when she applied for a job in Manhattan, using the persona of Brooke Henson, a South Carolina woman reported missing since 1999. She was indicted in September 2007 in Greenville S.C., on charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, and identity theft, Ed Donovon, a Secret Service spokesman, told the Crimson in an interview in 2008. The Secret Service—best known for defending key government figures—is also charged with investigating major cases of fraud.Donovon said that Reed was put on the Secret Service’s Most Wanted List—a group of eight fugitives—in December 2007.Reed had also attempted to adopt the identity of Bowman ’99, who later graduated from Columbia Medical School. Natalie M. Bowman ’99 could not be reached for comment yesterday. Ann Fitz, one of Reed’s attorneys, said she believes Reed’s actions were motivated by mental illness caused by her mother’s death in 1998. “She felt like there was no other choice but to try and hide herself and live her life through somebody else’s identity,” Fitz said.Fitz said she was particularly disappointed with the verdict because she said it dismissed mental illness as merely a “creative argument.” But Walt Wilkins, the prosecutor and U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina, said Reed’s scams were purely an effort to support herself after she had left home in 1999, and that Reed had continued to put herself in social situations despite the defense that she suffered from a “social anxiety disorder.”Wilkins added that identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation.Director of Undergraduate Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 said that while the admissions process can be defrauded, the careful scrutiny given to each applicant typically catches inconsistencies. McGrath acknowledged new technology can more efficiently flag such cases, but stressed a desire to rely primarily on readers’ judgment. “This is not a science,” she said. “This is a thorough careful, human process and we intend to keep it that way.”

Stanley K. Burrell, better known as MC Hammer, the rapper famous for his 1990 single “U Can’t Touch This,” has made a new career of touching his fans through interactive websites and social media. Yesterday, Burrell shared his knowledge on his new area of expertise before an audience at Harvard Business School, explaining how social media sites—such as micro-blogging service Twitter—can facilitate personal interaction in both business and music. “My biggest inspiration comes from God, my next inspiration comes from people, from engaging with people,” Burrell said. He added that social media, more than any other form of communication, excels in “shortening the distance between creator and consumer.”As a celebrity in the modern world where information is on-demand 24 hours a day,  Burrell said that social media like Twitter allows him to interact directly with the 90,000 fans that follow it.“I would rather control my persona than to put my life or my persona in the hands of others,” he said.The talk, which was recorded by ABC’s Good Morning America as part of a special series on the Twitter phenomenon, revealed an older, more business-minded Burrell than the rapper who was known for a meteoric rise and fall in the music world.Burrell gave the audience an overview of his current business initiatives, which include DanceJam.com, a web community dedicated to publicizing dance videos, and “BurrellTime” iPhone application that allows his fans to follow his life in real-time.“I’m building my social media ecosystem one peg at a time,” he said. As an entrepreneur with an entertainment background, Burrell said that advertising was instrumental in highlighting artistic talent. “At the end of the day, there are only so many notes, so many rhymes, so many keys on the keyboard,” he said. “The next thing is: who is the best marketer?” Despite his burgeoning career in business, Burrell said the he retains an appreciation for the personal and entertainment value of his musical roots. He said that although a single nowadays has little value from a monetary perspective, “there’s an experience value to music, and music as a commodity is extremely valuable.”Brooke J. Jenkins, a student at the Business school who called herself a long-time fan of MC Hammer, noted a contrast between the content of his talk and his public persona in the early 90’s, the height of his fame. “He’s definitely a different person, probably in a better place.” Jenkins said.

Although most knights exist only in fairy tales, Harvard Squares’ Raymond E. Ost, chef and co-owner of Sandrine’s Bistro, was knighted yesterday with the medal of the French Order of the Mérite Agricole.Boston’s Consul General of France, Francois Gauthier, presented Ost with the honor in Gauthier’s Cambridge home.The French government award recognized Ost’s culinary career, which spans nearly four decades. It also honored his promotion of French cuisine and his use of local ingredients in his dishes.Gauthier indicated that approximately three to five people in the US receive the distinction each year, and that he was the individual who had nominated Ost for the highly selective honor. Past recipients  of the award include culinary luminaries Julia Child, who introduced French cuisine to the American palate, and Jacques Pépin, a French chef and television personality currently working in the US.“France is probably the only [country] to recognize the great cause of food,” Gauthier said before pinning the medal on Ost’s suit jacket. His speech also referenced another of Ost’s culinary accomplishments: cooking for the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s 800 wedding guests.After Ost accepted the medal, Gauthier followed by proposing “a toast to Raymond, and a toast to French-American friendship.” “Great things are at stake when it comes to food,” said Gauthier in an interview after the ceremony. He lauded the chef for helping “pass on the value of French gastronomy and respect for food.”Ost, whose French cuisine bears an Alsatian twist, found out about the honor when a certificate arrived in the mail a few weeks ago, although the actual medal was not included in the package that he received. “[The certificate] was telling me that I received the reward, but you have to buy the medal...so the French Consul bought the medal,” Ost said.The Ordre du Mérite Agricole was originally established in 1883 by Jules Méline, then Minister of Agriculture, to recognize contributors to French agriculture. An estimated 340,000 people have been named “chevaliers”—or knights—since 1883. The order has three ranks: chevalier, officier, and commandeur. After Ost’s knighting, the 60 attendees, which included close friends and family as well as local officials, sampled the French truffles and pastries which Ost and his culinary team had prepared for dessert. Born in the Alsatian town of Strasbourg, Ost cooked in kitchens around the world before he finally decided to settle down and make his home in Boston. In 1996, Ost first opened Sandrine’s Bistro, named for his daughter, after a stint as the executive chef of Le Meridien Boston, a restaurant in the city. The newly minted knight said that he appreciated all the support he has received. “All my friends are here, and that means more to me than the medal,” Ost said.But diners at Sandrine’s Bistro won’t be glimpsing the medal on the restaurant’s walls anytime soon.Ost said the award will remain at home.“Nobody cares,” Ost said. He added, laughing, “Maybe somebody would steal it.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu

The $787 billion federal stimulus plan signed on Tuesday has given state and local officials dealing with the fallout from the current economic downturn cause for optimism. In an announcement yesterday morning to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 said that the stimulus package will give the state $6 to $9 billion over the next two years. Throughout the state, towns and cities have submitted thousands of shovel-ready projects—immediately actionable proposals—in the hopes of receiving funding from the stimulus package, and Cambridge was no different.According to City Councillor Craig A. Kelley, Cambridge has a large list of  projects that require funding—including street work, sewer reconstruction, and a renovation of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School.Cambridge budget director David J. Kale said that the financial stimulus will “take pressure off local revenues” since projects will be able to move forward without drawing from city dollars.Around Cambridge, various organizations that have suffered during the economic downturn expressed the hope that the stimulus plan would lessen their financial problems.  The Cambridge Housing Authority—which has been coping with underfunding from both state and federal sources—is now expecting a “significant increase in federal capital funds” that will allow it to tackle roughly $230 million in capital projects, said Executive Director Gregory P. Russ.Though no specific figures have been released, Russ estimated that the funding for the Housing Authority will be doubled this year to about $7 million, with the opportunity for even more money if the organization applies for competitive funds for green building projects. The Cambridge Health Alliance, a network of local health institutions, is also expected to benefit from the stimulus, said spokesman David Cecere, who added that his organization was still assessing the detail’s of the bill’s impact. In January, the Health Alliance announced a “major strategic and reconfiguration initiative” to cope with financial difficulties. The federal stimulus package will give Massachusetts anywhere from $1.7 to $3.1 billion in Medicaid funding, according to various reports.This comes as positive news to the Boston Medical Center, a “safety net” hospital that serves many Medicaid-eligible patients. Director of Communications Ellen Berlin said that she was “cautiously optimistic” about receiving more funding, and that she hoped that the BMC would be “paid more fairly” for the services it provides.On the state level, Massachusetts will benefit from funding for infrastructure improvements, including $300 million for mass transit; affordable housing projects; and education aid. In addition, the stimulus package will provide residents with tax cuts, low-income housing, medical care, and education funding.The plan also may create or save an estimated 79,000 jobs in the state, according to a report released earlier this week by the Obama administration.  –Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard students who hoped to hop across the pond this summer to work may find themselves staying closer to home due to unresolved visa negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom.The U.K. Border Agency recently unveiled a new youth mobility scheme that applies to individuals between the ages of 18 and 31 who would like to “experience life in the United Kingdom.”In order to apply for a visa, individuals must have a valid national passport from a country taking part in the youth mobility scheme. But because the U.S. has not yet signed the agreement, several internships sponsored by the Institute of Politics and the Center for European Studies are now only available to students with passports from the European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, or New Zealand.The visa troubles have already impacted students’ summer plans.Anna Raginskaya ’11 spent last summer as an intern at Sotheby’s Auction House in London. At the end of her internship, she was offered an unpaid position for the following summer, an opportunity she had to decline recently due to work permit complications. “It was a really painful situation,” Raginskaya said. “There is so much value to interacting with different people and different business practices.” According to U.S. State Department spokesman Robert A. McInturff, student work permits are processed through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. McInturff said that complications regarding the youth mobility program fall under the jurisdiction of the Bureau.Christopher W. Reid, the interim CES Student Programs Coordinator, said that he has been in constant contact with both the State Department and the Harvard Club of the United Kingdom. According to Reid, the lack of agreement has been frustrating for internship coordination.  “They’ve been saying that they are in negotiation for three months,” Reid said.In addition to problems with work permits, CES also eliminated a number of U.K. internships due to the economic downturn. Reid said that some employers were unable to sponsor summer interns this year.Though visa negotiations began before the financial crisis, Robin E. Mount, the Director of the Office of Career Services, said that talks may have been elongated by the dire financial situation. “It’s a very tough time and you’re seeing a lot of protectionism taking place between countries,” Mount said. The U.K. has historically been one of the most popular summer destinations for Harvard students, according to Mount. While Raginskaya ultimately secured an internship at Sotheby’s New York office, other students have been unable to find such ready alternatives.Steven C. Rizoli ’11 had made preliminary arrangements for a summer job in England and now planned to apply for a grant through the Weissman International Internship Program.         “I’m a serious Anglophile,” Rizoli said. “I’m really considering working or living in England for a time after graduation.” —Staff writer Courtney P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 1,600 eligible staff workers received a crimson folder containing details about their early retirement packages on Tuesday, posing a challenge for recipients weighing the offer’s benefits against the possibility of being laid off after choosing to stay.
A longtime staff worker said she will likely accept the “generous” benefits of the package, including a year’s salary and improved insurance plans. She and two other staffers quoted by The Crimson in this article all asked that they not be named in order to protect their relationship with University officials.  
Despite the new incentives, the package’s arrival has alarmed staffers faced with the possibility of leaving Harvard, voluntarily or not.
“Everybody knows. It’s general knowledge,” one administrator who recieved the package said of the possible staff cuts. “I can’t imagine there won’t be layoffs, so those of us who feel vulnerable have to make a decision.”
In addition to detailed descriptions of the program and a list of support resources, every package includes an individualized statement detailing the recipient’s potential benefits—a figure determined by the employee’s age, salary, and length of service.
University staffers who retire under the incentive program will receive one-time pension benefits equal to their annual salaries, reduced by any severance packages they had been entitled to receive. Individuals may receive the benefits as a single lump sum payment or as an annuity.
Those under the age of 62 will also receive a special “bridge benefit” of $750 a month until they become eligible for Social Security.
Though retirees are eligible for “enhanced” medical, dental, and life insurance coverage, the package repeatedly notes, in italics, that employees are not guaranteed such coverage because the University can “change or end its retiree benefits in the future.”
In a time of economic uncertainty, it remains unclear whether eligible staff workers will opt to leave their jobs. Choosing retirement would have a certain finality: those who leave under the plan will not be eligible for re-employment with the University for at least one year from the date of retirement, according to the package.
One FAS staffer working in an academic department said that the current package is not generous enough to appeal to staffers below the cusp of retirement. Of the 516 FAS staffers who are eligible for the program, only 87 are 65 years of age or older, according to the package.
Eligible employees—those at least 55 years of age who have worked at the University for a minimum of 10 years as of June 30 of this year—will have 45 days to accept or decline the package, which repeatedly advises recipients to consult with an attorney prior to signing the form indicating their choice.
A staffer who accepts the plan and signs the form within the 45-day “election” period—slated to end April 6—would have seven days to revoke the decision.
The countdown has already begun, and, according to one administrator, the plan’s progress has been moving at an alarming rate since the University’s announcement of the plan last Tuesday.
“June 30 is really not that far away,” the individual said. “Lives are going to change radically.”
In meetings with department administrators last week, FAS finance officials said the University will reassess budgets after the end of the 45-day period and begin discussions about layoffs with the Office of the General Counsel and human resources officials.
“We’re in a weird position because there’s always the threat of layoffs hanging over our heads,” said the administrator citing heightened levels of anxiety among staff. “It’s causing a lot of stress and angst among the people I know.”
University President Drew G. Faust said in a letter to the community yesterday that the financial crisis will “entail hard choices about what matters most—not an easy exercise for a university like ours.”
But the president’s tone rubbed some staffers the wrong way.
“She pissed off a lot of people here with her attitude, ‘Oh, we’re all in it together, we’ll get through this,’” said one staffer.

Maybe 35 is the lucky number in hockey this year.Bruins goalie, #35 Manny Fernandez, has won 14 of his last 19 starts and six out of his last nine games. New Jersey Devils goalie, #35 Scott Clemmensen, is on his own streak, posting 31 saves in a win against the Bruins last week and 27 saves against San Jose on Sunday. But the number 35 that deserves this week’s fame is none other than the Harvard men’s hockey team’s goaltender, sophomore Ryan Carroll.Last week, in his first three career starts, Carroll posted a total of 113 saves, bested some of the nation’s top collegiate goalies, and proved that he belongs in the Harvard net. “I think Ryan did a great job,” junior Alex Biega said. “He proved to the rest of the nation that he has the ability to be the go-to guy for the team.” With his performance over the weekend—which included a .922 save percentage—one could assume that Carroll has always belonged in the top goalie spot. But Carroll began this season just like last, as the backup. In his freshman year, Carroll only saw playing time in one game after suffering an injury. The starter last year, then-sophomore Kyle Richter, made 883 saves throughout the season and was perhaps the team’s best player. Still, Carroll committed himself to becoming stronger for his sophomore year.“Being injured was frustrating,” Carroll said. “But I’ve worked hard all summer and all season and now I’m finally in the net.”However, even with Richter’s absence, Carroll found himself in the backup position once again—this time behind freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle. Hoyle has played 1127 minutes this season to Carroll’s 204. But while Hoyle was a major factor in Harvard’s hot start, the Crimson lapsed in the middle of the season, winning only once during a 16-game stretch. During the consolation final of this year’s Beanpot, Carroll finally got his chance. Playing against No. 15 Boston College in front of a sold-out crowd at T.D. Banknorth Garden, Carroll made 42 saves in his first career start. Despite a close 4-3 loss to the Eagles, Carroll demonstrated that the effort he’s put in since the previous season has paid off. “Matt Hoyle is a great goalie, and I was confident that he would play well [in the beginning of the season],” Carroll said. “I was just there ready to take my chance.”Carroll continued his time in goal last weekend against Colgate and No. 6 Cornell. Against the Raiders on Friday, the Crimson was outshot 31-23. It was Carroll’s 29 saves that helped Harvard to its 3-2 victory, and its sixth-place ranking in the ECAC. “[We’re in] such a low scoring league, that in the goalie situation, it’s a position that is make or break,” Biega said. “Ryan was very sound positionally and he definitely has the poise to do tremendous things.”Following the win, Carroll again showed his prowess in goal against the Big Red on Saturday night. With another 42-save game, Carroll helped the Crimson earn a 4-2 win against its historic rival. The fact that Carroll faced Ben Scrivens in the opposite goal added to his remarkable feat. Not to be outdone by Scrivens, the stingiest goaltender in the country and frontrunner for the Hobey Baker Award given to the best national college hockey player, Carroll proved to be the better goaltender on the night. “It was great, the atmosphere was unbelievable and it was unbelievable to upset them, especially since they are ranked number six in the country,” Carroll said.Although the win over Cornell was a personal highlight for Carroll, he was quick to point out that that the moment was special for the team as well. “I’ve played really well and our team has played really well,” he said. “I’m proud to be in the net and help our team with some wins.”Despite three solid performances last week, Carroll knows he needs to continue focusing on his play, especially with upcoming games against St. Lawrence and Clarkson this weekend.“Now that I’m in the net I need to keep working,” he said To Carroll, this season is not about his comeback kid story, but rather the comeback story of the team. “It’s great to finally play but I wouldn’t put it as me being a Cinderella story. Hopefully [our winning streak] continues until playoffs and the rest of this season.”

There’s nothing quite like a Cinderella story—a tale of a girl who goes from rags to riches.The Harvard women’s fencing team has a Cinderella story of its own this year, without the evil stepsisters. Sophomore sabre Yunsoo Kim, simply a novice fencer when she entered college, currently finds herself an integral part of what could quite possibly be a National Championship team—something every Division I athlete dreams about. Yet, for Kim, this fairy tale has become a reality.Unlike her teammates, Kim did not begin fencing at a young age. She didn’t train at the best fencing facility in the country, nor did she compete competitively. In fact, Kim’s high school did not even have a fencing team. She only fenced recreationally in an afterschool program.“I came here and had to basically learn everything,” Kim said.Her coach, Peter Brand, has watched Kim grow over the last two years, and is as impressed with her as a person and with her work ethic as he is with her as a fencer.“She’s been very patient with me and everybody else, for someone who has never fenced before,” Brand said. “It’s remarkable really.”Kim has had a little luck too, as she just happened to be in the right place at the right time when entering college. It is exceedingly rare for Harvard to be down a starting female fencer. It’s even more extraordinary that a walk-on was given the chance to fill this void in the team. Yet, somehow, the stars aligned, and Kim was able to take advantage of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.“It’s one of the best decisions I’ve made at Harvard,” Kim said.Last weekend, at the first part of the Ivy Championships, Kim competed in the sabre, winning two bouts and losing a few others by a close margin. Because the Crimson only has three sabre fencers and there are three sabre positions to fill, Kim competes in every tournament.“I really respect her for her attitude and her character,” Brand said. “She’s making steady progress. I think she’s won the respect and admiration of all of her teammates.”Instead of having to deal with evil stepsisters, Kim has had the support of her sabre teammates, freshman Caroline Vloka and freshman Hayley Levitt. They offer advice with regards to fencing—advice that Kim views as integral to her success.“They motivate me, they help me, and they tell me that I can do it,” Kim said. “We all support each other...It’s such a tight team, a great community.”Kim’s story has come about due to a lack of recruited fencers. This weakness has certainly been recognized by the coaching staff, and Brand has stated that he plans to recruit more sabre fencers in the future. With a move like this, Kim’s future as a starting Harvard fencer is not solidified.“To her credit, she keeps chugging along, taking what she can get,” Brand said. “She’s supporting us in trying to find [new recruits]. At the same time she is spending a lot of time getting better.”This year isn’t the only year Kim has helped out her team when it was in a pinch. Last year, as a freshman, she learned an entirely new weapon, the epee, when it was a weak facet of the team. This year, Kim’s versatility and work ethic allowed her to earn her way to a starting role.Kim wrote to Brand the summer before entering college, telling him of her desire to fence in college. Although Brand explained that he rarely accepts walk-on­­—especially those who have never fenced before—would end up being an exception to his rule.Brand was already familiar with the Kim family, having worked with Yunsoo’s father when he was an assistant coach at MIT. Her father also began fencing in college. Keeping in mind this past relationship, Brand knew he would be able to take a chance on the novice. “She was willing and able to work really hard,” Brand said. “I saw that in her as I did her father. I expected to see something special, and we did. We do have a special person here.”This Sunday the women’s fencing team will play for the Ivy League title. After that, it will compete for a national championship. Kim will fence for Harvard in the sabre. We shall see if this Cinderella gets her happy ending.—Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.

It is a well known fact that road trips bring sports teams together. But they also bring beat teams together.This past weekend, the men’s basketball team travelled to Ithaca, New York and New York City to square off against league foes while we—men’s hoops writers Timothy J. Walsh, Dennis Zheng, and myself–sojourned with them. And while the Crimson basketball team suffered two defeats, we experienced the lavish lifestyle of the road.Well, sort of.Cruising to the tunes of T. Pain, Lil’ Wayne and the Goo Goo Dolls, our bro-some hauled over 780 miles through five states. However, highlights from the trip would extend well beyond basketball games and the song “Mrs. Officer.”Our first stop was the sprawling campus of Cornell in Ithaca, New York.Consider driving to Cornell if you can picture yourself in a Steven King novel, or alternatively, are in the market to buy a mobile home. Some towns to look into include the Village of Greene and the Town of Triangle. A little known fact: the Finger Lakes were originally settled by representatives from Playskool. Friday the 13th saw a substantial loss for the Crimson at the hands of the Big Red.For us, it also meant a serious loss of faith in the quality of Cornell fandom. When it came to the student body’s support of their dominant team, it was quantity over quality.The best cheers and jeers the “Red Zone” could muster was “Put on a tie Amaker” and “You have skinny legs” (a jab aimed at freshman guard Max Kenyi). I felt like I was at a no-name D-III school that prides itself on its communications program and ample parking space. Following another uninspired Amaker joust later in the game, I heard some of the fans behind me ask who Coach K was. Then I just felt like leaving.Following the crushing 96-75 loss, we sought to forget our (unbiased) woes over a quality meal. Strolling through college town, we opted for Italian and found a hole in the wall establishment simply named “Pizza.” Simple is good, right? Wrong.Twenty minutes into the wait for our food, we looked on as a crowd of scantily clad women enthusiastically exited a tiny bathroom; one of them approached a man behind the counter, who pulled out a letter from inside his shirt and gave it to the smiling female. Suspecting that “Pizza” actually stood for something else, Tim and I hastily reconsidered ordering “hero” sandwiches.After surviving the night in Ithaca, we piled back in the car and plotted a course for Columbia University. New York City on Valentine’s Day proved to be slightly more appealing than the frigid slopes of Cornell. Call me a romantic, but I just can’t help but cherish NYC over a place that celebrates Agricultural Science majors.If you were concerned, the Hallmark-contrived holiday was far from lost for our traveling trio–dreamy happenings filled the day. We walked through a beautiful campus, watched a great show from front row seats and ate at a quaint restaurant in the city.Just for the record, we’re still just friends; that’s all.Continuing the trend of Italian food, we stopped by a nominally less questionable pizzeria that actually had a real name several blocks away from Columbia. There would be no illicit cover-ups here, just pizza that put Noch’s to shame. Although the featured item was “jumbo” slices that were bigger and most likely tastier than Dennis’ face, Tim and I opted for a large pie and never looked back.Much like our dining experiences throughout the weekend, the game against the Lions was intense. After leading by as much as 10 in the second half, Harvard hit an offensive speed bump down the line and looked on as the Lions claimed a one point victory in the final five seconds of the game.And you thought you had a bad Valentine’s Day…We had hoped for a split, but in the end there were no split feelings about the trip. Regardless of wins or loses, the retreat provided an excellent way to get to know the team, each other, and all the meanings of the word “pizza.” Perhaps the radio exemplified our growth the most. What began as the faint, nervous humming of song lyrics on the way to Cornell progressed into a full out karaoke fest in Tim’s car by Saturday night.All things considered, the retreat represented the birth of a unified beat team willing to cover a team’s road games regardless of the quality of play, pizza or pop music. And there’s no question that we enjoyed it. Next year we might just head all the way to Penn and Princeton.—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

Penn and Princeton may have home court advantage, but as the Harvard men’s basketball team (10-12, 2-6 Ivy) gears up for this weekend, it has nothing but revenge on its mind. 
The Crimson is looking to redeem itself against Ivy rivals Penn (8-13, 4-3) and Princeton (9-11, 4-3), after facing devastating losses to both teams earlier in the season. Harvard will take on the Quakers at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Palestra in Philadelphia, and will play the Tigers Friday at 7 p.m. in Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium.
Last weekend, the Crimson suffered two away defeats against Cornell and Columbia, dropping to seventh place overall in the Ivy standings. 
“I think we could respond better this weekend,” senior Drew Housman said. “We kind of crumbled once the crowd got into it. Our freshman got their first real experience last weekend.” 
Although the difficulty of playing away may have hurt Harvard last weekend, the team feels more prepared coming into these upcoming games.
“We’re not happy with coming away with two losses last weekend,” captain Andrew Pusar said. “But it’s us, not the places. These have been tough places to play…Going into an environment like that, it can give you a spark.”
Currently on a three-game winning streak, the Quakers have certainly found a solid rhythm. This past weekend Penn cruised by Brown, 73-52, and beat Yale, 68-63, the following night. 
An obstacle that the Crimson will have to face in its matchup with the Quakers is sophomore forward Tyler Bernardini. Bernardini has been one of the Ivy’s leading scorers all season, currently sitting at the number five spot.
“He’s a good scorer, a good shooter,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Just like any other team, I’m sure he’s going to be a little bit more comfortable, confident being at home, so we’ll have our work cut out for us.”
Another player the Crimson has to keep an eye on is freshman point guard Zach Rosen, who is leading the Ivy League in assists per game (5.2), including 39 in his last six games. 
Although Penn has won 13 of the last 14 games against Harvard, the Crimson is excited and ready to take on the challenge, particularly after the Quakers squeezed by Harvard, 66-60, earlier this season.
Princeton may come into tomorrow’s contest slightly less poised, as it is currently on a three-game losing streak. However, earlier this season, the Tigers turned a five-game losing streak into a seven-game winning streak, so this game cannot be taken lightly by the Crimson. 
Princeton’s offense has been a two-man show that posed problems for Harvard and the other Ivies this season. Sophomore guard Dan Mavraides and freshman guard Douglas Davis have been dominating outside the arc, with Mavraides leading the league by shooting .548 from three-point territory in Ivy games.
“Those two, they’re good shooters,” Amaker said. “Davis is such a key with making things going for the team…Mavraides [is] a very good shooter. So I think they’re solid players, and I’m sure they’ll [be] looking to right their ship because they’re coming off of a few losses themselves.”
In the last meeting of these two rivals, the Crimson fell on hard luck. After exchanging leads for most of the game, the Tigers pulled ahead with only 3:49 remaining and held on to win the game, 77-71. Nevertheless, Harvard knows what it has to do to be successful.
“It’s not that much different against Princeton,” Housman said. “Offensively, we’ll be able to find some gaps in their zone.”
The Crimson has been practicing hard all week to prepare for these two battles. After the previous encounters this season, Harvard knows how it can shut these teams down. 
“We don’t anticipate those two teams changing up what they do,” Amaker said. “They’re very consistent and they had success against us the first time. Both games were very good ballgames, possession games that could’ve changed in our favor.”
This weekend gives the Crimson a chance to make its way back up in the standings and earn back some respect in the Ivy League.
“It would be nice to go into their houses and dictate tempo,” Housman said. “The number one thing is staying confident and really staying energetic…We want to play our style of basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two weekends full of upsets, one might have figured that last weekend the Ivy League would sort itself out from this disarray.Instead, all we got is more confusion.
Entering last weekend undefeated and in first place in the league, Princeton not only lost both those titles, but gave them up in shockingly easy fashion. Yale and Brown each clowned on the Tigers, giving the Bears their first win of the Ivy season.For good measure, Princeton lost at home to Penn on Tuesday, though it put forth a much better performance.
League favorite Cornell regained the top spot, but blowing a 19-point lead in the second half against Dartmouth is a good sign for the rest of the league that the Ithaca team can be had, as well as a good harbinger for whoever Cornell plays in the NCAA tournament. 
And where is Harvard in all this? Another close game lost at the end, this time at Columbia. 
In its six losses, the Crimson was tight to the end in four of them before usually being let down by poor foul shooting and/or other mistakes, as well as better execution by its opponent.
So is all the end-game karma against Harvard? Well, no. In the two games it did win—at Dartmouth and home against Brown—the winning scores came on the final possession, and the opponent arguably played better each time. So while Harvard perhaps should be better than 2-6 in league play, that record could just as easily be worse.
Let’s see what is in store for this weekend’s set of games.
HARVARD (10-12, 2-6 Ivy) at PRINCETON (9-11, 4-3)
Princeton looked to be getting back to its formidability of the past after winning its first four league games, including dominating performances against Cornell and Columbia. Now, who knows.
The tough overtime loss against Penn leaves the Tigers with just two days to rest up before welcoming the Crimson to Jadwin Gym. Princeton has lost its first home games the past two years after playing Penn mid-week, but that can be attributed to those Tiger teams being terrible. Harvard has not won at Princeton since 1989, and if it couldn’t beat away the Tigers when they were down, the chances of ending this 20-year drought now are not good. Princeton 67, Harvard 61.
DARTMOUTH (6-16, 4-4) at PENN (8-13, 4-3)
The Big Green beat Penn for the first time in 12 years earlier this month up in New Hampshire, but the Quakers have just won three games in a row, all on the road. Dartmouth won’t have to wait 12 more years to beat the team in blue and red again, but it also won’t get its first season sweep of Penn since 1959. The Big Green did sweep the Quakers eight times in the 1940s and 50s when it also played in the NCAA championship game twice. Times have changed. Penn 70, Dartmouth 58.
COLUMBIA (10-12, 5-3) at BROWN (7-15, 1-7)
Brown finally broke its league duck against Princeton, surprisingly, last weekend. Well, maybe nothing is too surprising in the league any more. The Lions swept Dartmouth and Harvard last weekend and find themselves surprisingly in second place. They’ll stay there for at least one more day. Columbia 57, Brown 53.
CORNELL (17-7, 7-1) at YALE (9-13, 4-4)
A tough game for the Big Red, especially coming after nearly getting shocked at home against Dartmouth. For a veteran and well-coached team, that almost-clunker should serve as an important wake-up call, and we can expect see a much better performance from the defending champs. Cornell 72, Yale 65.
DARTMOUTH at PRINCETON
Surprisingly, these two teams were at or near the top of the league just one week ago. After nearly stunning Cornell and everyone else who follows Ivy League basketball, the Big Green could definitely grab a win at Jadwin. However, the Tigers have the edge after their previous victory up north. Princeton 58, Dartmouth 50.
COLUMBIA at YALE
Joe Jones got the better of his brother James when the two meet earlier this season, and his Lions have also won their past two trips to the intimidating John J. Lee Amphitheatre—no easy feat. The Bulldogs, however, are in much better form than when the teams met earlier, and Ross Morin and company should bounce back from defeat against Cornell the previous night. Yale 65, Columbia 58.
CORNELL at BROWN
Quoting fellow beat writer Walt Howell, “I will never pick anyone to beat Cornell.” I concur. Cornell 75, Brown 60.
HARVARD at PENN
The Crimson really should have won this game when the two met in Cambridge earlier this month. Harvard will have senior forward and Palestra favorite Evan Harris back, but junior Doug Miller will probably miss out. Guard Harrison Gaines is back for the Quakers after being sick for the earlier fixture. Advantage Penn. The Crimson must wait another year to win a game on this road trip. Penn 67, Harvard 60.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team began clocking in hours of vigorous team fitness and technical training early in September for what would be a short season, consisting of only 10 matches played in December and February. 
After a successful regular season, the Crimson boasts a 6-4 record and a No. 5 national ranking. Now, in the final stretch of the season, Harvard’s hard work culminates in this weekend’s CSA National Team Championships and next weekend’s CSA National Individual Championships.
Tonight, the Crimson will take to the courts with a vengeance against No. 4 Cornell (12-3) in both teams’ first-round matchup of the National Team Championships, held in Princeton, N.J. 
Competition continues throughout the weekend, and results from today’s matches will determine which team Harvard will face tomorrow. 
If the Crimson is victorious against the Big Red, it will most likely face a very challenging second-round date with Yale, Princeton, or Trinity, all teams that Harvard fell to earlier in the season.
Despite the three-day setup of the tournament, the Crimson is not looking beyond its first-round opponent. Harvard will focus on successfully delivering the critical points necessary to defeat Cornell and advance in the Championship bracket. 
In early December, the then-No. 4 Crimson suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of the then-No. 6 Big Red in a hard-fought battle that ended with Harvard on the losing end of a 6-3 decision. 
“The first [match against Cornell] for us is just huge,” said junior and Crimson No. 1 Colin West. “That is our tournament.”
If Harvard wins today, the worst overall the team can place is fourth. However, if the team falls to Cornell, the best it can do is fifth place. The Crimson’s hope to clinch a top-three finish hinges on victory in its first-round contest.
“If we get past this one thing, we’re rolling,” West said. “Then we’ve got positive momentum and the tournament should be a really strong one for us.”
Harvard had a strong start to the season, winning its first three competitions against Brown, Williams, and Dartmouth before blemishing its perfect record with the loss to the Big Red. The Crimson quickly rebounded with a 5-4 win against a solid Rochester team.
“[The victory] was a wake up call and a rallying point at the same time,” said Harvard junior Alex Lavoie. “[That match] showed us that we can beat and hang with the best teams, but that it takes a lot of work and a lot of guts to just do it.” 
The Crimson’s captain, senior Verdi DiSesa, has led his teammates all season, exhibiting what may be considered the team’s mantra of ‘seizing the moment.’ 
DiSesa’s big win at Rochester against an All-American, high-caliber opponent gave Harvard the edge it needed to win. 
“There’s no such thing as last minute training [in squash]. It just doesn’t work,” West said. “You only get one shot at each game, and you have to perform on the day. And Verdi is bar none the best at that.”
The Crimson showcased its skill and heart last Wednesday, when it challenged No. 3 Yale and almost pulled off an upset against the Bulldogs. Harvard fell just short of a team victory, and Yale went home with the 5-4 win. 
Coming off of that nail-biting match, the Crimson has been focusing on its mental sharpness. In the team’s final week of training, it is preparing to play outside of its comfort zone in order to pull off the exciting points and wins that will be critical to its success this weekend.
“[We’ve been focused on] playing the big points right,” West said. “We’ve had a lot of matches that have come down to the last point—the crisis point—and that’s what we’ve been working on, playing tough under those pressure situations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in the national rankings for the first time in months, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team looks to capture the ECAC regular-season title this weekend with two clashes at Bright Hockey Center. Tonight will see the Crimson (15-9-3, 14-4-2 ECAC) face off against No. 7 St. Lawrence (21-8-3, 15-4-1), while Saturday’s action will pit Harvard against conference foe Clarkson (16-11-5, 10-7-3). 
Coming off just its second loss in its last 11 games—a non-conference overtime nail-biter to No. 5 UNH Tuesday night—Harvard seems to be peaking at just the right time. Behind the strong offensive play of last year’s Patty Kazmaier Award winner, tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, and stingy netminding of junior Christina Kessler, the Crimson has won eight straight ECAC contests to rise back near the top of the standings. 
With 30 points on the season, Harvard currently sits just one point behind St. Lawrence’s 31 for first in the conference.  
“It’s a really big weekend for us,” tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “We’ve really come on the second half of the season with some really big wins, and luckily some of our opponents have struggled, so this weekend is a big opportunity.” 
Way back in November, when Harvard traveled to New York to face these same two teams, the Crimson was met with two losses—two losses that signaled to fans and players alike that Harvard would have some ground to make up if it hoped to repeat as ECAC champs. 
This time around, the Crimson is out to prove it’s not the same team it was at the beginning of the season. 
“We played well coming out of Christmas, but since exams we’ve really gelled as a team,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We’re rested and we’re healthy, and that’s very important.” 
Brine agrees that the exam period could be seen as a turning point of sorts for the team’s fortunes this year. 
“We worked really hard over exam period, even though it’s difficult with everyone obviously concentrating on our studies, but we all committed to get down to the rink as much as possible,” she said. “Also, the break gave some of our injured players a chance for some much needed rest.” 
It was just before the exam period that Harvard started its current eight-game ECAC winning streak. Much of its recent success can be attributed to the stellar play of Vaillancourt, who leads the league with 30 points scored in conference play. Over the last seven games, Vaillancourt has scored 19 points, giving her a hand in 19 of the team’s last 23 goals. A Kazmaier nominee once again this year, the senior will have to continue her hot streak if Harvard hopes to come away victorious this weekend. 
Having been atop the ECAC standings all season long, St. Lawrence comes into tonight’s matchup after losing its last game, 2-1, at home against upstart Princeton. Led by senior Carson Duggan, who paces the team with 34 points, the Saints will be looking to avenge last year’s ECAC championship game overtime loss to the Crimson.
Clarkson enters Saturday’s battle in sixth place in the ECAC. The Golden Knights, anchored by sophomore goalie Lauren Dahm, who ranks fourth in the nation in goals-against average, have split their last two weekend sets.
With postseason play looming, the importance of this weekend’s matchups is heightened. While the Crimson has already locked down home-ice advantage for the first round of the ECAC playoffs, a sweep this weekend would let Harvard play at Bright throughout the tournament. However, the team is not concerned with such talk of postseason play just yet. 
“We’re just taking it one game at a time, not even looking to the NCAAs yet,” Stone said. “At this point of the season it’s win or go home, so we’re just trying to stay focused.” 
Having climbed back from a rocky start, Harvard has the chance tonight to finish the season by reaching the goal it had from the beginning: winning the ECAC regular-season crown.
“We’re in the position we hoped to get to, and we’ve worked hard to get ourselves to this point,” Stone said. “To have the opportunity to take care of business on your own in the last weekend is the opportunity you want.”
