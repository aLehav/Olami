After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last winter, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 asked us to lead a task force on student mental health at Harvard. We readily agreed, as each of us has noticed in our respective roles that many of our students grapple with emotional and psychosocial distress. According to the most recent National College Health Assessment by the American College Health Association, 45 percent of students reported having felt so depressed within the last 12 months that it was difficult to function, and almost 66 percent reported having felt overwhelming anxiety within the same time period — numbers that have risen steadily over the past decade. It’s also no secret that universities in general, and Harvard in particular, are high-stress environments that attract people who are high-achieving, and who often have become so at great personal sacrifice.
With the 45 undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, and administrators who constitute the task force, we began in February to examine how Harvard should address the academic, social, and institutional issues that affect student mental health. Starting last May, we began convening focus groups to hear directly from undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, faculty members across multiple schools, and staff at all levels of the institution. We asked countless questions about how students and others perceived the scope of the problem, which resources and policies were effective, which did more harm than good, and how Harvard could do better.
In addition, the task force has been analyzing several surveys fielded across Harvard’s schools. The College has been systematically surveying its incoming freshman students about mental health issues since 2010, and Harvard University Health Services has included questions about student mental health on its biennial health and well-being survey since 2012. We’ve taken a close look at the results of these surveys, as well as at data from the Graduate Student Mental Health Survey Initiative, led by Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira, and other sources of data, to inform our thinking about the state of student mental health at Harvard and what changes might help improve the well-being of our students.
We have learned a great deal. For example, many undergraduates feel perpetually overwhelmed, yearn for more meaningful relationships, or find extracurriculars to be yet another source of competition, rather than relief. Many graduate students feel profound isolation, experience financial hardship, worry about the relationship to their advisers, or remain unsure about their academic and career prospects. Many students of color, and BGLTQ, international, and low-income students, wonder how much the institution considers their concerns central to its mission. And many students at all levels are not entirely sure how, when, and where to go for help with potential mental health concerns.
The task force continues its work. We are conducting additional focus groups, continuing to gather and analyze survey and administrative data, and examining the mental health policies at Harvard and our peer institutions. We intend to make full use of the range of perspectives and talents represented on the task force, whose diverse membership includes psychologists, sociologists, and psychiatrists, poets and biologists, therapists, deans and administrators, students from across the University, and people of multiple economic, gender, race, national, and ethnic backgrounds. We aim to draw on our collective experience to cultivate the most supportive environment we can for everyone at Harvard.
For the progress we have made to date, we thank the Harvard community. As our work continues, we ask that you keep sharing your thoughts with us. If you have comments, questions, concerns, an issue you believe no one has heard, or a perspective on mental health that we should take into account, please be in touch with us.
Your point of view is vital to our work.
Emma Dench is Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Professor of Ancient and Modern History, and of the Classics, and Chair of the Task Force’s Working Group on Graduate and Professional Students. Matthew K. Nock is a Professor of Psychology and Chair of the Task Force’s Working Group on Undergraduate Students. Mario L. Small is a Professor of Sociology and Chair of the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When was the last time you seriously thought about what your life would be like 20 to 30 years from now? We rarely think about what would happen to the friendships we are so heavily involved in currently, what it would be like having a family, or whether or not we would be truly happy with the vocation we end up in. We end up focusing on more pressing deadlines that we can take care of right away, choosing to neglect any thoughts about the uncertain future.
Part of the reason why I used to hesitate to think about the future is that I fear my life will not be satisfying. I sometimes cringe imagining how terrible it might feel to reconnect with my friends a long time after we graduate, watching them have lucrative careers and luxurious lives while my standard of living is nowhere near theirs. My fear intensified over winter break. I felt conflicted between wanting to rest and feeling guilty for not carefully planning my future.
Thankfully, attending the Harvard College alumni reunion in my home country made me feel more reassured about my deeply-rooted doubts. When I received the invitation to the reunion, I didn’t want to go. I did not know anyone else who was going, and most of the attendees who RSVP’d to the Facebook event were about the same age as my parents. I worried the event would be like every other networking session, where the alumni talk about their achievements, and current students hunt for internships. I worried I would get stuck in uncomfortable conversations I could not contribute to. Nevertheless, a part of me had a glimmer of hope that maybe there would be some genuinely nice people there — after all, not all adults are as cutthroat and serious as a lot of us are.
To my surprise, the alums that came were nothing like I imagined; they somehow reminded me of a much older and slightly more classy version of my friends. I was most amazed by how the experiences we either had or are having at Harvard brought people of different ages together. While there were some incongruities, including changes to Harvard Square, there were also some things that stayed the same: memories of grinding through psets, late night conversations with your close friends, and crazy adventures.
I was surprised to hear that when Harvard College hosts alumni reunions on campus, alumni are given the option to stay in their dorms with their roommates. For those who ended up becoming very close to their roommates, being able to stay in the same dorm (many of which haven’t been renovated since they graduated) would bring back fond memories.
From the three fun hours I spent with these Harvard alumni, I walked away with a sense of reassurance that the friends I have grown to cherish now will stay forever. One alum told us that what she realized after attending college reunions every 10 years. Ten years after graduating, people are still working hard, eager to network. Twenty years later, people start experiencing the ups and downs of life and become more understanding of each other. Thirty years later, people have dealt with all sorts of difficult problems in their lives, everyone becomes extremely nice to one another. This made me smile — time and distance may bring me closer to friends that I never had a chance to get to know well during my time in college. Any sense of bitterness or competitiveness you have towards a friend may become something that both of you can leave behind and laugh at years from now.
Meeting alums who once were college students anxious about their futures like us and listening to their stories, I felt more confident than ever that my life will actually work out. Nothing feels better than knowing the friends I have grown to cherish now will stay forever, although we may not be able to see each other as often. Our shared experiences will help us revisit our past, laugh together, and even sympathize with future generations of Harvard undergraduates. So why not lay aside our stress and unhealthy desires for success and spend some time checking in with your friends and spend time enjoying each other’s companies? After all, what remains after we graduate aren’t the negative emotions, but are the small memories that we can revisit with joy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since 2006, once every year Annenberg is sumptuously prepared for the collision of two worlds. The “Celebration of Scholarships” brings together Harvard College students with the individual donors who have endowed their scholarships. While the event arguably has a significant effect on the school’s ability to encourage continued donations to financial aid, for many of the students who attend it can be an overwhelming affair that highlights their sense of alienation from the wealth and privilege of the university they attend. Worse, many students feel objectified — put out on display for the oohs and aahs of elite donors who they do not know and cannot identify with, yet to whom they still feel obligated.
While we understand the importance of maintaining continued financial aid donations, which currently endow two-thirds of all financial aid, we want to challenge the way in which the event is framed and presented.
As it stands, what precisely the event intends to celebrate is ambiguous. A celebration of scholarships fetishizes an abstract exchange of money between a donor and the College. At best, this fetishization of the scholarship as such just seems sort of bland — trivial in the way that celebrating a purchase might be. At worst, however, it risks making students feel that their presence at the event, not to mention at Harvard more broadly, is in service of that transaction rather than the other way around.
But the idea of creating an institutional context to celebrate the achievement of first-generation and low-income students is worth preserving. The event might best be redeemed by dropping the “-hips” and reconceiving it more as a Celebration of Scholars. Doing so would still allow donors to mingle with and feel a connection to these students that would encourage them to continue donating, but it would also reframe the event as not a celebration of a monetary exchange but the accomplishments of a remarkable group of students. Gaining admission to Harvard despite systemic socioeconomic disadvantage, not to mention excelling here through four whirlwind years, is a major feat that deserves proper celebration.
One model Harvard might consider is restructuring the event to focus on the celebration of soon-to-be-graduates. Instead of focusing on scholarship students generally, the event could be geared toward graduating seniors as a culminating ceremony for their time. Prep for Prep, a New York City nonprofit that helps students of color gain admission to private schools, provides an example. Their annual Lilac Ball is fundamentally a fundraising event, but it seeks to celebrate the graduation of high school seniors who completed the program. In so doing, they not only raise money and offer donors an opportunity to mingle with scholars, but also pay tribute to the hard work of students that makes the whole endeavor worthwhile in the first place. The College might consider restructuring its event in a similar way.
Who knows? Harvard might even end up raising more money.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Cornell W. Brooks and Boston activist and organizer Monica Cannon-Grant spoke about how to fight for social justice in the United States at the William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice’s inaugural Social Justice Hackathon Friday.
The hackathon, which was held in Gutman Library, featured both presentations and group work time and began with a discussion between Brooks — former president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People — and Cannon-Grant — who helped organize a 2017 march against white supremacy and a counter-protest during the 2019 “straight pride” parade in Boston. The two discussed Cannon-Grant’s experience with activism, which she said began during a summer in which her neighborhood saw 15 separate shootings. Cannon-Grant said she started throwing block parties in order to unify her neighborhood and combat violence.
Several years after starting her block party initiative, however, a young man nearly shot Cannon-Grant’s son in the head, and her son only survived because the trigger jammed. That incident launched Cannon-Grant’s career advocating for young black people in Boston.
Cannon-Grant concluded that victims and killers deal with similar stressors and decided to commit herself to helping and advocating for the “shooters.” She started a non-profit organization called Violence in Boston to address these issues locally. Cannon-Grant said that federal funding often goes to state police to prevent crime, but it should go to activists on the ground working to rehabilitate people.
“We are not going to arrest our way out of any problem,” Cannon-Grant said.
After Cannon-Grant’s talk, the audience broke out into several groups. Each group discussed possible solutions to several issues including immigration, voter suppression, bail fines and fees, and reparations.
The immigration team discussed the Liberian immigration crisis and finding long-term stability for immigrants to the United States, and the voter suppression group brainstormed strategies for making voters feel like their ballots matter and increasing general civic engagement. Members of the bail bonds and fines team examined bail bonds in Louisiana and discussed strategies for resolving black-white disparities in court fees. At the same time, the reparations group considered how to best repair the damages of historical institutions like slavery and undo institutional racism.
After the small group session, Brooks and Cannon-Grant again spoke to the audience about strategies for creating and operating advocacy organizations. Cannon-Grant urged students to consider what intellectual or financial resources they have and can give to movements for social justice.
“Everybody’s activism is different,” Cannon-Grant said. “Show up in whatever way is comfortable for you.”
After Brooks and Cannon-Grant spoke, local activists Renée Omolade, Segun Idowu, and Atara Rich-Shea spoke on a panel about their own distinct social advocacy.
Omolade — who started youth engagement and community development organization We Are The Ones after her friend was shot in 2014 — said that she felt she had a moral obligation to become an activist because she is from Dorchester, Mass. where less than 10 percent of residents have college degrees. From the time she was 14 years old, she was involved in Boston violence prevention programs. She said that, through her experiences, she discovered that activism can happen at any time and place.
Idowu said his social justice career began in 2011 when he protested the execution of Troy A. Davis — who was convicted for the murder of a police officer though he maintained his innocence until his death — in Georgia with a group of Morehouse College students. He said he is currently working to fund local black businesses to build wealth in black communities in Boston.
Massachusetts Bail Fund Executive Director Rich-Shea said her work as a public defender representing marginalized people led her to believe that prisons do not do a service for society.
Friday’s event ended with a poetry reading from National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda S.C. Gorman ’20 and a performance from Harvard’s Kuumba singers.

Organizers of Divest Harvard — a student group calling on the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels — poured liquid meant to represent oil over their members' heads during a demonstration at the Smith Campus Center Friday.
More than 20 protesters from Divest Harvard and climate advocacy group Extinction Rebellion marched from the John Harvard Statue in Harvard Yard to the Smith Center to watch Claire Pryor ’22, Jaden “JD” D. Deal ’23, and Owen Torrey ’21 carry out the demonstration. The trio sat on white sheets while three other Divest Harvard members, wearing placards bearing the names of oil companies, drenched them with a thick, brown liquid meant to symbolize oil.
Protest attendee Miles A. Mcallister ’21 said the demonstration was “amazing.”
“My congratulations and gratitude to the performers,” Mcallister said. “That was really cool and special and powerful. I wish there were more people here to see what went on today.”
The demonstration came just one day after an Undergraduate Council ballot referendum showed that 69.3 percent of undergraduate voters believe Harvard should commit — by Earth Day 2020 — to complete divestment “as soon as possible” and produce a plan for doing so. Last year, 71.5 percent of UC referendum voters supported divestment.
Mcallister, who carried a sign at the protest that read “Harvard profits from climate change,” said that he voted to support divestment.
“If the University is going to broadly act that they’re leaders in the fight against climate change and sponsor research into it and things of that nature, their investment holdings need to also represent that,” he said.
Joseph Winters ’21, a Divest organizer who spoke at the event, told attendees that Harvard’s continued fossil fuel investment makes the school “complicit in the degradation of our collective future.”
“We — students, alumni, faculty, and community members — demand the divestment of Harvard’s over $40 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry,” Winters said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred The Crimson to previous statements regarding divestment.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.”
“As it has done for well over a decade, the University will continue to support its faculty, students and staff as they pursue a range of innovative and ambitious efforts to accelerate the world’s transition to renewable sources of energy and to help mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change that are already being realized,” he added.
Swain also pointed to Harvard’s climate action plan, which was introduced by former University President Drew G. Faust, which commits the University to ridding its operations of fossil fuels by 2050.
Winters closed his remarks to the crowd saying that the demonstration was meant to symbolize Harvard and the fossil fuel industry’s “extraordinary indifference” to fossil fuels' impacts on humans.
“We call out these bad actors and demand that Harvard take responsibility for its role in perpetuating the climate crisis and global climate injustice,” Winters said.

Roughly 50 students demonstrated outside of The Harvard Crimson’s building Friday to protest the publication’s coverage of a Sept. 12 rally calling for the abolition of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Current and former Crimson editors organized the protest to support a petition demanding that The Crimson apologize for its coverage, cease requesting comment from ICE, and commit to “protecting undocumented students,” according to a Medium post by co-organizer Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20.
The petition — started by student-led immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream last month — criticizes The Crimson for requesting comment from an ICE spokesperson for its Sept. 13 article, “Harvard Affiliates Rally for Abolish ICE Movement.” The article covers a protest hosted by Act on a Dream and quotes several students’ criticisms of ICE, including calls for its dissolution. The story notes that ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Friday protest coincided with Champagne Showers, The Crimson's annual celebration of its incoming leadership. Several protesters entered the building chanting "New guard, don't let us down" and "Champagne won't wash away undocu voices."
Mudannayake, a Crimson design editor, declined to comment for this story. Act on a Dream Co-Directors and former Crimson editorial editors Emily A. Romero '21 and Diego Navarrete '21 — who were also present at the protest, along with other members of their organization — also declined to comment.
Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that The Crimson welcomes reader feedback.
“We respect the right to protest The Crimson’s policies and welcome free expression of views different from ours,” Guillaume wrote. “In the past few months, we have met with representatives of Act on a Dream to hear their concerns and explain our approach. We always welcome feedback from our readers and from those we cover."
The Crimson requests comment from all subjects of a story in accordance with standard journalistic practices, according to Guillaume.
"This policy demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that the individuals and institutions we write about have an opportunity to respond to criticisms in order to ensure a fair and unbiased story," she wrote.
Act on a Dream’s petition calling on The Crimson to apologize and change its policies has garnered more than 1,000 signatures as of Sunday night. Fifteen student organizations including the Phillips Brooks House Association, Harvard College Democrats, and Harvard Graduate Students Union–United Automobile Workers have also signed on.
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council also passed a resolution on Nov. 10 in support of Act on a Dream’s concerns about The Crimson’s reporting policies.

Former French Ambassador to the United States Pierre N. Vimont discussed the future of European foreign policy with diplomats and Harvard affiliates in a conversation hosted by Harvard’s Center for European Studies Friday.
Though he no longer works as an ambassador, Vimont holds the uncommon honorific title of “Ambassador of France” because of his lifelong service as a diplomat.
Moderators Boston University professor Vivien A. Schmidt and Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs senior associate Karl Kaiser introduced Vimont, who spoke on topics ranging from the changing role of China in Europe to the uncertain future of Brexit.
Regarding the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, Vimont said many Europeans oppose a solution that leaves Britain a seat at the table as a nonmember of the EU, as it would set a bad precedent for other nations. He said he hopes Europeans find a creative way to address this concern.
“I personally think that we should start thinking out of the box maybe to find something interesting because, after all, Britain will be a former member — we’ve never had that — and therefore why not try to invent and be creative?” he said.
Vimont also discussed China, claiming that the nation has begun to cooperate more with the European Union. Vimot, however, admitted he was cautious about assuming diplomatic relations are improving, adding that Europeans must simply wait and see.
Ultimately, Vimont said European nations could overcome many hurdles by finding a way to cooperate among themselves.
“The main takeaway is that European foreign policy is a sort of work in progress: There’s still a lot more to be done,” Vimont said in an interview following the event. “One of the main difficulties at the moment is getting the member states to accept and to buy into this idea of having a common foreign policy.”
“This is where we need to get more commitment and a greater sense of ownership on behalf of all those member states with regard to the foreign policy that they are trying to build,” he added.
Adrien Abecassis, a French diplomat who attended the event, said this idea was his main takeaway from Vimont’s talk.
“What he’s traced very wisely was the need for Europeans to have a deeper talk between themselves on what they want to do in the world — what kind of power they want to be,” Abecassis said. “Then the discussion on the tools, the structure, and the means will follow, but not the other way around.”

The Undergraduate Council voted to allocate $10,000 to fund printing and laundry for Student Events Fund-eligible students and another $10,000 to fund Wintersession grants at its general meeting Sunday.
The UC will provide $20 in Crimson Cash at the beginning of the spring semester to a total of 500 SEF-eligible students: 200 freshmen, 100 sophomores, 100 juniors, and 100 seniors. SEF is a College program that covers the costs of some event tickets for students who receive a certain amount of financial aid. The council will decide the students who receive the stipend by a random lottery that SEF-eligible students will be able to opt into, according to the legislation.
Crimson Cash may be used for laundry, printing, and at various restaurants and stores both on and off campus. Representatives at the meeting said that while they acknowledge the $20 may be used for purposes other than printing and laundry, they intend to use the program to study how participants spent the money.
The UC will send a feedback form to participating students at the end of the spring semester. They will then gauge the program’s potential for expansion.
Freshman Yard representatives Yousuf Bakshi ’23, Esther J. Xiang ’23, Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, Janna E. Ramadan ’23, David Y. Zhang ’23, and Phillip Meng ’23, as well as Quincy House Representative Phiroze K. Parasnis ’21 and Leverett House Representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22, sponsored the legislation.
Some representatives said they are concerned the UC will have to continue bearing the expenses of the program if the University does not institutionalize the initiative.
UC Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22 also raised concerns over whether the Council will be able to gather information on the program. He said he does not think giving each student $20 in Crimson Cash would provide the Council with much new information because $20 is not enough to cover the costs of printing and laundry.
Gan said she acknowledges the other representatives’ concerns and intends for the program to be a “first step in the right direction” to improving financial accessibility on campus rather than a long-term solution.
Dunster House Representative Noah Harris ’22 sponsored the legislation to fund Wintersession grants for individual students. While student organizations recognized by the College are eligible to apply for Wintersession funding, individual students are not, according to the legislation.
Representatives at the meeting said students may apply for UC funding to perform thesis research or hold events, among other possibilities.
The UC also voted to fund two other initiatives at its meeting Sunday.
The Council allocated $500 to the Woodbridge Society of International Students — an international student organization — to fund outings to Taza Chocolate Factory over Thanksgiving break. Attendees will receive a factory tour and participate in a chocolate tasting.
“For students who stay [on campus], breaks can often be less fulfilling and lonely as is empty,” Woodbridge’s grant proposal reads. “[W]e want to give students who stay on-campus the ability to go do something fun and out-of-the-ordinary during break so they have a break that is as fulfilling as those of students who get to go home.”
The event will be open to all students on campus over Thanksgiving break, with priority given to international and SEF-eligible students, according to the grant proposal.
The UC also allocated $4,400 to retroactively fund the Nigerian Student Association’s annual Nigerian Independence Day Gala, which took place Sept. 29 this year.
Students from various colleges gathered to celebrate Nigerian culture and the advancement of Nigerian art and technology at the gala, according to the grant proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As more than 150 temporary and less-than-half-time Harvard employees transition into permanent, benefited staff positions following a policy change that went into effect in March, the shift has brought “extraordinary” opportunities for some, but unintended challenges for others.
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Executive Director Bill Jaeger called the numbers of contingent workers a “significant reduction” during an interview last month, noting that overall use of temporary workers and less-than-half-time workers is down 15 to 20 percent compared to a year ago.
HUCTW pushed for new contingent worker rules after internal research last year revealed that roughly 300 temporary and part-time workers at Harvard worked “excessive” hours without the benefits they were owed. The union contended that temporary workers and less-than-half-time workers enjoyed fewer benefits than regular Harvard staff members, despite the similarity of their work to permanent staff.
The new contingent worker policy limits the timeframe temporary and less-than-half-time workers can be employed. The rule also bans University departments from cycling workers between temporary status and less-than-half-time more than once.
“We’re ensuring that people… in regular roles here are getting the regular positions with benefits that they deserve,” Jaeger said.
Forty-two of those workers transitioned in the first two months after March 3, when the policy went into effect. The policy was crafted as part of HUCTW’s new contract, which was agreed upon in October 2018 after months of delays.
Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an emailed statement that the new policy addresses the union’s concerns about the use of contingent workers while giving individual departments the “flexibility to manage their work and resources.”
“As with requirements of any labor agreement or employment law, decisions on resource allocation and workload management, in compliance with any such requirements, rest with leadership at the local level across University departments and units,” Curran wrote.
The University has employed 3,331 temporary and less-than-half-time workers since March 3, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. On a day-to-day basis, however, that number is typically much fewer. On Nov. 14, for example, 1,684 contingent employees were at work across campus.
Sara M. Alfaro-Franco, a videographer in the Division of Continuing Education, worked as a contingent worker for five years before this July, when she was hired into a new permanent part-time position.
Alfaro-Franco said the transition has allowed her to access an “extraordinary” range of benefits, from health care to access to classes.
“It has really opened my doors and it’s been a world of possibilities for me,” she said.
She said that transitioning into a permanent staff role has also changed the way she views her job.
“I feel a deep investment in the University that I never felt before,” she said. “They’re taking care of me and I want to take care of them in whatever way I can, which is working hard and doing my job.”
Though her hourly pay has remained the same, Alfaro-Franco said she is now working around 30 hours a week, up from 14 before the transition.
Jeffrey Czekaj, who works as an exhibition installer in the Graduate School of Design, said he was employed off-and-on by the University for more than 10 years until he was hired as a staff member this year.
Czekaj said he felt like an “outsider” even though he worked alongside staff.
“Nobody here, like, knew our names, we weren’t invited to the meetings,” he said.
He said he ran into difficulties applying for the Massachusetts Health Connector because the agency said Harvard should be giving him insurance as his employer, but his position did not previously afford those benefits.
“I have a six-year-old kid, so my partner and I would have to figure out… whose insurance he was going to be on and now it’s easy, like, I just have insurance for my whole family,” he said.
While Czekaj and five others were hired as permanent employees under the new policy, now only six employees install exhibits compared with the eight or nine contingent workers who used to construct each one.
“This last install we definitely could have used more people,” Czekaj said. “That’s going to be a challenge going forward.”
Jaeger and Graduate School of Design spokesperson Travis Dagenais declined to comment.
William S. Davidson, another DCE videographer who transitioned to a permanent role, said he was initially “angry” about the new policy because it came with a cap of 14 hours for less-than-half time workers and he was not immediately hired full time.
He said that due to the lengths of the classes he was assigned to film, he was only able to work 11 hours per week to stay under the cap and thought about leaving.
DCE spokesperson Harry Pierre declined to comment.
Even with the videographers who were hired into part-time positions, Davidson said it has been a “challenge filling all the hours” because the remaining contingent workers are capped at 14 hours.
“The full time people in the department have had to pick up the slack. They’re doing more shoots than they did in the past, which was another thing I think that the union didn't foresee happening,” Davidson said. “The idea of the contract was to encourage Harvard to create more union positions, but I don't know if the money is there to do a lot of that."

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that contingent workers serving as videographers are capped at 11 hours of work per week. In fact, the cap is 14 hours per week though scheduling issues often prevents videographers from working more than 11 hours.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that internal research last year revealed that roughly 300 temporary and part-time workers at Harvard worked “excessive” hours without overtime pay. In fact, the research showed that the workers did not receive the benefits they were owed as a result of their extra work.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the new policy requires Harvard to provide staff-level compensation and benefits for some contingent workers. In fact, the new policy limits the timeframe during which they can be employed.

Resident Flyby seniors and seasoned Harvard-Yale attendees Stuti and Lydia mom the heck out of you with these tips for The Game. tl;dr: Charge your phone, wear layers.
Share your location with your blockmates/best friends if you don’t have it shared already (which is a good safety measure for when you’re in Cambridge too!). Do it now before you forget! Service is often spotty at H-Y because of saturated cell towers and because The Game is played in the literal woods of Connecticut.
Sign in to eduroam WiFi NOW so you’ll have some form of service at The Game (see #1).
Another necessary technology hack: Bring a portable charger. You need phone power from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at least on that Saturday, and you don’t need it dying right when you need to contact your Yale residential college to let you in for all your belongings.
Dress for the cold! While you may feel like certain drinks you may be consuming will shield you from the cold, your body is still totally capable of getting hypothermia. That means gloves (bonus points if they’re touch-screen gloves), hats, scarves, and multiple layers.
Do wear your Harvard sweater if you invested in one. (Note: The H sweater should be one of many layers, and not your only layer). Seriously, we’ve rarely worn our Harvard sweaters. The H sweater I was so pressured into getting by Harvard Student Agencies’ adorable photoshoots is rounding out to a $20-per-wear purchase, which is still highly regrettable, but better than a $30-per-wear purchase?
While Yale does give us free breakfast, it is basically guaranteed to run out if you wake up too late. In our experience, 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. is the sweet spot for breakfast but cutting it close could be very bad. The last thing you want is to have to wait in line for 40 minutes in a New Haven coffee shop. Actually, no, the last thing you want is to not get anything to eat and then go to The Game on an empty stomach — especially if you’re drinking!
Avoid spending this week and set aside some cash for H-Y shenanigans. Even just 24 hours in New Haven tends to add up in the form of Ubers and food.
The unfortunately named Yale Bowl is not like Harvard Stadium — as in, it’s genuinely far from campus. And not like Quad to River far. You can wait for the (free) buses to shuttle you over, though you might be on your feet in the cold for a while. Alternatively, if you choose to Uber or Lyft, you will hit a point on the trip when the traffic is backed up enough to force you to walk the rest of the way anyway.
There is a McDonald’s at Uber distance from the Bowl. That is all.
Have a couple condoms on you at all times. Can’t hurt, might help.
Definitely go have fun at Toad’s, but get to bed on the earlier end on Friday night to save your real party energy for Saturday. (Expect like a 7 a.m. wake-up!)
Hydrate or diedrate.
Attention, East Coast friends: consider skipping class Monday/Tuesday and go home from New Haven via Amtrak or bus on Saturday if you can. Tickets tend to be way cheaper that weekend than the day before Thanksgiving, and if your family home is closer to New Haven than Boston, it simply makes sense.
Pack a going out outfit for Friday night — your H sweater would make for sweaty club attire.
Bring non-WiFi entertainments for the bus ride down and back. Examples include PDFs of class readings, downloaded Netflix episodes, a sleep-mask and earbuds, or your beverage of choice. Trust us, that drive takes way longer than you’d think.
If the forecast calls for sun, bring shades. Remember, you’ll be outside all day! And you’ll want to shield your eyes from the reflective, pasty butts of Yalies in case they “Saybrook strip” again.
If the forecast calls for rain, don’t worry about an umbrella. It will just get in the way. Embrace the wet, muddy tailgate vibes … just not in white Vans.
Remember to get at least a pic or two with your friends! You’ll need to Instagram of course.
If you’re a freshman and want to use this occasion to remind people you were choosing between Harvard and Yale because you were admitted to both, don’t!
Harvard-Yale is not that deep. Just try to have fun!
