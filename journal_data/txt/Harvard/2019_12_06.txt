After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Something very pecoo-liar is going down in the shadowy realm of stan Twitter, and it has to do with a certain Gucci-sporting ex-boybander’s music video. Some artists enigmatically wipe their Instagram clean in the weeks preceding a release. Others drop surprise albums. But has anybody in the history of album promo ever devised an elaborate alternate reality game (ARG) of a fake island off the Scottish coast, planted standalone social media ads on fans’ Twitter feeds, and let chaos and teenage fans’ FBI sleuthing reign supreme?
Much like many Gen Z sexual awakenings, the answer is “not until Harry Styles.” It all began when poor, unsuspecting Twitter user @TheBrotographer stumbled upon a mysterious ad for a tourist site advertising a fake island called “Eroda.” At first, the linked website seemed to be a commonplace scam, especially given its fairly elementary design (what is that font — Cambria? Georgia? So help me God, is that f-cking Caslon?) and use of stock photos of Nordic landscapes. But upon further investigation, things were much stranger — and sexier — than they appeared to be.
For one, the site’s individual pages are littered with cryptic messages. “Don't mention a pig in the pub,” advises the webpage of the local Fisherman’s Pub, while a listing for privately chartered fishing boats recommends that passengers “wear one peculiar gold earring,” “for extra good luck.” Elsewhere, the site cautions against leaving Eroda “on odd numbered days.” Um, what the hell? On top of that, the site doesn’t even have a means to give it money. Nary a PayPal link or a Venmo username? Pretty ineffectual scam you got there.
Unless it wasn’t a scam at all, as shrewd Harry Styles devotees quickly discovered. The “Attractions” page locates the swine-free pub at the corner of “Cherry Street” and “Golden Way” — tracks three and five, respectively, from Styles’ upcoming release, “Fine Line.” (Admittedly subtler than “Having Sex Avenue” and “Feeling Sad Road,” which would’ve been my picks. I guess there’s a reason I’m not in marketing!) A number of other close readings proliferated — some which are probably reaches, like this weirdly popular hypothesis about the Greek poet Herodas (some of us didn’t take HUM-10) — but ultimately the dead giveaway was track four, “Adore You.” What’s Eroda backwards? Yep, you guessed it. Polish up your tin foil hats, because Eroda is officially Illuminati confirmed, everyone.
Eventually, all became clear on Monday when Styles’ official channel released this explanatory trailer, in which Eroda was revealed to be, indeed, a promotional campaign for “Adore You,” the singer’s new single and music video. In between was some weird guerrilla marketing, in which some poor Columbia Records intern made fake Harry Styles stan accounts to tweet obviously manufactured missives like “Eroda is…” and to pretend to leak some shaky handheld footage of a movie theater ad. One profile’s Twitter bio reads, “I’m just a simple Harry fan... like all of you.” Why is this the most unsettling thing I’ve read all day? The ominous energy of this sentence! The ellipses! That period at the end! No self-respecting digital native punctuates their Twitter bio. It’s psychopathic. If anything, this phrase is more convincing that the profile is actually managed by a very personable serial killer, or perhaps a benevolent axe murderer. Or someone’s mother trying to cyberbully their kid’s enemy on a fake Instagram. How do you do, my fellow kids? This is the least successful catfish of our generation, but go off.
With the allure of a conspiracy in the air, few denizens of the Harry Styles cybersphere are focusing on the actual music video (including this writer, so enjoy the following two-sentence, extremely surface-level reading). The video seems to revolve around a “pecooliar” boy — Harry G.D. Styles himself — with a literally megawatt smile, whose charisma is so intense that it sets umbrellas on fire and even paralyzes the fish. The poster features a stained-glass-like silhouette of Styles in a vaguely Christlike pose, surrounded by more fish. Fish… loaves… Nietzsche was wrong. God is very much alive, and his name is Harry Styles. Step aside, God! There’s a new lord and savior in town. #Blessed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research asserts that Harvard intentionally recruits applications from a large pool of African American students who “effectively have no chance” of admission. The authors speculate that the College does so in order to “downplay the magnitude of race-based preferences.” Despite acknowledging that attracting a diverse applicant pool could promote diverse incoming classes, the study questions whether these recruitment strategies amount to students being sold false promises to serve the school’s interests.
We believe that the College is justified in conducting thorough outreach to African American students. Previous research has shown that a vast majority of low-income high-achievers do not apply to selective colleges. Moreover, many high-potential students may have lower test scores, not because they aren’t deserving of admission, but because of the many flaws of these tests, as well as the fact that potential cannot be narrowly defined by a score. Broad-based recruitment is essential to encouraging these students.
Rather than indulging in speculation that such practice is a cover for the opportunistic manipulation of admissions statistics, we support Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons  ’67’s testimony during the trial for Harvard v. Students for Fair Admissions trial. Lower test-score cutoffs for recruiting African American applicants are warranted because “economic disadvantage” has given them “less of an opportunity, on average at least, to prepare well and to do well on standardized testing.” It seems clear to us that as long as the College is transparent about applications for fee waivers, such that it does not unduly take money from economically disadvantaged students, it should continue its recruitment strategies.
Furthermore, we believe this paper is part of a set of research reports that seeks to discredit Harvard’s admission process as racially discriminatory and subsequently dismantle the practice of affirmative action in higher education spearheaded by SFFA’s legal campaign. As we have opined in the past, holistic admissions captures students with nontraditional interests and academic backgrounds, and these applicants, who do not fall into a standard bucket of successful applicants, contribute to the diversity of our student body. At best, test scores are a product of past performance and circumstance. Harvard should continue to be concerned with future potential. No applicant’s academic success can be entirely encompassed by a test score.
Lastly, and more generally, we are uncertain whether the use of statistical modeling and analysis can provide a sufficiently robust understanding of the admissions process. Undeniably, the aggregation of data surrounding college admissions can reveal implicit biases that are unintended for each applicant and only noticeable when considering a wider group of applicants. These studies, however, consider only the end results of the admissions process — that certain students do not apply to selective colleges, or that Asian American students have lower personal scores — but fail to consider the substantive process behind each applicant’s admission. Admissions are done on a case-by-case basis, considering the contextual factors around each applicants’ background, and studies that merely focus on what the outcome looks like should be taken with a grain of salt, especially when they are used to determine whether the entire process passes the muster of nondiscrimination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a federal judge ruled in October that Harvard doesn’t illegally discriminate against Asian American applicants, I’m once again confronted with the meaning of being Asian American at Harvard, a prestigious institution, and more broadly, the meaning of being Asian American in an educational context. Being immersed in a setting where diversity and inclusion are constant topics of discussion, I have introspectively delved into my personal experience of being Asian American and found that it’s characterized by high levels of stress and anxiety perpetuated by the idea of the “Asian Advantage,” or more accurately a “stereotype threat” that is masked by a phrase with positive valence. Asian Americans have been labeled the “model minority,” a label marked by hidden stereotype threats and microaggressions; this not only undermines the performance of Asian American students, but causes mental health issues and affects long-term performance.
The term stereotype threat is defined as circumstances where “individuals who know of a stereotype associated with a group to which they belong are anxious about confirming the stereotype, and their anxiety causes them to perform below their real abilities.” In the case of Asian Americans, there’s a persistent stereotype that Asian Americans are intelligent, self-disciplined overachievers who are naturally gifted in the sciences and math — or STEM — fields and thus possess an advantage. These perceptions have manifested into the idea that stereotypes imposed on Asian Americans are “stereotype lifts,” or stereotypes that benefit Asian Americans’ performance in learning and academic situations. However, recent research has shown that these “positive” stereotypes held, and even endorsed, by teachers and peers lead to psychological distress and a reluctance to seek help. The high expectations put on Asian Americans can cause Asian American students to “choke” under pressure, and there’s evidence that feelings of threat from stereotypes can undermine academic learning. Therefore, characterizing the stereotype threat against Asian Americans as a stereotype lift does not take into account the various responses that these stereotypes induce on Asian Americans and only serves to perpetuate Asian Americans’ emotional distress from pressure to conform to high expectations and feelings of invalidation in response to everyday putdowns.
Stereotypes also contribute to the presence of microaggressions, or subtle comments and actions that express a prejudiced attitude and are often unintentional or unconscious. The most common microaggressions inflicted on Asian Americans are inaccurate attributions of intelligence and alienation in one’s own land. These microaggressions once again create pressure to succeed academically and negatively affects self-esteem and self-efficacy. Therefore, Asian Americans are subjected to being stereotyped and socially marginalized, which additionally affects their sense of social belonging, or their sense that they have good relationships with others. Negative sense of social belonging, along with negative self-esteem and self-efficacy, is correlated with lower academic performance and poor mental health. The interaction of stereotype threat and microaggressions against Asian Americans only hurts their sense of social-belonging and once again, perpetuates psychological distress and pressure on academic performance.
Critics may argue that the stereotype threat doesn’t really undermine Asian American students’ performance given the statistical data on their educational achievement and household incomes, but that is not necessarily true. An important consideration to account for is that the immigration of Asians to the United States is hyper-selective due to U.S. immigration laws. Many of the Asians entering the U.S. are highly educated and highly skilled. Their children are able to start off at a more favorable starting point due to high socioeconomic status, which has been shown to be a positive indicator of academic performance. Additionally, other outside influences may include Asian cultural norms, which emphasize the importance of education and high motivation to succeed academically, which is commonly shared among children of immigrants due to their parents’ sacrifices. While teachers’ perception and subsequent actions towards Asian American students may cause some Asian Americans to internalize these perceptions and achieve more than they normally would have, the stereotype on Asian Americans is still a double-edged sword with the high cost of mental health issues that plague many Asian Americans who feel pressured and “don’t feel Asian” because they don’t fit the stereotype.
In fact, the stereotype threat affects Asian Americans in the long-term, both professionally and mentally. The “positive stereotypes” bleed into Asian Americans’ post-academic life, where the same stereotypes of being self-disciplined and naturally gifted in STEM fields morph into negative stereotypes of being quiet, uncreative, and lacking social and leadership skills. Ironically, the same stereotype used to explain why Asian Americans achieve higher educational outcomes is the same reason that there’s a large disparity in Asian Americans and white Americans’ occupational achievement and leadership positions in the labor market; despite making up a large percentage of the professional workforce, Asian Americans do not obtain executive positions at the same rate. Additionally, the same distress that Asian Americans feel about confirming the stereotype of academic excellence in educational contexts carries over to the workforce where their colleagues perceive them to have traits that society deems negative, binding Asian Americans to the bamboo ceiling. The first step in dismantling the bamboo ceiling is breaking the ideas of the “model minority,” “Asian Advantage,” and “stereotype lift;” that starts with unveiling the hard truths behind those seemingly optimistic terms.
As Asian American students who have constantly experienced the notions behind the label of the “model minority” and will continue into the workforce barred by the bamboo ceiling, it is important for us to inform others about the challenges we face and not accept the stereotypes that are placed on us, including the stereotype of being shy and complacent. As students who will possibly continue on into educational fields or policy making, it is important for us to constantly challenge these notions to bring awareness to a large group of the population that is constantly overlooked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Critics will say that there is no power in protesting. They will walk by a rally or strike and scoff, remaining unfeeling even as crowds of students and alumni take to the football field to call divestment in the name of climate change. They like to write it all off as inconveniences when the Ethnic Studies Coalition stages a sit-down for faculty denied tenure, or when the Harvard Graduate Student Union vote to go on strike for a better contract.
But even these cynics have to recognize the power behind these actions: how a cause can be enough for hundreds and thousands of people to come together, united because the only option is to take a stand, especially when it is hard.
I felt this same power when I attended the San Francisco Never Again Action protest this past July. Though I was only interning in the area for the summer and did not know anyone in the crowd, I found myself amongst company that was comforting, strangers who felt familiar through the convictions we all shared. See, in our shared goal of calling out the injustice of the “concentration camps” for detained migrants at the border, I did not have to know these people in order to trust their commitment to the cause we all stood behind — their decision to stand with me was enough in that moment.
In the closing of the protest, one of the organizers took to the stage with the microphone and looked at all of us for a long moment. His voice was steady as he told us some wise words a mentor had once shared with him: “Think deeply: What kind of ancestor do you want to be?”
I’ve thought a lot about this question since hearing it. The concept of ancestors is always something that I had not given much attention to before college: The circle of my family has always been confined to my parents and siblings. Though the rest of my extended relatives live an ocean away, the distance has always left me feeling detached from the motherland. It is not a surprise then that my ancestral ties feel even fainter, but the absence feels heavy for some reason — especially with the recent loss of my final grandparent.
To some respect, we all crave a desire to know where we came from and who was here before us. It’s why historians scour through archives and scientists work out countless theories. I am not immune to this pull, having always envied people who are able to trace back their family lineages, easily connecting the dots from great-grandparent, to second-aunt, to third cousin twice removed — mapping out their history from generation to generation. With the death of my grandparents, I was suddenly struck with a sensation of feeling unmoored by yet another generation of people who once shared my blood. The disconnect is like being alone at sea, knowing that there were others before you but not having access to their charts and maps in the pursuit of your own journey.
So I have chosen my own ancestors. I read through the biographies of activists like Malcolm X, who worked tirelessly to organize and advocate during the civil rights era. I turn to people like Rosalind Franklin, English chemist and X-ray crystallographer specialist, whose work was key in determining the structure of the DNA molecule. I find inspiration with figures like Lalla Fatma N’Soumer, a woman who rallied her indigenous people against the French invasion in Algeria. I follow in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, a leader who was driven out of his own community for preaching for justice and change, unfaltering in his faith even when it would have been so much easier to just quit.
And yet, we learn about them today because they chose to take that stand, whether in choosing a career that women were encouraged against, or facing a stronger opposition that tried to intimidate them to surrender. These ancestors go down as having been on the right side of history.
In the age of today, we have a choice in how we will join the ranks of tomorrow — as members of an imperfect world, where people are denied rights in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, you and I are tasked with the responsibility to protest. As our ancestors have done before us, we must demand change for every instance of injustice, establishing a legacy that teach our future generation to accept nothing but what is right. Because even when we are forgotten, the record of our deeds and the choices we made will serve as a testament to the people we were and the causes we fought for. Will that person be someone who chose to be narrow minded and selfish? Someone who turned a blind eye to atrocities like the Uighur re-education camps and mindless exploitation of immigrant laborers?
It is the people who don’t know how to dream or how to fight, who choose to criticize and condescend because they are the easier options, asserting that no real change will come about because they fear the process of change will be hard — it will be, but at the promise of something so much better. The question then remains: Will you be remembered for being on the wrong side of history?

The bathroom in Cambridge Rindge and Latin School had been locked for days — marked off with red tape, closed for maintenance. But this was not a routine cleaning. Rather, they were scrubbing away evidence of hate — a swastika had been spray-painted on the bathroom wall.
This 2016 incident was the first time CRLS graduate Noah Y. Epstein ’21 remembers a hate symbol appearing on the walls of his school, the only public high school in Cambridge. It would not be the last.
In a sense, this became a routine sort of maintenance. During his senior year, from fall 2016 to spring 2017, Epstein recalls a double ‘H’ — shorthand for a Nazi slogan — appearing on a bathroom wall and not long later a quote from the Confederate Manifesto.
On Oct. 28, the Cambridge City Council moved to address hate crimes like these. The body voted unanimously to pass an ordinance “to determine Cambridge’s threat level from hate crimes and other related events” and empowered City Manager Louis A. DePasquale to decide on an appropriate response.
The ordinance’s preamble explains that “counts of hate crimes, hate speech, and other related events have been on the rise in recent years,” and suggests that “Cambridge is not immune to these incidents as physical attacks, vandalism and damage to property, and hate speech have been documented or reported in some fashion in recent month, including events in the Cambridge Public School System.”
Reports of hate crimes in Cambridge spiked to 25 in 2016 — Epstein’s senior year, which coincided with the election of President Donald Trump. In 2017, only nine were reported, but in 2018, that number rose to 16 — a 78 percent increase from the year prior and 23 percent above the 10-year average of 13.
The ordinance calls on DePasquale to consult with the school department, city officials, and groups like the Urban Area Security Initiative and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Any provisions beyond this remain unclear — the details are left up to the City Manager and the outside groups.
DePasquale and City Council members did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
With the passage of the ordinance, the Cambridge City Council has moved to formally assess and respond to hate crimes, perhaps marking a breaking point: No longer can the burden of addressing the incidents rest solely on student affinity groups and schools; instead, the onus has shifted to the municipal government.
Groups including school officials and the police department view the racist vandalism in Cambridge Public Schools as one-off incidents that do not represent CRLS or Cambridge as a community. Many students, however, identify a persistent — if less overt — current of racism at CRLS, causing them to wonder if the vandalism incidents ought to be written off as mere irregularities. As the municipal government positions itself to address the rising prevalence of hate crimes, the question remains: Does Cambridge have a hate crime problem?
***
Ayesha M. Wilson is wearing a sweatshirt that reads “Just a kid from Cambridge” and a residual smile — she has just run into a former student in line for coffee. Wilson won a seat in the Cambridge School Committee in the municipal elections held on Nov. 5 and graduated from CRLS in 2000. “When these acts happen,” she says, referring to the graffiti incidents at her alma mater, “we don’t create these spaces. Young people and staff kind of have to create those spaces for themselves.”
After the first swastika appeared during Epstein’s senior year, the Jewish Heritage Club organized a series of forums to educate students about acts of hate and bias. Epstein says the first meetings were widely attended and successful. But soon, the student leaders graduated, and the momentum died down. No permanent alternative has taken its place.
But for Wilson, the onus to educate in the wake of the incidents, to “create spaces” of healing and solidarity, ought to have always fallen on the adults in the school — not its students. “It is our responsibility as educators to make sure that we're building it into our curriculum,” she says.
“I’ve got to keep going back to education — it has to be that,” she insists. “Our people have to be more educated around the different diverse communities that are within our city.”
The City Council order reflects a frustration — shared by Wilson and others — that the school district has not done enough, says Will H. MacArthur ’20, a former Crimson columnist who graduated from CRLS in 2016 and ran for School Committee in 2017.
Epstein is hopeful about the ordinance. Perhaps the municipal government will assume more responsibility, shifting the burden away from students.
“I think that it’s a much stronger step,” Epstein says. “When swastikas showed up the first time around, there was a School Committee resolution that said, basically, ‘we condemn hate and strive to build a stronger community,’” he continues. “There was no action item.”
***
In many ways, Cambridge is the epitome of a progressive city, and the CRLS student body reflects that. Epstein remarks, “There’s a reason that it’s called the People’s Republic of Cambridge.”
But in a place as liberal as Cambridge, Wilson wonders how the recurrence of such attacks can be explained — and what that contradiction might say about the city. “The challenges that are faced by our communities doesn’t match the fact that we’re that liberal or that progressive.”
Addressing that contradiction, however, Pete Simi, a professor at Chapman College who studies extremism and white supremacy in America, suggests that the problem of hate crimes “doesn’t understand geographic boundaries.” “It doesn’t understand the political orientation of the area,” he says, “and in some ways, a liberal area becomes a target.”
Some see hate crimes as anomalies in Cambridge, gashes in a predominantly blue city. Others think they might say something about Cambridge itself.
Deputy Superintendent Rob Lowe of the Cambridge Police Department believes the problem is not “systemic.” The attacks, he posits, are not endemic to the Cambridge community. “A lot of these are often one-off incidents, if that makes sense. We’re not typically seeing patterns.”
As Wilson argues, “As progressive as Cambridge is and as liberal and Cambridge is, we need to also think about every individual’s ownership.” She wonders how each resident’s biases “tie into how we create a city that is like this.” A city is formed by the people who live there — their prejudices, along with everything else, are inextricable from the city itself.
CRLS has also had trouble reconciling evidence of bigotry with their liberal community values. After each incident, the school sends out an email. The messages condemn hate and reassure students — MacArthur felt that one idea persisted: ‘This is not who we are as a community.’
“If you keep saying that, even as incidents of hate keep happening, I think it can kind of impede having a serious, community-wide investigation of why this keeps happening,” Macarthur explains. “Maybe right now, this is who some people in our community think we are.”
Tal T. SebellShavit, a physics and astronomy teacher at CRLS, does not believe these incidents represent the school: “It doesn't mean that it’s a bad community,” he says. “It means that a bad thing happened in a in a good community.”
SebellShavit does, however, understand a tension between viewing the graffiti as isolated incidents and a broader reckoning with racism at CRLS. “I think that that’s a little bit of an unpopular opinion, especially in a district that is working on microaggressions, on having all students feel safe.”
CRLS has faced controversy over other instances of racism in the past few years. For example, in February, a white School Committee member used the n-word in a high school classroom. In 2017, the Black Student Union released a series of videos in which mainly students of color recounted instances of microaggressions and discrimination they had encountered from teachers and peers. Along with the vandalism, a less visible, systematic racism persists at the school.
CRLS administrators did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“I have no idea what the district is trying to do to combat this,” SebellShavit says of hate graffiti. While the district has acknowledged microaggressions, he is unsure about their operations regarding hate crimes. He continues, “No one’s doing anything about this. And if they are, they’re doing it all under the water.”
Though the School Committee may have previously fallen short, Wilson hopes to turn that around. “I want to make sure,” she explains, “that we’re coming together and just having a safe space, where you could just share any challenge that you’ve had in our district, whether that is specific hate crimes, microaggressions, or macroaggressions.”
“Some of these incidents do fit the definition of hate crimes,” MacArthur says, “but even the ones that don’t are part of a broader climate in the school I think it should be considered the district’s responsibility to help address.”
The City Council ordinance addresses only criminal acts — and gives City Manager DePasquale broad autonomy to work with outside groups on the problem. How DePasquale will proceed remains to be seen.

Open a bag of GoodieKrunch and you’ll find flaky clusters of brittle, baked coconut goodness. A fresh, almost floral aroma wafts out of the bag. An unorthodox, unapologetic upgrade on the classic cereal-and-granola-schtick, each of GoodieKrunch’s crumbs holds the seed of a remarkable story.
GoodieKrunch is the brainchild of Haverhill, Mass. resident HamdAllah M. Olona. It’s a recent arrival to the Farmers’ Market at Harvard, held every Tuesday in the Science Center Plaza during the fall.
Across a span of 40 years and countless miles, Olona carried the GoodieKrunch recipe from Nigeria to her dorm room’s kitchen in England, and in 2018, the recipe arrived at Massachusetts farmers’ markets. What started as her grandmother’s sweet treat is now Olona’s hope that soon — within the next five years — she’ll sell her product in stores across the nation.
What’s now known as GoodieKrunch began as “coconut candy,” the phrase Olona’s grandmother would shout to Olona and her 17 siblings to tempt them home. Olona grew up in her chieftain father’s compound, and some of her fondest memories center around sharing the “candy” with her grandmother.
As a child, Olona’s parents made sure the entrepreneurial spirit ran “in [her] blood.” Her father ran two Nigerian Peugeot branches, and her mother served as the regional Coca-Cola distributor.
“I got involved in their businesses at a young age. I learned French because I started helping my dad with his business so much. I learned it to be my dad’s translator,” Olona recalls. (Olona would quietly reveal later that in addition to French and English, she also speaks Yoruba and a bit of Arabic. Her son, quiet throughout the rest of the interview, perked up in response to this admission and looked at his mother with pride.)
“Navigating your business, logistics and all that, I’ve known it since I was little,” Olona says. “Starting GoodieKrunch was like a piece of cake for me.”
But before “coconut candy” would become “GoodieKrunch,” Olona’s father sent her to a private school and university in Cambridge, England, where she studied finance and accounting. While abroad, Olona would bake her grandma’s “coconut candy” for herself and guests. She grew accustomed to dismissing thankful guests’ suggestions to sell her “candy” on the market.
Upon graduating university, Olona moved to Canada and met her husband, following him to Cambridge where they would start a family. While raising her four children, Olona worked for CitiGroup, Cambridge pharmaceutical companies, Philips Electronics, and finally, at National Grid, an electricity and gas provider. And she continued making her trademark family coconut candy on the side.
That is, until Olona realized that her grandmother’s candy could give people with gluten intolerance an alternative snack option. Upon realizing that the treat could fill a practical void in the food market, Olona gave in to her friends’ pleas and trademarked the name “GoodieKrunch” in 2017. In 2018, she began selling GoodieKrunch at two Somerville farmers’ markets on Saturdays.
On top of working at National Grid and raising four children, Olona began to rent a commercial kitchen and hired one assistant chef. The pair would bake GoodieKrunch in any spare time they could catch during the week.
This spring proved fateful for GoodieKrunch. Olona applied to the annual competition held by the Massachusetts-based nonprofit “Entrepreneurship for All,” or “EforAll.”
Comparing the program to the television phenomenon “Shark Tank,” Olana explains, “E for All is the tank without the shark… They mentor you, they teach you, they give you one or two mentors who can guide you through the process of being an entrepreneur, and in addition, you win money.”
Olona won the top prize — $3,000 and three months of training.
Just one month later, Olona lost her job at National Grid along with roughly 100 others. Olona, however, views the layoff as “a blessing in disguise.”
Since last spring, Olona has made expanding GoodieKrunch her priority. She worked to craft new flavors — ranging from chocolate, peanut butter, and flaxseed to a new keto-fruit option — and to expand her product’s reach across Massachusetts. With the help of four weekend staff members, Olona now regularly sells at seven farmers’ markets in the Greater Boston Area.
Now, Olona is eyeing the retail market, hoping to expandexpanding into local grocery stores and negotiating deals with the likes of Stop & Shop, Whole Foods, and Market Basket. GoodieKrunch is growing, and Olona already has plans to expand even further.
“We’re online as well,” Olona says. Over the course of our conversationOlona at first seems reluctant to admit her ambition. But after a few attempts to pierce her quiet demeanor, the salesperson “in her blood” emerges: “In five years I could see GoodieKrunch going national, definitely.”
A few obstacles still stand in the way of Olona’s vision. For starters, she doesn’t own a dedicated kitchen yet.
“Currently I’m renting my commercial kitchen,” Olona sai. “I’m planning to actually purchase my own stand-alone building to manufacture GoodieKrunch there and to have a storefront where people can buy GoodieKrunch.”
And, Olona is currently “doing the math” to determine whether retail or food services will be the more profitable avenue for GoodieKrunch’s expansion. Pursuing food services — vending machines, hotels, and university dining halls, for example — could be more profitable than striking a deal with a region-wide grocery store.
No matter what, Olona stresses that “the most important thing is that GoodieKrunch tastes good. If it doesn’t taste good, it won’t sell. Why jeopardize the taste for cost-effectiveness?”
As our interview comes to an end, Olona brings the conversation back to her grandmother and her village in Nigeria. GoodieKrunch, she argues, is more than a family recipe carried across oceans — it’s a reflection of an entire town’s sensibility.
“In my country, the coconut is like the tree of life. Coconut oil, water, meat. You can go on and on about coconut,” Olona says. “Back home in Africa when a coconut tree dies, we chop the fronds off, take off the leaves, leaving only the stalk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Computer scientist Francine Berman discussed the need for data policy that promotes the public good and protects consumer security at the Radcliffe Institute’s Knafel Center Wednesday evening.
Berman, who is a Radcliffe fellow, gave her talk, entitled “Civilizing the Internet of Things,” as part of the Institute’s Fellow’s Presentation Series. A computer science professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, her research has focused on cyberinfrastructure — advanced technological systems — and the responsible use of data.
She began her discussion by describing the unprecedented amount of technology in use around the world.
“Today, there are many more connected devices than there are humans on earth,” she said. “If we think about it, we’re really talking about this connected world, what it is, and where we’re headed.”
Berman’s current work focuses on the social and environmental impact of this digitally connected world, which she calls the “Internet of Things.”
“[The IoT is[ a deeply interconnected set of sensors and cameras and smart systems and all kinds of devices and other technologies that are connected to one another, that share and exchange data, that work together to make decisions, and that often operate autonomously in the background, with or without you knowing it,” Berman said. "[It] has the promise of technology that will really enhance our environment."
Berman, however, noted that there are also many risks associated with the IoT, citing security problems with baby monitors, self-driving car crashes, and Amazon’s Alexa sharing private conversations.
“The question becomes, is the IoT a future utopia or a future dystopia?,” Berman said. “It’s up to us as we develop and nurture the IoT that we’ll be seeing in the future.”
In her talk, Berman pointed to policy, regulation, and civic involvement as potential solutions to the more dangerous aspects of the IoT.
“The government can help in lots of different ways,” she said. “We have to know what rights we can expect in the Internet of Things. We have to know what kind of data protections we have.
“We need an IoT equivalent of OSHA to keep us safe,” she added. “We need guidelines for ethical development. We need clarity on who’s responsible and who’s liable when things go wrong.”
Ethan Cowan, a master’s student at the Harvard Extension School, said he found the connection between technology and policy important.
“The technology has far outpaced the public policy and political knowledge and I don’t think that we have — not just in the U.S., but as a species — come to terms with the radical effects of the amount of data that we’re generating and what it can tell us about ourselves and about individuals,” Cowan said.
Connecticut high school student Lauren C. Uhl also said that information about the IoT is missing from political discourse.
“We don’t really hear politicians talk about this — aside from Andrew Yang — you don’t get a lot of context into politicians and their views,” she said.
Yang, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has proposed the idea of giving individuals property rights to their data.
Berman said that voters should take a close look at candidates’ platforms and views on technology in order to remedy this problem and facilitate discussion about an ethical IoT that promotes the public good.
“The head of the country has an enormous responsibility to set the tone for where the U.S. is going to be in terms of information technology,” Berman said. “It’s important to know that about your candidate, and to ask your candidate that question.”

Amid disagreement over fossil fuel divestment among professors at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III urged both sides to respect each other in an interview Thursday.
Students, faculty, and alumni at Harvard have repeatedly called on the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry — an action University President Lawrence S. Bacow and his predecessors have resisted on the grounds that Harvard should not use its endowment for political purposes.
Doyle said he applauds the efforts of student activists and believes climate change is “the existential threat of our lifetime” but urged that conversations on divestment should take place “at the right time and with the right tone.”
“In any conversation, both sides have to respect each other,” Doyle said. “It needs to be a discourse and not...a shouting match from one side with no intent to hear the other side.”
Doyle said that given his limited knowledge of investment strategy, he cannot speak on how the University should invest its endowment but hopes to promote awareness of climate change through teaching and research instead.
“[Teaching and research are] not the only thing we need to do, and I know it falls short of solving the problem, but it’s things that I have direct agency as dean,” he said.
SEAS faculty members have offered contrasting perspectives on whether the University should divest from fossil fuels.
More than 390 faculty — spanning multiple schools within the University — have signed onto a petition by Harvard Faculty for Divestment. At least a dozen professors listed their affiliation as SEAS.
Environmental Science and Engineering assistant professor Marianna K. Linz ’11 wrote in an email that she “strongly believe[s]” the University should divest from the industry.
“Personally, I hate that they funded efforts to discredit my entire discipline,” she wrote. “More importantly, they knew about the warming of the planet and chose and continue to choose present profit over future risk.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Engineering Sciences and Geophysics professor James R. Rice said his opinion on the issue of divestment is “mixed.”
He said he favors a gradual replacement of fossil fuels with more sustainable forms of energy and believes “we’d be in trouble” if the University immediately divested from all activities involving fossil fuels.
“I think that’s a battle that ought to be fought at the ballot box in terms of the politicians we elect and what we expect of them, rather than telling the University to divest,” Rice said.
Rice added that divestment is further complicated by the fact that investment returns enable the University to have “students, faculty, decent facilities, and everything else.”
“I would prefer the University to be very selective about who it invests in, but I can’t oppose it, having some priority in investing in investments which make returns to the University,” he said.
Like Rice, Atmospheric and Environmental Science professor Steven C. Wofsy said he was initially skeptical that divestment from fossil fuels represents the best way to address environmental concerns. He said he later changed his mind, after observing fossil fuel companies’ active opposition to “anything that has to do with the environment.”
“I’ve come down on the notion that something is ethically flawed to participate in profiting from the fossil fuel industry, writ large, at the current time,” he said.
Wofsy added that while he previously prioritized the nuances of fossil fuel divestment — in particular, where to draw the line — he now believes that the University can resolve the complexity at a later time, after it has divested.
“Why can’t you pursue your core mission with more vigor and also divest?” Wolfsy said.

As Harvard prepares to open the new Allston campus in fall 2020, the Committee on Student Life discussed challenges associated with the move — including transportation and dining options — at its last meeting of the semester Thursday.
The CSL — an advisory panel that includes Harvard administrators, faculty deans, house committee chairs, and Undergraduate Council representatives — will share these concerns with the committee supervising the Allston campus, UC President and CSL member Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said in an interview Thursday. Members of the Allston committee will attend the next CSL meeting in February so that the two bodies can work together to examine potential solutions, according to Palaniappan.
“Not unexpectedly, issues such as food, transportation, class schedule, and social and study spaces came up in the Committee on Student Life,” said Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair in an interview Thursday.
Of these issues, Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean Anne Harrington ’82 said she is particularly concerned about transportation between the Quad and the new SEAS campus, because the Quad houses are farther from Allston than the river houses.
“Transportation is a slightly different kind of problem than the problem of dining and study spaces, because it's a problem that can't be solved completely by Harvard alone,” Harrington said. “It will require negotiating with the City of Cambridge. It will require figuring out bus routes, managing the flow of traffic of just other Cambridge citizens.”
Currier House Faculty Dean Sylvia I. Barrett also said she thinks that transportation from the Quad to Allston might frustrate students.
“It really impacts the sense of community that we have in the Quad if people are not happy because of this major issue,” Barrett said. “And it's not too late to come up with a reasonable solution.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has made significant investments in transportation infrastructure to support the Allston project.
“New infrastructure including upgraded bike and pedestrian amenities, entirely new streets, mobility hubs, shuttle stops, wayfinding and green spaces are being built to support the building’s operation,” O’Rourke wrote. “Additionally, shuttle service has been expanded to serve Allston in recent years and will be further expanded and increased as the building nears completion.”
Harrington proposed several measures aimed at remedying the transportation problem, including building a new campus bridge across the river to Allston with “an express bus lane.” She also suggested creating a carbon-neutral subway line under the river. Harrington said she thinks administrators and students can work together to make the new campus accessible to students from all residential houses.
“It doesn't matter how wonderful Allston is going to be — and it is likely going to be wonderful — if people can't get there,” Harrington said.
UC Representative and CSL member Alexa C. Jordan ’22 said she thinks Allston will be an “amazing resource for students,” and that the UC might be able to facilitate alternate modes of transportation. She pointed to the UC’s current bike subsidy program as an example.
“One thing from the UC standpoint that I've been thinking about a lot is the potential for possible ride sharing, bike sharing options,” Jordan said. “So is there a way in which the UC can help subsidize scooters or bikes?”
Palaniappan said that though the proposed transportation options seem “unclear” at the moment, she believes that the CSL’s upcoming meeting with the Allston committee in February will provide some answers.
The UC can also serve as a forum for representing the undergraduate population’s needs to the administration, according to Palaniappan.
“I can see the UC as being an important body in relaying what those student concerns are once the Allston campus does open,” Palaniappan said.

In the wake of its record-breaking capital campaign that wrapped up last year, Harvard has focused its fundraising on student financial aid, securing graduate fellowships, and continuing development in Allston, University Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee said in an interview Wednesday.
Student financial aid is currently one of the University’s top fundraising priorities, Lee said. During the $9.6 billion capital campaign that ended in June 2018, Harvard struggled to meet its financial aid goal as quickly as other targets. Financial aid is not fully endowed and an economic downturn could lead to increased need from students and families.
“Across the University, student financial aid, support of our students, is going to remain critical,” Lee said. “There are two things that define, that will sustain excellence at Harvard, and that's continuing to attract the very best students and to attract the very best faculty.”
"These will remain among the highest priorities in any post-campaign environment,” he added.
Though Lee is in charge of Harvard’s fundraising, he is not in charge of determining the University’s fundraising priorities. Rather, the fundraising is directed by goals “articulated by the academic leaders of the institution,” according to Lee.
Another such goal is securing funding for additional graduate fellowships, according to Lee.
“I've actually, in my 33 years of doing this, I really rarely see the level of consensus and unanimity around the fundraising objectives,” Lee said. “There seems to be virtually unanimous consent that securing additional resources for graduate fellowships should be considered among Harvard University's highest priorities going forward post campaign.”
Harvard’s recent expansion into Allston has also necessitated funding focused on that area. The new campus will house the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, an Enterprise Research Campus, and the American Repertory Theater. Identifying potential donors who can help further support the “Allston dream” is a high priority, according to Lee.
“We're continuing to think creatively about how we might approach other opportunities, but I can tell you that identifying those individuals who share a passion for achieving this goal in Allston is a high priority,” Lee said. “We continue to work on articulating a case for support there as well.”
In addition to fundraising, Lee has focused on “sustaining a momentum” following the capital campaign. He assumed his position in November last year, shortly after the campaign concluded.
“Our challenge and our opportunity is to engage our constituents, our alumni, and our donors in helping us to think about how we take this to the next level,” Lee said. “So we spend a lot of time engaging in discussion with our leaders within the institution about the very best strategies to sustain levels of engagement that will lead to continued fundraising success.”
Despite the possibility of an economic downturn and University-wide recession planning, Lee said there is “reason to hope” that Harvard’s fundraising would still “fare reasonably well.”
“From the fundraising perspective, I've had conversations with some of our some of our alumni,” Lee said. “And I have reason to believe that they would stick with Harvard, and they would continue to be generous to Harvard, despite economic downturns.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates crowded the steps of Widener Library Thursday to protest the decision to deny Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña tenure and demand an ethnic studies program.
The University informed García Peña — who specializes in Latinx studies — of the tenure decision Nov. 27. Since then, students and faculty across the University have protested the verdict by penning letters to top Harvard administrators, staging a sit-in at University Hall, and interrupting a faculty meeting.
Ethnic studies advocates have called on Harvard to reverse García Peña’s tenure decision; publicly release correspondence about that decision between Bacow, Gay, and Romance Languages and Literatures department chair Mariano Siskind; and open an investigation into García Peña’s case for “procedural errors, prejudice, and discrimination,” according to a letter they circulated.
García Peña did not respond to a request for comment on her tenure case.
During the rally, Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition member Laura S. Veira-Ramirez ’20, a former Crimson editor, told protesters that Thursday was the last day of García Peña’s course SPANSH 126: “Performing Latinidad.” She said García Peña’s mentorship inspired many of her students’ advocacy for a formalized ethnic studies program at Harvard, a demand with an almost 50-year-long history.
“Beyond Professor García Peña, we’re fighting for an ethnic studies department,” Veira-Ramirez said.
Activists have linked García Peña’s tenure decision to the broader fight for an ethnic studies program. García Peña helped establish the ethnic studies track in History and Literature and is currently serving on a search committee for faculty who specialize in Ethnic Studies.
Ethnic Studies Coalition member Rosa L. Vazquez ’20 said at the rally that the University has touted the diversity of its students without supporting them.
“We’re fighting for our histories to be taught in these classrooms that preach diversity but don’t actually teach us anything,” Vasquez said. “Harvard loves to put our faces on admissions pamphlets but won’t actually teach our histories or our culture.”
The Ethnic Studies Coalition contends that administrators’ responses to the issue have been unsatisfactory. University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay responded to students’ demands in two separate emails Wednesday night, according to an open letter posted by the group on Medium.
Bacow’s email stated that he could not publicly offer an explanation about García Peña’s tenure denial because the tenure review process is confidential, the letter states.
In a separate email, Gay wrote that she supports Ethnic Studies, according to the letter. She also wrote that FAS has launched a cluster hire of three to four faculty members who specialize in Asian American, Muslim American, and Latinx studies.
During her speech at the rally, Ramirez called the emails from Bacow and Gay “inadequate” and accused Bacow of hiding behind bureaucratic “red tape.”
“In our response, we demanded that they have a comittee to review any discrimination that could have taken place and likely took place in this tenure process,” she said. “We must acknowledge that these people need to be held accountable.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven both declined to comment on the tenure decision regarding García Peña. They also declined to comment on Bacow’s and Gay’s emails.
In addition to García Peña, at least three other professors who specialize in race or religion have been denied tenure or left the University to take a job elsewhere. In November 2018, the University denied tenure to Harvard Graduate School of Education associate professor Natasha K. Warikoo; History assistant professor Genevieve A. Clutario accepted a position at Wellesley College soon after; and Science and Religion associate professor Ahmed Ragab was denied tenure at Harvard Divinity School last spring.
Roughly 100 Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers picketers on strike Thursday joined the ethnic studies rally in a show of support.
HGSU-UAW, which represents approximately 5,000 student teaching staff and graduate research assistants across the University, has been on strike since Tuesday. Members have given up their teaching and research responsibilities until the union negotiates a contract with the University. Though the two parties have reached 12 tentative agreements, they remain at odds on key issues including compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
During the ethnic studies rally, HGSU-UAW organizer Justin Bloesch said the union’s student workers support the protesters’ fight for ethnic studies at Harvard, connecting the two groups’ missions.
“This has been a fight for decades on campuses across the country. Harvard is decades behind,” he said. “The fight for economic justice isn’t the same fight without racial justice.”
“Whether it’s ethnic studies or grievance procedures to address discrimination or harassment or adequate mental health care, Harvard is not doing enough to make this place an equitable campus,” he added.

Former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd discussed the current state of U.S.-China relations and the possibility of future conflict between the two countries at the JFK, Jr. Forum Thursday night.
The discussion — which centered around “The Avoidable War,” a book of major speeches delivered by Rudd in 2018 — was moderated by Graham T. Allison, a government professor at the Kennedy School, and Jane Perlez, a New York Times correspondent who covers Chinese foreign policy.
Rudd, who currently serves as the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, began the talk by sharing details about his book. He explained that, per the title, he believes that military conflict between the two superpowers can be avoided.
“War might be seen by some as inevitable — I don’t have that view,” Rudd said. “It might be seen by some as probable — I don’t actually share that view, either. But I do think that it is possible, through mutual mismanagement and a very difficult decade ahead.”
Rudd also explained the principle behind his book, a concept he calls “managed strategic competition.” He noted that there are currently two prevailing schools of thought on the state of U.S.-China relations: one that emphasizes American economic dominance, and one that advocates for Chinese political supremacy.
“What I’ve tried to do is identify a third way, which is, ‘How could these two mature states, who between them actually have much historical wisdom, how can they navigate a peaceful but competitive future between them?’” Rudd said.
Perlez said she believes a total American or Chinese victory is improbable, and asked Rudd about his view on the details of negotiations between the U.S. and China about power struggles in the Indo-Pacific region. In response, Rudd said that he believed the current state of affairs was likely to continue into the future.
“There are plenty of things that can go wrong in the China model, but it’s prudent for everyone to assume that this model, which has been around for 40 years or so, is going to bumble on, and on balance, continue to work, to a greater or lesser degree,” he said.
Several forum attendees said that Rudd’s ideas piqued their interest.
Noriyuki Shikata — who served as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Japan in China and currently serves as an associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs — said he was interested in Rudd’s idea of managed strategic competition.
“I don't have a lot of difficulties in accepting this concept, but still, I guess he’s working on this concept in this book,” Shikata said.
“And today, I guess, you know, time is so limited, that we didn't hear very much about the content of this idea, so I’m really looking forward to the reading,” he added.
Benjamin B. Bolger, an alum of the Graduate School of Design, said he found Rudd to be a “profound leader” with “penetrating insights and deep analysis.”
“He spoke to the current dynamic, where the current leader of China may have plans to be in office for a considerable time,” Bolger said. “And it'll be very interesting to see how the U.S. and Australia deal with that evolving dynamic of internal power in China, and how it affects foreign policy both for America and Australia.”

A car crashed near one of Harvard’s freshman dorms early Thursday morning, leaving the driver dead and the one passenger in critical condition, according to the Cambridge Police Department.
Before 4 a.m., the driver veered off of Massachusetts Avenue and plowed into a gate and a tree next to Wigglesworth Hall, a dorm in Harvard Yard.
Officers from CPD, the Harvard University Police Department, and Massachusetts State Police responded to the scene of the accident. Police closed the intersection between Massachusetts Avenue and Bow Street to traffic until approximately 7:15 a.m.
First responders transported the driver and passenger — both males who were neither affiliated with the University nor Cambridge residents — to local hospitals, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. The driver was later pronounced dead and the passenger received treatment for serious injuries.
The cause of the crash remains under investigation by CPD, the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, and the State Police, according to a citywide alert sent Thursday morning.
Warnick said he believes that the accident underscores the need for traffic regulations to ensure safety in the Square. He cited the Cambridge City Government’s Vision Zero effort, which aims to reduce the speed limit on most Cambridge streets.
“Reducing driving speeds from 25 mph to 20 mph will help make Cambridge safer for people of all ages and abilities walking, biking, and driving on our streets, while at the same time potentially having a significant outcome in the event of a crash,” Warnick wrote.

A team of Harvard chemists has succeeded in performing the coldest chemical reaction to ever occur, according to a Nov. 29 paper they published in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science.
Chemistry and Chemical Biology professor Kang-Kuen Ni leads the team, which has been working on this ultracold chemical process for four years.
The team created a technique using lasers that allowed them to set the reaction temperature just a few millionths of a Kelvin above absolute zero — the lowest physically possible temperature. They used the reaction to study the process by which the chemical reactants broke down.
Ming-Guang Hu, a postdoctoral researcher in Ni’s lab, said the team wanted to observe the effects of the ultracold technique on a chemical reaction. Hu is one of the first authors on the paper, along with Yu Liu, a graduate student in the lab.
“Our goal is to apply the ultracold molecule technique to different fields,” Hu said. “For this project specifically, we want to apply the ultracold molecule technique to study the chemical reaction.”
Hu added that scientists have long understood the theoretical basis of the different stages of chemical reactions, but that the new experiment allows them to more directly observe intermediate stages. Hu and Ni said scientists have relatively little knowledge of the short-lived middle stages between reactants and their final products.
“What we were looking for was the products of this reaction, to confirm that these chemical reactions were happening, going from reactants to product,” Ni said. “But a bit of a surprise was that we also see the intermediate, which is usually more transient in nature.”
Hu said he hopes the study will help future researchers to better control the speed of ultracold chemical reactions.
“The long-term goal is really to be able to control, or alter, the reaction rate of chemical reactions,” Hu said. “The ultracold technique is probably the most close to that dream.”
The team is currently exploring new ways they can use the ultracold technique, according to a Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology press release. The release states that the technique may help researchers manipulate reactants during a reaction, prematurely “excite” them, or physically “nudge” them around.
Ni said she has heard very positive reactions to the experiment from other researchers.
“In the very immediate community, people are very excited. It was a bit of a puzzle for at least ten years,” Ni said. “But, moreover, we also saw something that we didn’t expect. Now we have opened up new possibilities to everybody, so the community is very excited to see what we could learn next.”

A team of Harvard scientists have found a potential new method of treating obesity by limiting the body’s absorption of fat, according to a paper published Nov. 25 in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
Md Nurunnabi, a former postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, led an eight-month project to test the interaction between fat molecules and choline and geranate — known as CAGE — an orally administered liquid salt.
Bioengineering professor Samir Mitragotri first developed CAGE in 2014. He initially tested the ionic liquid’s ability to improve the body’s absorption of medicines, an experiment which helped the team conceive of CAGE’s potential ability to also prevent fat absorption.
When the team was looking at how the intestines absorb certain molecules, they found that CAGE was able to enhance the delivery of insulin and other medicines. They also discovered that CAGE caused the body to not absorb hydrophobic molecules.
“That was very puzzling and counterintuitive,” Mitragotri said. “It led us to the idea that maybe we can use CAGE to reduce the transport of a hydrophobic molecule. And what molecule that came to our mind was fat, and the idea that if you can reduce the uptake of fat, it could have therapeutic applications.”
The team assembled a mixture of CAGE and fat to test their hypothesis. The mixture formed particles that were noticeably larger than when the fat mixed with water alone.
The team fed a mixture of a high-fat diet and CAGE to rats and found that those large particles reduced fat absorption in the rats’ intestines, which ultimately reduced the body mass of rats with high-fat diets.
Additionally, the team observed that the rats treated with CAGE ate less food compared to the experiment’s control groups.
Mitragotri said he believes CAGE could become a simple, safe, and cost-effective treatment for obesity.
The team noted in their paper that over 70 percent of American adults are overweight or obese — a fact Mitragotri said makes this type of research particularly important.
“Obesity is a huge issue. It is extremely pertinent. And it is at the root cause of many secondary complications, including diabetes, cardiovascular, and many other conditions,” Mitragotri said.
Eden E.L. Tanner, a postdoctoral bioengineering researcher who contributed to the experiment, wrote in an emailed statement that she believes it is important to reduce discrimination against people who are overweight or obese, though finding new medical treatments is also necessary.
“While working to combat this discrimination is of critical importance, some people opt to reduce their body mass,” Tanner wrote. “Orally administered CAGE shows great promise at being able to provide a safe alternative to conventional approaches.”
Nurunabbi said he believes the study’s results are promising, but that CAGE requires further research.
“We are going to continue working on CAGE, because we are still in a very early stage,” Nurunnabi said. “Does it work or not? We see, ‘yes.’ Now we have to answer the question: ‘how does it work?’”
“The immediate question is how does this finding translate to the clinic for humans,” Mitragotri also said. “That requires many more studies and testing and collaboration with other clinicians in moving it forward. So that’s the path we would need to explore moving forward.”

Six University affiliates – including three Harvard seniors – learned Thursday they will have the opportunity to earn a master’s degree in Beijing next year through the Schwarzman Scholars program.
Seniors Anirudh Suresh ’20, Christopher M. Vassallo ’20, and Kangrong “Allison” Zhang ’20 each received the scholarship alongside Sara S. Surani ’18, Jullian A. Duran ’18, and Christopher Li ’18. They form part of the program’s fifth class.
This year's applicant pool included 4,700 applicants from 41 countries and 108 universities. Beginning in the fall of 2019, the 145 Schwarzman Scholars will study at Beijing’s Tsinghua University for one academic year, graduating with a master’s degree in Global Affairs.
Scholars can concentrate in public policy, international studies, or economics, and they accompany their classroom studies with hands-on experience in their fields of interest. Students also study Mandarin during their year abroad. CEO and co-founder of financial firm Blackstone Stephen A. Schwarzman founded the scholars program.
Several of the scholars said they were attracted to the scholarship because it afforded them the opportunity to learn in a different environment.
Zhang, a joint concentrator in applied math and history, said her time growing up in China and the U.S. initially sparked her interest.
“Having grown up in both Beijing and California, I’ve been interested in China and its changing relationship with the rest of the world,” she said.
She said she hopes to ultimately live in China full-time.
“Personally, because I hope to explore the possibility of working in China in the long term, Schwarzman Scholars will also be a great way to begin reintegrating myself into Chinese society,” Zhang said.
Vassallo, who studies history at Harvard, plans to study U.S. foreign policy “from a Chinese perspective.” He added that he one day hopes to work on the state department’s policy planning staff or on the National Security Council.
“These are settings where policymakers hash out key decisions that ultimately shape the relationship between the world’s superpowers,” Vassallo said.
Vassallo added that the scholarship will allow him to take the “first step towards cultivating a unique, authoritative voice on US-China relations.”
“A year as a Schwarzman Scholar will allow me to transition from careful observer to active participant in the debate that is reshaping foreign policy,” he said.
Suresh, a mathematics concentrator, said he is most interested in exploring themes of “artificial intelligence” and “general technology.”
He said he also hopes to learn about “political and social issues” in China and to learn Mandarin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of academic unions worldwide have thrown their support behind Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers this week as they began their strike Tuesday.
At least 20 other student unions have written statements of support for HGSU-UAW on Twitter, and some individuals have taken other actions, like striking in solidarity, picketing at Harvard, and donating to a hardship fund for striking workers
HGSU-UAW went on strike Tuesday after more than a year of contract negotiations with the University. Over the course of 28 bargaining sessions, the union and the University have reached 12 tentative agreements. But the parties remain at odds over issues including health benefits, compensation, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
Numerous graduate student workers from local colleges and universities have spent time on the picket line during the first three days of the strike, holding colorful signs bearing slogans like “An Injury to One is an Injury to All! Solidarity from UMass Lowell” and “UMass Boston Stands with Harvard Workers.”
Boston University Ph.D. student Megan J. LeBarron spent time on the picket line on Tuesday with friends from Boston College and Northeastern University. She said she is currently planning a return trip.
“There’s something really wonderful and inspiring about hearing the beats and marching along, and that physical solidarity of being in the same place at the same time, dedicated to the same cause,” she said.
LeBarron added that her time on the picket line left her feeling empowered to support unionization efforts at Boston University. Though BU graduate students are not currently unionized, an organizing committee is working to gain recognition on their behalf, she said.
“There's something really powerful in seeing that you are not alone here,” she said. “You feel marginalized and so do all of these other people. And in that, there is some degree of strength.”
MIT Ph.D. student Crystal Lee said she spent time on the picket line Thursday. This semester, she served as a Teaching Assistant for the Harvard course HISTSCI 119VH: “Sugar, Spice, and Science: Colonialism and Commerce in the Making of a Global History of Science.”
Lee, who is not part of the union, emailed her students at Harvard on Tuesday to inform them that she planned to stop performing her Harvard teaching duties in solidarity with HGSU-UAW. In her email, which she later posted to Twitter, she said her decision was due to “the momentous nature of the discussions between the Union and the Harvard administration.”
Lee said she worried about being used to break the strike if she did not withhold her labor.
“I don’t really want to be a strike breaker because I think it is entirely conceivable for Harvard to look to outside labor, look at Tufts, MIT, BU, etc. to try to replace Harvard graduate student labor and I want no part in that,” she said. “To put it crassly, I don’t want to scab on my fellow graduate students at Harvard.”
MIT graduate student Ethan G. Baker also said he hopes to deter Boston-area students from doing work for Harvard. He wrote in an email that he is “trying to make sure coworkers understand to not unintentionally replace the labor of striking workers.”
Away from the picket line, many HGSU-UAW supporters outside of Boston have found ways to support the strike from afar.
Jeff R. Schuhrke — a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the former president of their Graduate Employees Organization — said the strike is important to his union, which held a strike for nearly three weeks this spring.
“It’s heartening to see other grad unions going on strike as we did,” he said. “We understand what’s at stake, and how difficult it is and how risky it is and how much work it takes to organize it from our own experience.”
He added that he is closely following disputes between HGSU-UAW and Harvard over grievance procedures for sexual misconduct.
“It’s becoming our main issue that we’ll be taking on going forward in our next contract campaign, so seeing what happens with HGSU and with their strike is really important to us and we hope that they get some kind of strong language in their contract about that,” he said.
Alex J. Miller — the communications chair for Academic Labor United, a group of graduate students at the University of Hawaii attempting to unionize — said that this strike is an important example for his organization.
“It’s important for our members to see what a strike looks like and what a strike on a university campus looks like,” Miller said. “It’s about showing them the numbers that we need.”
Robyn Orfitelli ’06, who currently works as an English lecturer at Sheffield University in the United Kingdom, has taken similar steps to “signal boost” the HGSU-UAW strike online. She said she has “donated to their fighting fund” and plans to write a letter to Harvard’s administration expressing support for the strike.
Orfitelli is a member of the UCU — the University and College Union — which represents academic workers at several universities across the U.K. Members of the UCU, representing more than 6o universities in the U.K. including Sheffield, held a strike from Nov. 25 to Dec. 4, overlapping with the strike at Harvard for two days.
“There’s a saying that goes, ‘the longer the picket line, the shorter the strike,’” Orfitelli said. “In today’s internet age, the picket line isn’t just the people who are physically on the picket line. It’s all of the people on the internet, who are expressing support or sharing information so that new people can learn about what’s going on, because a lot of industrial action is a battle of public opinion.”

Mail and package deliveries across the University were disrupted Wednesday and Thursday by the graduate student union strike, which will enter its fourth day Friday.
United Parcel Service is not delivering to Harvard in support of picketers, according to several University communications. At other locations across the University Wednesday and Thursday, individual picketers attempted to block delivery entrances and asked drivers to withhold their deliveries.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers went on strike Tuesday after more than a year of contract negotiations with the University. While the parties have reached 12 tentative agreements in the 28 bargaining sessions held so far, differences remain on key issues such as compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
The decision by UPS not to deliver to Harvard has delayed packages addressed to the University’s Cambridge campus. Several undergraduate Houses experienced delays, according to email announcements from House administrators over email lists.
“[Harvard University Mail Services] is in the process of scanning in all of today’s UPS packages and expects to deliver those packages to the Houses tomorrow, 12/6,” the announcement read. “HUMS is not planning to keep delivering UPS’s packages should UPS continue to withhold delivery tomorrow onward.”
The email noted that students with urgent deliveries, like medications, should contact HUMS for expedited access to their packages.
The strike also disrupted BorrowDirect — a service that enables library borrowing across academic institutions in the United States — according to an email publicized by HGSU on Twitter. Some BorrowDirect deliveries rely on UPS.
Harvard Library is now looking at alternative methods to address delivery delays for borrower services and other deliveries as part of the ongoing University-wide contingency plan should the strike continue, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
In the meantime, Library patrons were cautioned to “expect fairly long turnaround times for loans.”
Ann-Catherine I. McNeill, a Ph.D. student in the Study of Religion who lives in a freshman dorm in Harvard Yard because her partner is a freshman proctor, did not receive an expected delivery from UPS Wednesday.
“I didn't get my UPS delivery today but that was totally worth it,” McNeill wrote in an email, noting that she supports the strike “wholeheartedly.”
“I would much rather get fair working conditions, harassment protections, and adequate healthcare coverage than a timely delivery of my online shopping (preferably both but if one has to choose) and I am grateful for UPS Teamsters supporting us,” she added. “Let's hope I get a fair contract and my mail sooner rather than later.”
Members and supporters of HGSU picketed at gates, loading docks, and delivery centers, including Johnston Gate, the Center for Government and International Studies, the Harvard Kennedy School, Quincy House, Leverett House, Currier House, and Eliot House.
“We're out in this particular spot because we're trying to talk to people that make deliveries to Harvard to get them to not make deliveries in solidarity with the Union,” said Physics Ph.D. student Lev H. Kendrick, who was stopping deliveries outside of Quincy House Wednesday morning.
History of Science Ph.D. student Alexis Turner, another picketer stopping deliveries outside of Quincy House, said the group stopped one of the three deliveries made in the morning.
“A second gentleman informed us that if we got in touch with his union management, next week at this time he won’t deliver,” she said.
Sean M. O’Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 25 — a union representing roughly 12,500 people including delivery workers in the Boston area — wrote that its members “always” honor picket lines.
“Solidarity is key to getting a fair wage with proper rights and protections, and we are proud to support our union brothers and sisters. These student workers have already learned that only by standing together can working people hold greedy employers accountable,” O’Brien wrote.
Correction: Dec. 10, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Alexis Turner is a Physics Ph.D. student. In fact, she is a Ph.D. student in History of Science

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several academic departments across the University emailed graduate student teaching staff asking whether they are participating in the graduate student union’s strike this week, prompting anger among union members.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile went on strike Tuesday after more than a year of contract negotiations with the University. Despite the 12 tentative agreements the two parties have reached, differences remain on key contract provisions including compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimiantion complaints.
The memo — originally sent out to Government department affiliates by Chair Jeffry A. Frieden — was posted in part on Twitter by union members. Frieden informed graduate students that they are responsible for reporting whether they are working and that those who strike should not expect to be paid. Frieden also reminded faculty that they are “management” and are still responsible for their “instructional responsibilities.”
In a separate email, the department asked graduate students teaching fellows whether they are striking.
“The Department, meaning I in my official capacity as Department Chair, has emailed all graduate students who are serving as Teaching Fellows to ask if they are working,” Frieden wrote in an emailed statement. “We are collecting that information, as requested by the administration.”
In preparing to send out the memo, the Government department consulted University administrators, according to Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. Though other departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences later sent similar memos detailing teaching responsibilities to their graduate students and faculty, they did not do so under the instruction of the University, Swain wrote in an emailed statement. The University did, however, ask departments to collect information about individual teaching fellows' strike status.
Administrators at Harvard Divinity School, the Physics department, and the African and African American Studies department also sent emails to graduate students asking whether they are striking or not.
“Please respond to this email to confirm whether or not you intend to fulfill your responsibilities as a Teaching Fellow,” reads a segment included in many of these emails. “Please note that by not responding to this message, you are confirming your decision to strike.”
It is unclear whether the Divinity School, the Physics department, or the African and African American Studies department also sent the memo reminding students and faculty of their teaching responsibilities.
But some departments declined to send either the memo or an email asking students to report their strike participation.
Administrators from the Classics, the Celtic Languages and Literatures, the Astronomy, the Comparative Literature, the East Asian Languages and Civilizations, and the Germanic Languages and Literatures departments said they did not send departmental emails to student workers asking whether they are striking.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton emailed students asking whether they will fulfill their teaching duties in an attempt to collect information about “matters of payroll.”
“Due to the timing of the strike and the closing of the payroll period, all teaching fellows will receive their regular pay for December, whether they strike or not,” Hempton wrote. “Future decisions about payroll matters will necessarily be determined by Harvard’s central administration.”
The union organizing committee later wrote letters to department chairs stating that they are concerned about emails asking faculty members to report graduate students’ strike status, according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Crimson. The union’s letter stated that administrators may use the information to “dock students’ pay,” and it urged department chairs to “proceed with more caution” when distributing work to department members.
“We’re concerned that members of the Harvard community are being given new managerial responsibilities they have never before had to shoulder,” the union wrote.
In an email to members, the union’s organizing committee provided suggestions on how members should respond to these kinds of requests. In the email, they addressed academic responsibilities, teaching responsibilities, and strike benefits.
“As suspected may happen, the Harvard administration started attempting to intimidate student workers from striking, rather than devoting time to bargaining a fair union contract,” the organizing committee wrote. “We believe that these emails are primarily intended to intimidate, as depending on email non-responses from student workers is unlikely to be a reliable indication of who is participating in the strike.”
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that strikes are not “secret actions,” and therefore student workers on strike should not expect to be paid. Swain also referred back to a University-wide email from University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 last week in which Garber wrote that retaliation is against the law and University policy.
“For multiple reasons, including considerations for compliance with federal laws, the University has an obligation and a legal right to track whether work is being performed or not, and to use that information to determine whether or not a worker will be paid,” Swain wrote.
Former Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board William B. Gould IV that there is nothing “inherently unlawful or improper” about departments asking students whether they are on strike.
“What can be potentially ominous from the employee’s perspective is the fact that if you are on strike, you can be temporarily replaced and be permanently replaced,” Gould said.
Gould said that though employers are legally allowed to temporarily or permanently “replace” striking employees, they cannot disrupt or change employment relationships because employees engage in a strike.
“There have not been many strikes in higher education in these kinds of jobs,” Gould said. “We’re really travelling down unchartered territory”
HGSU did not respond to a request for comment.
Germanic Languages and Literatures Chair Alison F. Johnson said she refused to ask graduate students in her department whether they are working during the strike.
“I don’t think you should impute a position about responsibilities and obligations to Harvard based on failure to answer an email,” she said. “People have the right to define their position themselves in their own voices, and they should not be bullied or threatened or harassed into a position that they haven't declared themselves to hold.”
Swain declined to comment on Johnson’s comments, but referred back to Garber’s email, which stated that faculty and staff “must fulfill their academic responsibilities to their students.”
Correction: Dec. 6, 2019
A previous version of this article misattributed the quote, “For multiple reasons, including considerations for compliance with federal laws, the University has an obligation and a legal right to track whether work is being performed or not, and to use that information to determine whether or not a worker will be paid,” to an email by University Provost Alan M. Garber '76. In fact, the quote comes from an emailed statement by University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. 
Clarification: Dec. 6, 2019
A previous version of this article stated that the University did not instruct departments to send out memos similar to the one the Government department sent to its affiliates. To clarify, these memos reminded graduate students and faculty of their teaching responsibilities and are separate from communications that asked invididual teaching fellows their strike status. The University did instruct departments to collect information about which workers are striking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 40-minute bus ride away from Harvard Square, over the Charles River and through Boston, a picket line at Harvard’s Longwood campus marks another fault line between the University and Harvard’s graduate student union.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers members began picketing at the Longwood campus Wednesday, a day after their strike began in Harvard Yard. Union members formed two picket lines in Longwood — one outside of Gordon Hall, a Harvard Medical School administrative building, and the other outside the Kresge Building, which holds the Harvard School of Public Health.
After more than a year of contract negotiations with the University, HGSU officially began its strike on Tuesday. Though the two parties have reached 12 tentative agreements, they remain at odds over health care benefits, compensation, and a procedure for adjudicating sexual harrassment and discrimination complaints.
The Longwood campus houses the School of Public Health, the Medical School, and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. More than 2,500 students and 11,000 faculty populate the campus.
Picketers at Longwood chanted various science-themed slogans, including “Put pipettes down! We need a contract now!” and “Hey don’t make that buffer, while your fellow students suffer!”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the University still believes that a strike is “unwarranted.”
“Student workers have [a] vital role in fulfilling Harvard’s teaching and research mission, and with that in mind, the University is committed to addressing concerns that have been raised throughout this process,” Swain wrote. “A strike will neither clarify our respective positions nor will it resolve areas of disagreement.”
Systems Biology Ph.D. candidate Daniel S. Eaton said he was impressed by the turnout at the Longwood strike since many who work at Longwood are faculty or staff scientists, not graduate students.
“I’m actually really impressed with how we’re doing here,” he said. “I think things are staying excited, and I hope that we’ll be able to propagate this energy into the future.”
Though the picket lines in Longwood resemble those in the Yard, union members at the medical campus shared a particular interest in the bargaining provisions concerning health.
HGSU negotiators have asked that all union members automatically receive full health, vision, and prescription drug coverage. The union’s proposed health care system would lift the 40-visit cap on mental health care visits and would cover the majority of health care costs of members’ dependents.
The union is also demanding that the University pay 90 percent of dental care costs. Currently, the dental health plan for graduate students requires students to opt-in and pay an additional fee.
In response, the University has stated that it will not agree to cover the costs of each member’s health care. Harvard has instead offered pool funds to offset health insurance premiums, as well as cover dental care and child care.
Population Health Services Ph.D. candidate Mathilda Regan said her role on the picket line is an extension of her commitment to health.
“I think especially studying public health, we realize how important it is for people to have access to good medical care,” Regan said.
Following a morning of picketing Thursday, HGSU hosted a rally in Longwood that drew a crowd of roughly 50 strikers. Speakers, who criticized the University for its alleged unfair treatment of graduate students, also took time to celebrate graduate student research and work.
Biological Sciences in Public Health Ph.D. candidate Caroline Keroack argued in a speech at the Thursday rally that graduate students cannot contribute to the study of health through their research if they are not healthy themselves.
In her speech, Keroack said she has suffered from severe depression since the age of 12. Though her condition requires weekly therapy treatment, she said she is unable to afford therapy under Harvard’s current health care plan.
“We cannot be the gears that grind forward this institution if we cannot keep ourselves physically and mentally healthy,” Keroack said.
Swain declined to comment on criticisms of Harvard’s current health care plan.
In support of the graduate student worker strike, 18 construction laborers working on a restoration project near the Longwood picket line shut down their job site for the day.
Jason R. Achstetter, a labor foreman for the construction management firm Walsh Brothers, said the workers walked out to show support for striking union members.
“Being in the union you know what a strike is about and how you’re supposed to react to a strike,” he said. “I called my supervisor and he talked to Harvard and talked to the unions and it came down that we were going to have a walk out for a day so we could show our respect.”
Massachusetts Nurses Association President Donna Kelly-Williams said in an interview that Harvard’s student workers should not need to strike in order to be recognized by the University. Kelly-Williams spoke at Wednesday’s rally at Longwood.
“Harvard is so involved in medical research, and we give the greatest care in the world to patients that come to seek care here and in Massachusetts, and we’re not taking care of our own,” she said. “What kind of a message is that?”

NEW HAVEN, CONN. — A Connecticut judge gave ten Harvard students and alumni community service and asked them to later return to court at a hearing Friday, several weeks after they were arrested for interrupting the Harvard-Yale football game to hold a divestment protest.
Under the agreement, the protesters are required to complete five hours of community service before their Jan. 27 court date in New Haven, Conn. and commit no additional offenses between now and then. Jan. 27 is the first day of spring semester classes for Harvard College students.
At least 19 Yale students and alumni also appeared in court Friday and were given the same conditions.
All of the arrested protesters in the courtroom said that they agreed to the terms. If the protesters complete them, the charges will be dismissed, Judge Phillip Scarpellino said. One Harvard alumnus did not appear in court.
Scarpellino strongly recommended that students do their community service with Project Green Thumb, an alternative to paying fines for some offenses in New Haven. The project helps clean up New Haven Green, a public space in the center of the city. They are not required, however, to serve locally.
Ahead of the appearance, Attorney Hugh F. Keefe, who is representing the Harvard students arrested during the divestment protest alongside Attorney Tara Knight, who is also married to Keefe said he planned to get the case dismissed.
“My job is to make sure that every student arrested and given a summons gets out of this without any record, any criminal record, any infraction record in the world,” Keefe said. “That's what I plan to do.”
Police arrested the protesters last month when they interrupted the Harvard-Yale football game for a divestment demonstration. Dozens of activists — followed by hundreds of spectators — stormed the field a few minutes before halftime ended and unfurled large banners calling on Harvard and Yale to divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt.
Many of the protesters staged a sit-in, refusing to leave even as announcers and police officers asked them to leave the field. Several of them chose to leave only after police told them they were under arrest.
In total, police charged 50 people with disorderly conduct.
Following her appearance, Fossil Free Yale member Eleanor Hewitt said she is thankful for the judge’s conditions.
“I was thankful to our lawyer for organizing such a generous deal for us,” she said.
Emma Phelps, who is also a Fossil Free Yale member, said she agreed but that she also wanted to extend her thanks to all of the people who gathered to support the group outside of the courthouse.
“[I am thankful] to all the people who came out in support of us at the rally today outside the courthouse,” Phelps said.
Outside the courthouse, supporters gathered to listen to speeches and sing songs as the students in the courthouse emerged from their hearing.
Harvard and Yale have repeatedly declined to divest their endowments from fossil fuels despite increasing calls to do so from students, alumni, and faculty. Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow and his predecessors have argued that the endowment should not be used for political purposes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 5-0-0 start in ECAC play and an appearance in the top 10 of national rankings, Harvard has since cooled off in a 4-game nonconference skid. Nonetheless, although ultimately coming up short, the squad battled to hard-fought finishes against the nation’s top two teams—No.2/2 Wisconsin and No.1/1 Minnesota—last weekend at the Country Classic, a showcase hosted at the Ford Ice Center Bellevue, the NHL’s Nashville Predators’ practice facility. With the tournament in the books, the Crimson (5-4-0, 5-0-0 ECAC) will be looking to leverage the momentum as it returns to ECAC play this weekend on the road against Yale (6-5-0, 3-3-0 ECAC) and Brown (1-10-0, 1-5-0 ECAC), seeking to both end the losing streak while maintaining a perfect conference record at the same time.
“We got better as the weekend [at the Country Classic] went on, and I think we’re going to carry that steam into this weekend and then hopefully after winter break too,” said sophomore goaltender Lindsay Reed, who posted 91 saves outside of Nashville and has also backstopped the Crimson with a .902 save percentage on the season.
In early November, Harvard squared off with the same two conference foes in a weekend home set, prevailing with a 4-1 victory over the Bears and a 5-2 defeat of the Bulldogs. With these wins already recorded, the Crimson has a blueprint for this weekend and season sweeps over the two opponents on its mind, which would go a long way in the ECAC and Ivy standings—not to mention the importance of righting the season’s momentum before exams and winter break. Since all Ivy teams that sponsor varsity programs also play in the ECAC, games within the Ancient Eight take on an added intensity and double-count in the standings.
“We have to realize we’re still undefeated in league play—we’re 5-0,” Reed said. “Everyone still wants to beat us...These are two huge Ivy League and ECAC games.”
Looking back at last weekend, the shots on goal battle presented Harvard with a challenge and should be a pivotal element to the Crimson’s success. Against the Badgers, Harvard found itself locked in a 2-1 game into the second half of the third period. However, the disparity in offensive opportunities added up, and Wisconsin managed to ice the game with three late third-period goals. By the time the game had ended in a 5-1 Badger victory, Wisconsin had toppled Harvard in shots on goal, 57-15, so the offensive advantage eventually translated into a win, albeit sealed late in the last stanza. The next day, a similar trend repeated, with the Gophers turning a 2-0 third period lead into a 4-0 final behind the weight of a 43-21 shots on goal advantage. While the Crimson lost these two games, Harvard put up very different numbers in its early November wins. In the first Brown game, the Crimson demolished the Bears in shots, 59-14, and in the first go-around against Yale, Harvard narrowly trailed for the game, 30-27, but initially outshot the Bulldogs, 21-18, in the first two periods.
“We definitely tried to be a little cute at times and didn’t take the shots when we could,” junior forward Becca Gilmore said. “First peppering the goalie—getting a ton of shots again—that kind of opens up the more finesse plays closer to the net. We can definitely learn from Wisconsin and Minnesota. It’s something they did well [taking a lot of shots].”
While the Crimson has only tallied four goals over its last four games, the offense clicked on all cylinders before the non-conference foray. In the opening five contests, Harvard put up a whopping 25 goals in its first five games due in large part to the offensive prowess of Gilmore and sophomore forward Anne Bloomer, who have totaled 10 points apiece on the season. Sophomore forward Dominique Petrie and junior forward Keely Moy have also paced the attack with nine points each.
An offensive jumpstart does not just depend on volume, however, but also on timing. Fast starts can set a tone for the entire game. Against Yale, the Crimson managed to jump out to a 3-0 lead, and against Brown, a 2-0 advantage. While both the Bulldogs and Bears did cut the Harvard advantages to one eventually, with the Bears sticking around at 2-1 in the final frame, the early momentum proved to be enough to set the Crimson over the edge. On the road—especially in rival games against nemeses like Yale and Brown—setting the momentum takes on added importance and would go a long way to creating a victory.
“While we always focus on playing a full 60 [minutes], we definitely focus on the first few minutes of a period and the last few minutes of a period,” Gilmore said. “The practice this week has been phenomenal, and we’re coming off a really good weekend of playing together. If we just keep that momentum, we’re looking pretty good for this weekend.”
Notably, closing games on the offensive was a key to the Crimson in the last Yale-Brown pair of matchups and will be again this weekend. In each of the two games, Harvard converted one-goal nail-biters into three-goal comfortable margins, taking 2-1 to 4-1 against the Bears and 3-2 to 5-2 against the Bulldogs. Ultimately, this ability to make a final push boils down to intangibles more so than any particular set of skills.
“That’s really just relying on bench energy, and just heart,” Gilmore said. “Our team has a lot of it; we have good chemistry [and] we believe in each other. None of us ever really doubt that [we’re all working hard]. Lifting that energy, using the bench energy to escalate the game, is definitely what we’re going to rely on.”
In addition to offense and tenacity, defensively, the Crimson will be looking to put together a full, simplified game. To some extent, tilting the ice back to the offensive side will alleviate pressure and allow the team to focus more fully on individual roles.
“We need to keep it simple,” Reed said. “By keeping it simple, [I mean] protecting the house and everyone doing their own respective job. Then everything will take care of itself…We can score more goals and pull away from a one-goal lead or come back from being down.”
As for the opponents, Yale and Brown have gone in very different directions entering the weekend set with Harvard. While the Bulldogs have not been stellar, they have positioned themselves above .500 overall and remain a threat in the league. The Bears, on the other hand, have struggled, only winning one game so far on the campaign. Nonetheless, with the parity in the conference, any team can win on any given night, especially given the proximity, rivalry, and familiarity between Harvard and its opponents—not to mention that both Yale and Brown will be looking to avenge games that them saw them cut the deficit to one before Harvard pulled away.
With the stage set for a pivotal conference weekend, the puck drops tonight at 6:00 pm in New Haven before a 3:00 pm Saturday matinee in Providence.

The Harvard men’s hockey team cracked open its 2019-2020 schedule with six straight wins. Last week, it lost its unblemished record to a ranked Boston College team and followed up this performance with another defeat at the hands of another neighbor, Boston University.
Friday at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the No. 12/9 Crimson (6-3-0, 6-1-0 ECAC) continued its stretch of losses as it fell to historic rival Cornell in front of a sell-out crowd. The No. 2 Big Red (10-0-0, 7-0-0), the only undefeated team remaining in Division I, handed Harvard its first conference shortcoming of the season to the tune of 3-1.
“Coming on the road, we wanted to play disciplined,” Cornell coach Mike Schafer said. “And for the most part we did that. I thought we fell asleep a little bit in the second period. They took the timeout, they started to do some things differently, and I think we reacted very well to it.”
Three high-profile matchups in the past seven days made for a prime opportunity for the Crimson to show that it belongs alongside the country’s other top squads. More practically, the group will require the remaining conference schedule and few non-conference bouts to achieve marquee wins for the Pairwise rankings, the determinant of NCAA Tournament berths in late March.
“When you start the year, especially if you find some success, you think that, ‘Okay, this is the way we’re going to play,’” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But then you end up seeing different styles of teams, teams that are heavier…and we’re still sorting that out…. Quite honestly, it’s been a good test the last three [games] for us.”
Cornell delivered an emphatic statement in the tilt’s first frame. Taking the ice for the second period with a 2-0 lead, the Big Red added another tally at the 15-minute mark. During a shift with sustained offensive zone time, rookie forward Jack Malone curled above the goal line with the puck and found fellow freshman Travis Mitchell through a seam. The blue-liner buried the shot in a mostly empty net, a testament to the quality of Malone’s set-up pass.
With a sizable lead and a roaring crowd of visiting supporters, Cornell had tilted the ice severely in its favor. Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 called a timeout to allow his squad to regroup, and the hosts picked up their play slightly, earning a powerplay which ultimately proved fruitful.
Sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone faked a point shot and worked the puck down the left side. The offensive-minded rearguard connected with freshman winger Nick Abruzzese on a cross-ice feed, and the first-year executed the one-timer to put his Crimson on the board.
One element of Harvard’s game which did look sharp on Friday was its man-up unit. The five attackers were snapping the puck cleanly from player to player, and of course the group cashed in once. Of the few high-quality looks Harvard had on Big Red backstop Matt Galajda (1 GA, .958 SV%), many of them came on the powerplay.
“Even before [the powerplay goal], we kind of started to get our legs under us,” Abruzzese said. “We scored, and I thought the rest of the game we outplayed them. We had a lot more offensive zone time, and that led to some chances. Maybe one or two goes in and it’s a different story.”
With two minutes left on the first-period clock, Cornell extended its early lead to 2-0. Junior winger Tristan Mullin attempted a threatening wrap-around, which Harvard net-minder Mitchell Gibson (3 GA, .906 SV%) kept out. Mullin’s classmate, forward Brenden Locke, found the loose puck in front of the net and potted the second-chance opportunity.
The Big Red’s pair of early strikes — not to mention several near-goals which only the pipes managed to keep out — marked an uncharacteristically offensive first stanza for Cornell. Ahead of Friday, just 18 percent of the team’s scoring came in the opening period (0.78 first-period goals per game). And Harvard, which entered the bout atop the nation in first-period goals per game (1.75), struggled to muster any offense through 20 minutes.
“[The start] was pretty much an ideal first 20 minutes,” said Big Red junior tri-captain Morgan Barron. “There were a few mental lapses, but other than that, it was a good start for us…. [The rest of the season] is going to be about trying to figure out how to play that way for the full 60.”
Cornell began the game with nearly 10 minutes of sustained pressure, hemming the Crimson in its defensive zone for minutes at a time. This smothering dominance earned the Big Red a powerplay early in the frame, which did not itself culminate in a goal but led to one shortly thereafter.
As junior Henry Bowlby’s infraction expired, the visitors rushed the puck up the ice. On the subsequent cycling of the puck down low, tri-captain Jeff Malott picked up a centering pass that came from the left corner. The forward spun around the traffic at the net mouth and found his own rebound, beating Gibson under the pads.
The initial tally was one of a whopping 10 shots endured by Gibson in the contest’s incipient five minutes. By the first-period horn, Cornell owned a lopsided 17-4 edge in shots on goal.
“[Cornell] pinned us in the zone,” coach Donato said. “They came out physical, made us break the puck out under pressure. We didn’t do a great job of it…. I just felt [in] the first period, for the most part, we watched.”
In addition to the productive start, the Big Red’s ability to shut down Harvard’s impact forwards contributed to the success it found Friday in Cambridge. Cornell’s trio up front of Mullin, junior Kyle Betts, and fourth-year Noah Bauld has contained the opposition’s top line at even strength with significant efficacy this season.
“[Harvard] always has a top line,” coach Schafer said. “Over the years, they’ve always had that number-one line that can create offense…. That’s 10 games in a row now where [Mullin, Betts, and Bauld] have been out against the other team’s top line and they haven’t got a point 5-on-5.”
Looking to rebound from a disappointing setback, Harvard will look ahead to more conference action on Saturday against Colgate. The Big Red, meanwhile, continues its undefeated dominance and remains an ECAC rival against which the Crimson has enjoyed little success in recent seasons. Friday’s outing brings Cornell’s record against Harvard to 5-1, and 5-0 in the conference, since the Crimson’s 2017 Frozen Four run.

Kirkland House is famous for its furry residents, and Tiki, the absurdly cute, eight-month-old service dog of Nikki Daurio ’20, is no exception. After seriously contemplating suicide last year, Daurio took a year off from Harvard, and this year she says she can “see how much healthier I am.” Daurio credits herself for getting healthy through her treatment, but says that Tiki has been invaluable to her. Daurio says of Tiki, “Harvard is a completely different place with her. I don’t understand how I went through three years at Harvard without her.”
Daurio got Tiki from a goldendoodle service dog breeder, Cali Pals Service Dogs. For the first two months of her life, Tiki was exposed to all sorts of environments, including a construction site at seven weeks old. She then completed a month of non-service dog obedience training before Daurio got her in May. The pair continued working on obedience training until Tiki was four months old, after which they underwent service dog training at Orange County Service Dogs three times a week.
Daurio and Tiki trained for around six hours a day all summer using a variety of methods. Daurio says that it’s hard because “you’re treating this dog as medical equipment” and yet “they’re also a puppy.” She says that service dogs “still have off days. We continue our training every day.”
Tiki was almost named Waves, as Daurio feels a deep connection to the ocean. By the time Daurio got her, Tiki had already been trained to respond to her given name, Kiki. Daurio decided to keep the same sound, and named her Tiki for its association with the tiki torch in “Survivor” and its relation to the beach.
Daurio is impressed by the dual roles of service dogs, noting “On and off-vest, it’s like two different dogs. When she has her vest on, she knows she’s working.” However, when the vest come off, “she likes to remind me that she’s a puppy.” Even with all of her skill and training, Tiki hasn’t mastered drinking water without submerging her entire face. “That’s why she has a permanent mustache,” laughs Daurio.
So what’s the difference between service dogs and emotional support animals? Daurio explains that essentially, “there are three main categories: a therapy dog, emotional support animal, and service dog.” While service dogs have specific tasks they are trained to perform to help one individual with a disability, neither emotional support or therapy dogs are task trained. “Therapy dogs are meant for many people,” Daurio says. Like service dogs, “emotional support animals are meant for one person, however, they are not task-trained.” Only service dogs have public-access rights, but emotional support animals can fly and live in no-pets buildings.
Tiki has three tasks: deep pressure therapy, interrupting signs of self-harming behavior, and providing a brace to help Daurio if she needs help getting up or feels like she’s going to pass out. To ensure that she is fully capable of doing her job while she is working, Tiki needs clear boundaries on what behavior is and is not acceptable. For example, she is only allowed to play with dogs in a designated space at designated times. Tiki won’t be considered fully trained until two years old, and even then the training will continue.
{image id=1341518 size=medium align=right caption=false" byline=true}When asked about what it’s like living with a service dog, especially as a student, Daurio admits, “It’s not a privilege to have a service dog. It’s really annoying.” She says “if I didn’t need a service dog, I would love to not have a dog with me everywhere I go.” But Daurio can’t speak highly enough of Tiki. “She works so hard. That’s another thing that’s hard about having a dog at school: They work so hard that it’s hard to correct bad behavior when they’re off-duty.”
As for how people should treat service dogs in public, Daurio says, “don’t stare at them. If they’re putting effort and energy into not paying attention to you, that takes away from them doing their job.” While dogs are cute and it’s easy to get excited every time you see one, Daurio says, “I hope that people reading this article, when they see a service dog in public, they just ignore it.”
There are two moments that Daurio points to that stick out of her memories with Tiki. The first is when, at five months old, Tiki was “incredible” at Disneyland. “It showed me that I can live a life with a service dog, and she’s amazing. I love her so much.” The second is “the first time she tasked without me training it, I was crying, and she jumped up and interrupted. And in that moment I was like, this is my dog. This is my service dog, and we’re gonna be together forever.”

Sometimes, visitors to the west side of the Science Center’s fourth floor are greeted not by the Biology offices or Statistics help sessions they came looking for, but by a shrill series of yaps — compliments of a very small and energetic dog named Jerry. Jerry, a nine-year-old Chihuahua, comes to the Science Center a few days a week with Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution” preceptor Annie S. Park.
Park says that when she adopted him seven years ago, Jerry was several pounds heavier than his current weight, a nontrivial difference since Jerry is already so light. According to Park, Jerry didn’t have much of a neck or waist and resembled a “fat sausage.” Losing a few pounds since then has helped Jerry get to a healthier weight for his legs and joints to support. Good for you, Jerry!
Park loves that meeting or even walking past Jerry “brings out the side of people you normally don’t get to see,” like when he’s able to elicit high-pitched “awwww”s from tall, powerful-looking athletes. Jerry is small enough that people passing by often don’t see him until they get pretty close, so suddenly noticing him is always an exciting surprise.
Jerry can get nervous around strangers, but on the whole absolutely loves attention. In particular, he enjoys groups of “adoring fans.” If Park lets him out at the front of the lecture hall before class, students will come up to meet him, which Jerry thinks is “the best thing ever.”
“He likes prancing and playing with his toy,” Park says. “It’s really funny to watch.”
Toys, of course, are an important part of Jerry’s life. He’s never without one, meaning that if Park doesn’t bring one for him, he’ll find something like a stick, fall in love with it, and take it home with him. Jerry isn’t picky about toys at all, and similarly, he’s very willing to try new foods. He enjoys fruits, carrots, and other typical dog-friendly human foods, and will “eat anything, honestly,” including odd foods like cilantro.
Park also said Jerry has made progress with his socialization over the years.
“When I got him he was extremely unfriendly, extremely unsocialized. And so, like, the first time I took him outside, he was like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ and would not walk.”
Jerry has come a long way, Park said. He can still get shy or even territorial around strangers, but opens up and is good at remembering people.
“He has a really big personality at home when he's comfortable,” she said. “It makes me sad that not everyone can see that side of him where he's just, like, rolling around in bed. Like, you know, this crazy little guy.”
Jerry is still learning to get along with other dogs, but Park proudly reports that he has made one dog friend, a small Maltese that he plays with.
One of her favorite things about Jerry is that he “always gives, like, 110 percent to everything he does,” Park says. “He's that guy that like, really tries as hard as he can at everything. So if he's like, ‘I need to drink water,’ he will go drink water and drink water as hard as he can.”
When Flyby met Jerry, he was stylishly dressed in a green striped sweater. He looked so good that it was shocking to learn that he hates outfits and will run away when Park holds one up to put on. The outfits are necessary for Jerry to “be happy and still play outdoors.” He loses heat so easily that even 75 degree weather can be chilly for him. According to Park, one of Jerry’s best looks is an outfit made of fluffy sherpa material, which has bear ears attached to the hood.
Park would like to get a Halloween costume for Jerry, but has struggled in the past with finding costumes small enough for him. Given her choice of well-fitting costumes, she thinks Jerry would be excellent in a spider costume where the extra legs flopped around every time he runs.

If you knock on the right door in Wigglesworth H Entryway, you just might be greeted by entryway proctor Kasey Hamel ’14 and her colorpoint cat Piper. Piper is a ragdoll cat, a variety known to go limp when you pick them up and hold them in your arms, almost like a newborn baby. Hamel, a proctor and physician assistant by profession, simply adores Piper, and says, “I would describe our relationship as perfect.”
Although Hamel grew up in a pet-friendly home — her family had three dogs and two cats at one point — she recalls her sometimes lonely years as a College student, as she missed the feeling of a dog or cat in her lap. She consequently vowed to get a cat after graduation. Kasey Hamel and her husband Tom Hamel ’14 got Piper from a breeder a couple of years ago. "It was the best day of my life," she smiles. Piper’s birthday is Cinco de Mayo, and she is now two years old.
While Piper may be adorable, she can still get into trouble. When she was a young kitten, Piper jumped into the toilet, very much by accident. “She had this thing that she liked to sit on top of the toilet while I would shower,” Hamel explains. One day, the seat was left up, and Piper leapt up to her normal perch only to get drenched in toilet water. “I had to pick her up and hold her up like Simba in the shower to wash her off,” Hamel laughs, recalling how shocked the two of them were at the ungodly hour of 6 a.m. on a workday.
“Piper is the love of my life,” confesses Hamel. "When I'm home, we are always together. She loves to cuddle up on my chest and purr, she's always following me around.” However, Piper has a slightly more playful relationship with Tom. “She's always bugging him and stealing his seat,” Hamel laughs. Piper also devotedly waits next to the door for him to come home every night. She often tries to take chicken off their plates if Kasey and Tom decide to eat on the couch.
Piper’s favorite toys are her fish taco squeaky and a laser pointer. Piper is a fairly social cat, though she is more of a home-body and thus doesn’t have too many pet friends. One of her close friends is Basil the guinea pig who lived in Weld until last semester with a former proctor. At one point, Hamel babysat Basil, and while it took a little bit of time for the two pets to warm up to one another, Piper was sad when Basil went home. “I was keeping Basil in the bathroom, and when I got home from work Piper would be outside the bathroom ready to go say hi to Basil, and she did that for a few days after Basil left,” Hamel recounts.
Next time you walk down Massachusetts Avenue, take a glance Yardside to catch a small ragdoll cat people-watching on the busy street. "I also think she's a big JP Lick's fan,” Hamel quips. Alternatively, keep an eye out for Piper sitting in the kitchen window of her Wigglesworth H room, overlooking the Yard. Indeed, one day another proctor noticed Piper meowing amicably at tourists, who were talking back at her and took pictures of her. “I like to think there's some tourist blog that she's famous on somewhere, like the Cat of Harvard Yard," Hamel laughs.
Despite self-admittedly having more 2000 photos of Piper on her smartphone — a “‘cat’alogue”, so to speak — Hamel has no plans of starting an Instagram account for Piper as “she's too special to release publicly.” Holding office hours, however, is not off the table. "I mean, for the students, yes. If there are some true cat fans out there, I could not deprive them of Piper,” Hamel says.
Piper is, by no means whatsoever, Kasey’s pet peeve. "Everything about her is perfect. She's a model cat: easy, breezy and beautiful."
