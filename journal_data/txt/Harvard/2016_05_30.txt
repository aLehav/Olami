Boston Calling will be held at Harvard’s athletic complex in Allston in May 2017, marking a venue and scheduling change for the popular music festival.
Under a rental agreement with Harvard’s Athletics Department, performers and concertgoers will congregate at the complex on North Harvard Street across the Charles River from the College—home to athletic facilities such as the Beren Tennis Center and Blodgett Pool, according to a press release from festival staff. Previously, the festival was held at Boston’s City Hall Plaza.
The festival will only take place once each year after this spring’s concert, which is currently running and will end Sunday. Previously, the festival occurred in both the fall and the spring, but now, it will only be held Memorial Day weekend.
Building on its current programming, which this year featured artists including the Alabama Shakes, Sia, and Sufjan Stevens, Boston Calling also looks to expand its “comedic” offerings and incorporate a film festival into the event. Next year’s film component will be curated by actress, producer, and Harvard College alumna Natalie Portman ’03.
Timothy J. Williamson, Harvard’s director of athletic communications, said, “We are pleased to provide a venue that allows Boston Calling to expand its creative programming while remaining in the City of Boston,” according to the release.
Boston Calling debuted in May 2013. This fall, Harvard’s Department of Athletics awarded dozens of undergraduates with free tickets to the fall festival at a promotional event for the football team’s first home game against Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in program history, the Red Line, Harvard's men's ultimate frisbee team, will compete in the championship game of USA Ultimate's College Championship, held this weekend in Raleigh, N.C.
It has been a weekend of firsts for the Red Line, powering past Georgia and North Carolina on Sunday en route to taking its spot in the top two in the playing field.
In its first semifinals appearance ever, Harvard went up against the hometown favorite North Carolina Darkside in a game that was riddled with weather threats. The Red Line held a 7-5 lead before North Carolina cam back and tied the game at nine. With a 12-11 lead late in a game to 13, Harvard channelled recent USA national team qualifier John Stubbs for its final goal, extending its weekend of first-time appearances to the championship game of the tournament.
Earlier that day, the quarterfinals matchup between the Red Line and University of Georgia's Jojah Ultimate team saw five breaks in the game, spaced from beginning to end, and traded between the teams. Stubbs was once again Harvard's anchor on the field, drawing many Jojah defenders and opening up space for his teammates. The Red Line went on to win 14-13 in a move to the semis.
Harvard will match up against the Minnesota Grey Duck in the championship game today at 2:30 pm.
