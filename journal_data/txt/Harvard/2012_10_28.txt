After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Halloween fever sets in to replace the seasonal plague of midterms, it's time to feed the autumnal soul with some truly spine-chilling and ghastly songs. Let's overlook the easy targets, the likes of the Friday-obsessed Rebecca Black, "rather dead than Red" Taylor Swift, and ear-beating Bieber. Instead, let's focus on the following thrillers, which rise above the rest in unlistenability. As you sacrifice the nearest pumpkin to Hecate and get up to no good this October, take a listen to the following horrors.
1) Kate Bush—"Wuthering Heights"
What would Halloween be without some oddball Gothicism? Florence & the Machine does pre-Raphaelite gothic with romantic gilder and panache, but Kate Bush puts the truly weird in "Wuthering Heights." Brace yourself for some witch caterwauling (without the Macbeth), tai-chi prancing, and necrophilic love between Cathy and Heathcliff. So Halloween, it hurts.
2) Rammstein—"Amerika"
Amerika, according to guttural German heavy metal band, Rammstein, is wunderbar and in the holy heat of All Hallow's Eve, what could be further from the truth? Rammstein, meaning 'ramming stone' in Deutsch, is just as it sounds – a German chain-smoking and sawing monster between Scylla and Charybdis that just isn't as wunderbar as Amerika, the land of Coca-Cola, Wonderbra and WAR.
3) Cannibal Corpse—"Rancid Amputation" (to enjoy alongside a parody version by the Australian comedy group The Chasers)
The aptly named American death metal band Cannibal Corpse makes Rocky Horror Show look like Mitt Romney's beloved Big Bird. The theme of violent death and crazed morbidity is best served with a slice of the crème de la crème of Australian comedy—The Chasers' War On Everything. Here, they give a light-hearted, lounge music rendition of a song about "limbless cadavers" and "decomposing remains."
4) Right Said Fred—"I'm Too Sexy"
Sex and sluttiness (its lesser version) seem to be the playlist obsession of Americans come Halloween. Among the repeat offenders that need to be consigned to the naughty list, Right Said Fred's stripper song is particularly horrid. "I'm Too Sexy" sounds like a narcissistic, nymphomaniac zombie/Shwarzeneggar but like all terrors, you just can’t look away.
5) Kate Bush—"The Dreaming"
We begin and end with a Bush. Kate Bush's "The Dreaming" is meant to evoke the Australian Dreamtime with Rolf Harris making breathy bird and sheep sounds in the distance. Four minutes of bird-flapping, zombie yoga and clone-trooper-style body-con, completed with haunting smoke and fog, make for a visual feast you probably don’t want to sink your teeth into this Halloween.

This Halloween weekend, what dwelled in the bowels of the Science Center was not some ghoul or poltergeist but something far more fearsome: the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society. Here are five of the best jokes from their show.
5. I think little person's the word. I know in the past it's been midget or dwarf—I just don't want to offend anybody. You never know if there's one in the audience. Cause, you can't see them. – Sierra "Nickname TBD" Katow '16
4. I'm in the Voice Actor's Guild, and the Italian National Alliance, and now I have to tell everyone that I'm in the VAGINA. – Alex "Sconez" Iascone '16
3. I was going to make a joke about Frida Kahlo, but I thought it would be too highbrow. – "Holy" Roman "Empire" Berens '16
2. I experimented with drugs at a very early age. I was at a concert and somehow got backstage, and found the band and they were shooting up. They saw me standing there and asked if I wanted a hit, so I said yes. That's the story of how I did heroin with The Wiggles. – Aaron "Jack" Aceves '15
1. I'm very confused myself. The other day, I went to the wrong bank. I had a tough time explaining to the teller why the deposit envelope was filled with semen. – Daniel "The Marvel" Fitzpatrick '15
CORRECTION: October 28, 2012.
An earlier version of the Oct. 28 post mistated the official name of the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of recent news that Harvard plans to build a new basketball arena to house the Crimson, we decided to highlight a few of the nation’s best and brightest of arenas in order to get some idea of what features the new arena could have. The new structure will replace Ray Lavietes Pavilion, the second-smallest basketball facility in the Ivy League and projects to be finished in between 2017 and 2022. Here are a few of our favorite spots to catch a game of basketball:
Cameron Indoor Arena, Duke (North Carolina)
Cameron Indoor: home to the Cameron Crazies, one of the greatest college basketball student sections of all time. Also home to the Duke Blue Devils and USA Olympic men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, Cameron Indoor is among the loudest and most fun arenas in all of college basketball. The student section can be an experience in itself. The engagement of the Crazies and the fans make Cameron one of the best in the nation and give the Blue Devils a great home-court advantage. Let’s not forget that the mascot has been a key fixture on the sidelines through many a March Madness. Will the Crimson men ever have a crazed, life-size mascot version of John Harvard run around a roaring student section?
KFC Yum! Center, University of Louisville (Kentucky)
The home of the University of Louisville Cardinals, this mega-arena opened in the October of 2012 and seats 22,000 fans. What makes the Yum! Center so unique is the variety of amenities that are available for fans and visitors. The lists include 2,084 club seats, 72 luxury suits, four club lounges, and over 25 permanent concession stands. Guests can choose between an 8750 square foot sports bar and concession stands that stock Yum! Brands KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. Oh, and don’t forget about the public food court area that gives fans an exhilarating view of the Ohio River. Could a Felipe’s and Noch’s located inside the new Harvard basketball arena be on the horizon?
Dean E. Smith Center, UNC (North Carolina)
Michael Jordan, Mitch Kupchak, Dean Smith. Many famous names reverberate throughout the arena. While the home of the North Carolina Tar Heels is certainly a lively atmosphere to watch basketball, it pales in comparison to the raucous Cameron Indoor Arena. What makes Dean Smith Arena so special are the historic moments captured in the rafters and in the showcases spread throughout the arena, bringing back memories of the Tar Heels’ long history of collegiate basketball. One particularly memorable collection of nostalgia: Dean Smiths original letter to Michael Jordan, and the original copy Jordan’s letter of intent to play for North Carolina. Is it possible that Tommy Amaker’s original letter to Houston Rocket and Harvard basketball standout Jeremy Lin can be retrieved and enshrined in the new arena? How about a copy of his patent office request to trademark the term “Linsanity”?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even though the Harvard men’s soccer team jumped out to an early lead, Dartmouth took advantage of three straight scores on its way to a 3-1 victory over the Crimson on Saturday afternoon in Hanover.
Despite the promising start for Harvard, the Big Green’s homecoming opponent, Dartmouth tied the game midway through the first half, and the match remained deadlocked until the Big Green scored twice late in the second half to seal the contest.
“[The loss] was obviously disappointing,” co-captain defender Richard Smith said. “Our gameplan was to come out and jump on them in the early part of the game, and we started to do that, getting a goal in the first 10 minutes. We were pretty happy with the first half performance, but in the second half we really didn’t get off the block.”
Sophomore Alex Adelabu led Dartmouth (8-6-0, 4-1-0 Ivy), contributing two goals along with an assist. Adelabu has put together consistent performances all season and ranks second in the Ivy League in both points and goals per game.
The Crimson’s only goal of the match came from freshman forward Jake Freeman in the ninth minute of play. Sophomore midfielder Matt Sheeleigh crossed the ball from the edge of the penalty box to Freeman, who curved a shot into the corner of the goal.
Freeman has been one of the main cogs of the Harvard offense this season. The freshman ranks second on the team in points and leads the squad in shots on goal with 16.
The Crimson (2-9-3, 0-4-1) held the lead until the Big Green tied the game in the 23rd minute, when Adelabu pounced on a rebound off a missed shot and dribbled the ball into the net.
Dartmouth struck twice more in the second half. Adelabu capitalized on a Harvard defensive mistake that led to a two-on-one break to notch an unassisted tally in the 77th minute, his ninth goal of the season.
“I thought we were playing a pretty good game until they scored the second goal,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said. “[In] many of the games we’ve lost, we haven’t been able to get a second goal, and that kind of held us down. We need to score the second goal early in the game so we can stay in it.”
Just six minutes later, the Big Green put the game out of reach when freshman forward Alberto Gorini scored off a pass from Adelabu from the right side of the goal.
“It was disappointing to give up a very avoidable second goal on just an unfortunate series of events,” Smith said. “That kind of deflated us a little bit, and the third was kind of the last straw. We just really couldn’t come back from that. It was a disappointing second half performance.”
After the initial Crimson tally, Dartmouth controlled the flow of the rest of the game, outshooting Harvard 18 to six. The six shots were the Crimson’s third-lowest total on the year.
Harvard has come out strong in the opening minutes all season long but has been unable to maintain the intensity for the full length of matches.
In its last three losses, the Crimson has found itself tied at halftime only to surrender goals late in the game.
“We’ve managed to bring a good mentality in the beginning of games,” Smith said. “It’s very easy in the beginning of the game because you’re hyped up for it and you’re dialed in. For some reason, we haven’t been able to sustain that. There’s no easy answer for why that’s happening.”
With the win, the Big Green remained tied with Cornell for second place in the Ivy League, one point behind the leader Brown. Harvard, which sits in seventh place and has not won a conference game since the end of the 2010 season, will play its final home match this season next Saturday against Columbia.
The Crimson has had no shortage of close matches this season—11 of Harvard’s 14 games this season have either ended in a tie or have been decided by one goal.
“We’ve been on the wrong end of a few unfortunate results that we’ve probably deserved to win,” Smith said. “The main aim for the rest of the season is to continue to improve and hopefully get results from our hard work and effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say that all good things must come to an end. The Harvard women’s volleyball team found that out the hard way this weekend, as its three-game winning streak came to a screeching halt with straight-set losses to both Princeton and Penn.
“It was a rough weekend,” said captain and outside hitter Taylor Docter. “We came in maybe a little overconfident from our winning streak. I just don’t think we showed up the same way that we have recently. We let the teams we were playing control the pace of the match instead of us.”
Early deficits in the two road matches proved insurmountable for the Crimson (8-13, 5-5 Ivy) as it took on its Ivy rivals, the Quakers (11-9, 6-3 Ivy) and the Tigers (11-9, 8-2 Ivy).
“We didn’t get a lead ahead of either team, so we were constantly fighting back,” said freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte. “Rather than taking the position of the aggressor, we were taking a passive position. You never want to be put in that role.”
Holte attributes the defeats to an overall lack of cohesiveness and focus during the weekend.
“Our mentality is that we need to focus on our side before we focus on our competitors’ side,” Holte said. “I think we got nervous and forgot how to play within our system and trust the other players. We became individuals rather than honed in as a team. I don’t necessarily think it was how Princeton and Penn adjusted to beat us; I think we really beat ourselves.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0
A week after four Harvard teams lost to the Tigers, the Crimson volleyball team found itself in a similar struggle against second-place Princeton on Saturday.
The squads played a close second set, swapping leads four times and giving the Crimson multiple opportunities to even up the match, but the Tigers prevailed, 29-27, after an ace by outside hitter Sydney Brombai and a kill by outside hitter Chelsea Parker.
The second-set win gave Princeton—which held off a late 5-0 Harvard run to take the first game, 25-20—a 2-0 lead over Harvard that it did not relinquish for the remainder of the match.
Sophomore setter Ginny Willis, the current league leader in assists, spearheaded the Tigers’ effort against the Crimson, notching a double-double with 42 assists and 10 digs.
Following senior setter Beth Kinsella’s ace, Harvard briefly took a lead in the third set, 10-8, but Princeton matched the Crimson point for point and eventually took the lead to win the set, 25-22, and hand Harvard its second loss of the weekend.
“It was the small things, like missed serves and not being as disciplined on our defense as we should have,” Docter said. “That’s what is so frustrating about losing both games. It never feels good to walk away from a match saying that you should have won or you could have won, but that’s kind of how it feels; we beat ourselves, essentially.”
Docter led the Crimson’s offensive effort with 15 kills while sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey brought up the defensive end with 13 digs.
With her performance, Docter tallied her 944th kill, moving the captain into 9th overall in kills in Harvard history.
PENN 3, HARVARD 0
The first time the Crimson played Penn in September, Harvard forged a comeback in the fourth and fifth sets to earn a victory. But on Friday evening, history failed to repeat itself.
Despite double-double performances by Kinsella and freshman setter Hannah Schmidt, the Crimson didn’t extend its winning streak to four games as Penn took all three sets.
“The first two games we struggled within our system, and we got beat by more than we wanted to be beat by,” Holte said. “Then we got a 10-minute break where we could re-focus and be a little more confident and bring a little bit more Harvard volleyball pride into the game. There was just one final push we didn’t get to in order to win that game.”
An ace from Docter and a kill from Casey, as well as multiple attack errors by Quaker players, gave Harvard a 15-10 lead in the third set. But despite multiple ties with Penn down the stretch, the Crimson was unable to overcome a two-set deficit and a late surge by the Quakers in the third set, falling, 26-24.
Penn jumped out to an early 12-5 lead in the first set and never looked back. The Quakers, led by double-doubles from sophomore outside hitter Emma White and freshman setters Alex Caldwell and Ronnie Bither, won the first and second sets handily, 25-17 and 25-19, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team capitalized on power plays and made a strong opening statement this weekend as it emerged victorious on the road against Quinnipiac and Princeton.
The No. 9 Crimson (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) grabbed early leads against the Bobcats (3-3-1, 0-1-0) and the Tigers (2-2-0, 1-1-0) and never looked back en route to two commanding wins to start its season.
“The team dynamic was awesome, everybody was so pumped to play, and it was just a really great start to our season,” freshman forward Mary Parker said.
HARVARD 9, PRINCETON 1
A dominant offensive showing led the Harvard to a rout over Princeton for a strong close to its weekend.
Halfway through the second period, senior forward Jillian Dempsey slid the puck to junior forward Lyndsey Fry, who knocked it past Tigers goaltender Kimberly Newell to give the Crimson a commanding 4-0 lead.
With the score, Fry achieved her first hat trick of the season, having scored her first goal nine minutes into the first period and another five minutes into the second.
“We were all forechecking hard and backchecking hard and doing the little things right and getting shots on net led us to scoring goals,” Parker said.
Harvard, led by Fry’s three scores, kept the puck on its offensive side for the majority of the game, taking 49 shot attempts to Princeton’s 17.
“It started from our net out,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We played very, very well. We were opportunistic and had two late-period goals, which were moment changers.”
Thirteen minutes into the second period, Tigers senior forward Kelly Cooke took advantage of a clear lane to tally Princeton’s lone goal, bringing the score to 4-1.
The Crimson was able to capitalize on special teams, as Harvard recorded five power plays to Princeton’s two.
The Crimson notched its first during a power play two minutes into the first period. Sophomore defender Sarah Edney slotted the puck to Parker, who found the back of the net to score the first goal of her collegiate career.
Dempsey, who also had three assists on the day, tallied two goals in the third period, while Edney, freshman forward Miye D’Oench and senior forward Spurling added a score each to round out the Crimson’s goals.
Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who made an impressive four saves during a penalty kill, notched her first win with a solid defensive effort, recording 16 saves.
HARVARD 2, QUINNIPIAC 0
Although Quinnipiac controlled much of the offensive action on Friday night, a strong defensive stand gave Harvard its first victory of the season. Co-captain and goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded 30 saves to deny the Bobcats any chance to get onto the scoreboard.
“Bellamy played unbelievable in the Quinnipiac game,” Parker said. “She was stopping pucks left and right, which I thought really helped and really kept the momentum on our side.”
The Bobcats failed to capitalize on multiple chances to score late in the first period. After missed shot attempts by Quinnipiac players, sophomore forward Nicole Kosta had a clear shot past Bellamy. Kosta took a shot at net, but her backhand shot hit the post and ran wide.
With the shutout, Bellamy is now tied for second in career shutouts for goaltenders at Harvard.
“Our defenders played really well, and I saw every puck on Friday night,” Bellamy said. “They were moving bodies out of the center of the net, and just made my job a lot easier. To get the offense and then the defense helping was everything I could ask for.”
A power play with two minutes left in the first period led to the Crimson’s early lead. After Parker won the faceoff, sophomore forward Hilary Crowe received the puck and passed it to Dempsey, who received it near the right circle. Dempsey returned it to Parker, and the duo worked the puck across the ice to give Dempsey a go-ahead goal for Harvard’s first score of the season.
A scrum near the Bobcats’ goal at the end of the second period led to the second Crimson goal. Crowe took advantage of the confusion to shoot the puck past senior goaltender Victoria Vigilanti, extending Harvard’s lead to two.
Goaltenders on both sides held the third period scoreless; Quinnipiac held the advantage in shots on goal throughout the game, 30-22, as well as in the final period, 10-4, but couldn’t convert on ample opportunities.
“Even though they outshot us, we had a lot of good shots on them, and the shots we did have were quality,” Bellamy said. “Our forwards did a good job putting pressure on them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the departure of prolific scorer Alex Killorn ’12 from the Harvard men’s hockey team, it would seem as if the Crimson would have a major hole to fill in its offense.
But in the opening game of the 113th season of the program, the Crimson (1-0-0) came out firing, answering to any of these concerns en route to a 5-0 shutout over first-time opponent Bentley (2-2-0, 1-0-0 Atlantic).
“It was a great start for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There was a lot of energy, and I was really proud of the way our older guys led our overall spirit. Those guys really led our group very well today.”
Utilizing a balance of veterans and newcomers, the Crimson was able to blank the Falcons in the first ever matchup between the two squads Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center, with junior Raphael Girard recording his first career shutout.
Harvard benefitted from a strong night from freshman forward Jimmy Vesey, who netted the first two goals of his collegiate career as well as his first assist.
The rookie scored his first on the power play, where Harvard converted one of two chances, picking up where it left off last season on the man-advantage.
Girard stopped all 31 shots on goal, including several of Bentley’s wide-open scoring chances to halt any momentum the Falcons were trying to build.
“[Girard] was excellent—they had some very dangerous chances,” Donato said. “They were in alone [in front of goal] a few times; they were flying guys behind us a little bit. They got some guys that are pretty good at it.”
The Crimson started the scoring early, as senior Luke Greiner received a pass from Vesey and fired a shot across Bentley goalie Branden Komm from the left circle at 4:09 in the first.
Senior Alex Fallstrom added another for Harvard 16:22 into the period as he fired a shot from the left circle as well. Streaking down the ice after a couple of passes from Max and Marshall Everson—the second assist the brothers have recorded on the same goal in their collegiate careers—Fallstrom beat Komm with a shot into the upper left-corner.
The second period provided an opportunity for the Falcons to regain some momentum as they tried to sneak one past Girard—including an attempt that was reviewed but ultimately ruled that the puck did not cross the goal line.
“They are a good veteran team,” Donato said. “There [are] going to be times in the game where they take momentum and I think they did that in the second. We lost a lot of puck battles.”
Girard made 14 of his 31 saves in the second, stoning last year’s Walter Brown award winner, junior Brett Gensler, a few times before Vesey’s goal in the final minutes of the second frame.
After corralling a pass from sophomore Patrick McNally, captain Danny Biega found Vesey near the opposing net. The freshman then poked the puck past a Bentley defender, toe-dragged across another, and put it past the goalie on the right.
“It was a little bit of a backbreaker because they were getting some chances,” Donato said. “Even though we had 20 shots in the second period, the chances we gave up were too dangerous for us to be comfortable.”
Vesey’s second goal was a strong put back in a tough area down low in front of net midway through the third period. After the puck was sent in front of net by Biega and sophomore Colin Blackwell, Vesey beat the Bentley defender to it and knocked it into the net.
“I was in his blind-spot behind him,” Vesey said. “He didn’t really see me… I kind of just swatted at the rebound and got it through.”
Marshall Everson rounded up the scoring for the Crimson with a goal assisted by Fallstrom with just 35 seconds remaining in the contest.
In a season with high expectations for Harvard, the Crimson believed that this first game in front of a sizeable and enthusiastic crowd was a strong statement moving forward.
Overall, Harvard outshot the Falcons, 44-31, despite giving away six penalties in the third period alone in what turned out to be a chippy game towards the end. The victory marks the first season-opening win since 2009 and first season-opening shutout since 2000.
“We have to be hard to play at home, and we showed that tonight with a big 5-0 win,” Girard said. “We just shut them down….so [teams] know when they are going to come to Harvard, it’s not going to be real offensive, but if it’s going to be offensive, it’s going to offensive for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final road swing of the season, the Harvard field hockey team came close to a win but ultimately dropped its two games over the weekend, including a 2-1 overtime nailbiter to Vermont (2-16, 0-5 America East) on Sunday in Burlington, Vt.
The Crimson (3-12, 1-5 Ivy) also fell to conference foe Dartmouth (10-5, 5-1), 4-1, in Hanover, N.H., on Saturday afternoon.
The pair of losses extended Harvard’s losing streak to a season-high seven games, but the team is not looking down, according to sophomore forward Noel Painter.
“The losing streak has been tough, and we have not been able to finish and put the ball in the net to get the results that we want,” said Painter via email because she could not be reached by phone. “We are improving every week in all areas of the game.”
The team feels it showed improvement game-to-game this weekend, too.
The Crimson had more corners than Vermont, 7-6, and was outshot, 13-12, improving its ratios from the Dartmouth game. In that contest, the Big Green tallied 16 corners to Harvard’s six and 24 shots to the Crimson’s four.
But this weekend, the improvements did not turn into a win.
VERMONT 2, HARVARD 1
The Crimson suffered a tough loss to the Catamounts in the second of Harvard’s back-to-back weekend contests.
It was a reversal of Harvard’s 2-1 home overtime win against Vermont last year—this time, on their home turf, the Catamounts came out on top.
Vermont took an early lead on freshman Molly Higgins’ goal off a deflection nine minutes into the game.
Despite the early deficit, the Crimson fought back and thought it had pulled even with Vermont. With two minutes left in the half, a Harvard attack resulted in a rebound that bounced back to freshman midfielder Madison Jung, who finished it off. But the referee called a foul because the ball hit a Crimson player’s foot, nullifying the goal.
“All it takes is a few questionable calls to change the outcome of a game,” captain Kim Goh said by email because she also could not be reached by phone. “But we’re trying to capitalize more on our opportunities so that those kinds of things don’t affect our game as much.”
As it turned out, Harvard would even the score at 1-1 just eight minutes into the second half, when junior forward Rachael Rosenfeld tallied an unassisted goal, rifling the ball into the back of the net from the middle of the circle.
The game remained knotted at one for the duration of the frame. The Crimson defense withstood nine second-half shots by the Catamounts, and co-captain goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos had four critical saves.
But in the fifth minute of overtime, a Harvard foul in the circle gave Vermont a penalty stroke. Angie DeBellis shot the ball past Tassopoulos into the left side of the cage to give the Catamounts the win.
“Losing in overtime is not the way anyone wants to lose because it’s a heartbreaker,” Painter said. “It’s very disappointing, especially when it is off of a stroke.”
DARMOUTH 4, HARVARD 1
In the opening contest of the road trip, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead but ultimately wilted under the second-place Big Green’s offensive attack in a 4-1 loss.
Sophomore midfielder Caroline Code tallied her first score of the season just 1:33 into the game, rolling the ball into the net off of an assist by senior forward Emma Keller.
The goal gave Harvard its first lead since a 1-0 victory over Brown on Sept. 29, a streak stretching six games.
But the advantage would not last, as Dartmouth controlled the remainder of the game. The Big Green’s Janine Leger evened the score just three minutes after Code’s goal and added another goal in the 28th minute.
Dartmouth outshot the Crimson, 16-3, in the first period and 24-7 for the game.
The Big Green was able to sneak two more goals past Tassopoulos in the second half to put the game away as Harvard failed to strike back.
