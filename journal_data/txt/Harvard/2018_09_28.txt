After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 18, the Fox Club was reported to be once again an all-male final club. Now, this would come as no surprise if the club had not signaled to College administrators, less than two weeks prior, that the group would admit women into their organization and become co-ed. Many final clubs and other unrecognized single-gender social organizations have taken steps to comply with the sanction policy enacted by the College and become co-ed, and the Fox Club seemed to have decided to do the same. Yet, the club’s turnaround and decision to remain all-male speaks volumes about the perception of the sanctions.
The Fox Club’s actions demonstrate that the sanctions have been unsuccessful in changing Harvard’s social scene. In choosing not to participate in the College’s program for gradually transitioning to co-ed membership, the Fox seems to believe their lack of recognition from the College will not deter sophomores from joining this punch season. Without an enforcement policy, there will likely be no change; the Fox will operate as they have been for the past century, practicing the same exclusivity that in part prompted the sanctions in the first place.
While we reaffirm our support of the sanctions in theory, we would be remiss to not be critical of their rollout. The blatant unenforceability of the sanctions is a loophole of which final clubs can and have been taking advantage. If the administration does not make efforts in the future to create an effective system to hold these clubs accountable for not following the sanctions, then it is likely that situations like these might echo in the future with other final clubs.
Moreover, the Fox Club’s regression back to an all-male final club highlights the disproportionate effect the sanctions have had against female clubs. Many all-male final clubs have extensive alumni networks, vast financial resources, and property in Harvard Square tied to their deep roots at Harvard, allowing them to withstand the crackdown from the College better than their newer, all-female counterparts. None of the all-female groups have attempted to avoid becoming recognized; they have all succumbed to the policy and have gone co-ed. As we have opined in the past, we believe that female clubs have their purpose, and that the sanctions, as they have been enacted, have unintentionally affected more female groups on campus than male groups.
We support the intentions of the sanctions, but as they are currently being practiced, they are not serving their purpose. The Fox Club’s track record of admitting women in their clubs and a year later rescinding their membership, then going co-ed and immediately doubling back on that shows that they feel free to act on their own accord, without paying much credence to the repercussions from the sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, many of us don’t watch TV regularly, so we’ll be mostly immune to the barrage of political ads that will flood screens across the country in the coming month. We won’t entirely miss it — every time you watch a YouTube video or scroll through your Facebook feed, we’ll probably run into an ad, but we’ll experience nowhere near the level of advertising swing districts are getting.
All this campaigning has a cost: nearly $4 billion.
As one writer put it, the money spent on this year’s races will likely total more than what it cost to produce 19 Marvel superhero movies. If you’d rather compare it to something a little more tangible: it will cost more than One World Trade did. It’s enough to pay the tuition, room, and board of every student at Harvard College — nearly ten times over.
The number that is most often tossed around is the cost of the presidential campaign cycle. But while that figure has also grown, it has stayed a lot closer to what it was 60 years ago than the congressional side. Adjusted for inflation, Richard M. Nixon’s campaign in 1972 and Barack H. Obama’s in 2012 were not all that far off from each other. In fact, Donald J. Trump’s 2016 run cost less in inflation-adjusted dollars than either candidate spent in 1960.
It’s Congressional races that have seen the bulk of the growth. According to official figures, our $4 billion cost today represents more than 16 times what was spent on the 1960 Congressional races.
Even though other metrics like health care spending, GDP, and even income have grown considerably since 1984, campaign spending has far out-paced them. While income a little more than doubled between 1984 and 2012, campaign spending ballooned an astounding 555 percent. It’s grown more since then.
What that dollar amount translates to is hours and hours of fundraising. And though we at Harvard may not feel these effects every day, they make a real impact.
The non-partisan U.S. Term Limits group estimates that members of Congress spend anywhere from four to eight hours of their day fundraising. It’s no wonder that they have to spend this much time though. For 535 people to raise those $4 billion in two years, each member of Congress needs to be raising over $70,000 every week, or more than twice the median income in this country.
It’s a lot of money, and it’s a lot of even more valuable time.
But it’s not just constituents that should be and are worried about the time and effort Congress dedicates to this fundraising. Recent Institute of Politics speaker and former Florida Congressman David W. Jolly ruffled quite a few feathers back in 2016 when he introduced The Stop Act, barring federal office holders from soliciting funds while in office. Though it received bipartisan support (notably from Democratic party sweetheart Robert F. “Beto” O’Rourke), party leadership failed to let it into committee hearings.
Our professors have recognized this issue, too. Law School professor Lawrence Lessig in 2015 declared a campaign for president focused solely on the issue of passing meaningful campaign finance reform. He argued that solving this issue would be the first step to easing our political challenges.
Our country faces pressing issues every day, but if our elected representatives allot less than half their time to solving them, it’s no wonder many of our issues are passed from election cycle to election cycle. While elections continue to get more and more costly, the time dedicated to solving them will continue to decrease so long as fundraising and campaigning needs increase.
Because big money favors party leadership, it is unlikely that such a change would come from the top down. As Harvard students, many of us will leave this campus and emerge as our nation’s leaders. Whether we become business leaders with the power to control corporate donations, political leaders considering campaign finance reform, or just voters choosing between candidates, remember to preserve the integrity of our political system. We must demand campaign finance reform. Not necessarily because money isn’t a form of speech or because the money makes our representatives beholden to special interests — while those are two valid points, this one is more straightforward.
Our representatives need to spend more time representing us and less time fundraising from us. Maybe then their accomplishments will speak for themselves, and we won’t need as much campaigning to convince us in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past few weeks, multiple women have come forward alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh harassed, assaulted, or even raped them. The accounts begin from when Kavanaugh was a high school student, just 17 years old. They continue into his subsequent college career at Yale.
At Yale, Kavanaugh’s behavior was part of a larger “boys will be boys” culture that was furthered by aggressive drinking games and secret societies. This reality does not surprise me. But I am disappointed — not only were the (lack of) morals which informed Kavanaugh's abhorrent behavior left unchallenged at Yale, but his treatment of women seems to have been accepted as the reality of that time and place.
This article is not about debating Kavanaugh’s guilt or innocence. I consider the women who have come forward brave beyond measure. I respect them. I believe them. And their allegations make clear that Kavanaugh’s alleged behavior was a pattern, one that continued and even thrived at Yale, and one that certainly did not change for the better. So, this article is about one simple question.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh change? And why don’t more students at these institutions change?
I am not naive; I do not think everyone is destined to embark upon a lifelong journey culminating in moral enlightenment. But I do believe that people, especially 17-year-olds, are capable of change. And more importantly, I believe it is the mission of institutions like Yale — institutions whose goal is to create the next generation of leaders — to serve as environments where students grow into better people.
You don’t have to take my word for it. Yale College clearly states its mission as one to “educate [students] ... to develop their intellectual, moral, civic, and creative capacities to the fullest … to lead and serve in every sphere of human activity.” And as a student at a peer institution, this statement reminds me of our own mission here at Harvard, which is “to educate the citizen-leaders for our society … through our commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.”
And so, I wonder, at institutions which profess not only to create the world’s leaders, but also to develop the “moral capacities” of these leaders, how is it acceptable that students who enter do not change for the better?
I ask this because, in my experience, Kavanaugh’s case is not unique. At elite universities such as ours, it is rare to see students change positively. In fact, most of my peers entered Harvard not at all interested in transforming into better people, but rather, focused on transitioning into the next elite echelon.
For some, the transition is to another elite university, and four years are spent working by the book in pursuit of an elusive medical school or law school acceptance letter. For others, the transition is to an elite six-figure job, with fall semester spent in a flurry of pantsuits and blazers, and jobs secured before college is even halfway over.
For students who come from excellent high schools and wealthy families, the transition is simply being funneled into even higher levels of privilege, through final clubs, exclusive social networks, and easily secured finance internships. For students who are interested in politics, the transition is being funnelled into an all-encompassing belief system. These students enter college attached to a political ideology, and then quickly solidify their stances by joining partisan political groups and interning with powerful politicians. Instead of questioning or critiquing their beliefs, students entrench themselves in their political opinions as quickly as possible so as to maximize professional success.
There is no space to transform here. There is only time to move, and to move up, and to do it fast. There is only a script: Finding an internship, joining a final club, studying, partying, repeat. And far too often, this script includes hurting others. Sometimes that means picking a problem set over a friend in need of help. Sometimes it is more harmful, like participating in exclusive and sexist social spaces without any qualms. And sometimes, as we see in the accusations brought against Kavanaugh, it can be extreme. Assault. Rape. Driving a peer to trauma, and not even caring.
The complete disinterest in change, coupled with the supremacy of individual ambition which enables harmful behavior, results in a culture defined by moral carelessness. Following the script becomes an instinct, and no part of the script is devoted to self-interrogation. No space is given for the discomfort that comes with self-critique. Thus, there is no possibility of changing for the better.
Harvard, Yale, and our peer institutions must combat this. The administrations should work against this mentality of transition, whether by strengthening advising networks so that students are more comfortable with exploration and failure or by promoting a liberal arts education which emphasizes moral reasoning beyond ancient Chinese philosophy or Greek mythology.
But most importantly, we as students must lean into discomfort. This means engaging outside of our silos and interrogating the assumptions behind our beliefs. It means looking out for others, which includes both the friend who is overwhelmed during midterms season and the stranger at a party who needs help. It means being self-critical and conscious of how we ourselves engage in harmful behavior and uphold power structures. It means choosing to change and improve ourselves and the spaces we are part of.
When we step out of Harvard Yard, we depart to better serve our kind. But by furthering a culture of transition and carelessness, we have been unable to serve even our own peers here in the Yard. And as long as we remain unwilling to change, our institutions will never create true leaders. Instead, we will continue producing men like Brett Kavanaugh — those who, instead of changing for the better, act to further the worst.
So if we wish to change the world, we must learn to change ourselves first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis will step down from his role at the end of September for “personal reasons,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email to students Thursday.
Davis is leaving Harvard one year after he started the job. During his tenure, he advocated for a multicultural center on campus and helped students process the controversial arrest of a black undergraduate in April that prompted allegations of police brutality.
In her email, O’Dair praised Davis’s contributions to the College.
“In his time at Harvard, Dean Davis has helped the College better understand the social, cultural, and psychological factors that impact many communities on our campus, and we are all deeply grateful to him for his work,” she wrote.
Davis’s time as associate dean was not free from controversy. He stumbled into trouble when administrators placed Christian fellowship Harvard College Faith and Action on a year-long “administrative probation” after the group removed a female student from her leadership position following her decision to enter into a same-sex relationship.
Soon after the probation took effect, Davis told a small group of students that Harvard was reluctant to punish HCFA in part because the school did not want to be seen as waging war on Christianity, the students told The Crimson. Davis later apologized for his remarks, writing in an email that he had spoken “off-handedly and flippantly.”
In an interview Thursday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he is grateful for Davis’s work and is “really sad” that he is stepping down.
As administrators search for a permanent replacement for Davis, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller will take over three of the four divisions that comprise the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion — the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Office of Diversity Education and Support, and the Women’s Center, according to O’Dair’s email. The Harvard College Title IX Office will report to O’Dair and Associate Dean Joan Rouse will continue serving as the Interim Director of the Harvard Foundation, O’Dair wrote.
Separately, the College will also “conduct a formal review of the administrative structures of the EDI Office and the Harvard Foundation” with the goal of integrating the organizations more effectively, O’Dair wrote.
She wrote administrators will offer more details about the search process for Davis’s successor in November.
Davis could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.

Donning pink pins and hoisting handmade signs, Harvard students huddled at viewing parties across the University Thursday to watch an extraordinary Senate hearing which saw Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the Palo Alto psychology professor who has accused him of sexual assault, offer dueling — and compelling — versions of the truth.
Students on campus joined millions of others across the country riveted by what many have described as the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation process in decades. For Harvard Law students in particular, though, the day-long proceedings held hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C. hit close to home.
Kavanaugh has taught at the school for over a decade as a visiting lecturer. Students watched, some with bated breath, as Ford described how Kavanaugh had allegedly attacked her when the two attended a party as teenagers in suburban Maryland.
"I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me," Ford recounted, growing visibly emotional. "I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming."
In his testimony, Kavanaugh strongly — and angrily — denied Ford's allegations.
"This has destroyed my family and my good name," Kavanaugh said. "This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election."
The intense and highly scrutinized hearing stretched on for more than eight hours, as senators and a prosecutor hired by Republicans questioned first Ford and then the nominee. Senators pressed Ford about details of the alleged encounter, Kavanaugh about his teenage drinking habits, and each other about their possible partisan motivations.
Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemed all but certain to be confirmed to the Court until about two weeks ago, when an anonymous letter accusing the nominee of sexual assault leaked to the press.
Ford came forward as the author of the letter a few days after it leaked, alleging in an interview with the Washington Post that Kavanaugh had pushed her onto a bed, pressed his body to hers, and attempted to take off her clothes at a house party in 1982.
Days afterward, another woman — Deborah Ramirez — told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while freshmen at Yale College.
Kavanaugh repeatedly and unequivocally denied the allegations and requested the chance to defend his reputation in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. After several days of negotiations over the terms of such a hearing, Ford agreed to fly across the country to answer questions in person.
 Seated before the committee Thursday morning, Ford said that, though she was “terrified” to go public with her allegations, she felt it was her “civic duty.” When senators asked her if she was completely sure Kavanaugh is the man who attacked her, she replied that she was “100 percent” certain.
In his testimony, Kavanaugh again vehemently denied the allegations. He became teary and agitated, launching a broadside against the Democratic members of the committee and dubbing the hearing “a circus."
The series of unfolding accusations across the past week sparked emotional reactions — and protests — in Cambridge, even spurring some students to urge Law School administrators to bar Kavanaugh from teaching at the school pending a "full and fair investigation" into all allegations of sexual misconduct. Law School administrators have three times refused to say whether they will permit Kavanaugh to teach his course on the Supreme Court this winter.
“It is our longstanding policy not to comment publicly on personnel matters,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Hundreds of Harvard Law students walked out of class Monday to show support for Ford and Ramirez and to protest Kavanaugh. At the College, the Harvard Democrats and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better criticized the Law School’s silence on Kavanaugh at a meeting Tuesday evening. And on Wednesday, members of the Harvard International Socialists rallied around the John Harvard statue in the Yard to demand Harvard to sever ties with the embattled nominee.
The day of the hearing, the Harvard Law Student Alliance for Reproductive Justice held a screening in a classroom closed to the press. Haley R. Adams, a second-year Law School student who attended the screening, said in an interview during a break in the proceedings that she sympathizes with Ford.
“I don’t want to speak for all women but I think that most of us can probably see ourselves in that experience,” Adams said. “Maybe not in quite as formal as a setting, but in a situation in which we are trying our best to convey an experience and being doubted and questioned, and it’s really horrifying to watch and it’s exhausting.”
 The Law School Dean of Students Office also held a separate screening in a school pub.
Shortly after 11:30 a.m., a group of Law School students launched an anti-Kavanaugh demonstration outside of Pound Hall — the same location where students held the walkout and rally Monday. The protesters flaunted posters reading “We Deserve Better” and “I Still Believe Anita Hill.” Some signs offered more pointed criticism of Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82. One, referencing the dean's refusal to comment on Kavanaugh’s employment status, asserted that “This ‘personnel matter’ is PERSONAL to us.”
The group of roughly 20 to 25 students stood outside and posed for pictures while holding posters during a break in senators’ questioning of Ford.
Though students at the Law School have loudly voiced their outrage over Kavanaugh, Harvard Law professors have made no organized effort to oppose his nomination. Their silence stands in contrast to action taken by law school faculty at Yale, Kavanaugh’s alma mater, several of whom penned a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee urging the senators to “conduct a fair and deliberate confirmation process” that includes an investigation led by a “neutral factfinder.” Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) formally submitted the letter for the record during the hearing Thursday.
Second-year Law student Sejal Singh — one of the four authors of a Harvard Law Record article that called on the University to ban Kavanaugh from teaching — said she was disappointed that Harvard professors have not sent a similar letter to the Senate.
“My understanding is that the letter from Yale Law professors calling for a real, full, fair investigation was entered into the record today,” Singh said. “And I really wish there had been a similar letter from our professors here at HLS.”
Kavanaugh’s time teaching at Harvard not only stirred controversy in Cambridge, it also featured in the nominee's opening testimony.
Before the allegations emerged, 80 of Kavanaugh’s former students had sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee extolling the judge’s character and teaching abilities. Later, more than 200 current and former students signed and sent a rebuttal letter opposing his nomination.
“In a letter to this committee, my former students — male and female alike — wrote that I displayed ‘a character that impressed us all,’” Kavanaugh said Thursday. “I loved teaching law. But thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee have unleashed, I may never be able to teach again.”
According to several Law School enrollees, students sitting in Harvard Law classrooms Thursday “applauded” and “burst out in cheers” when Kavanaugh said he might never return to a teaching role.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) also pointed to the praise from Kavanaugh’s former students to defend Kavanaugh’s character.
“His clerks love him. His students love him. His colleagues love him. This man is not a monster,” Hatch said.
Back at Harvard, students also gathered at screenings held at the Institute of Politics Thursday, though attendance petered out over the course of the afternoon. Alexandra S. Norris ’21, who attended the IOP viewing event, said she wanted to experience the hearing alongside other students who cared about the confirmation process.
“I always like to watch things like this and it’s nice to do it around other people who are interested,” she said.
In the conference room where the hearing was shown, specific moments drew a range of responses from those who had gathered to watch.
When Ford mentioned the GoFundMe campaigns her supporters have set up to help cover security costs and Rachel Mitchell — the prosecutor Republicans brought in to question Ford — appeared confused about the online fundraising site, laughter broke out in Cambridge.
The proceedings more frequently drew sober reactions, though. When Ford said she had taken a polygraph test to determine the veracity of her allegations on the day of her grandmother’s funeral, the audience gave groans of disbelief.
Upstairs from the IOP conference rooms where undergraduates gathered to watch, a group of Harvard Kennedy School students took in the hearing in a student lounge. At the viewing — hosted by the school’s Gender Policy Union and Women in Power organization — Sarah Kinney, a mid-career MPA candidate, said cheers erupted when Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke up in support of Ford.
Watching the proceedings with other students provided a source of support on an emotionally fraught day, Kinney said.
“I think that there’s a lot of power in having people around you to do difficult things,” she said. “I didn’t really want to watch it, I wasn’t interested in watching it by myself and I just did not want to experience that without a support community.”
The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote Friday morning on whether to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate.

The plaza at the heart of Harvard Square will soon be under construction to both renovate the elevator outside the Harvard Square T station and restore the historic Out of Town News kiosk.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the elevator construction project is intended to make the Square and T station more accessible for people with disabilities. Additionally, In 2006, the MBTA settled a lawsuit in which it promised to update the elevator.
Cambridge Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said she was satisfied with the MBTA’s work on the elevator so far.
“The MBTA elevator is very welcome. The elevator had lots of different problems and getting the MBTA to take on a capital expense is always a heavy lift, and it’s appreciated,” Devereux said. “It, of course, does somewhat disrupt the foot traffic around the entrance to the headhouse, but I think they’ve done a pretty good job of containing it.”
Devereux said the MBTA will also be renovating the tunnels of the station's underground bus terminal starting in the summer of 2019.
Concurrently to the MBTA updates to the plaza, the Cambridge City Council is in the process of planning the restoration of the Out of Town News kiosk, a long-time Square staple.
“In 2011, the Harvard Square Business Association developed with principle, of course, an idea for the restoration of the kiosk,” Jillson said. “The basis of that is if you actually go over there and look at it — I mean really look at it — you will see that this little building that we all love and revere so much is basically falling apart.”
Devereux said a working group is currently developing plans to repurpose the current building, which has served as a news stand since 1984, but dates back to 1928, when it was the entrance to the subway.
“It will no longer be a commercial newsstand as it is now,” Devereux said. “The city owns the building and has been leasing it all of this time to the Out of Town’s operator, and it was decided that it should serve a more public purpose.”
Despite this, the city plans to maintain the kiosk’s recognizable appearance.
“You can’t change a brick. Nobody would want to,” Jillson said.
Devereux added that Cambridge will also be modifying other parts of the plaza. In particular, the current information kiosk will be removed. These changes are intended to make the plaza a more open place for visitors, Devereux said.
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and president of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, wrote in an email that the MBTA should also redesign the entrance to the Harvard T station while construction is underway in the plaza on these other projects.
“Since the redesign of the kiosk plaza is about to get underway, now would be an ideal time to replace the MBTA entry as well,” she wrote.
Devereux said she too wants to see both the T station headhouse and the escalators into the T station restored in the future.
“It’s like fixing your house and doing everything but repainting the front door and front porch,” Devereux said. “It’s like ‘Yeah, but we have beautiful bathrooms upstairs and look at our kitchen, it’s really sexy, and out in the backyard, we planted a bunch of trees. Well how come you didn’t fix your front porch [if] it’s got a hole in the steps and the door doesn’t work?’”

President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela spoke at the Kennedy School's Institue of Politics and met with Harvard faculty and students from Central America — as well as University President Lawrence S. Bacow — Thursday.
Before the Forum event, President Varela met in “a closed door session” moderated by History of Science Professor Gabriela Soto Laveaga with Central American students and faculty at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, according to Paola Ibarra Deschamps, the assistant director of programs at the David Rockefeller Center. Varela also “met briefly” with President Bacow, according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
Varela was joined on his visit by Emanuel Gonzalez-Revilla, the Panamanian ambassador to the U.S., Melitón Alejandro Arrocha Ruíz, the Panamanian ambassador to the United Nations, and Luis Alejandro Posse, the consul general of Panama to New York.
This is Varela’s first visit to Harvard since taking office in 2014. Varela, a Georgia Tech trained engineer, won the election against the handpicked successor of former president Ricardo Martinelli, who is now awaiting trial for charges of using his office to enrich himself and wiretapping his political opponents.
In his speech at the Forum, Varela emphasized his dedication to advancing anti-corruption and transparency within the government.
“At night, when I was announced the winner of the elections, I promised myself and made a commitment to work towards two essential goals  — first, transforming the use of politics as a business to politics as a service and rebuilding our democracy, making it functional for future generations with power only to use to serve the people and not ourselves.”
He described his last four years as president as “a complicated surgical procedure to remove the tumors of corruption” from Panama.
“We fought the infectious corruption — at the same time protecting 40,000 jobs and more than 10 million dollars invested in public works by recovery of over 500 million dollars from stolen money without hurting the innocent,” Varela said.
Varela also spoke about his life in Boston 30 years ago as a student learning English and experience a vastly different system of government from Panama's dictatorship.
“I would take the red line train from my little apartment on Beacon Street to come to Harvard Square,” Varela recalled. “I saw people’s freedom to express their opinions, enjoy freedom of the press and open criticism of the government — something that at that time, was punished in my country.”
Varela did not mention President Donald Trump in his speech or in an interview with student media before the event, but he said in the interview that Panama has a “good relation with the United States institutions, all of the agencies” but that the countries “could coordinate more in specific areas.”
“It is a friendship of 115 years,” Varela said.
Gabrielle Salvado ’22, who asked Varela the last question of the night, said she could relate many of the topics she is learning about to the president’s speech.
“I was also really happy that I got to ask my question because I actually ended up skipping my gov section for this, and so I’m writing an essay relating this to my American foreign policy class,” Salvado said. “He actually had a lot of very interesting strategies that had to do with engagement and things like that that I could draw back to my class, which was really cool.”

As Typhoon Mangkhut — so far labeled the most powerful storm of the year — struck the Philippines, Hong Kong, and southern China, Harvard students from the affected regions checked in with their loved ones more than 7,000 miles away and kept an eye on the reports of widespread destruction.
The typhoon hit the Luzon region of the northern Philippines as a category five hurricane and reached Hong Kong last Sunday as a rare Signal 10 on a 1-10 scale.  The typhoon also hit China’s southern Guangdong Province before it was downgraded to a tropical depression on Monday afternoon once it moved into the neighboring Guangxi Province.
Romnick L. Blanco ’22  is from a province three hours away from Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Upon learning about the typhoon, he said he read news reports of the damage to his home country. According to the Filipino police, an estimated 66 people have died as of last Monday.
“I saw a picture of a sick child being transferred from an ambulance which was stopped behind a boat that fell,” Blanco said. “It made me really sad that it could be in the condition of this, that the Philippines are going through right now.”
Blanco said he was used to typhoons after having lived his entire life in the Philippines, but was surprised when he read reports of its intensity. A category four super typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2013, is the deadliest storm on record in the Philippines, killing 7,000 people.
"What surprised me was the fact that the news articles described it as something that was like Hurricane Florence which happened in the Mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S.,” Blanco said. “If it's that strong, then that's terrifying, because that's really terrifying in the sense that there will be a lot of damages, and a lot of people will die.”
Noah B. Ramos ’21, who has family in Manila, said that most College students with family in the Philippines are from the Manila area, where he said the typhoon “only hit the edge.”
Ramos and Blanco said they were not aware of any Philippines relief efforts from on-campus organizations.
Hong Kong student Cedric H. T. Li ’21 said the storm was “the strongest typhoon [to hit Hong Kong] in recorded history” and that many of his friends back in Hong Kong are still struggling to get to school or work.
Li said the Harvard community has been “loving and caring” in the wake of the storm.
“My resident dean Amanda reached out this morning,” Li said. “I felt like the staff and the administration really looked out for me and I felt closer to Currier House as a whole.”
Li also said the Hong Kong Society and Asian American Association plan to hold a fundraiser to support rebuilding efforts in Hong Kong.
“This shows a lot of attention and a lot of love here from Harvard in terms of international issues and how they are affecting the students,” Li said. “It’s very nice to know that we are all looking out for each other and we are all caring for our city. That spirit of Hong Kong is still there.”

Harvard Business School raised close to $1.4 billion in the University’s recently concluded capital campaign, surpassing the school’s original goal by nearly $400 million, according to Business School Spokesperson James E. Aisner ’68.
The University-wide fundraising effort, which began in 2013 and ended in June, brought in a grand total of $9.6 billion for Harvard, a record high for U.S. higher education fundraising.
The campaign —the Business School’s second-ever — brought in $225 million designated for financial aid and $346 million for faculty and research.  The inaugural campaign, which concluded in 2006, raised $600 million, at that time a record for business schools.
In an email to campaign donors, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said he was grateful for their “commitment to this remarkable institution.”
“Your generosity fueled our efforts to deliver a transformational educational experience that develops leaders of competence and character,” Nohria wrote. “These leaders — people like you who create real value for society — truly make a difference in the world.”
The Business School also reported “significant strides” in alumni engagement throughout the campaign. Nearly 27,000 individuals contributed to the campaign, including 59 percent of MBA alumni. Additionally, first-year reunion attendance has increased 65 percent since 2013, according to Aisner.
Aisner wrote that 45 percent of the campaign funds will be allocated to the endowment, 38 percent will be for “current use,” and 13 percent reserved for capital projects. A remaining four percent is currently to be determined or undesignated.  Aisner identified development at Tata Hall, Chao Center, Esteves Hall, Pagliuca Harvard Life Lab, and Klarman Hall as “key campus projects.”
Over the course of the campaign, the School has used funds to develop and strengthen many signature programs, including the online extension school HBX, as well as a joint MS/MBA degree with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Funds from the campaign will also support 27 associate professorships at the Business School, Aisner wrote.
In his email, Nohria added the School will publish more details about the campaign in its upcoming December alumni newsletter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council voted Wednesday to move one step closer to eliminating “shopping week,” a Harvard scheduling quirk popular among undergraduates.
The Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — approved the creation of a committee to develop a proposal for early registration at its biweekly meeting Wednesday afternoon, according to the Harvard Gazette. An early registration scheme would eliminate shopping week, the current course registration system that allows students to try out courses during the first week of the semester before officially enrolling.
The Wednesday vote is the latest development in an ongoing discussion to alter the way students enroll in classes.
The subject was first broached at a March meeting of the entire Faculty, when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana introduced the subject without putting forward an official proposal. Multiple professors spoke in favor of an early registration system at the meeting, stating that such a system would allow professors and graduate students to better plan their courses.
Many undergraduate students, however, have praised shopping week for its flexibility in allowing them to try various options before finally selecting their courses.
Though an official proposal did not exist at the time of the March discussions, the Council heard a proposal to switch to early registration from Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh at its last meeting on Sept. 12. The proposal advocated replacing shopping week with a system that would require students to enroll in courses prior to the beginning of the semester. Students would then have time to add or drop courses if they wished. Under Claybaugh’s proposal, the new system would be introduced in the fall of 2020.
The Council typically votes on proposals the second time it hears them; the first meeting is reserved for discussion only. It is unclear if the Council voted directly on Claybaugh’s proposal at its most recent meeting. Regardless, the decision to create a committee to develop a proposal for early registration indicates the  Faculty is taking formal steps to alter the current course registration system.
The Council also voted Wednesday to change the wording of the undergraduate foreign language requirement, the Gazette reported. This vote follows a proposal introduced by former Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris at the Council’s last meeting, in which he advocated broadening the ways students could fulfill the foreign language requirement.
The Harvard College Student Handbook currently requires that students prove competency in a “language with a written component that is taught at Harvard” or a language for which “an appropriate examination with a written component can be given.” The new wording deemphasizes the writing component, allowing students to meet the requirement using languages such as American Sign Language and Ancient Greek.
The basics of the foreign language requirement, however, remain essentially the same. Students will still be expected to either take a year of foreign language classes or demonstrate competency in the language through test scores.
Activists have long advocated that Harvard allow students to use ASL to fulfill the requirement. Since Harvard first started offering ASL two years ago, the courses have attracted significant undergraduate interest.
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 was present at Wednesday’s meeting and answered questions from the Council about general FAS affairs. The Council also had the opportunity to preview the Dean’s Annual Report to the Faculty.
The next full Faculty meeting will be Tuesday, Oct. 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 40 Harvard students and administrators gathered in Kirkland House’s Senior Common Room Thursday night to honor Ahmed S. Gondal ’18, who died suddenly earlier this week.
In an email sent over the House mailing list Wednesday evening, Kirkland’s faculty deans Thomas C. Conley and Verena A. Conley wrote that Gondal “passed away unexpectedly at home in Pakistan.”
Gondal, whom close friends and family members called “Shujju,” graduated from Harvard in May with a concentration in Government and a secondary in Economics. During his time at the College, he served on the Honor Council for three years and was a member of both the Cricket Club — leading the group as its captain in 2016 — and the Debate Team.
On one side of the room Thursday stood a table with pens and stationery. Administrators encouraged attendees to write remembrance notes, which they promised to send to Gondal’s family in Pakistan. Those in attendance spent most of the evening sharing stories about Gondal, often tearing up as they spoke.
Many fondly remembered Gondal’s ever-present smile.
"He had this radiant smile that he would have on his face every time I saw him," Kirkland resident dean Soha Bayoumi said.
Friends said Gondal had plans to pursue a career in public service in Pakistan. During his four years at Harvard, Gondal maintained a steady and serious interest in his childhood home. He rose through the ranks of the College’s Pakistani Students Association to become its president.
He wrote his senior thesis on the cybersecurity of the Pakistani electoral system. And he served on the board of the Harvard Pakistan Forum.
In a Facebook post on Thursday, members of the Pakistani Students Association wrote that the group plans to hold its own memorial service for Gondal “in the coming weeks.”
Farhan U. Javed ’18, who served as co-president of PSA with Ahmed, spoke at the memorial service Thursday. He detailed one of his favorite memories of Ahmed, describing the time the two of them drove across Cambridge to pick up desserts for a club dinner.
Javed and Gondal had ordered “gulab jamun,” a dessert consisting of fried dough covered in a sugary syrup that Javed said is very popular in South Asia. Javed said Gondal could seem somewhat formal — but that he had a playful side and his playfulness was on full display during the car ride.
“We were just blasting Pakistani music, driving 400 gulab jamun through Cambridge back to Harvard Square,” Javed said. “But when we got back, we opened the trunk and the syrup from the trays had fallen all over the car.”
Rida Qadri, who coached Gondal through a successful debate career in high school, also attended and spoke at Thursday’s gathering.
Qadri is now a graduate student at MIT and lives in Cambridge with her husband, Feroze H. Shah. The couple has known Gondal since 2011. Qadri and Shah, who Gondal used to call his “adopted parents,” said Gondal loved McDonald’s chicken nuggets, barbeque sauce, and Coca-Cola. Wherever he went, they said, he was always looking for a can of Coke.
Qadri remembered travelling to Ireland and Mexico with Gondal as he competed in international debate competitions. She said Gondal always jumped forward to lend a hand, no matter what was going on.
“He was very tiny but always wanted to help,” Qadri said. “We did a lot of moving around, and he called himself ‘muscle man.’ He would always say, ‘Muscle man will be there.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company returned 10 percent on its investments during fiscal year 2018, bringing the total value of the University's endowment to $39.2 billion.
The returns, announced in a note from CEO N.P. Narvekar to Harvard affiliates Friday afternoon, mark an improvement from last year’s return of 8.1 percent and a serious turn-around from the loss of $2 billion in fiscal year 2016.
Narvekar, who previously oversaw Columbia University’s endowment before joining Harvard’s investment arm in December 2016, wrote in his message that he remains “confident” in the endowment management group’s future. This is the second round of endowment returns Narvekar has produced during his tenure at Harvard.
“As is well known, HMC, as an organization, and the endowment portfolio are still in the early stages of a multi-year transition, with much work ahead,” Narvekar wrote. “Thanks to the exceptional team we have at HMC, we are confident in the direction of the organization and the long-term prospects for the endowment.”
But Harvard — as it did last year — is still trailing those of its Ivy League peers who have posted their returns. The University’s 2018 results fall short of the University of Pennsylvania’s returns, which clocked in at 12.9 percent, and Dartmouth’s returns of 12.2 percent.
The University also lagged behind the S&P 500, which returned 14.37 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
Harvard’s endowment — by far the largest university endowment across the globe — funds many of the school’s operating costs and is used to ensure Harvard can count on consistent funding in the near future. Roughly one-third of the University’s operating budget is drawn from the endowment each year, though its schools depend on the investment fund to varying degrees. For example, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s largest unit, received about half its operating budget from the endowment in 2016.
The unusually brief note from Narvekar — three short paragraphs in total — stands in stark contrast to the five-page letter he sent out announcing last year’s returns in which he also detailed his plan to overhaul the endowment. Narvekar noted Friday, however, that he will offer further details in the University’s financial report next month “for those interested.”
Since Narvekar took the helm of HMC in December 2016, the endowment has shifted from a “silo” model — in which managers focus on individual asset classes — to a generalist model, in which managers are responsible for the entire portfolio and compensated for overall performance. Narvekar has also moved to downsize HMC and outsource some investments, including spinning off the school’s real estate division to Bain Capital. In January 2017, he announced that HMC planned to lay off half of its staff as part of the five-year overhaul.
In recent years, HMC has struggling to address its historically poor portfolio performance and has continually underperformed its peer institutions.
The news of the 2018 endowment returns comes shortly after Harvard wrapped up its record-shattering capital campaign. In total, the University raised $9.6 billion, surpassing its original goal by more than $3 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When two rivals square off, even a scrimmage can turn into something as intense as a national championship game. That is why this Saturday’s contest between Harvard (3-4-1, 0-0-1 Ivy) and Yale (5-3-1, 0-1-0) at Jordan Field is sure to be exciting. Both sides head into the game with the added incentive of earning their first conference win at the expense of the other.
“Any time there’s an Ivy League game, it’s like an NCAA tournament game, it’s a knockout type game,” said Crimson head coach Chris Hamblin.
Harvard dropped its first two games of the season against California and San Francisco respectively, but then regained its balance to win three out of the next five before facing Penn to open Ivy League play. The game against the Quakers was a slugfest, with defense taking center stage. Even overtime could not separate the two teams as the match concluded in a 0-0 draw.
Regardless of their sub-.500 record to this point, the Crimson has much to be pleased with.
“I think we’ve had different ups and downs throughout the season and I think what’s impressed me is that regardless of whether we were at a high... or we were at a low… everyone has stayed really bought in to the process, to the system,” co-captain midfielder Zayne Matulis said.
Furthermore, Harvard’s roster is a youthful one—the team added 10 freshman to its ranks and welcomed back seven sophomores. Many of these players found themselves thrust into large roles from the get go, and they responded nicely, keeping a clean sheet in each of their three victories and adding another against the Quakers.
The contributions of several upperclassmen have been crucial to the success of the team as well. Co-captain midfielder Leah Mohammadi leads the group in scoring with four goals, and senior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel has started between the sticks in seven out of the eight games thus far. Having said that, possibly their most important contribution is one that does not appear on the stat sheet.
“I think the upperclassmen did a really good job welcoming in those younger players and making them feel comfortable so they can be themselves,” Hamblin explained.
It is this supportive culture that breeds team unity and progress. The group might not be firing on all cylinders quite yet, but the environment will go a long way towards helping them achieve their goals.
The Bulldogs, on the other hand, find themselves with a winning record heading into this weekend’s competition. After a mediocre start to their campaign, Yale ripped off four consecutive wins before hosting Princeton in New Haven. The Bulldogs could not, however, keep up with the Tigers, who secured a 3-0 victory with two second half goals.
Nonetheless, the statistics reveal that Yale boasts a balanced attack, as four players have scored at least two goals. Even so, the Crimson will do well to keep an eye on junior midfielder Noelle Higginson, who has three goals and five assists to her name.
In the books, the result of this weekend’s game is weighted just as equally as any other, and the squad knows that.
“I think we approach every game the same regardless of who we’re playing,” Matulis said. “At the end of the day we just have to be focused on us.”
This may be true, but come Saturday there will certainly be an extra bit of excitement and energy in the air at Jordan Field in Cambridge, Mass. Harvard-Yale is always more than just a normal game. Each student-athlete will be eager to write the next chapter in this fabled rivalry, and historically speaking, this game should be exhilarating to watch.
Four out of the last five regular season meetings between the Crimson and the Bulldogs have featured at least three goals. Both squads will be fighting for pride and that ever-so-important first conference win.
“I think for us to get a win and a strong performance against Yale, that will give us momentum moving forward… to really have a springboard into the rest of the Ivy League,” Hamblin said.

Harvard men’s soccer opens Ivy League play Saturday with a home game against rival Yale. The Crimson will look to beat the Bulldogs for a second consecutive season, having rallied from a goal down to score two goals in the final eight minutes of last season’s game. The match kicks off at 4:00 at Jordan Field.
Harvard (2-5, 0-0 Ivy League) has faced a number of difficult opponents so far this season, falling to three ranked teams by a combined nine goals. The tough stretch of games came during a time in which Harvard was still getting accustomed to two new assistant coaches — Mike Fucito ’08 and Francesco D’Agostino — and a new formation. But the Crimson is coming into Ivy League play on a high after it beat familiar opponent Boston University, 2-1, in overtime last Wednesday on junior Taner Dogan’s second goal of the season.
“It feels great to get the goal,” Dogan said, “but looking at our team performance as well, that was the first time that we dominated possession and put our foot in the game for 90 minutes plus overtime.”
Freshman Havard Hjermstad was also encouraged by the performance against the Terriers, pointing to it as evidence that “we’re taking steps each training and each match and we’re moving in the right direction.”
Yale (4-2-1, 0-0) enters the game on a three game winning streak, with the victories coming over Bryant, George Mason, and Fairleigh Dickinson. But the Bulldogs’ most impressive result of the season thus far was a 2-2 draw against Big Ten stalwart and No. 5 ranked — according to the United Soccer Coaches poll — Michigan State.
Harvard will be looking to prove that its last-place finish in the Ivy League last year, their first such finish since 2012, was no more than a fluke. With Dartmouth, winners or sharers of four straight Ivy League championships, struggling to a 1-4-2 start to the season, both the Crimson and Yale will feel that the opportunity is there to challenge favored Columbia and Cornell for the Ivy League championship.
Additionally, Harvard has had 10 days to prepare for this game, a welcome change from the congested schedule the Crimson had earlier in the season.
“It’s kind of nice to get a full week of training and work on some things before the game,” Dogan said.
Harvard must shore up its defense in order to successfully defend its home turf Saturday, because the Bulldogs have scored nine goals in their last four games. Yale is led up front by impressive freshman forward Paolo Carroll, who has scored goals in three straight games and has four goals and three assists on the season despite coming off the bench in the first two games.
The Crimson has given up 19 goals in its first seven games, more than any other Ivy League team. But head coach Pieter Lehrer and the team will be encouraged by the fact that just four of those goals allowed have come in the Crimson’s three home games, a sign that perhaps Harvard is more defensively solid on its home turf.
The Crimson will hope that the St. Louis native’s overtime winner against Boston University can get its offense rolling. Harvard has tallied just eight goals in seven games, with tallies coming from six different players, led by two each from Dogan and senior forward Cesar Farias Jr. The Crimson will have to rely on that diversity of attacking threats against a Yale team that has held its last three opponents to one total goal and its last two to 11 combined shots.
The streaking Bulldogs should serve as a good measuring stick for Harvard after the Crimson’s tough and hectic start to the season. Hjermstad is confident about Harvard’s chances.
“We just have to play our game,” the Hosle, Norway native said. “I think we’re the better team, so we’re going to show that.”
Correction: A previous version of this article listed the location of Saturday's game as Ohiri Field. In fact, it takes place at Jordan Field.

If last year’s performance is any indication, No. 12 Harvard (7-1, 1-0 Ivy League) should have no trouble overcoming the Pennsylvania Quakers (4-4, 1-0) this Saturday. However, as Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden put it, the Quakers will “be absolutely ready to come at [Harvard]” following their 6-0 loss to the Crimson last season.
Harvard is coming off a four-game win streak, including last weekend’s 6-0 shutout against Yale. This marks the best start in the history of the Crimson’s field hockey program, the team having lost only one of eight games this season.
In the Bulldogs’ defeat to Harvard last Friday, junior forward Maddie Earle found twine toward the end of the second half, a shot that contributed to her four-goal weekend and title of National Offensive Player of the Week.
“I think being able to get two goals fairly early in the game really relieved us from the pressure and stress we were feeling,” van Herwaaden said. “It allowed us to grow into the match and really take control of the second half.”
The Crimson’s rout of Yale handed Harvard its sixth straight series win against the Bulldogs, increasing its all-time record against its historic rival to 25-15-7.
“There was a certain level of excitement to that game, so to win in such an exciting fashion was huge,” captain Kathleen Young said. “We had an outstanding performance by Ellie Shahbo, our freshmen goalkeeper, and saw a lot of good scoring distribution. It was a real team effort.”
Each of the Crimson’s six goals against Yale were netted by different players, increasing Harvard’s scoreboard total this season to 30.
“One of the goals we set at the beginning of the season was to improve upon every game and not focus on outcome,” Young said. “As a team, I think we’ve really done that.”
After a mediocre start to their season, the Quakers seem to have found their groove. Penn has won two of its last three games, with its only loss coming against the No. 11 Syracuse Orangewomen.
“The one major result [Penn] had against Syracuse last week should really wake us up and force us to prepare… for a very strong performance on their part,” van Herwaarden said.
The Quakers’ offense is headed by senior Rachel Mirkin, who leads the team in scoring with three goals to the season. However, the Crimson’s Bente van Vlijmen has tossed eight between the posts, one of three on the squad to have netted a hat trick.
“I think we’re all very excited for Penn,” Young said. “It’s definitely going to be a good game, just as it has been the past couple of years. [Penn is] a tough opponent so we’re definitely preparing a lot this week.”
Sunday’s non-league matchup against the Bryant Bulldogs (2-8) will round out what Young called a “tough weekend” for the Crimson. In their own half of the field, the Bulldogs’ Marijn Jaarsma has seen the most time in the cage. Her two scoreless games are on par with the pair of shutouts earned by Harvard freshman goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo this season.
“[van Herwaarden] recruited an exceptional class, as always, of freshmen this year,” Young said. “Rachel Greenwood from England has had a big impact on our forward line, along with Kiley [Allen] back at midfield. And Ellie [Shahbo], of course, is playing really well in goal.”
A Sep. 25 poll by the National Field Hockey Coaches Association placed the Crimson at No. 12 in Division-I field hockey, an eight point increase from last week. Like last week, this ranking places Harvard at second in the Ivy League only to Princeton. Neither Penn nor Bryant made the top 25 of this week’s poll.
For Harvard to emerge from this weekend with its win streak intact, both its offense and defense will need to continue to adhere to the game-by-game mentality that van Herwaaden has preached throughout the season.
“For our team,” as Young put it, “the most important game is the next game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week ago, the Harvard football team walked into Brown Stadium, leapt out to a 24-3 lead at halftime, and cruised toward the finish line. With the momentum gained from that 31-17 win, especially on the heels of a 36-14 drubbing of San Diego in week one, it would be difficult to bet against the Crimson. That is, if Harvard were playing just about any other opponent this weekend.
On Friday night, the University of Rhode Island will make the trek up from Kingston, marking the second game in a row that Harvard will play under the lights. Just as the Bears were underdogs on their home turf, so too will be the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) this week. Harvard has a chance to prove that it can hang with a team that is considered the cream of the FCS crop, but this is no simple task.
The No. 20/22 Rams (2-1, 2-0 CAA) are a juggernaut, replete with size, physicality, and athleticism. Just last week, Rhode Island went on the road to face FBS member UConn and fell merely one touchdown short, 56-49. The Rams started a last-ditch drive on their own 33 yard line with 57 seconds remaining and proceeded to march all the way to the Huskies’ 16 in 46 seconds. That is as far as Rhode Island would advance, but the series showed just how dangerous the team’s passing game can be.
According to coach Tim Murphy and his players, one of the keys to this game will be reining in the Rams’ impressive team speed.
“You can tell that fundamentally and otherwise this is a team that you’re going to have to play four quarters to beat,” Murphy said. “You can’t give them anything, and you’ve got to keep the ball in front of you because of their team speed.”
This observation comes not only from review of game tape, but also from real-life experience. Last season, the Crimson opened its campaign on the road at Meade Stadium and lost, 17-10, in what many would have considered an upset at the time. Just over a year later, it is clear that Rhode Island was on a rapid upward trajectory. Wrong place, wrong time for Harvard.
Last year, however, there was a completely different group donning Crimson uniforms.
“We couldn’t get those explosive plays from our guys,” said senior defensive back Wes Ogsbury. “I don’t know what it was, but this year it seems like it’s all starting to click, and it’s showing up in our record right now.”
Though San Diego’s Anthony Lawrence and Brown’s Michael McGovern each showed flashes of solid quarterback play in the first two contests, Harvard’s defense was able to contain each and limit them to a combined 45-for-89 passing (50.6 percent). The same cannot be expected this Friday.
“He’s a better quarterback than those guys,” Murphy said. “You’re going to see a guy that can really sling it, and he’s slinging it to some guys that are legitimate Division I scholarship kids. [It’s] certainly going to be more pressure on our defense in general and our secondary in particular this week based on what we’ve seen on film.”
That guy is none other than JaJuan Lawson, a redshirt senior in his second season leading the Rams’ offense. In three starts this season, Lawson has thrown for 838 yards and has completed 69.9 percent of his attempts, while also racking up 122 rushing yards. He has 11 touchdowns, nine of which he threw and two of which he ran in on his own.
“He’s a dual threat,” Ogsbury said. “I think his biggest strength is his receivers, so we’ve really been locked in this week preparing for what’s ahead of us.”
In Harvard’s first game last season, Lawson did not factor in much, tallying just one pass attempt and one carry.
On the Crimson’s side, Murphy is counting on sophomore Jake Smith to counteract Lawson. Last week, Smith threw for 251 yards and completed 23 of his 30 tries. Despite throwing two picks, the second-year field general looks well-prepared to challenge Rhode Island.
“I like the phrase, ‘You’re either getting better or you’re getting worse. You never really stay quite the same,’” Murphy said. “He’s getting better, he’s learning, and he’s gaining confidence. What hasn’t changed is his poise and his ability to throw the football. He’s had that since he walked in here.”
Not enough can be said about the impact a trio of sophomore running backs has had complementing Harvard’s ability to succeed in the air. Devin Darrington, Aaron Shampklin, and B.J. Watson have a combined 513 ground yards on 65 carries. Though when he was asked about the group, Smith opted to keep it simple.
“If I can just stand there and give the ball to one of them, I’m just chilling,” Smith said. “That’s alright.”
Facing off against one of the most complete teams on paper in recent memory, the Crimson will need to limit mistakes in order to keep this game competitive. Notably, San Diego failed to force a single turnover in Harvard’s home opener.
“I always tell my own children, ‘Please try to learn from other people’s mistakes and then you don’t have to make them yourself,’ and I say that to my players as well,” Murphy said.
