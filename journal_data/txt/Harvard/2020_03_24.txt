To the Editor,
“The Myth of Taxpayer Money” (March 17) argues that the federal government should not worry about raising taxes to pay for new spending because it can simply print money. Although the idea is appealing, the author’s claims about the American monetary system are factually incorrect.
He writes, “The government creates money by spending and destroys it by taxation,” and “when you pay taxes, … money is removed from circulation.” But taxation does not destroy dollar bills in circulation; it simply transfers them from individuals to the government. The total supply of money in circulation is set by the Federal Reserve, which is distinct from the federal government.
The author also writes, “If the federal government wants to pay you $100, they can tell your bank to increase the number in your bank account by 100.” This again confuses fiscal and monetary policy. The Federal Reserve, not the government, controls the money supply. The government cannot increase the number in your bank account without taxing or borrowing from someone else. In theory, the federal government could convince the Federal Reserve to expand the money supply to fund its spending, but this would be a difficult task: The Federal Reserve’s express purpose is to determine monetary policy independently from the political process. For reference, readers may look to Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s Principles of Economics, pages 627-629, for an explanation of the money supply.
The author’s broader point is that the federal government should increase spending without worrying about revenue, linking the removal of fiscal constraints to the end of the gold standard. While he fails to advance any specific policy proposals, taking his argument to its natural conclusion would imply that any country using a fiat currency not tied to real resources — in other words, nearly every country in the modern era — would have unlimited spending power. However, the sovereign debt crises in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia in the 1990s, and Europe in the 2010s illustrate real consequences of unchecked spending that range from hyperinflation to lower capital accumulation. Limitations on federal debt are not simply theoretical constructs from “mainstream discourse” in economics as the author suggests; they are historical facts.
We encourage The Crimson Editorial Board to retract the article based on its factual errors without regard to its political stance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To date, 15 members of the Harvard community have tested positive or presumptive positive for COVID-19. The University stopped emailing the community at large after two. And as that number ticks upward — six when we made our meeting agenda midday Sunday, 14 by the time we met over Zoom that night — it will be natural for students and other Harvard affiliates to wonder what degree of contact they may have had with these individuals.
Are they undergraduates? My entryway-mates? Were they at that end-of-days darty I attended? And will I, as a result, spread the virus to my grandmother now that I’m home?
The degree to which public health efforts must override standard protections of patient anonymity has come into question in the past weeks — not least at the federal level. United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II has waived some federal patient protections, including requirements to obtain patient permission to speak with family or friends involved in care, the patient's right to request privacy restrictions, and the patient's right to request confidential communication. Federal officials are reported to be meeting with tech companies to discuss possible ways to use data to track citizens.
Along these lines, we sympathize with our peers who wish for more and more helpful information. These are anxious times — driving many, not least some members of our board — to hide away from their loved ones for weeks.
Still, we support the University’s decision to maintain the anonymity of those community members who tested positive for COVID-19. As University President Lawrence S. Bacow put it when he announced the first confirmed case, “Ensuring the anonymity of these individuals is paramount. If you are aware of their identities, please respect their privacy so that they can focus completely on their health. The last thing they need—or any of us would want for them—is public attention and scrutiny.”
Harvard has a legal and moral responsibility to protect these patients’ privacy. To release further identifying information — such as if these individuals are staff, students, or faculty, or in what House they live — would ultimately compromise this privacy.
At Harvard, moreover, such action wouldn’t do much to protect anybody. Preliminary studies demonstrate that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 — 17.9 percent — are asymptomatic. Furthermore, the bar for qualifying for COVID-19 testing in the United States is high; at a time when there are not enough tests to meet demand, only individuals expressing severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are likely to be tested.
As such, it is almost certain that the number of coronavirus cases within the Harvard community expands beyond the 15 reported. Knowing more about the individuals in our community who tested positive would only provide a sliver of data. And what data might be provided — House, event attendance, affiliation — would serve as a poor basis for individual action.
To release more information about the whereabouts or identities of the people behind Harvard’s coronavirus cases would, at best, force the University to uncomfortably negotiate patient privacy protections without concrete public health benefits and, at worst, instill false certainty (or alternatively, excessive panic) in community members without meaningful grounds. After all, campus life is, by nature, high-contact and highly communal. We share bathrooms, shuttles, lecture halls, and dining facilities.
We applaud those in our community and beyond who have chosen to voluntarily make their positive test results more public. However, this choice must remain theirs. Encroaching upon the privacy of our community members with little public health benefit in sight is not a strategy worth championing.
To be sure, this crisis should already be inspiring deep reflection about how we can handle similar situations better in the future. Harvard, in consultation with medical professionals, should evaluate inefficacies in the “contact tracing” method particularly as deployed in dense student populations. But protecting patient privacy should always remain a chief priority.
To the fifteen individuals in our community who have tested positive: We wish you the privacy and care you need to recover in this terrifying global moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a moment last year when pop artist Lizzo was getting wall-to-wall favorable coverage. On top of the success of her newest album, she was applauded for proudly displaying her body — something that a few years earlier, might have been unthinkable. In her 2019 Time Entertainer of the Year profile, she credited her fame to a “culture change.”
“There were a lot of things that weren’t popular but existed,” she said, “like body positivity, which at first was a form of protest for fat bodies and black women and has now become a trendy, commercialized thing … Suddenly, I’m mainstream.”
Traditionally, fat women have been scorned in American pop culture. Maybe the embrace of her appearance would signify a new era of body positivity.
It didn’t last for very long. Though she was able to stave them off for a little bit, Lizzo’s detractors soon went beyond critiquing her music to dissecting her physical appearance, often in ways that were demeaning and cruel. Posting a picture of herself in a bikini sparked accusations of being a public health hazard — apparently, having the audacity to go to the pool means that you’re encouraging people to eat themselves into prediabetes.
Fat-shaming is clearly detrimental: It seriously impacts the mental health of those who are overweight. A lot of fat-shamers claim that they’re actually being helpful; by humiliating people — in their telling — they’re encouraging them to lead healthier lives. Predictably, none of them seem to be actual nutritionists.
A fixation on other people’s weight isn’t just damaging to fat people; it's bad for all of us. An obsession with the aesthetics of “health”, rather than habits that actually support a healthy lifestyle, encourages harmful behaviors to mold our bodies into socially acceptable forms. Eating disorders, unhealthy diets, and overexercising are all ignored, as long as you’re slim enough. The priority is appearance, not health.
In previous columns, I’ve written about my own body image issues. Apparently, my self-hatred was surprising to a lot of my friends and family; this is probably because I’m not overweight and never have been. For me, a dislike of my body wasn’t triggered by off-hand comments by people I knew; it was primarily driven by a fear that if I were fat, it would mean that I was worthless.
I don’t know exactly where this fear came from, but I suspect that it was instilled in me by the culture at large through some toxic osmotic process. At some point, it's hard to ignore the bombardment of messages, both subtle and overt, about what our bodies should look like. The upshot of fat-shaming is paranoia, even in those who aren’t overweight. It feeds anxiety that one will become fat — and therefore deemed less-than.
Through conversations with older people, I’ve come to realize that this toxic sentiment might be a relatively new phenomenon, at least in how widespread it is. While I don’t know a single girl in my high school who didn’t have at least some insecurities about her body, my parents had an entirely different experience: Eating disorders, at least in their perception, were rare and infrequently discussed.
However, there is a long history of disordered eating among the wealthy and famous. I wonder, given the influence of social media, if such pressure to make one’s body ready for public consumption has now been pressed onto all of us. Social media accounts are meant to be looked at, which is why people often feel pressured to present the best version of themselves. Unfortunately, they are constantly told that that “best version” is skinny.
For reasons that are perhaps obvious, I recently deleted my Instagram account. When I was in middle school, I’d spend hours scrolling through my feed, comparing my completely normal 13-year-old body to 20-year-old models or girls in my school who were skinnier than me. I’d often see posts from “body-positive” influencers, who were inevitably pilloried by faceless accounts with negative comments about their bodies, their diets, and their life choices. Today, when I see how women with similar body types, like Lizzo, are ridiculed across the internet, I think about my younger self, and girls who are that age right now — are they learning the same things that I did?
The need for kindness to ourselves and others is ever more pressing. We should focus, more than anything else, on how we can care for each other. Disparaging comments, whether verbal or virtual, about other people’s bodies can only hurt us.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down and advised residents to stay at home Monday in the most drastic step taken by the state yet to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The advisory — which comes as Massachusetts reports 646 confirmed cases and five deaths from the novel disease — will take effect Tuesday at noon. The measures will be in place until at least April 7.
Despite mounting pressure from lawmakers in recent days, Baker declined to order residents to shelter in place. He said at a State House news conference Monday that he “strongly” advises people over the age of 70 to stay at home.
The governor also announced a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people, tightening from a previous restriction on gatherings of more than 25.
“Our goal is to slow the spread by limiting person-to-person contact,” Baker said. “A concerted effort now will help us get back to work and back to school.”
Last week, a group of 32 municipal and state officials sent a letter to Baker urging him to enact a stringent shelter in place order that would strip all out-of-home activity to “essential needs.” Baker denied having plans to issue such an order last Friday.
In the Monday press conference, Baker drew a distinction between his stay-at-home advisory and a shelter in place order.
“I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their homes for days on end,” Baker said in the conference. “What this means is that everyone can still buy food at the grocery store, get what they need at the pharmacy and, of course, take a walk around the block or at the park.”
Grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, medical marijuana dispensaries, and restaurants serving takeout and delivery will remain open. Public transportation will also continue running, though Baker said it should only be used for essential travel.
Massachusetts is one of several states that have issued stay-at-home advisories.
“We’re advising people to use common sense with every step we take,” Baker said.
Baker said he would leave enforcement of the new measures up to local authorities.
He acknowledged that the order to close non-essential businesses could have an “incredible” impact on the local economy.
“It’s not lost on me, or anybody else in our administration, that many businesses — locally grown and owned by our neighbors and friends — are the businesses most unlikely to be able to put in place remote or telework policies,” he said. “But I also know that by taking this action now, we can significantly improve our position in this fight to slow the spread of this virus.”

Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale announced a pair of initiatives this weekend to support the city’s homeless and senior populations during the coronavirus pandemic.
Starting Monday, the city began preliminarily contracting restaurants in Central and Harvard Square to provide bagged or boxed meals for delivery to homeless shelters. Many Cambridge shelters are struggling to support the homeless populations they serve, suffering from staff and supply shortages.
The Harvard Square Business Association and Central Square Business Improvement District are working to identify restaurants to participate in the program.
Jeremy Warnick, a City of Cambridge spokesperson, called the initiative a “creative solution” to support struggling businesses and the vulnerable homeless population.
Siddiqui and DePasquale thanked HSBA and CSBID for their assistance in a joint statement Friday.
“By contracting with local restaurants in Central and Harvard Square, where a large majority of homeless programs are located, we are able to minimize delivery challenges, and facilitate the availability of both hot and cold meals to shelters and other sites in both Squares,” they wrote.
The two went on to implore residents for their aid amid the growing coronavirus pandemic.
“This is a time to show that residents of Cambridge stand together, support those in need, and are a united community in the face of this unprecedented public health threat,” Siddiqui and DePasquale wrote.
As of yesterday, 15 local restaurants, including El Jefe’s Taqueria and Black Sheep Bagel Cafe, have signed on to the program. HSBA director Denise A. Jillson, who is coordinating efforts from Harvard Square businesses, said the Cambridge Savings Bank is providing beverages to homeless shelters as a part of the program.
Beneficiaries include the Y2Y shelter and the Thursday meal program at Christ Church Cambridge.
Erik Mass, director of sales at OTTO Pizza, which has a Harvard Square location participating in the city’s initiative, said the chain was open to a variety of solutions that could mitigate the situation.
“We just want to help the community,” he said. “We’re open to any ideas. You know, we’ll have to be creative. So whatever we can do, we will do.”
After this week, the city will look for restaurants beyond the two Squares for additional support.
Warnick said there is no long-run timeline for the program, but that the city hopes it “can be extended as long as possible.”
The city is also “aggressively looking” for temporary housing provisions for Cambridge’s homeless, particularly those showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, according to the press release. The city has set up a series of resources aimed at seniors and other Cambridge residents that may struggle with food insecurity. The provisions come after the indefinite closure of Cambridge senior centers and the Cambridge Council on Aging.
In partnership with Food for Free — a Cambridge nonprofit focused on food rescue — the city created the Cambridge Community Food Line. Residents — particularly seniors — at high risk of food insecurity can call the phone number for weekly deliveries of produce and grocery items.
Food for Free is currently enlisting volunteers to deliver food to residents. According to its executive director Sasha Purpura, 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to deliver food to roughly 500 needy individuals. Purpura said she expects the number of food-insecure residents partaking in the program to grow. All distributed food will be sourced from the Greater Boston Food Bank.

Harvard will continue to pay students who can perform their on-campus jobs in a remote setting, asking students who cannot do so to seek other employment opportunities through the Student Employment Office, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to undergraduates Monday afternoon.
The University announced two weeks ago that campus would not reopen for classes after spring break in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. For weeks after the news broke, many students with on-campus jobs wondered how they would make up the lost income from their term-time employment if they did not receive their previous salaries.
Many students hold jobs staffing various facilities — including gyms, package centers, and house grilles — that require them to be physically present at Harvard.
Madison J. H. Earle ’20, who previously worked 12 to 15 hours each week at the Smith Campus Center, said her campus job was essential to her livelihood.
“A lot of students on Harvard's campus are only working those jobs because we do need to support ourselves financially in some way,” she said. “We're not working those jobs for fun or for some sort of extracurricular activity.”
Earle said she thinks it is “unrealistic” for these students to find remote campus jobs, citing factors like the financial burden of internet access, restrictions for international students like herself, and low numbers of open remote jobs for students.
Burke wrote in a missive last Thursday that student employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic will receive a weekly stipend equal to the average of the weekly pay earned in February until May 17.
He retracted the statement in a note several hours later, writing that he “inadvertently” included incorrect information about the College’s policies surrounding student employment.
Lindey M. Kneib ’20, who previously worked 20 hours a week in the Winthrop House office, said in a Saturday interview that she was “relieved” and “excited” when she read Burke’s original email promising weekly stipends to students who cannot complete their campus work remotely.
“I relied on that income. And I know a lot of other Harvard student employees also rely on that income,” she said. “ I was like, this makes sense, because if we were back on campus, we would still be working and it wasn't our choice to leave.”
Lindey added that she was “absolutely deflated” when Burke sent out the retraction moments later.
In his most recent email on Monday, Burke added that students whose financial aid packages included a term-time work expectation will now only have to complete half of that original expectation.
He further noted that the difference in lost revenue will be supplemented by a Harvard scholarship.
Raphael Tsiamis ’22 — who works as a course assistant and can continue his job remotely — said he appreciated the reduction in required work for students on financial aid, but that he thought it should primarily go to students who cannot continue their previous jobs.
“I already have a job, so I think it would be good to divert this money to students who won't be able to continue their term-time jobs,” he said.

A team led by scientists at the Harvard Black Hole Initiative published an article Wednesday outlining a method to simulate sharper images of a black hole.
The article was published in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science Advances. It comes less than a year after the Event Horizon Telescope, a collaborative network of telescopes around the Earth, visualized a black hole for the first time.
Physics professor Andrew E. Strominger ’77, the Black Hole Initiative’s assistant director of theory and a core collaborator on the paper, emphasized the theoretical motivation for studying black holes in this paper.
“There is a question of what's the information in the [Event Horizon Telescope] image? What do you learn out of black holes?” he said. “What's the universal physics in this?”
After the Event Horizon Telescope released an image of a black hole in April 2019, a group of Harvard scientists convened to discuss both refining the image and theoretical explanations.
The researchers used an image rendering method called ray tracing commonly found in computer graphics. The technique can “produce the image that a distant observer would see if a black hole was lit up,” lead author and Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Michael D. Johnson said.
“It just came out beautifully,” Johnson said.
Black holes amass subrings of photons, or particles of light, due to the black hole’s gravitational pull. These rings of bent light form a spherical “photon shell” around the black hole, which can then be visualized using computer simulations.
The simulations were the result of theoretical calculations.
“The structure was reproduced on a computer, but if you don't know what to look for with a computer, you'll miss it,” Strominger said. “It has to be something that you can explain with pencil and paper and understand. And when we set out to do that, we found… that it wasn't just one ring, but then we realized that there must be infinitely many more.”
That observation led to more precise calculations in the numerical image, which then produced sharper pictures of the black hole.
Co-author Alexandru V. Lupsasca ’11 said the new technology will help scientists better understand the core properties of black holes, such as their mass and spin, which elude astrophysicists.
Lupsasca likened black hole imaging to “sitting in New York and trying to take an up-close picture of a quarter in LA.” He said the scope of that challenge is why computer simulations are necessary to further refine the image.
Johnson credited the team’s success to their unique three-pronged approach, putting experts — theoreticians, researchers specializing in simulations, and those focused on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope — who do not usually collaborate in the same room.
“These are three communities that don't normally talk to each other very much. And we're all trying to take the end result of research that we've been working on for years or even decades,” Johnson said.
Strominger also emphasized that the experiment brought experimentalists and theorists together.
“It's a wonderful classic example of experiments inspiring new theoretical endeavors and theoretical endeavors inspiring new experiments,” he said.

More than 5,000 Harvard students and affiliates have signed an online petition asking Harvard to guarantee all University employees full pay for the complete 2020 spring semester.
The petition comes after the University shuttered most of its operations due to the coronavirus pandemic. University President Lawrence S. Bacow asked students not to return to campus after spring break in a March 10 email — a move that drastically altered campus living and dining operations. Meanwhile, labs have ramped down research; libraries and other academic facilities have closed; and staff have piloted a work-from-home system.
The University subsequently agreed to provide employees whose facilities have closed and whose jobs cannot occur remotely 30 days of paid leave with benefits.
But employees whose facilities close will still face a gap between the end of that paid leave and the end of the semester — a problem that led the Labor and Employment Action Project, a student organization at Harvard Law School dedicated to worker advocacy, to draft the “Harvard, Pay All Your Workers” petition. The petition calls on the University to extend paid leave to cover the rest of the Spring 2020 semester, and to include subcontractors and temporary workers.
Law School student Mackenzie C. Bouverat, a member of the Labor and Employment Action Project, wrote in an email that she believes Harvard holds a responsibility to provide for its employees given the school’s wealth and its more than $40 billion endowment.
“We simply do not believe that the world’s richest university can justify depriving its workers and students of income during a global pandemic,” Bouverat wrote. “This is not a request for frivolous discretionary spending, but a demand that Harvard take necessary measures to protect the health and well-being of its staff and students throughout this ongoing crisis.”
The petition also claims that Harvard has not guaranteed its contracted dining workers the same emergency compensation benefits as other full-time employees. It further alleges that in doing so, the University is violating its Wages and Benefits Parity Policy, which ensures that all contracted employees receive comparable compensation and benefits as full-time workers.
“The university administration has refused to guarantee these 30 days of pay to subcontracted dining and catering workers,” the petition reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement the University considers the health of its students and employees its top priority, reaffirming Harvard’s guarantee to provide 30 days paid leave for dining hall employees.
“The economic impact of this rapidly evolving public health crisis is one that is hitting employers of all sizes, not just higher education institutions,” Swain wrote. “The University will continue to review and assess its human resources policies, including those related to compensation, as this public health crisis and its economic impact continues to evolve.”
At schools across the University, including the Law School, Harvard Business School, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard Graduate School of Design, subcontracted workers employed by Restaurant Associates — a national dining services firm — provide dining services, rather than workers directly employed by Harvard.
UNITE HERE Local 26, a Boston-based hospitality union, represents both subcontracted and Harvard dining workers. Incoming President Carlos Aramayo wrote in an emailed statement that the union is seeking to ensure all of its workers on campus will be compensated immediately.
“We are in ongoing discussions with Harvard regarding compensation for the subcontracted members of Local 26 at Harvard’s professional schools, including the Law School, during the Covid-19 crisis,” Aramayo wrote. “We hope that Harvard will resolve this situation and pay these workers within the next twenty-four hours.”
Project No One Leaves, a housing justice organization at the Law School, co-sponsored the petition. President Sricharitha “Cherry” Mullaguru said the organization signed the petition because of what it views as the clear intersection of workers’ rights and housing justice.
“For us, it's about doing whatever tiny thing we can to support movements for justice for marginalized groups in the economy, whether that's workers or tenants,” Mullaguru said.
Like Bouverat, Mullaguru also said Harvard has a responsibility to use its “disproportionate power” to ensure all of its employees, whether subcontracted or full-time, maintain a sufficient livelihood.
“There isn't really an excuse for them to not be able to provide this, in the midst of a horrible global health crisis, when we know that income stability is going to be a challenge for a large number of people,” she said.
The petition concludes with a call for Harvard to prioritize its employees over its finances.
“In this time of crisis, Harvard should put the good of its employees ahead of the university’s narrow budgetary interests,” it reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ravi Patel took over the popular convenience store formerly called Louie’s Superette after purchasing it from longtime proprietor Cheng-San Chen earlier this month.
Patel assumed operations of the Surrey Street beer-and-wine shop, which remains open amid the coronavirus crisis, on March 3.
He said the store — which sits across the street from Mather House — has been “very quiet” in light of the pandemic, which forced Harvard students to move out earlier this month.
“People are scared to come out,” he said.
Chen — known as “Louie” and beloved by many Harvard undergraduates — operated the shop on and off between 1987 and fall 2019. He said some students asked him to keep running the business until after graduation, but he decided he was “too old to run the store.” Some Mather House residents presented Chen with a goodbye card after he announced he would sell the store in the fall.
“I’m very happy to work for all the Harvard students,” Chen said. “[They] are all smart and young. I feel most of [them] will be the future leaders of the world in different fields.”
Chen came to the United States from Taiwan to attend graduate school after undergraduate studies in applied mathematics and a stint in the Taiwanese military. He holds a Ph.D in biophysics and worked for the now-defunct Digital Equipment Corporation before buying the convenience store from Louie G. Palucci — the shop’s namesake — in 1987.
Patel, the store’s new proprietor, said the shop was “jumping” for its first few weeks of operation under new ownership, though business has slowed.
Many Cambridge businesses have shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic. Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 announced Friday that all non-essential businesses in the state must close in order to mitigate the spread of the disease.
Louie’s Superette has faced a multitude of challenges over the years, including robberies, a devastating fire in 1993, multiple liquor license suspensions for allegedly selling alcohol to minors, and a 2005 ownership change that led to a months-long legal battle and Chen taking over the store again after a two-year hiatus.
Chen said the key to success for Patel will be fostering relationships with Harvard affiliates.
“I told the new owner that to be successful, he has to be interested in Harvard University and like the Harvard students,” Chen said.
He added that he misses being able to “talk to the future leaders” attending Harvard who visited his store.
“It’s not just money, it’s community,” Chen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric J. Cheng ’20 was set on moving out to Los Angeles to pursue a Hollywood career in acting and writing after he graduates from Harvard this spring. He said he thought the best way to enter the entertainment industry was to live at the center of it.
“L.A. works in real time,” Cheng said. “You have to be there and be present.”
But with the city under lockdown and physical production of major films and television series halting due to the coronavirus pandemic, Cheng said his dreams may be dashed.
“I’ve been looking at apartments, but it’s hard because now I really don't know if I'm going to be there in July or even the next year,” he said.
For seniors set to graduate, the coronavirus has rapidly changed where and how they expected to live, work, and build a career. In a matter of months, the global health crisis has flummoxed both members of the class of 2020 and the Harvard officials tasked with guiding them.
Director of Harvard’s Office of Career Services Robin E. Mount said she has shepherded students through the 2008 recession and the 2001-2002 dot-com burst. But neither event is quite comparable to the present circumstances.
“We’ve had a few crises that we’ve weathered through in our offices, and the only one they’re saying is the most similar is World War II,” she said. “What’s so different about this time is there’s two crises going on at once. There’s the health crisis and the social distancing. And then there’s the economic crisis.”
Seniors are now facing a job market rife with uncertainty. Those with once certain summer or full-time employment are now scrambling to find alternatives as employers delay or even rescind offers due to the unpredictable timeline of the coronavirus.
After successfully being matched with a state government for a fellowship, Government concentrator Kaitlyn M. Greta ’20 said she only had to clear a state-level interview. But as the coronavirus outbreak worsened across the country, her fellowship informed her the state had to postpone scheduling interviews indefinitely.
“I’m potentially going to state government and politics,” she said. “And with the coronavirus, all the resources are not going into hiring which makes complete sense. They’re going into figuring out resources to fight the virus.”
“What I’ve been encountering is everything’s been pushed back,” she added. “There’s just more uncertainty around when are they going to interview you, if they’re going to interview you, when do they have time to read applications?”
Mauricio D. J. Garcia ’20, who hopes to find a research position before he eventually applies to medical school, said he feels lucky the demand for pharmaceutical innovation has not ceased.
However, Garcia said he is concerned a research position that would ordinarily start in late May may now be pushed into the fall.
“As someone who would really rely on some sort of income that would come right after graduation from these jobs, that now puts me in this weird sort of limbo where now, I don’t know how financially secure I might be during that time,” he said.
As cities and states have ordered lockdowns for most residents, many companies are also navigating how to continue their operations remotely. But for some, like those in retail, dining, and entertainment, such measures are not possible.
Avila S. Reynolds ’20, an aspiring film director and writer, said the pandemic has prevented her from finishing her film thesis because she is unable to use Harvard’s equipment, its budget for permits, as well as its student actors, dancers, and crew members. Those changes have left her without a valuable portfolio centerpiece for job applications.
“Because of coronavirus, and having to go home, I’ve effectively lost all of my equipment and all of my resources and am now facing a lot of anxiety and fear,” Reynolds said. “There are financial difficulties because I was banking on having this film to use for my portfolio to then apply for other jobs in media.”
“I’m a little bit concerned in terms of how willing people will be to take on younger people in media who don’t have as much to offer, and how those jobs which are already kind of scarce and low paying will potentially disappear,” she added.
Eleonore L. Evans ’20, a History and Literature concentrator searching for a career in communications or content production, also said she is anxious about the future of the economy and predicted layoffs.
“The predictions for unemployment are pretty dire, so having all of that go on in the background definitely doesn’t help matters,” she said.
“I just don’t think this is going to be traditional in any sense of the word,” she added. “So filling out a job application, writing a cover letter, I just don’t think that that’s going to be the most effective way to figure out my path forward.”
Evans said that she intends to avail herself of the Harvard Alumni Directory, as well as the Harvard Varsity Club, a networking service for student-athletes.
Deb Carroll, an associate director at OCS, said she believes Harvard’s “very large and very strong” alumni network will buoy students.
“Harvard students are certainly not going to be disadvantaged compared to other students,” she said. “There’s lots of helping hands that want to reach back and help support students.”
Though Mount said hard hit sectors such as airlines are not “big areas” for Harvard students seeking entry-level jobs, the major exceptions are corporate retail and international consulting.
She added that her office is currently scouting opportunities for students at “green shoot” companies that are thriving in the crisis, such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and health care firms.
Though most students have returned home after Harvard decided not to reopen for classes after spring break, OCS will continue to offer virtual programming and advising services.
Students can still schedule career advising appointments conducted via Skype or phone. Workshops and panel discussions will occur online, and several employers are continuing to hold virtual information sessions.
OCS also offers its full resources to alumni up to five years after they graduate. Mount said the office is prepared to help students through a variety of challenges in the coming months and years.
“We’re here to help you. We’re fully staffed. We’re going to be by your side as these things unfold. It’s too early to really say what all of the impacts are going to be but that we’ll muddle through it together,” Mount said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Subcontracted security guards at Harvard say they have not been guaranteed the same emergency compensation benefits as the University’s direct-hire employees, even as some guards report losing work and pay following the closure of many campus facilities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Working conditions and pay for Harvard employees — especially those who cannot work remotely — have come under scrutiny since the University moved instruction online and announced the temporary closure of many buildings, including most undergraduate dormitories, dining halls, and research labs.
Directly employed dining hall workers, custodians, and other staff who cannot work remotely will receive 30 days of paid leave if the facility where they work closes. This policy has not yet been applied, however, to Harvard’s subcontracted workers, which include certain dining workers, custodians, and security guards.
Several students have voiced concerns in recent weeks about worker compensation; most notably, the Labor and Employment Action Project at Harvard Law School circulated a petition last week urging the University to pay subcontracted and temporary employees who are laid off as a result of the pandemic. The petition, which more than 30 graduate and undergraduate student groups co-signed, has garnered more than 5,000 individual signatures.
Harvard contracts Securitas North America, a multinational Swedish company, to handle most of its security guard operations. 32BJ Service Employees International Union, a New York-based labor union branch that includes University custodial staff, represents Harvard’s Securitas guards.
Some Securitas guards have reported that their positions have been “displaced” as a result of the closures, 32BJ SEIU Vice President Roxana Rivera wrote in an email.
“We’re working to address those situations and ensure that they are able to get continued employment,” she wrote.
The union is requesting that Harvard give its security officers and custodians the “economic support” they need to provide for their families, according to Rivera.
“We hope that, in this time of crisis, Harvard will do the right thing and offer contracted workers the same protections as they’re offering their directly-employed workers,” she wrote. “This must include the 30-day commitment to paying peoples’ salaries in the case of a layoff, as well as all other special conditions.”
Aryt Alasti, a subcontracted security guard at Harvard, said he and fellow colleagues have found Harvard’s treatment of their vendor employees to be unfair.
“That’s very unfortunate, as obviously many of such workers, who depend upon their incomes to support families and livelihoods, will quickly be in dire financial straits when staffing requirements are reduced or eliminated at their facilities,” Alasti wrote in an email.
He added that, by declining to give its outsourced workers access to the same pay benefits as its full-time workers, Harvard is violating its Wage and Benefit Parity Policy.
The parity policy, which Harvard enacted in 2002, guarantees contracted employees in security, dining, and custodial services receive wages and benefits “comparable” to in-house employees who perform the same work, according to the version of the policy included in Harvard University Dining Services’ most recent union contract.
The current contract between Securitas and 32BJ SEIU stipulates that employees scheduled to work when the University “closes due to an emergency” must be paid at their regular rate.
Alasti wrote in an email that Securitas has reduced some guards’ hours from 40 hours per week to 16 hours.
“I’ve been advised by our union representative that Securitas's basis for laying people off and reducing hours is a ‘management rights’ provision in our contract,” Alasti wrote. “This would only override the requirement to pay employees during declared Harvard emergencies if the argument is based upon an absurd technicality: that the term ‘emergency’ was never used in announcing the shut-down of campuses.”
Area Vice President for Securitas Christopher Connolly wrote in an emailed statement that his company is working to provide “other available schedule opportunities” for those employees affected by facility closures and changes.
“Securitas is working diligently within the confines of the collective bargaining agreement between Securitas Security Services and SEIU 32BJ to re-assign any officers affected by the reduced need for services,” Connolly wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard remains committed to adapting to the ongoing pandemic.
“The University continues to assess and review its HR policies in light of the rapidly changing public health crisis,” Swain wrote.
Last year, several Securitas guards at Harvard alleged Securitas used a different contract provision — one that allowed for non-disciplinary transfers without cause — to leave them in limbo without work and pay as they awaited reassignments that never materialized.
Rivera added that she believes Harvard has a responsibility to take care of its subcontracted employees.
“The COVID-19 crisis underscores the urgency for those with power to take care of more vulnerable community members,” Rivera wrote. “Harvard must give back to the Security Officers who have kept the university safe for years, and must not abandon them during this difficult moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed several measures Monday evening intended to give financial support to small businesses in Cambridge, identify potential emergency shelters, and halt in-person real estate showings during the coronavirus outbreak.
The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Department of Public Health declared a public health emergency over COVID-19 Thursday evening, following the closure of Cambridge Public Schools and cancellation of all “non-essential” city meetings on Mar. 13. There are currently twenty recorded cases of coronavirus in Cambridge.
At the state level, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down and issued a stay-at-home advisory on Monday. Baker declared a state of emergency on March 10 after the number of recorded coronavirus cases in Massachusetts doubled overnight.
According to the policy order — which was filed by Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan and Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler — “emergency appropriations” will provide financial relief to organizations whose operations have been limited by social distancing recommendations and requirements.
The measure passed by the City Council during their weekly meeting will allow the City Manager’s office to direct funds toward arts and culture institutions, nonprofits, food service establishments, and other businesses.
The policy order also states that loss of revenue associated with COVID-19 will be an “impossible hurdle to overcome without assistance.”
During Monday’s meeting, Zondervan said the measure would help “ensure [the] survival” of arts and non-profit organizations that “may not be eligible for some of the financial relief that may be forthcoming from the state government.”
The policy order also states that “the positive, uplifting power of art and music will be an important component of our healing process in the months to come.”
The City Council passed a measure asking the City Manager and directors of Cambridge’s assessment and inspection services to “compile an up-to-date list of housing units and buildings currently vacant in Cambridge” that may be used to house homeless individuals in the city while meeting the requirements of social distancing.
The policy order states homeless individuals are “especially vulnerable to the transmission and severe health risks of COVID-19, as many are older, struggle with compounding disabilities, and have little to no access to healthcare.”
There were 408 homeless people in Cambridge in 2018, according to an estimate from the Cambridge Department of Human Services.
Following the lead of Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh, the City Council also passed a measure that will prevent brokers, landlords, and real estate agents from conducting in-person apartment showings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure is intended to curb the transmission of coronavirus.
The City Council also passed separate measures to support senior citizens in Cambridge and make city council meetings more accessible during the coronavirus outbreak by promoting social distancing.
Cambridge residents can now use Zoom — an online teleconferencing platform — to participate in the public comments section of city council meetings.
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. attended Monday’s meeting in-person at city hall while Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan participated remotely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Normally, the first day of classes only happens once a semester.
Not this semester. Harvard students found themselves navigating a second first day of classes Monday as courses made their online debuts on Zoom.
The transition comes a week after students were asked to move off-campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As students resumed classwork after spring break, Monday marked the first day students and professors made the shift to remote learning.
Harvard is one of many universities to move its classes online using Zoom — a video conference platform — as part of an effort to de-densify its campus. In the week leading up to the launch of online classes, faculty and teaching staff received training on how to use the software.
Despite the training and trial runs, however, Monday morning did not pass without technical difficulties.
The 10:30 a.m. Zoom lecture for Economics 10b: "Principles of Economics" — one of the courses with the highest enrollment at the College — was delayed approximately 40 minutes due to issues with the invite link. Divided between three separate “breakout” rooms on Zoom, the students and two professors were at first unable to join the same virtual meeting space.
David I. Laibson ’88, who co-teaches Ec 10b, said he was disappointed the first Zoom class got off to a shaky start.
“We feel terrible that people had to wait too long for the lecture to begin and then had it run past the allotted time,” he said. “We’re disappointed that this is the way the second half of the semester began.”
The Ec 10b teaching staff had about 20 practice sessions leading up to the first online lecture following Spring Break, all of which “worked like a charm,” according to Laibson.
“The only time we had a problem was when we went to the real course,” he said.
Laibson also noted that Ec 10b was not the only class which was affected by this technical issue. “We’re hearing that there were failures nationally at that particular time of the day. So it may be that, indeed, it’s not the size of the course. It’s just that at that moment, if you happen to try to set a meeting up, it wouldn’t work, everywhere,” he said.
Laibson said he ensured his students that he was doing everything in his power to prevent such a mishap from happening again.
“A 40 minute wait-time to have a lecture start is absolutely inexcusable,” he said. “I’ve been in touch with the entire leadership of the FAS. Everyone’s working on this with great intensity.”
While Ec 10b experienced some technical difficulties, some students said that other courses made the transition to Zoom remarkably smoothly.
Oliver L. Sughrue ’20 said he was “impressed” with how easy Zoom was to interface with and also expressed his optimism about the unique potential for the platform.
“You can hear everybody, you have a great view automatically,” Sughrue said. “I’d much rather be on campus, but this really is not as bad of an alternative as at one point I thought.”
Sughrue also commented on what he called a feeling of closeness in the classroom despite the geographical distance between the students and professors.
“I was really impressed with how intimate it felt. You’re able to ask questions to a professor much more easily than I think you would — at least, I think for me — in an auditorium,” Sughrue said.
Christopher Robichaud — who teaches GENED 1023: "Ignorance, Lies, Hogwash, and Humbug" — also said he values Zoom’s messaging capabilities as a tool to encourage student participation.
“The chat feature was really helpful,” he said. “Someone who may be a little bit hesitant to speak in a larger auditorium setting — which is where I usually teach — now feels more comfortable interacting with me through chat, and I can share their question with everyone and then answer it.”
In addition to the chat feature, Harvard Zoom users reported that having the opportunity to see people’s pets on-screen was another positive attribute of the platform.
Marwa Albaadani ’22 said she shared a particularly exciting moment during her philosophy section, when a student’s cat kept bumping into their computer camera.
“In the middle of section, someone’s cat woke up and really wanted their person’s attention and wouldn’t leave the frame. It kept rubbing up against him and blocking his view,” she said. “It was super cute.”
For Xiomara Hipólita Feliberty-Casiano — a teaching assistant for Spanish 20: "Intermediate Spanish" — the choice to introduce her dogs to her students had symbolic importance.
“I think that part of showing myself as my true self is very important for me right now,” Feliberty-Casiano said. “Showing myself with my vulnerabilities and my imperfections, I think that’s going to be very, extremely important right now.”
Robichaud also began his class by introducing his own cat and encouraged other students to introduce their pets to the class as well.
“Why try to hide some of the warm, nice things that go on in a house?” he said. “I just think that that makes things a little bit more comfortable during an uncomfortable time.”
Many courses have yet to make their debut on Zoom. Though he acknowledged that the College’s sudden shift to remote learning was unprecedented and unexpected, Robichaud is optimistic about the viability of an online curriculum.
“I mean it’s only Day 1, but you got cats, you’ve got no technical difficulties, and certain features like chat that I think, in their own way, sort of draw more students into the conversation,” he said. “We’re just Day 1, but I feel good about it.”

Sections
So you’re home. There’s no red brick, no bright green and blue Science Center lecture halls, and your blockmates have been replaced by your parents. The vibes are more than a little different, and with classes starting on Zoom, they’re about to get even crazier. But that doesn’t mean you have to spend the rest of the semester in a funk. Here’s how to vibe check your classes on Zoom.
Get your space in check
Repurpose those party lights you had in your dorm room to become Section Party Lights. Find a window so that if the vibes aren’t good you can look out into the world. Practice a little #socialdistancing with your parents. They don’t really need to come to Gen Ed 1152: “The Incas and Their Empire.” However, nobody can see your full-size Harry Styles poster, so no need to take that down. I’m sure Harry would love to hear your professor use the word “dialectic” four times in one minute, so why deny him the pleasure?
Rock a new lecture look
Put on some sunglasses. Not only will it let everybody know that you’re an absolute chiller, but you can also roll your eyes at any off-vibe comments that people may make. Plus, they’re a great way to dress up your mismatched sweatsuit that you’ve had since seventh grade. Oddly saggy sweatpant-capris are a vibe unto themselves.
Keep your blood moving
Put Zoom on mute and have a dance break. You’ll get your heartrate up and give your classmates a look at all those TikTok dances you’ve been learning. It’ll be like a Friday night in the Cabot Aquarium except on a Wednesday and at 10:30 a.m. Bonus points if you can get other people moving.
Pack a snack
Class time is now officially mealtime. No lab chemicals can get in the way, and you have more than just a tiny fold out desk to lay out your feast. Gather your crunchiest snacks, your smelliest sandwiches, and enjoy yourself. No food is taboo.
Directly vibe check
Zoom lets you send individual messages to people in a group call. There has never been a more direct, yet private way to tell somebody that they are absolutely not vibing (or totally vibing!). Works for section kids, works for overenthusiastic people in different time zones who didn’t have to get up at 7 a.m. for a 9 a.m. class. Also could work for professors.
Be nice to your professors and TFs
This is disruptive to them too. Actually show up to class on time, maybe consider participating. The nicer you are to them, the more they’ll support you on your (remote) vibe journey. Consider adding them on Houseparty. They like fun too.
If all else fails, yelling out “vibe check!” is still an option. What are they going to do, make you leave school? Oh wait.
