After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
For many Americans, September 11 is a day memorializing tragedy: the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. It is also the anniversary of another violent event that happened exactly 40 years ago this week: the overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende and the violent installation of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. This coup was the beginning of a turbulent and repressive era in the Latin American history. A new exhibit at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies entitled "Memory and Democracy in Latin American Poetry," which opened on Wednesday, looks at artistic works that contextualize this history.
  The exhibit, which will be on display through February 15, presents a selection of poems in Portuguese and Spanish. The works in the show come from a diverse ensemble of poets of Chilean, Peruvian, Brazilian, Mexican, El Salvadorian, and Argentine nationality. Some of the poems have been placed on the walls of the DRCLAS offices in the Center for Government and International Studies and on the mirrors in the second-floor restrooms. All are available to visitors in printed format. 
"Some poems, we translocated from the page to the wall,” curator of the exhibition, Sergio Delgado, said, who is also professor of romance languages and literatures. “They brought into question the role of walls and public spaces in poetry.”
  Wednesday's exhibition reception kicked off a special series of Arts @ DRCLAS events which reflect on the theme of democracy and memory. A talk later this month by Daniel L. Schacter, professor of psychology, will reflect on how the brain forms memories, and an upcoming lecture by Jorge I. Dominguez, vice provost for international affairs, will concentrate on the selective nature of collective memory. The public is also encouraged to submit poetic works that will be published in an anthology.
  Merilee S. Grindle, director of DRCLAS, said, "It's hard to imagine a discipline that doesn't have something to say about the connection [between democracy and memory]. Besides the obvious contributions from political science, sociology, and related fields, art, film, poetry, science of the brain, and others all play a role."
  "What poetry brings to the table is not just historic documentary but also a sense of play and a sense of song that shouldn't be forgotten," Delagdo said. He admitted the idea of putting together this collection was intimidating. "I won't lie, I was daunted by this intersection, especially in a place as complex as Latin America."
 Rather than an exhaustive retrospective on post-1973 poetry, Delgado chose to create an exhibition that is deliberately selective. Speaking before a crowd of university faculty, DRCLAS staff, students, and community members, Delgado said, "This is an expansive collection that will hopefully leave space for you to bring in your views and experiences as scholars of Latin American history." Delgado explained that the poems written by poets who date from the years following the coup spoke to him in particular because of generational effects. He will lead a guided tour of the exhibition on October 18. 
   "These exhibits are one part of the project. Another aspect of the project is to ask ourselves and scholars how the collective memory of these events have influenced developments in Latin America to this day," Grindle said.
  Students in attendance reacted favorably to the exhibition launch. "It's really cool that Harvard has made a space to showcase painful memories of Latin American wars. I'm proud to see there's a civility of these histories; the fact that it's artistic rather than having a head of state to speak, it makes it more accessible and intimate,” Herbert B. Castillo '14 says. 
   "September 11 means a lot of different things to different people, and this exhibit does a good job of commemorating things we're not confronted with every day. I'm really glad to see the representation of this kind of work at Harvard through artistic outlets," Edward Escalon Jr. '14 says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While you were filtering back into Harvard, gearing up for a hearty week of lecture-hopping and back-slapping, an old friend of mine and I sat at the bar, chewing on Mexican tamarind candy and chatting up some strung-out Spice Girls rejects.
“At least you’ll only be missing shopping,” my Cornellian friend assured me.
“But shopping…” I trailed off.
A seraphic Irishman, mid-to-late twenties, top hat, exposed lower half, smiled his way through the crowd and mounted the bar. Supine, he clutched a battered bottle of Jameson and gave a signal of “have at it.” Without ceremony, strangers (in even stranger costume) proceeded to shoot the whiskey off an unmentionable place, one by one—seven, when all was said and done.
Forty-eight hours before shopping week began, I was eating dust, watching a man on a giant spaceship go up in balls of fire. You should have joined me.
Burning Man, a regular late summer gathering on the silt playa of Nevada’s Black Rock Desert, defies description. You’ll learn from any of the few dozen media profiles out there that two weeks ago, 68,000 people squatted around a giant effigy in clock formation, in the midst of pretty lights and crazy cars. But the moment I decamped on the playa, I could tell there was something more to it. You see, Burning Man ain’t your frat brother’s festival—it’s a strange, immersive totality that is both city and ethos, heaven and hell. There is something uniquely essential about Burning Man, and Harvard kids need it.
Our home on the Charles counts itself as diverse, and by many measures it is. However, as I’ve written before, Harvard tends to select for certain domesticated traits across demographic and socioeconomic lines: conventionality, conscientiousness, and profound risk-aversion. Burning Man, while similarly diverse, selects for the exact opposite—bringing together all the wackiest, most open-minded, and most experimental hippies, rednecks, Silicon Valley execs, and retirees under a common ethos of decommodification, radical self-expression, and civic responsibility.
Your writer would not be a fan of such things if they were but the empty, hokey aspirations of some hippie revivalists. But coming back to Cambridge, where alternative expression and communal earnestness are golf-clapped and then summarily dismissed, the value of Burning Man and the principles by which it runs has become absolutely clear.
There was no such thing as a pleasant day at Burning Man, nor anywhere in the Black Rock Desert, I would imagine—though to be sure, there were plenty of margaritas and pretty girls. Rather, every waking hour resounded with the emotional range of life taken to its most radical possibilities. I became instant friends with neighbors, climbed avant-garde jungle gyms, stood in awe of great craftsmanship, and participated in a wonderful, norms-challenging human carwash. And yet at every corner, there were unspeakable things, too—forcing me to confront the limits of my open-mindedness nearly every few hours.
However, the liberal elite experience sought and delivered at Harvard has little room for things like beauty and terror, which disrupt pleasant equilibria and stop people in their tracks. Perhaps the Burn’s strongest impressions were left in moments full of both: the hour I spend locked in a flashing box with a kind French couple, the time my friend and I ran from a dust storm before an installation challenging us to construct the personalities behind magnified close-ups of open eyes. With moments like these at every step, it’s no wonder that I saw more people in deep, soul-searching contemplation than I’ve seen at college—the officially-sanctioned mecca of self-discovery—over the course of the last three years.
If any of this sounds intriguing and if you can deal with dust, make your next vacation in the Black Rock Desert. Beyond the admission fee of $380 and your initial contribution of supplies, the rest is free—and much of it invaluable. And while cruise or island getaway on a similar order of cost promises to be an exercise in isolation-in-comfort, Burning Man is something you can actually use: belonging in the midst of discomfort.
And finally, if I succeed in convincing you to get lost in the desert for a week next summer, you’ll at some point find yourself pulled over in the godforsaken hamlet of Gerlach, Nevada as you prepare to make your final approach to the playa. A volunteer ranger will hand you a compact program of the week’s events, listed by the hundreds and advertised with ample cheek. Don’t use it: you’re supposed to run into things.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of the fall semester, I made a drastic decision. As a registered Republican on one of America’s most notoriously liberal campuses, I have had to adjust to the widespread eye rolls and exasperated sighs that greet every criticism of the president elected to reshape the world after eight years of the loathed Bush-Cheney administration. While the ubiquity of bleeding heart liberals at an Ivy League university was not unexpected upon my arrival in Cambridge two years ago, it quickly became obvious to me that steadfast support for President Obama springs from something deeper than a young idealist with a supposedly intransigent moral compass becoming disgusted about Bush’s ever-expanding surveillance state. Continued support for Obama in liberal circles is truly stunning, especially considering this summer’s revelations about the administration’s blatant disregard for privacy and fundamental liberties. In order to call attention to the fact that the election of progressive hero Barack Obama has yielded two more terms for the iniquities of his Republican predecessors, I decided to affix a Bush-Cheney ’04 campaign sticker to the front of my laptop.
This decision was not made lightly. After all, while moderate, “squishy” conservatives may be semi-tolerable on Harvard’s campus, the disdain for the Bush administration that propelled Obama into office is still in vogue, both within GOP circles and without. Throughout the nation, coming out as a Bush fan is still considered taboo and may remain so for some time; only recently has political consensus allowed even the most loyal of Democrats to reveal their affinity for little-respected Jimmy Carter.
In light of prevailing opinion, it should seem clear that the prominent placement of my Bush-Cheney sticker should be read with due irony. However, this has not been the case. “You are a Republican,” I am told. “People might think you, like, actually like them!”
I am not particularly worried about curious students inaccurately interpreting my political beliefs. I am confident that those who know me understand my abhorrence of the previous administration’s contemptuous attitude toward civil liberties and its frequent skirting of the Constitution in favor of its own murky ends. However, the sticker is not meant to be a prop in an elaborately staged “How well do you really know me?” game but rather a device of old-fashioned political agitation. My goal is to elicit the combination of unease and visceral disgust from those on this campus trained to treat Bush-Cheney fandom as an unpardonable and incomprehensible offense.
I want the young, party-line Democrats around me to ask themselves why they consider Bush such a dismal president. Nowadays, people might cite his role in causing the financial crisis, but the Bush-Cheney tandem became personae non gratae well before the markets crashed. Six years ago, most of the complaints lodged against the Bush administration involved heinous executive power abuses. A quick trip down memory lane will reveal back to the embroilment in Middle East imbroglios, unconstitutional Guantanamo Bay detentions, and Patriot Act wiretapping questionable on both ethical and legal grounds.
A year into the second term of President Obama, the man elected to bring “change we can believe in” has largely discarded his ambitious domestic agenda—most notably by delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act—in favor of casting his lot with the Bush era neoconservatives, who increasingly find themselves at odds with the Republican Party they once helmed. The president has bolstered Bush’s unmanned drone program, even going so far as to state that it has the legal authority to kill American citizens at its will, as long as the administration determines the citizen to meet the vague standard of being “engaged in combat.” Like Bush and Cheney, Obama seems to believe his war-making powers to be unlimited, extending beyond drone strikes into the insistence that he can go to war even if Congress, the body given the constitutional right to declare war, votes against it.
Furthermore, Obama seems to believe he has not only the authority to kill potentially dangerous Americans but also the power to spy on every single one of them. Among the many revelations in the summer’s NSA scandal was the fact that no email or phone conversation is safe from the intruding eyes of bureaucrats in the Obama administration. This includes the private records of journalists, who have been targeted as potential obstacles to Obama’s consolidation of power.
While unlikely to exert any real pushback against Obama’s continued transgressions against civil liberties, I hope that my Bush-Cheney sticker will at least address the climate that allowed these offenses to take place so frequently. Blinded by optimism, rhetoric, and party ID, too many citizens placed blissful trust in their new, thankfully-not-Bush leader. As a country, we cannot let this happen again.  All I ask when you see my red, white, and blue laptop ornamentation is to ruminate on how we can avoid electing even more Bush-Cheneys in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the golden dome of the Massachusetts State House, a rancorous band of Republican legislators has stalled all proceedings in the House of Representatives. They claim that they are doing so to protest a system in which the dominant Democratic Party abuses its power and limits transparency. These Republican legislators may be using less than praiseworthy tactics, and they may even be acting against their own interests—but they also have a point. The lack of transparency on Beacon Hill needs to be addressed.
The event that sparked the legislators’ protest is a microcosm of the State House’s transparency problem. In the House of Representatives, bills to be approved sit in a small metal box called “the can” that sits on the speaker’s podium. Until recently, any given legislator was free to approach “the can” and sift through its contents to inspect the bills for the day. Elsewise, a member seeking to read upcoming bills would need to go to the clerk’s office or request more information from party leadership.
The system drew ire when House Speaker Robert DeLeo, a Democrat from Winthrop, invoked an old State House rule permitting him to stipulate which legislators can see the contents of “the can.” He limited that right only to the leadership of both parties, claiming that too many rank-and-file legislators were going through the contents and mixing up papers. Five Republican legislators decided that it was unconscionable to limit a legislator’s access to bills on which he or she would be expected to vote, and thus began their protest.
That protest, unfortunately, is unlikely to bring any positive effect. Even the House Republican leadership has condemned it as obstructionist, and the bills being held up are routine bills affecting the day-to-day lives of constituents. State Representative Alice Peisch, a Democrat from Wellesley, strongly condemned the protest by alluding to the “gridlock” in Washington. In a state where the Republican Party is already such a small minority, these tactics are only likely to make the legislators involved seem petulant and out of touch.
That is a shame, because these Republican dissidents are right in their principle. The “can” and the tradition it represents are antiquated at best and insidious at worst. There is no reason why bills to be approved by a body of the Massachusetts government should not be easily accessible to both legislators and citizens. These bills should be logged in an accessible format online. This would solve both the transparency problem and the ridiculous problem of having to limit access to “the can” because papers are getting mixed up.
State House Republicans—as well as their Democratic colleagues—should make transparency a priority. Rather than holding up all business in a vital chamber of government, the protesters should begin raising public awareness about Massachusetts’ transparency problems and then begin working to fix them. Bills to be discussed or approved should be available online in an accessible format, as should records of deliberations and roll calls on individual bills. Such changes are feasible and would make the government a much better servant of the people.
Fortunately for Massachusetts residents, State Representative Dan Winslow, a Republican from Norfolk, has introduced a law to digitize the “can,” making all state House bills available online. Enacting such a law would be a positive step toward greater transparency in the Bay State, and Representative Winslow’s legislative approach should serve as an example to his protesting colleagues.

Almost 100 laptops are stolen on Harvard property each year, according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, but HUPD hopes that a new tracking software being offered this fall will help recover more lost and stolen devices.
The software, known as LoJack for Laptops and developed by Absolute Software, activates GPS technology when the owner of a device reports it as missing. A four-year subscription is partially subsidized by the University, Catalano said, and costs $20.
LoJack is gradually replacing STOP—Security Tracking Online Property—which Harvard students have used to recover their property since 1999. STOP affixes a plaque with a registration number to a laptop’s casing for $10, and although it was effective at recovering lost laptops, Catalano said, people had to report to HUPD if they saw a laptop with the plaque affixed. As a result, the program relied on an “honesty factor” to return laptops to their owners.
Catalano said LoJack offers a more comprehensive and technologically advanced system. Once reported to either HUPD or Absolute Software, he said, lost or stolen laptops are recovered 75 percent of the time.
In response to questions about student privacy concerns, Catalano said privacy is not hindered by installing LoJack because laptop tracking is only enabled when a missing device is reported. “[HUPD] has no ability to track your computer until you either report it to us or directly to LoJack,” he said.
HUPD has held various events around campus since late August for students to register their laptops through LoJack. Students can also register laptops online for free, without LoJack’s tracking software, and HUPD registers bicycles by noting serial number, make, and model and issuing a numbered sticker for the bike.
Although precise figures on the number of students who have installed LoJack are not yet available, a HUPD officer on duty at a registration table in Mather Thursday night said that approximately 15 students per hour were registering their laptops during peak hours. “There are a lot of people interested,” Catalano said.
The registration drives will continue until Sept. 16, after which students can continue to register their laptops online and at HUPD offices.

Two researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have developed a new technique to construct biological structures the size of a grain of sand with unprecedented precision, a discovery that could herald better construction of artificial tissues.
While biomedical researchers have been able to assemble structures on a nano-scale, constructing precise, medium-scale structures—those that are the size of a grain of sand—has long posed a significant challenge.
“People are really good at making things that are astonishingly small, but it’s really hard to do stuff in the middle,” said Casey N. Grun ’14, the project’s undergraduate research assistant. “It’s about trying to establish things in this meso-scale...which is a sweet spot.”
Meso-scale structures involve combinations of biocompatible hydrogel blocks: water-based biological substances that can be inserted in the human body without causing adverse effects. A downside to using gel blocks, however, has been combining them in the right order. Ali Khademhosseini and Peng Yin, two professors at the Harvard Medical School, tackled the problem with a technique they dubbed “DNA glue.”
“Think about glue in everyday—with everyday glue, you can more or less make any two objects stick together,” Yin said. “But with DNA glue, if we made some blocks blue and some blocks red, we could make the glue so that only the red color can stick the red color, [and] the blue color only sticks to the blue color.”
A strand of DNA consists of a sequence of nucleotides, and nucleotides can only combine in certain patterns. By coating gel blocks with specific DNA sequences, Khademhosseini and Yin were able to ensure that the blocks connected correctly.
Grun worked in Peng’s lab with a software that allowed him to design the sequences of DNA that bound the blocks together. He had to ensure that the “DNA glue” only attached to other DNA. “It is a challenging problem because it’s not immediately obvious how to design long sequences of DNA that don’t bind spuriously with other things,” said Grun.
Khademhosseini and Yin said they hope further research could apply this new technique in medical procedures, such as the treatment of damaged human tissues.
They detailed their process in the Sept. 9, online issue of Nature Communications, and Khademhosseini described the improvements that this technique could facilitate in artificial tissue development and implementation in an email to The Crimson.
“By using these gels that can be self-assembled with DNA glue, we can aim to recreate such architectures to better enable the formation of engineered tissues,” Khademhosseini wrote. “Of course, this is far away still but [it is] one way that we can try to go about engineering artificial tissues.”

Beginning next week, members of the Harvard community and the University’s neighbors may not need to venture into Harvard’s laboratories to sample liquid nitrogen ice cream. Instead, they can visit Churn, an ice cream kiosk that uses liquid nitrogen to create any flavor in just seconds and just one of multiple new culinary offerings and artistic displays on the Science Center Plaza implemented by the Harvard Common Spaces Program this fall.
“When the renovated space opened in April, we had our core group of food trucks, and now that’s started to grow because the [food truck] community has heard about how popular this location is,” said Lisa Hogarty, Vice President for Campus Services.
The plaza recently welcomed Benny’s Crepe Café and Bon Me to the existing line-up of food trucks. Hogarty added that a Middle Eastern food truck might debut later this fall and that she anticipates trucks will continue to serve on the plaza throughout the semester.
Bon Me Truck, founded in 2010 by Patrick M. Lynch ’01 and Ali Fong, serves Vietnamese cuisine every Wednesday and Friday. Teagan M. Lehrmann ’13, the Catering Director and Business Development Manager for Bon Me Foods, said she “really pushed to be on the new Science Center Plaza” after witnessing the impact of the new campus initiatives during her time as an undergraduate. While Lehrmann said Harvard is not Bon Me’s most lucrative location, she estimated that the Science Center truck serves about 300 customers per day.
Churn finished securing its licensing Wednesday, and will likely open next week, according to Hogarty. She added that the ice cream kiosk has partnered with Harvard Student Agencies to train student employees.
A new arts market on the plaza also launched last Friday and will feature local artists and crafters, as well as a student concert series. Like the Tuesday farmers’ market, the arts market is poised to be a weekly occurrence and should help the Common Spaces Initiative meet its goal of increasing the number of student performances on the plaza, according to Hogarty.
The Common Spaces Program—a concept proposed by University President Drew G. Faust soon after she first took office—initially focused on finding spaces on the Harvard campus with the potential to become exciting destinations and bring the community together.
“The plaza was really first and foremost in our minds because it is the crossroads where everybody traverses the campus,” Hogarty said.
Hogarty also said that the University used multiple focus groups to discern what types of activities people wanted to see on the plaza. An overwhelming number of participants requested interesting food options, which prompted the Common Spaces Program to pursue food trucks.
The new offerings have been complemented by increased—and creative—seating options. The colorful, puzzle-piece chairs surrounding Annenberg were inspired by “colorful tetris pieces in parks in France,” Hogarty said.
The plaza recently entertained more than 3,000 guests after Faust gave her opening-of-the-year welcome address [LINK 1] in Sanders Theatre on Tuesday afternoon, and it will continue to host events throughout the year.
“The plaza is really a first for Harvard,” said Hogarty.  “Rather than just going to a basketball game or a football game, this is a space where all the schools, all the different student groups, and the Cambridge community can come together.”

Hundreds of paper airplanes zoomed across Sanders Theatre early Thursday evening to open this year’s Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, an event that honors unusual scientific and mathematical achievements.
Following a 22-year-old tradition, over one thousand audience members aimed their makeshift planes at a human target standing onstage. Cheers filled the theater every time one of the planes hit their target.
“We are gathered here to celebrate achievements that make people laugh, then make people think,” Master of Ceremonies Marc A. Abrahams ’78 said.
The annual ceremony was organized by the Annals of Improbable Research, an international science humor magazine, in conjunction with the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students.
Established in 1991, the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony allows Nobel laureates to present ten awards for unusual, imaginative, and quirky research projects. During the ceremony, five Nobel laureates including Eric S. Maskin ’72 and Roy J. Glauber ’45-’46, awarded the winners.
This year, prizes were given for projects ranging from chemistry to probability to public health. Awardees were given 60 seconds to explain their work, after which an eight-year-old girl came up and asked them to stop. Researchers sang, dressed up in mouse costumes, and brought giant red bouncy balls onstage.
The psychology prize, awarded to a paper entitled “Beauty is in the Eye of the Beer Holder,” drew particularly raucous laughter from the audience. The project allowed researchers to “confirm by experiment that people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive.”
“The group of winners this year was just astoundingly unexpected, and that’s what we want,” Abrahams said.
Eric Warrant and Marcus Byrne, two Ig Nobel awardees, first began their research on dung beetles after meeting at a beetle biology contest. They found that dung beetles can use the Milky Way to orient themselves.
Warrant and Byrne said that they were glad their work was receiving so much attention and that the ceremony gave them the chance to share their love for science.
“It’s a serious piece of work, but the humor surrounding the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony helps bring it out to the general public,” Warrant said.
“We’re not trying to promote dung beetles,” Byrne added. “We’re just trying to promote curiosity in science.”
The ceremony was also punctuated with “moments of science”—science demonstrations including a four-part mini-opera and 60-second lectures on various topics.
Both Nobel laureates and audience members alike said that the event was a celebration of everything that is fun and interesting about science.
“I think [the ceremony’s] contribution to science is smaller than any infinitesimal unit you can name,” said Glauber, who participated in the “Win-a-Date with a Nobel Laureate” Contest. “But if it’s fun, you have to reckon that there is something positive.”
Whitney Nimitpattana ’15, who attended the event with friends from the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students, said that she had been looking forward to attending the ceremony since high school.
“It’s a great way to make science really accessible to the public,” Nimitpattana said. “Plus, it’s the best nerd gathering ever. As a self-proclaimed nerd, I can attest to that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seeking its first win of the season at Providence on Thursday night, the Harvard men’s soccer team held the lead for just over two minutes in the first half.
Just before the break, junior forward Hiroki Kobayashi broke through the Friars’ defense and beat Providence goalkeeper Keasel Broome, netting his first goal of the season. But the Friars (4-0-1) responded quickly on the other end, and Harvard (0-3) fell, 3-1, in its third consecutive loss.
“We really wanted to beat this team,” said senior defender Ross Friedman, who had two of the Crimson’s five shots. “They play in the Big East against a lot of strong competition, and it’s a very well known program.”
Playing against the wind and into the sun in the first half, the Crimson was on its heels as the Friars came out firing. Providence took eight shots to Harvard’s two and was awarded four corner kicks, the last of which led to its first goal.
After a corner kick into the box, the ball bounced around with five seconds to play in the first half. Freshman midfielder Julian Gressel collected a low cross from sophomore midfielder Manny Andrade and beat Crimson goalkeeper Brett Conrad from the right side to tie the game.
Despite losing its lead, Harvard got on the board first in its second straight game. Last time out against Davidson, the Crimson scored in the 60th minute before allowing the game-tying goal 12 minutes later and going down, 2-1, with less than three minutes on the game clock.
“We sustained a pretty heavy onslaught in the first half,” Harrington said. “We were able to come out of that with a goal and the lead. The positive takeaway is that we were able to stick with it and stay confident, even though the game wasn’t going our way for the first thirty minutes.”
The Crimson held off the Friars for the first thirty minutes of the second half when—locked in a 1-1 tie—Providence capitalized on a penalty kick to take the lead for good. In the second of two goals scored off set pieces, senior midfielder Anthony Baumann scored his first goal of the season after being fouled in transition.
Five minutes later, the Friars opened up their lead to two. Conrad blocked a shot by freshman defender Nick Sailor, but Andrade collected the rebound and fired it into the lower left corner of the net. It was the third straight game in which Harvard allowed a goal in the final 20 minutes.
“When we’re down at the end of the game, we’re pushing forward trying and trying to score, so it’s a little bit of a give and take,” Friedman said. “You’ve got to throw numbers forward, and it leaves you a little vulnerable in the back at times.”
The Crimson started three freshmen against the Friars, midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu and forwards Ashi Geberkidane and Daniel Smith. Smith and Geberkidane have started all three games this season, and six of the seven rookies on the roster have seen playing time. Geberkidane is second on the team—after Friedman—with four shots, including three on goal.
“They’re getting used to the college game,” Friedman said. “Obviously there’s a little bit of a learning curve, but they’ve adjusted really well. A great part about our program is that we see ourselves as a team of leaders, so they have just as much influence on and off the field as a senior does, and I think we’re a better team for it.”
The Crimson struggled to find opportunities on the offensive end of the ball, taking a season-low five shots throughout the course of the 90-minute game. Harvard opened its season with a nine-shot showing against Iona but was unable to score.
Last time out against Davidson, the Crimson had 16 chances, one of which found the net. In order to start picking up wins, Harvard will need to overcome the 1.97 average goal differential of the last three games.
Under the new leadership of coach Pieter Lehrer—hired after the 2012 season—the Crimson is confident that the season will continue to come together in the five games before conference play begins in early October.
“The bounces weren’t going our way, but we had a lot of chances we could have capitalized on,” Harrington said. “It was not because of any individual performance or lack of effort. We can’t really let it linger on our minds for too long. We’ve got a big game coming up on Sunday, and that’s the focus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s tennis team will commence its Ivy League title defense this weekend when it hosts the Harvard Chowder Fest at the Beren Center.
The Crimson will hit the ground running, taking on top teams UC Berkeley, Tulsa, and San Diego as it begins the quest for its third consecutive Ancient Eight crown.
“We’ve invited three of the best teams in the country this year,” head coach Dave Fish said. “It’s a great test for our guys to see some of the best caliber players in the country and see how we stack up.”
Last season, Harvard had a banner year, posting a 6-1 record in Ivy play for the second straight year en route to the title. The sole blemish on The Crimson’s conference record was a late-season home loss to Brown.
Harvard, which at one point last year was ranked as highly as No. 17 in the nation, also advanced to the second round of the NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament for the second straight year. The Crimson fell to tenth-ranked Mississippi State, 4-1, on their home court in the Round of 32 after trouncing Samford, 4-0, in the opening round.
This season, Harvard will have to fight to reclaim its Ancient Eight crown as it replaces graduated co-captain Andy Nguyen, w a vital part of the Crimson’s singles and doubles lineups.
Junior Christo Schultz returns to the team this season after taking last year off. Harvard will also work three new freshmen into the lineup this season: Andrew Ball, from Palo Alto, Calif., Sebastian Beltrame, from Windermere, Fla., and Brian Yeung, from Hong Kong.
“Andy is a big loss, but our three freshmen are very strong,” said Fish. “All three of them are terrific, and I’m sure they’ll be great players for us. We can feel their intensity right away, and they’ll be competing for spots.”
The Crimson will start its season against some stiff competition. The Golden Bears finished last season ranked 17th in the country and advanced to the Round of 16 in the NCAA tournament. Cal also features two players, seniors Ben McLachlan and Campbell Johnson, who earned preseason top-50 rankings.
The No. 25 Golden Hurricane, who fell to Baylor in the Round of 32 of NCAAs, boast two players in the top-30 in the singles rankings, including No. 12 Japie De Klerk.
Meanwhile, the Toreros finished the season ranked 40th, and also reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament before losing to No. 4 USC.
Harvard will look to build on its success from last year, and will lean on its strong core of young players. The team graduated just one senior and has only one this season, co-captain Casey MacMaster.
MacMaster will team with junior Denis Nguyen in first doubles. The duo posted a 12-2 record in dual play last season, and opens this year ranked 20th in ITA preseason polls.
Doubles was a particularly strong suit for the Crimson last year, as the team captured the doubles point in 19 of its 25 matches, including a stretch of 12 straight. The second team was broken up due to Andy Nguyen’s departure, but junior Alex Steinroeder and sophomore Kelvin Lam were effective on the third court last year, notching an 8-2 record in dual play.
But Harvard’s success was not limited to doubles. Denis Nguyen, who solidified the top singles slot, and junior Shaun Chaudhuri, who went 11-5 in dual play on the second court, gave the Crimson some sorely needed punch at the top of the lineup.
Harvard will continue to use the fall as a tune-up for the Ivy season, and has a full slate of matches to build team chemistry and gain the experience necessary to match and build on last year’s success.
“The fall season is a time for individual development and coming together as a team,” Chaudhuri said. “We welcome our new players and see how they adjust, and try out new doubles pairings, and try to get better each match.”
After the Chowder Fest, the Crimson will hit the road for a series of tournaments, including the Ivy Tournament in New Haven, a trip to Texas A&M, and the ITA Northeast Regionals in late October before the Halloween Invite in Cambridge in early November.
“The guys are really motivated and are working hard,” Fish said. “If they keep doing battle, we’ll have a stronger lineup than last year. It’s a good group of guys, so we’re optimistic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It will be a homecoming weekend for eight of the 15 members of the Harvard women’s volleyball team as the Crimson squad (2-0) heads west to the Holiday Inn Mission Valley Aztec Invitational in San Diego, Calif. this weekend.
Harvard will face San Diego State (3-3), the tournament’s host, on Friday night, and then play Southern Methodist University (5-2) and San Francisco (1-5) on Saturday.  This weekend’s tournament is the first time the team has taken a West Coast road trip since 2006.
All three opponents enter the tournament with at least six games each under their belts, in comparison to the two matches the Crimson have played this season. Despite a lack of playing experience this season, Harvard has already taken command of the court with a new offensive system.
“We’re really excited about the tournament because first, a lot of us are from California so it’s fun to go back home, and second, because we get to play teams that are from the West Coast,” said sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte. “A lot of times, West Coast volleyball is just a little more competitive since it’s more of a West Coast sport.”
The Crimson arrives in San Diego with two come-from-behind wins against Holy Cross and Hofstra last weekend, as well as a record-setting game from Holte and Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors for freshman setter Corinne Bain in her collegiate debut. Harvard dropped both first sets to their opponents and was pushed to four games against Hofstra and five in a nail-biter over Holy Cross.
Bain provided a team high 59 assists over the weekend, while sophomore Hannah Schmidt provided relief at the net with 30 through the two matches. Consistent setting was a component of Harvard taking the pair of twins.
“We’re looking to build off our two wins last weekend as we go up against some tougher competition in San Diego,” said sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Shults. “We’ve focused a lot this preseason on staying disciplined at the net.”
Shults, along with Holte and junior middle blocker Caroline Walters, have also provided their own intensity at the net. The three are powerful blockers, with Holte having had a career-high 12 blocks against Hofstra last Saturday. The Crimson ranks No. 1 in the NCAA in blocks per set, with 3.78.
Bain has also been a power on offense, with 18 kills, second to sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace and her 20 kills.
Co-captain Natalie Doyle has taken the reins defensively, starting at setter. Doyle tallied 40 digs during the opening weekend. Junior co-captain and outside hitter Kristen Casey comes second, with 26 digs. The pair will be important against the hard-hitting trio of teams the Crimson will face.
“I think it will be fun to play against these teams that we’re approaching this weekend because they’re going to come at us with a quicker offense for us to adjust to,” Holte said. “We’re a scrappy team in the back row and we don’t let balls drop.”
SMU poses the strongest record of the three teams, having dropped just one of 10 sets at their home tournament last weekend. Their seven players at attack all have a hitting percentage above .200, with four of those seven near .300.
Likewise, SDSU poses an offensive threat. While the team doesn’t possess the consistent hitting percentage of the Mustangs, the squad’s top two hitters, senior outside hitters Summer Nash and Raegan Shelton, both average over three kills per set. Nash hits nearly four kills per sets.
San Francisco’s top hitters, Marina Terrell, Valentina Zaloznik, and Anja Segota, respectively, average 3.64, 2.80 and 2.44 kills per set. The team opened its season with five straight losses, but notched its first win, a 3-0 sweep of Air Force, this past weekend.
The team will face four more non-conference opponents after this weekend. The Crimson opens its Ancient Eight slate on September 27 against Dartmouth at home.
“I think our strength comes from our endurance and that’s going to help us in the Ivies,” Holte said. “I think that frustrates the other teams. We’re ready to win that Ivy title and we know we can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a slow start, the Harvard field hockey squad (1-2) notched its first victory of the season on Friday night against Holy Cross (1-2), rallying off four straight goals in the second half to beat the Crusaders for the seventh straight year.
Prior to the contest, the Crimson had struggled offensively this season—in its two losses last weekend, the team managed to score just one goal. Harvard’s shooting woes continued through the first half of Friday night’s game, and neither side managed to notch a goal by halftime.
“It wasn’t that we were struggling,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We just didn’t have enough conviction to put the ball in the net. We played a pretty good ﬁrst half overall, but we needed to adjust some things and pick up the intensity after halftime.”
The game continued slowly for the opening of the second half, until with just under 20 minutes remaining in the contest, freshman forward Sarah Finnemore was able to break the silence, scoring both her and the Crimson’s second goal of the season.
“We just picked up the intensity after halftime,” Finnemore said. “We really started focusing on the fundamentals and worked hard to keep the pressure on Holy Cross.”
After Finnemore’s ﬁrst goal, the ﬂood gates opened.
“I thought as the game went on that we played a little bit harder,” Painter said. “We really adjusted our mindset. We came out with the attitude that on every 50-50 ball, we were going to beat the Holy Cross player to it. When we got into the circle, we were going to take shots immediately and get the rebounds. It was really a mindset transition at halftime.”
Five minutes later, junior forward Noel Painter followed with her ﬁrst goal of the season, putting Harvard up 2-0 with only 14 minutes to go.
“Once we started scoring, we deﬁnitely got into a groove,” Finnemore said. “The passes started going stick to stick, and it really got a lot better.”
Finnemore then added the third goal of her short career, assisted by fellow freshman forward Marissa Balleza, while sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson rounded off the scoring for the match with ﬁve minutes left in the contest, thanks to an assist from Painter.
“Its wonderful to see [Finnemore] scoring three goals already,” Painter said.  “She’s a very talented and incredible player, and having her score and play at such a high level really helps to encourage all of us to do the same. It was nice that I got one into the back of the net as well, and I was glad that I could assist [Jacobson] on her goal, too.”
This was the Crimson’s first shutout of the season and marked a strong overall defensive performance from the team. Senior goalie Jenn Hatﬁeld notched six saves during the match as did Holy Cross goalie Maya Langman, who was playing her ﬁrst game of the year.
For the last several years, Harvard has met the Crusaders early in the season, winning the last seven contests. Over that time period, the Crimson has dominated the scoreboard, with an aggregate score of 22-2. However, Harvard went on to have losing seasons each of those years.
“We need to capitalize on our scoring chances more often,” Finnemore said. “We had some in the ﬁrst half that could have been goals, so when we have the opportunity to score we really need to make sure we do. We need to make sure we capitalize on any chances we have in the offensive circle and try not to give any defensive corners going forward.”
The Crimson will look to do just that as the team opens up Ivy League play at Yale next week.
“We need to come out with a tougher, more intense mindset early in the games,” Painter said. “We need to make sure to get the balls in the net early as we play tougher teams and enter Ivy League competition…We have been practicing hard and will be ready to go [next match].”

I’ve spent time recently in Lamont Cafe, Annenberg, and Pennypacker basement, despite not being a freshman (extenuating circumstances for each, I swear!), and I’ve overheard way too many conversations to this effect:
“Did you know Harvard gives us money to buy burritos??”
“I heard that, but I want to save money to do laundry…”
Actually, that's not quite how it works. Here’s a detailed breakdown of our campus currencies—not that we should need it, but we evidently do.
CRIMSON CASH, a.k.a your geographically-limited debit card
Default balance: $0
Used for: laundry, business in the Square, vending machines
Load it up: here. The site asks for your 16 digit CC number, which is annoying. Go ahead and make a note of it, though, since it’s also useful in case you ever forget your ID and need to eat in a dhall.
BOARD PLUS, a.k.a. Harvard really does pay for your burritos!
Default balance: $65 at the beginning of the semester. Rolls over from fall to spring, but expires on the last day of spring term.
Used for: Greenhouse and Lamont Cafe, mainly, but you can use it to pay for food elsewhere. Here’s a Flyby post outlining some of the other options.
PAPERCUT, a.k.a. “Was Hist and Lit really such a good choice?”
Default balance: $0
Used for: Printing all of your readings before you go and read every word of them, right?
Load it up: here. You can also install Papercut on your laptop if you want to print from your own computer to a Harvard printer, though the setup process can be confusing. Here’s Harvard's “foolproof” guide, if you’re interested.
TERM BILL, a.k.a. feels dangerously like free money
Default balance: $$$$$
Used for: Paying if your dorm room’s in disastrous condition at the end of the school year. Also: lots of random outings, PaperCut, UHS drugs [pharmaceutical] and massages and acupuncture at the Harvard University Center for Wellness.
Load it up: never. Any Term Bill spending you do gets added to your actual bill. Since $10 of printing charges won't seem like so much next to thousands of dollars in tuition fees, it's easy to get carried away with this spend-now/pay-later scheme. Don't say we didn't warn you.
Amidst the flurry that is the college application process, it’s hard to keep up with what’s going on in the news, and even to keep up with the constant stream of information that should help you find the right school for you.
Well now, The Admissions Blog is here to keep you informed and sate your curiosity with the first installment of our weekly news series. Check back each Friday in order to stay abreast of scandal, drama, and shenanigans (or, you know, policy changes) of college admissions.
SOCIAL U. For all the ambitious middle schoolers out there, this one’s for you. LinkedIn lowered its U.S. age limit yesterday to 13 years old, hoping to get kids using its new University Pages to connect with college students and explore the kinds of jobs graduates of particular majors or universities now have.   The ACT has forayed into social media as well, with ACT Profile open to anyone age 13 and older. Presumably the youngins can network for their lemonade stands too.
RANKINGS, CONT. As we’ve mentioned, this year’s U.S. News and World Report college rankings just came out. The Washington Post and The Atlantic advise ignoring them. The Chronicle of Higher Education suggests going DIY and customizing your own rankings on College Factual.

GOOGLE FOR COLLEGE. According to University of Virginia acting assistant prof. Ben Castleman, behavioral science and better college search engines are the key to getting more students into the right schools.  Castleman maintains that students  who can’t pay for private college counselors to curate a list of  colleges would benefit from a website that offers  suggestions like, “Here are five schools near you with high graduation  rates that are for most students pretty affordable. Do you want to start  looking at these?” Sort of like Netflix, but for colleges.
EARLY DECISION DECISIONS. Stressing about those upcoming early  decision/action deadlines?  Not sure whether to apply now or later?  Not even sure what early decision or early action are?  Fox Business says it’s got you covered.  Includes useful information about timing an application to maximize financial aid.
CAMPUS SECRETS.  If you're hopelessly in love with the imposing architecture of Yale or Princeton, steel yourself: Those gorgeous Gothic towers have a major racism problem.  Or so says Robinson Meyer over at The Atlantic as he picks apart the classic U.S. collegiate campus’s historical roots. Stanford’s palm trees and Mediterranean style are starting to look pretty good…
