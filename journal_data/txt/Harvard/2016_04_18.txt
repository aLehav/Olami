After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Jungle Book,” popularized by Walt Disney’s 1967 happy-go-lucky animated comedy of the same name, takes on a whole new skin under director Jon Favreau’s command. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, this live-action version of Rudyard Kipling’s classic novel stuns with breaktaking scenery and emotional complexity, lending a mature light to the otherwise entertaining children’s movie.
The film follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a “man-cub” raised in the jungle by wolves. He struggles to assimilate with his animal peers, who single him out as an odd and potentially dangerous creature. Despite his efforts to disregard his human characteristics and the fierce familial protection of his adoptive mother, Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o), Mowgli’s differences end up putting him in danger anyway when he is hunted down by a tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba). Facing no choice but to leave the jungle forever, he and his longtime mentor Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) begin their exodus, only to be met by a series of obstacles that force Mowgli to venture into the wild once again.
Set deep within the jungles of India, this film has an enormous amount of potential to recreate the gorgeous scenes of flora and fauna described in Kipling’s book and does so spectacularly. Scenes feature twisting branches enveloped in mist, a swampy river flanked by trees that glistens in radiant sunlight, and even a colossal temple of ruins, perfect for the villains lurking in its shadows. From brilliant fields of fire to golden sweeps of grass, “The Jungle Book” does not disappoint visually. Each minute is striking in its own way, whether it be painting joyous, idyllic scenes or ones saturated in guilt, anger, or anxiety.
The visual range of “The Jungle Book” complements its emotional one perfectly. Shere Khan shocks with his turbulent personality. He can exude sweetness and reason one second and crazed bloodlust the next. Other characters, though not quite as volatile, are equally complicated. Raksha’s conflicting loyalties to her adoptive son Mowgli and her biological cubs and family are heartbreaking, and Baloo’s (Bill Murray) languid and laid-back characteristics contrast beautifully with his savage strength and admirable dedication to Mowgli’s safety. Meanwhile, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) appears motherly yet threatening. These characters are fully fleshed out rather than being dumbed down to tropes, a refreshing twist on a genre that tends to rely so heavily on cliché.
Of course, much of this character complexity would not be possible without the actors’ stellar performances, particularly Sethi’s. Child actors are notorious for being immensely awkward on screen. They may oversell their lines, adopt a cloyingly sweet tone, or give the impression of reading straight from the script. However, Sethi does an admirable job of balancing his childlike whimsy with his maturation as a “man-cub.” He questions Bagheera with an innate, youthful persistence and displays a selfishness found in all people, young or old. And when Mowgli learns how to “grow up” in the film, Sethi adopts an intelligence and self-sacrificing persona that fits well with his curious and intuitive playfulness. His performance, though occasionally pretentious, is for the most part remarkable, rendering Mowgli quick-witted and responsible while still retaining his boyish qualities.
“The Jungle Book” falls into a few tropes in the end, wrapping up the plotline a little too cleanly and sentimentally; nevertheless, it remains unwaveringly compelling throughout. Sethi’s promising abilities coupled with the wide range of emotions found in both the scenery and characters render “The Jungle Book” a delightful yet insightful film.

“How can we lodge the truth of history in national discourse and public policy?” asked President Faust in a centenary tribute to historian John Hope Franklin, whose 1941 Harvard doctorate marked an African-American milestone. In accord with Franklin, she argues that academic history must become “a recognized part of everyday life and understanding.” Yet toward that aim, Harvard’s current flinching from slavery’s echoes—the House ‘masters’, the Law School’s seal—seems regressive. Expunging the Royall seal does not right past wrongs; it speeds their oblivion. Replacing ‘House masters’ with an anodyne term is the verbal whitewashing that Franklin deplored. He insisted that we must “confront our past and see it for what it is”—and our past necessarily includes the sordid story of American slavery’s subsequent neglect.
Here I voice a concurrent concern: Risks to Harvard’s scholarly repute. In justifying the removal of the title and seal, Harvard’s deans, the Law School, and the Corporation flouted accepted historical tenets. Condemning Washington and Jefferson along with Isaac Royall—and by implication all slaveholders—for their “moral feet of clay as slave-owners,” the Law School committee seems to forget that slavery was long a generally approved practise. So the committee did what it denied doing, “judging . . . the eighteenth century by the standards of the twenty-first.” Deans self-righteously extenuated the out-dated usages of bygone undergraduates. Expunging ‘master’ didn’t mean that the “old title was necessarily ‘wrong’”; rather, alumni who fondly remembered “the master of their beloved house should have no qualms in doing so.” The linguistic crudity of their unenlightened epoch is humored as “part of [a] long and proud history.” As for the Law School seal, the Corporation laments that the 1936 begetters failed to foresee “that its imagery might evoke associations with slavery.” Had those old-timers been more prescient, they would “quite likely” have rejected the seal. Too bad they were not more like us!
It is one thing to condemn past injustice, quite another to blame its perpetrators for lacking present probity. Blessed with “that absolute knowledge of right and wrong which enables us to pass final judgment on the men of the past,” wrote Inquisition historian Henry C. Lea in 1903, we complacently “measure them by our own moral yardstick.” But every sin condemned even in the Ten Commandments has been thought a virtue. Moreover, censuring predecessors puts us at like mercy of posterity; we cannot predict for what sins our successors will chastise us. “As we would have our descendants judge us, so ought we to judge our fathers,” advised the British historian T. B. Macaulay. “To form a correct estimate of their merits, we ought . . . to put out of our minds, for a time, all that knowledge which they could not have.”
The dilemma is that historical hindsight leaves our heads at odds with our hearts. “We are all convinced that enslaving human beings is bad,” concludes jurist-historian John T. Noonan Jr. ’47. “Can anyone today contemplate the slave trader or slaveholder without a shudder of disgust? … Abstractly, we may concede that [they] . . . thought that they acted justly. In our bones we experience repugnance and even righteous rage.” Rage and repugnance fuel reformist zeal, but they blind us to our own biases and obscure our understanding of the conflicted history we inherit.
Harvard’s reformers privilege the virtuous present over the villainous past. The deans would revoke any tradition that they feel discomfiting, like the term ‘master’. “Titles can and should change when such a change serves our mission,” which requires erasing “barriers” and “impediments” to collegiality—obstacles like references to slavery or, indeed, any offensive words or ideas.
But a university is not a refuge for students “to be protected from any form of dissent,” as Rachel E. Huebner ’18 recently wrote; instead, counseled the late Yale professor C. Vann Woodward, it ought to be “a forum for the new, the provocative, the disturbing, and the unorthodox.” College should be a place where barriers are confronted, not eliminated; students should learn to master impediments, not erase them. But doing so requires that they engage with often abhorrent, distressing, offensive ideas and values of other times. “Representing the past,” remarks historian of slavery David Blight, “needs to cause pain.”
To suppose that our precursors would have shared today’s social ideals, if only less blinkered, is incongruous presentism. To deplore and then palliate past failure to live up to modern morality is patronizing anachronism. To expunge visual reminders of a discomfiting past is ahistorical myopia. Retrospective humility mandates not only remembering the authors of acts and views now condemned, but also preserving the honors accorded to them as cautionary reminders. We need tangible mementos of actions and agents once acclaimed but since repudiated, once lauded but since loathed. They are lessons in the transience of fame and the perils of hero worship. It is futile to erase or hide a disconcerting history. “The good and bad of our past [are] inherently entwined,” as Professor Annette Gordon-Reed noted in urging the Law School to keep the Royall seal. History can be hard to digest, but it must be swallowed whole to undeceive the present and edify the future.

David Lowenthal ’44 is Emeritus Professor of Geography and Honorary Research Fellow at University College London. He is the author, most recently, of “The Past Is a Foreign Country—Revisited."

To the editors:
In your recent editorial opposing divestment, you write:
“Divestment is a profoundly hypocritical answer. All Harvard affiliates—from the administrators in Massachusetts Hall to the recently arraigned Divest protesters—look to fossil fuels every day as a helpful convenience. Our morning routines alone involve heated rooms, alarm clocks, hot showers, and lit hallways—all made possible by the combustion of long-dead dinosaurs.”
When President Faust made a similar argument—the argument from hypocrisy—the fossil-fuel industry’s major anti-divestment organization jumped on it, quoting it prominently on its website. They seemed to think it important, as you do.  But it is a fallacious argument.
Buying or keeping any shares puts the shareholder in the position of hoping that the value of those shares will increase.  The share price of fossil fuel companies rests on their continuing to pursue their present plans to extract and sell the fuel in their existing reserves and to search for new reserves.  If the fuel in existing reserves is extracted and burned, most calculations indicate that the temperature of the earth will rise enough to have catastrophic effects on human societies.  If governments and consumer pressure succeed in slowing or preventing this extraction and burning through carbon taxes or outright bans, the prices of the fossil-fuel companies’ stock would fall.  If we own that stock, we thus must hope that extraction and burning proceeds at the current or a faster pace.
Those who use these companies’ products to fuel their cars, heat their houses, and power their computers may hope, without any hint of hypocrisy, that taxes, bans, and consumer decisions reduce the attractiveness of fossil fuels, that research will produce renewable, affordable alternatives, that fossil-fuel companies find themselves undercut in price and efficiency by other industries, and that their reserves stay in the ground, so that they do not contribute to a fast-developing environmental and public health catastrophe.
Investors in fossil-fuel companies, in short, may and do have different objectives and aims from those of the users of fossil fuel products. There is nothing inconsistent—much less hypocritical—in buying and using these products today while pressing for their replacement as soon as possible by safer alternatives.  Nor is there anything inconsistent—much less hypocritical—in buying and using these products today while asking the institution one reveres not to put itself, gratuitously, in the position of hoping financially that these fuels will not be replaced.
The world-wide divestment movement has already changed consciousness and inspired questioning of the fossil fuel economy.  If there are sustainable arguments against it—not just that its proponents are hypocritical or should be doing something better with their time—its opponents should be willing to advance those arguments in civil public debate.

Jane J. Mansbridge is the Charles F. Adams Professor of Political Leadership and Democratic Values at the Harvard Kennedy School.           Daniel I. Wikler is the Mary B. Saltonstall Professor of Ethics and Population Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Both have signed a letter calling on Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2016, 12:37 a.m.
Amherst College set off a firestorm in May 2014 when it announced that it would ban students from joining fraternities and sororities and punish those who do. “Prohibiting student participation in off-campus organizations is an unprecedented incursion on the liberties of Amherst College students,” said a referendum supported by 70 percent of students, launching a campus-wide and national conversation about Amherst’s right to impose such a ban that’s stayed in place throughout the academic year.
Ninety miles eastward, Harvard seems to be tumbling down a similar path as the discourse around final clubs grows more bellicose. Last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana floated the possibility of barring undergraduate members of final clubs from holding leadership positions like team captaincies and from receiving fellowships. The idea of sanctions, suggested during a tense meeting with graduate and undergraduate leaders of final clubs, was speculative. But even so, it gives reason to worry about the College’s creeping encroachment on student life.
We have long condemned final clubs for cultivating such a toxic campus social environment. But sanctions elicit immediate questions of practicality. How the College would go about identifying students in final clubs is anyone’s guess. So is the question of whether the sanctions would be extended to other fraternity-like organizations. If so, still unclear would be the definition of a fraternity-like organization, especially as other groups would begin to fill the social void on campus in the wake of sanctions.
But beyond issues of feasibility, sanctions would mark a severe invasion of students’ privacy. Granted, there is no legal right to attend Harvard, so few would question the legality of sanctions on final club members. But by the same token, few would question basic liberties on campus, such as privacy within one’s own dorm room. The University doesn’t police which extracurricular organizations students join, nor the political causes they take on because students have the right to organization outside of the College. While we might not join the Porcellian Club graduate board president, who recently resigned in light of his comments about sexual assault, in crying “McCarthyism,” it is a worrying path forward.
We agree with proponents of sanctions who suggest that the final clubs are detrimental to campus life. The March report of the University’s Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention, which pilloried final clubs, emphasized that 47 percent of female seniors "participating in the final clubs" reported “experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college.”
To impose sanctions on club members would be to treat the institutions themselves as the sole roots of sexual assault. It would also partly absolve non-final club members from the effort to combat the issue on campus. In reality, sexual assault is a product of people, not places. And attempting to shut down final clubs through sanctions—without acknowledging that the same social scene could migrate to other forums and without recognizing that a revolution of culture is what’s needed—is to largely sidestep the issue of sexual assault that’s at the heart of the final club debate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Someone once told me the District of Columbia was “full of government graspers and rent-seekers.” Well, maybe a few. But it’s also full of everyday U.S. citizens just like the rest of us, except for one thing: their voting rights.
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s call on Friday for a capital city-wide referendum to make the District the 51st state in the union adds a new chapter to an old story. The arguments for D.C. statehood are tried (or tired) and true—yet in the past few decades, little has changed.
Certainly, little has changed in the three years since I last wrote about D.C. voting rights. My freshman fervor, however, has lapsed into senior cynicism. Back then, the District denizen in me would probably have jumped for joy at the prospect of finally clinching full citizenship. But when I heard about Bowser’s call for change, it just seemed kind of cute. The thing is, statehood simply isn’t going to happen anytime soon.
It’s the right thing to do, of course. The Founding Fathers didn’t envision D.C.’s metropolization, but metropolize it has. District residents represent more than just the in-on-Monday, out-on-Friday (or, more accurately, in-on-Tuesday, out-on-Thursday) congressional cohort. And there are lots of them: To borrow one of those tried and true advocacy arguments, D.C. beats out Wyoming in population. Denying more than 600,000 people congressional representation would be backwards anywhere. It’s even more striking in a country that got its start because people didn’t like being taxed without having a say in who legislated those taxes.
A yes-vote for statehood in November would be a symbol, not a statute: a democratic request for more democracy, but only a request all the same. Bowser hopes to use D.C.’s territorial status to mimic a model Tennessee pioneered in the late 1700s, the Washington Post’s Aaron C. Davis reported Friday. If D.C. residents approve an updated constitution that creates a republican government, a prickly process in itself, Congress could bypass the long and winding road to ratification by the existing states. The choice to decolonize D.C., then, could lie with Congress. November’s vote would be just another way to pressure those politicians.
A lot of decision making power about D.C. lies within Congress. Even now, though D.C. nominally gained home rule in 1973, laws that don’t suit Congress get squashed by budget riders. Bowser and the city council will put a $13 billion local spending plan into effect this year without Congress’s approval and appropriation, but that’s unprecedented—and it augurs a conflict to come.
That, maybe, is what makes Bowser’s boldness worthwhile, whether or not it seems naïve. We’re always told to pick our battles, and never to fight ones we can’t win. Bowser is bound to lose on statehood. But if she doesn’t try—and if D.C. doesn’t try with her—there’s no chance at all, and there’s also less likelihood that D.C. will wrest its budget from congressional control. Indeed, it’s hard to say that D.C. would have even the modicum of self-management it does today without the crusaders who in the seventies fought for statehood and got home rule and a non-voting representative instead.
This is a political lesson, but perhaps it’s a personal one too. Even without the gains that could come by going against the odds, it might not be so bad to stand up for the right thing every now and then, even if we’re going to lose. We might not reap the benefits we’re looking for—but we’ve got rent-seeking for that anyway.

To the editor:
A Crimson article published April 14 sought to establish my links with various right-wing extremists under the lurid headline “Overseers Candidate Donates to ‘Quasi-White Nationalist’ Group.” I feel that the information in the article lacked sufficient context and was thus misleading. Coming at the peak of alumni voting, this reporting risks torpedoing our Free Harvard/Fair Harvard slate of Overseer candidates.
Over the years I’ve certainly provided donations to a wide assortment of political groups and individuals, including left-wingers, right-wingers, and libertarians. These recipients are often on the political fringe and espouse controversial views on all sorts of issues. I might agree with them on some things and disagree with them on others, but their writing usefully supplements the conventional wisdom presented in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which I spend hours closely reading every morning.
I reject guilt by association. Just because I am personally friendly with various people, publish their writings, or even provide them some financial assistance does not necessarily mean that I endorse everything they say. For example, I strongly disagree with Sen. Bernie Sanders on numerous important issues, but since I prefer his overall positions to those of his competitors, he is my favored presidential candidate, and the only one to whom I have donated. During the last couple of presidential elections I wrote in Ron Paul’s name at the top of the ticket, not because I agreed with him about everything, but because the other choices seemed so unsatisfactory.
I have a long record of closely associating with people of sharply different views, having spent seven years as the publisher of The American Conservative, an opinion magazine that absorbed roughly 75 percent of my donations over the last decade. TAC was founded by Pat Buchanan and took a strongly Buchananite stance on immigration, trade, and social issues—positions I did not share. However, I strongly supported its lonely opposition to the disastrous foreign wars of the Bush Administration, afterward continued by the Obama Administration.
Over half my writing has dealt with matters of race, ethnicity, and social policy, including immigration, affirmative action, and bilingual education. Although often controversial, my articles have won praise from some eminent scholars and journalists, situated all across the ideological spectrum. If The Crimson’s writers wish to denounce me, they may do so, but they should focus on my own views rather than those of other people whose work I have funded.

Ron K. Unz ’83 is a candidate for the Board of Overseers as part of the Free Harvard/Fair Harvard ticket.

Charlie M. Storey ’82, president of Harpoon Brewery, announced his resignation as graduate president of the Porcellian Club and further apologized for comments he made last week about sexual assault and all-male final clubs at Harvard.
“I am sad that I have disappointed so many people that I care about,” Storey wrote in a statement posted on Harpoon’s website. “As I think it is best for all involved, I have resigned my position as the graduate president of the Porcellian Club.”
In a “Letter to Employee Owners” Storey apologized again for the statement he sent to The Crimson criticizing the College administration’s scrutiny of final clubs and defending the 225-year-old Porcellian Club. 
Storey’s letter kicked off a wave of national media attention, with many news outlets and public figures criticizing his claim that “forcing single gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease the potential for sexual misconduct.”
Storey’s most recent apology responded directly to criticism he said he received for an initial apology on Wednesday, when he wrote that he “chose [his] words poorly and it came out all wrong.”
“By saying earlier that my words were misinterpreted, I did not take full responsibility for what I said,” Storey wrote in the most recent statement. “I am doing that now. Plain and simple what I said was wrong. No excuses. I want to be clear here that I am apologizing for what I said, not just for who I offended with my words.”
Storey’s statement and subsequent apologies come at a time of unprecedented pressure from College administrators for the historically single-gender final clubs to adopt gender-neutral membership policies. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana previously issued a deadline of April 15 for final club leaders to inform him whether or not they intend to go co-ed. It is unclear what penalties a club may face if it does not go co-ed, though last week, Khurana suggested one possible sanction could be barring undergraduates in all-male final clubs from holding leadership positions and receiving fellowships.

For many visitors, the face of the Harvard Art Museums is not that of a curator or a faculty member, but rather the face of the University’s youngest students.
Since re-opening in November 2014, the Museums have employed undergraduates from various academic disciplines to dig deeper into the the collections and lead heavily-researched tours of the artworks on display. The guide program is a key initiative in engaging College students in the Museums.
The tour Danielle Frostig ’18 led on Sunday morning focused on the theme of “Art in Time, and Time in Art” and included stops at a set of sculptures, a painting by Charles Bird King, a Dutch clock, a textile depicting the Hindu god Krishna, and a piece featured in the special exhibition on Australian aboriginal art.
Because of the Visitas weekend, the eight-person tour group consisted mainly of prospective freshmen. On a typical tour, general members of the public comprise the bulk of tour groups, guides said.
Frostig encouraged individuals to share their opinions and interpretations of the various artworks. At the textile of Krishna, she asked, “What story do you think is being told here? And it’s not an easy, clear answer. I’ve heard everything.”
David Odo, the Museums’ director of student programs, oversees the program and said the Museums created his position in order to better engage students.
Prior to Odo’s arrival at the Museums in 2014, a smaller-scale version of the program was in place from 2008 to 2013, when students could access the collections off-site during the renovations of the facilities on Quincy Street.
“It was a great program, but more limited in scope,” Odo said. “When I was brought on board, I wanted to really expand it and create more opportunities for students, but also to take advantage of our new renovated and expanded spaces.”
There are 24 undergraduates currently involved in the tour program. Throughout the year, Odo said they work with him, conservators, curators, and each other during training sessions as they familiarize themselves with the artwork and conduct research. Roughly one semester of research and practice goes into the making of a tour.
Each tour centers around a theme the student guide chooses. The themes reflect the various academic interests of the guides, ranging from “Politics and Society” to “Problem Solving.”
Admitted student Maria Camasmie went on Frostig’s roughly 45-minute tour and said she appreciated that the tour had a particular topic of focus.
“I personally am someone who likes to explore on my own,” Camasmie said. “[The tour is] interesting because it’s thematic—different from all art tours I’ve taken.”
Student guide Jess A. Clay ’17 said he noticed that the program has shifted since its new launch in 2014 from having all of the tour guides share a theme—“Revolution”—to having each guide pursue their own theme.
“I think we've diversified our themes and content as we've settled in alongside the museum itself,” Clay said. “I think the program has become more eclectic as the guides have forged their own paths.”

Decked out in red Harvard bags and toting maps, brochures, and programs, a record number of prospective freshmen descended on Harvard Yard over the weekend for Visitas.
The College’s weekend for admitted students drew nearly 1,400 prospective students this year, a historic number of attendees according to Timothy J. Smith ’08, a senior admissions officer. The record number of admitted students required organizers to extend by almost a week the deadline for current students to sign up to host prospective freshmen. Smith said he was grateful for students’ help in supporting the future Class of 2020.
“We had more than 1,000 student volunteers help throughout the weekend and into [Monday],” Smith said. “It was an enormous outpouring of community support for us and for the Class of 2020.”
This year’s Visitas featured a talk from University President Drew G. Faust at Memorial Hall, along with several lectures and forums for students. A new addition to the slate of events was “Partytas,” a party exclusively for prospective freshmen held in Annenberg on Saturday night. More than 1,000 people attended, according to Smith. 
“The most exciting thing was Partytas; that was pretty fun,” Nenya A. Edjah, a prospective student, said. “It was somewhat lit but not as lit as it could be.”
Another new event was a street fair the Harvard Square Business Association hosted  that featured booths from local restaurants and shops.
One of the more favorable events of the weekend was “Visitas Thinks Big,”  some admitted students said, in which five Harvard faculty members discussed a range of world issues.
Ryan Lee, another potential student, said he was particularly impressed by S. Allen Counter, a professor of Neurology and director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Interracial Affairs.
“Some of the stories the panelists talked about were so incredible,” Lee said.  “This entire event has been great.
Students described the Visitas weekend schedule as a little overwhelming at times.
“There’s so much going on,” Lee said. “I’ve really not had a peaceful moment since [arriving]. It’s a mixture of all the events and meeting with all my friends who go to school here.”
Brandon V. Duffy, another prospective student, echoed Lee and said he looked forward to attending classes Monday and seeing Harvard’s academic environment.
“We’re having a good time, but it’s probably not really representative of life here [at Harvard], since we’re not taking classes,” Duffy said. “But we get to sit in on classes… I guess it’ll show us more what everyday life at Harvard will be like.”

Greenhouse Cafe, managed by Harvard University Dining Services, is set to close after this year’s commencement exercises as the University begins its planned revitalization of the Science Center atrium and Cabot Library.
It is not yet clear whether the cafe, a central eatery within the Science Center, will reopen after the renovations are completed, nor whether an alternative dining option will be available during the construction. In the interim, cafe staff have been given the opportunity to secure alternative employment.
Still, HUDS workers have expressed concern that the renovations will result in a reduction in their overall work force. HUDS employee Laquiesha N. Rainey said workers have received mixed signals from the University about whether the cafe will return post renovations.
According to University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga, cafe staff have known of the closure since October.
“Cafe staff were informed of the renovation plans in October, so they would have the opportunity to apply for open positions in other locations across the University during the intervening seven months,” DeLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement. “Staff still employed at the café will be invited to apply for currently open positions at other locations, including 11 new positions being created to staff swing housing.”
The impending closure of the cafe follows a maelstrom of shop closures around Harvard because of renovations to the Smith Campus Center, most notably that of several Square linchpins such as Au Bon Pain, and b.good. As dining options outside of HUDS continue to narrow, some students have expressed disapproval of renovations.
The Student Labor Action Movement is currently gathering signatures for a petition to demonstrate student opposition to the decision to close Greenhouse cafe, Samuel R. Heller ’18, a member of the group, said. SLAM has also met with met with workers at the cafe to help them with the transition to other campus locations. Still, Rainey said that the possibility remains that some workers may not be able to find another position on campus.
Labor relations between the University and its dining services employees have grown tense in recent months. Last week, over 200 Harvard affiliates from across the University's many schools rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall in support of the workers who are entering negotiations with Harvard this June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American film producer and director Irwin Winkler spoke Friday in front of aspiring filmmakers, fans, and curious students about rising above political and social adversity in filmmaking.
Known for tackling controversial topics such as cyber-crime and the Iraq War, Winkler was invited by the Institute of Politics for a public forum titled “The Politics of Film: Between Imagination and Industry.” The forum was co-sponsored by the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership and moderated by Brandon M. Terry, assistant professor of African and African American Studies and Social Studies .
Winkler, whose films include “Raging Bull,” “Rocky,” and “The Wolf of Wall Street,” spoke to attendees about the planning and politics behind filmmaking.
When asked about the obstacles in making casts more diverse and developing storylines centered around racial and ethnic minorities, Winkler emphasized the importance of innovation in transcending seemingly restrictive norms.
“I think the issue of diversity goes beyond Hollywood. [We could start] right here in Harvard,” Winkler said during the talk. “It comes down to creativity and ideas, and how you come up with interesting ideas that are commercially interesting.”
According to Winkler, filmmakers face not only broader social pressures, but “roadblocks” from the industry as well.
The award-winning “Rocky” film series, produced in part by Winkler, started off with much opposition, he said. With a then-unknown actor Sylvester G. Stallone and a novice scriptwriter, Winkler said he made it his goal to “prove that we could do it.”
“‘Rocky’ was about being stubborn and not taking no for an answer,” Winkler said. “The more roadblocks that came in our way, the more resilient we became. We also became stubborn and ambitious [like Rocky].”
Attendees, a mix of undergraduates and self-described amateur filmmakers, were able to ask questions on filmmaking and the film industry in general.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council discussed the possibility of introducing a mobile application that would allow students to more easily report incidents of sexual assault on campus.
During Sunday’s general meeting, Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 introduced Callisto, an app that allows students to electronically and anonymously report instances of sexual assault. If more than one student reports the same perpetrator, then the information is automatically submitted to the university’s Title IX coordinator. 
Pomona College and the University of San Francisco were among the first schools to test the program. More recently, delegates at last week’s Ivy Policy Conference at the University of Pennsylvania discussed the app and policy solutions to campus issues including sexual assault.
Greenlaw suggested that the app may encourage more students to report sexual assaults.
“For a traumatic event, I likely won’t want to talk to a person, especially if it’s embarrassing or I feel like I wouldn’t be believed,” Greenlaw said. “The anonymity lowers the bar to report.”
Undergraduates can currently seek confidential counseling for sexual assault at the University’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Counseling and Mental Health Services, and Response Peer Counseling.
While several representatives voiced support for the app, some questioned its effectiveness. Crimson Yard representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19 suggested that the UC should prioritize sexual assault prevention over another response system.
“There are already phone hotlines,” Whittaker said. “Is focusing on the app… the best way to focus our efforts?”
Greenlaw said he hoped the UC’s Digital Commission, established earlier this semester to work on technology-related Council initiatives, could work to integrate Callisto’s functionality into Omni, an app that provides contact information for various campus resources, including Harvard University Police Department and OSAPR.
“This enables us to crack down on these repeat offenders,” Greenlaw said.
During the meeting, Greenlaw also announced that the Finance Committee will move away from the Common Grant Application, the system by which student organizations currently request funding from the UC. Greenlaw said the current application makes it more difficult for the UC to enforce policies including this semester’s sexual assault prevention training requirement. The UC will likely create Council-specific online form, Greenlaw said.
The Council also voted to allocate $22,333 in grants to student organizations, and voted to designate April 29 as the “2nd Annual HUPD/Securitas Appreciation Day.” As part of the initiative, the UC allocated $200 to fund supplies for food and thank you cards for HUPD and Securitas staff.
Updating the Council, Freshman Class Committee Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said his committee attempted to fund a second berry brain break, but that a recent increase in the price of berries made the proposal “infeasible.”
The Student Initiatives Committee’s “Project H,” a $2,500 program designed to help students plan “open, inclusive social initiatives,” will hold its open party on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several final club leaders submitted largely non-committal responses to administrators  Friday on whether they plan to adopt gender-neutral membership policies, citing a lack of clear answers to questions they had posed.
In late March, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana requested at a meeting with undergraduate leaders of Harvard’s unaffiliated single-gender social clubs that they inform him by April 15 whether or not they planned to go co-ed. The deadline carried no clear consequences for non-compliance.
Of the groups that met with Khurana at two meetings over the past month, representatives from five said that their organization had not given Khurana a definitive answer on whether they would change their membership policies. All five said they had not heard of any other single-gender club informing Khurana of such a policy change. 
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the record on whether any clubs had announced an intention to go gender neutral. Over the past year, Khurana has consistently declined to comment specifically on his discussions with final clubs, citing their confidential nature.
Multiple clubs, among them the all-male Fly Club, told Khurana that they needed more information from the administration in order to make a decision. Fly graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 informed Khurana of the Fly's stance by way of a letter, a copy of which he sent to The Crimson.
“I had hoped that our written request to you for specific information we consider essential to a proper decision would have given the Fly the opportunity to discuss the matter at hand in more depth before April 15th,” wrote Porteus, referencing a list of four yes-or-no questions he sent to Khurana in advance of another meeting last week between College administrators and final club leaders.
In that list, Porteus had asked if Khurana would recommend banning undergraduate membership in final clubs, whether such a ban would apply to female clubs and Greek organizations, and whether Khurana would “recommend expulsion” for undergraduates who might violate a potential final club ban. According to Porteus and others present at the meeting, Khurana gave no clear answers to these questions.
“Having received no response from you, it is the opinion of our executive committee that the current university administration has given us insufficient information to discuss the issue you raise with the degree of care such a decision requires,” Porteus continued in his letter.
The deadline from Khurana came near the end of a tumultuous academic year for Harvard’s final clubs, which for decades had enjoyed virtually unfettered independence from the College. Since he began his tenure in 2014, Khurana has made the clubs a focus of his deanship, publicly criticizing them and exhorting them to reconsider their single-gender policies. In the fall, the traditionally all-male Spee and Fox clubs accepted women into their ranks, with Fox club undergraduates writing that “Harvard has forced our hand,” in a letter explaining their decision.
This semester, the clubs were the subject of intense criticism from a University-wide task force report that cited both their perceived exclusivity and survey figures indicating a high prevalence of “non-consensual sexual contact” as evidence of “a culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission.”
Recently, though, certain clubs have publicly fired back at administrators. Charlie M. Storey ’82, at the time the Porcellian Club’s graduate board president, said his club was being “being used as a scapegoat for the sexual assault problem at Harvard despite its policies to help avoid the potential for sexual assault.” Storey has since apologized for his comments and resigned from his role as graduate board president.
After the meeting last week, in which Khurana suggested that final club members could be banned from holding leadership positions in recognized organizations and winning fellowships, Porteus called Khurana’s proposed sanction a “change from liberal education to illiberal education” in an interview with the Washington Post.
Khurana will present University President Drew G. Faust with a plan to address Harvard’s sexual assault prevention report by the end of the academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across the College, 400 students have signed up to play Assassins—a live action game in which players receive human targets and attempt to eliminate them—with a particular focus on malaria prevention and awareness.
The game is sponsored by Malaria Assassins, a group of members of the Global Health Forum who won the 2015 Harvard Malaria Challenge. Sponsored by the Harvard University Defeating Malaria Initiative and Malaria No More, the contest challenged participants to increase awareness of malaria prevention and offered the winners $10,000 to implement a project to engage students in malaria education and eradication.
Harvard’s malaria-based iteration of the Assassins game has spread to other university campuses nationwide. Malaria Assassins has teamed up with students to bring the game to Stanford, Northeastern, and Duke. The game calls itself “the largest nationwide campus game of assassins,” according to the event’s Facebook page.
Bianca Mulaney ’16, an organizer of Malaria Assassins, said that the team of students decided to apply to the competition after discovering the extent to which malaria is a problem globally. Through this game, Mulaney hopes that more students gain an awareness of malaria.
“Malaria Assassins is a starting point for many different avenues of participation and engagement with combating malaria,” Mulaney said.
Students in upperclassmen Houses including Adams, Leverett, Lowell, Eliot, and Winthrop have already begun playing, with 146 participants still “alive” in the game. The freshmen yards will commence play in the coming days, according to event organizer William S. Xiao ’16.
Xiao, who has previously arranged other assassin games in Eliot House, said Malaria Assassins seeks to use an already popular student game as a form of malaria activism, especially because student organizations across the country also play the game.
According to Laura L. Doherty ’19, a participant in the event, the website design seems structured to aid student learning about the disease.
“The setup of the website itself is great because it forces students to be aware by making users answer factual questions about the disease in order to receive their next target,” she said.
Doherty, who found out about the game through the Winthrop mailing list, said she chose to participate to “immerse [her]self in the House community,” adding that she also learned about malaria through the process.
“I think the most important thing I learned about malaria has to do with just how many people the disease impacts,” she said. “When a lot of people think about terrible diseases or illnesses, malaria isn’t necessarily the thing that crosses their minds.”
Students have been appreciative of the event’s intentions overall, and have enjoyed the interactive qualities of the game.
“The most fun aspect is simply being able to build the House community and meet new people in a way that's designed to support such an important cause,” Doherty said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time this season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team came within one point of completing a comeback against a nationally-ranked opponent. Three weeks after the Crimson saw its last-second, game-tying goal against then-No. 10/11 Princeton disallowed, Harvard fell just short again against No. 15/17 Penn, despite mounting a furious comeback bid in the closing minutes of the game.
The Crimson (7-4, 3-2 Ivy) trailed for nearly three-quarters of the contest and could not overcome the deficit, falling, 8-7, to the Quakers (9-3, 3-1) in Philadelphia this Saturday.
“[This result] should just build our confidence,” sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn said. “We can hold our own against any team. We need to keep improving so we can win against these kind of teams, though. “
The matchup proved to be a battle of the defenses, and Penn’s back line came out ahead, limiting Harvard to just seven scores on Saturday, the Crimson’s third-lowest total this year. Leading the Quakers defensive unit was junior goalie Britt Brown, who totaled seven saves on the day to shut down the Harvard attack.
On the other side of the field, the Crimson defense faced a formidable opponent in Penn senior attacker Nina Corcoran, who is currently ranked first in the nation for assists per game and eighth for goals per game. However, the Harvard defensive unit stepped up to the challenge and limited Corcoran to two assists and no goals on the day.
With its star attacker effectively out of action, Penn looked to its younger players, especially sophomore attacker Alex Condon, who found the back of the net three times in the second half to secure the win for the Quakers.
“We tried to limit their top attackers, and we were successful, but the rest of their offensive unit was able to step up and score some goals” co-captain goalie Kelly Weis said.
Nonetheless, Harvard demonstrated why its scoring defense is currently ranked 15th in the country with a solid back line performance, allowing Penn to convert on just eight of its 20 shots. Weis led the effort, racking up eight stops.
With both defenses firing on all cylinders, the contest got off to a slow start. Neither team managed a goal until 20:01 in the first half, when Penn broke the deadlock off of a free position shot. It would take less than a minute for the Crimson to respond, as senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia brought Harvard back on level terms. Junior attacker Marisa Romeo then gave the Crimson its only lead of the game halfway through the first period as she collected her 22nd goal of the season in a man-up situation.
Behind by one, the Quakers offense came to life. Penn scored four unanswered points in four minutes to erase the Harvard advantage and put the Quakers ahead, 5-2.
The Crimson defense rebounded, and would manage to keep Penn off of the scoreboard for the remainder of the first half. Harvard even began to claw its way back into the game, with freshman midfielder Ali Thaler and Romeo each finding the back of the net once before halftime to send the Crimson into the break down by one goal, 5-4.
The second half proved to be a battle between Penn’s Condon and Harvard, with the Quakers sophomore providing all three of her team’s points in the second stanza.
Condon found the back of the net shortly after the restart, before Crimson co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd pulled the margin back to one goal. The situation then repeated itself, with Condon converting, only for Nicolia to match the feat. The Penn attacker ended her team’s scoring at 6:00 in the second period to put the Quakers ahead by two, 8-6.
Harvard refused to surrender, and Romeo completed her hat trick with a free position goal with just 33 seconds remaining in the contest. The clock ran out on the Crimson’s comeback bid, however, as the Quakers handed Harvard its second conference loss of the season.
“We had our ups and downs today, but as a team we never gave up,” Glynn said.

Stuck in a tie for fourth at the start of the weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team faced all kinds of playoff scenarios as it angled to outcompete a crowded EIVA field and make the final four-team tournament.
In the end, all the different what-ifs reduced to a simple dichotomy: Win two matches, or leave empty-handed.
At home, playing in front of a crowd of students, alumni, and parents, the Crimson (13-10, 9-5 EIVA) did not leave empty-handed. With victories over Princeton and NJIT, Harvard secured third place in the conference and clinched a playoff spot.
HARVARD 3, NJIT 1
Late in the fourth set last Saturday, sophomore setter Marko Kostich strode to the back of the court, the ball in his hands.
Above him glared a neon red scoreboard: 19-19. As he spun the ball, breathed, and hurtled to the line, the hush of the crowd signaled the gravity of the moment.
Only six points separated the Crimson from a doomsday, all-bets-are-off tiebreaker. For a team that had gone up 2-0 and needed a victory to extend its season, a fifth set was not an attractive possibility.
Kostich’s first jump serve landed in the court. So did his second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth.
“Coach’s philosophy is that you have to get the first serve in,” Kostich said. “I was pretty nervous the first serve, but the other ones felt more natural.”
With each point victory, the Malkin Athletic Center grew louder. The bleachers rumbled when a kill by captain Branden Clemens pushed the score to 23-19 and threatened to collapse when Kostich recorded an ace on the next point.
Then, at 24-19, with all players and spectators on their feet, a finish by junior outside hitter Casey White sent the place berserk—and Harvard to the playoffs.
“I felt really comfortable with [Marko] at the service line,” Clemens said. “I felt that everything was going to work out.”
Heading into the final set, the Crimson needed to regroup after a mistake-marred third frame. Poor passing and late service errors by Kostich and White had dogged Harvard, resulting in a 25-20 defeat.
The fourth frame started no better, as the Highlanders (8-18, 7-7) shot to a 10-6 lead. But Clemens sparked a comeback, recording three straight kills as part of a 5-0 streak to regain the lead.
On the afternoon, Clemens topped all scorers with 18 kills, and White added 11. Meanwhile Harvard held Jabarry Goodridge, the most lethal player in the EIVA, to nine kills and a .031 hitting percentage—his lowest totals of the season.
Much of the credit went to a defense that recorded 11.5 blocks, including two in the final seven points.
This defense helped the Crimson sail through the opening games. Harvard never trailed in the first two sets, which the team won by scores of 25-19 and 25-17.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
Ruckus broke out midway through the second set this Friday when Kostich and sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch rose for a block to stretch the Crimson’s lead to 16-9.
That rejection capped a remarkable 9-0 run on the strength of Clemens’ serve. Two times Princeton had called a timeout to stem the damage—and two times Harvard had responding by winning the next point.
Against the Tigers, not even stoppages of play could derail the playoff-bound Crimson. Harvard outhit Princeton (4-18, 4-10) by .323, and the hosts sped through a clean sweep.
“We played with energy,” Kostich said. “More specifically we stayed level.”
On senior night, two old hands proved especially effective, as Clemens and Schlossman combined for 19 kills on 28 attacks. The defense added 10 blocks.
Everything came together during the third frame, which the Crimson led wire-to-wire. In the 25-18 set, Harvard sported a .474 kill rate while limiting the Tigers to a .069 mark—the widest margin of the match.
The first set was less lopsided—at least for the first eight points. Then a Kostich service run created separation, and the Crimson ran away with a 25-17 victory.
Similar dynamics prevailed in the second frame, although in this case it was Clemens rather than Kostich leading the service charge. After the nine-point outburst, Harvard dug in to claim the 25-18 win.
“We came out with a sense of urgency, especially after talking as a team in the locker room,” Kostich said. “We really emphasized, ‘This game is for the seniors and for all the family that came out.’ It meant more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring has finally sprung for Harvard and Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight teams, which, for the first time of the spring season, were able to row in good weather over the weekend.
Men’s Heavyweight
The No. 5 Harvard men’s heavyweight team was in action at its spring season debut on the Charles. The Crimson faced off against MIT and No. 3 Princeton for the Compton Cup. The Crimson split this weekend, falling to the Tigers but downing the Engineers.
Princeton, which had won the cup last year, had a quick start and had a half-boat length lead after the first 250 meters of the race. By the halfway mark by the bridge, the Tigers held an open water lead, and it seemed that crew would go on to coast to a win.
Harvard’s V8 boat was not to be counted out, though. The crew redoubled its efforts to come within four seats of Princeton, but did not have enough time to overtake the Tigers and finished 1.7 seconds behind at 5:43.4.
While it is Princeton’s second consecutive year taking home the Compton Cup, Harvard still leads the all-time series with 62 wins, including 11 of the last 14 seasons.
The second varsity boat was the only one with a first place finish on the day. In this race, though, it was Harvard that jumped out to an early start, though its lead was smaller. Halfway through the race, the Crimson began to pull away, but the Tigers were always hot on its heels. With 750 left in the race, Princeton made a move to overtake the Harvard boat, but its Ivy rivals managed to hold onto its lead. Harvard went on to stop the clock at 5:44.7, Princeton at 5:47.9, and MIT at 6:24.3.
In the 4V race, though the Crimson had an early lead, the Tigers overtook it in the second half of the course to win by two seconds. Princeton also won the 3V race by nine seconds.
Men’s Lightweight
The No. 5 Harvard men’s lightweight team continued its win streak against No. 9 Dartmouth and No. 12 MIT over the weekend. The Crimson beat out its Ivy League and cross-town rivals to take the Biglin Bowl.
Harvard swept both opponents on the Connecticut River in Hanover, N.H. The varsity eight boat, coxed by junior Charlie Zhang and stroked by sophomore Andre Dupuis, had another close finish. Last year, the crew finished just ahead of MIT, and this year, it narrowly beat out Dartmouth by 1.7 seconds.
“I thought our boat had a good race - it felt like we were in control from the very first stroke. Dartmouth stuck with us and kept pushing us,” co-captain Ian Klein said. “I think we could have done a better job of stopping their momentum earlier, but they proved to be a pretty resilient crew.”
It was a tight race between the Crimson and the Big Green throughout the entire course, with the Crimson finishing at 5:38.3 and the Big Green at 5:40.0. MIT rounded out the race with a time of 5:49.1. With this win, Harvard marks its eighth straight year bringing home the Bowl, and 53rd time overall.
The second varsity boat took advantage of the light tail wind and current to beat out Dartmouth by open water. The squad finished at 5:41.9, with Dartmouth coming in 13 seconds later, and MIT 7 seconds after it.
Both third and fourth varsity crews bested the Big Green by open water in the 3V race, while the fifth varsity four A and B boats also finished by open water ahead of the Engineers.
“It seems like the league this year is very fast, and it's definitely clear that we have some work to do in the next couple of weeks leading up to HYPs and the Eastern Sprints to unlock some speed” Klein said. “We have all the pieces, just need to put it all together.”
Women’s Heavyweights
The No. 17 heavyweight team had a full weekend, with the first and second varsity teams making an appearance in Clemson, S.C. for the Clemson Invitational, while the third and fourth varsity boats stayed behind to compete against four other Boston teams.
“The Clemson Invitational is an important race for us because we get to race so many teams that we otherwise don't see except at NCAAs, so doing well there can be crucial so the people who select which teams go to the national championships can see how we compare to them,” junior Abigail Parker said. “Therefore, we really try to do our best at Clemson. We're always trying to get faster.”
After second and third places in qualifying races against ranked teams earned the first varsity boat a place in the finals, the Black and White found itself again in close competition with the likes of No. 4 Ohio State, No. 14 Washington State, and San Diego.
While Ohio State had pulled away to nab the top spot by seven seconds at 6:34.7, the second place was left up for grabs by Washington State, Radcliffe, and San Diego. By the end of the race, Radcliffe had been outpaced by the Cougars by four seconds with a time of 6:41.8, but had themselves outpaced the Toreros by that same amount to take third place with a time of 6:45.1.
The second varsity boat, after qualifying for the final race, finished fourth in the final race. Like the V8 squad, the 2V boat competed for third place with Louisville and San Diego. The Black and White was just edged out by Louisville by one second and took fourth with 7:01.7. Ohio State also took this race with 6:44.8, and Washington State followed again, stopping the clock at 6:53.0.
The V4 boat finished second twice on Sunday, first with a time of 7:47.7 and then later on with a time of 7:20.4.
Back in Cambridge, the 3V A and B boats took first and second in their race against Dartmouth, Northeastern, BU, and UMass, with times of 6:57.6 and 7:06.4, respectively.
Women’s Lightweights
Also in Cambridge was the No. 4 lightweight crew, which competed in the fifth annual Lightweight Invitational against BU, MIT, Stanford, and Wisconsin.
In the petite finals, both the first and second varsity boats won against MIT. The first varsity won by seven seconds, crossing the finish line at 6:42.2, and the second varsity won by open water, finishing at 6:54.7.
By the end of the first day, Radcliffe was solidly in second place. Facing choppy waters, the V8 boat finished at 6:46.0, nine seconds behind first-place finisher Stanford, which stopped the clock at 6:37.8. The second varsity boat won over MIT by open water.
“I think all three of our boats racing at Clemson had some good and some bad in their races this weekend,” Parker said. “We all faced tough competition and got a chance to fight it out in close races, which is great experience. Our four especially had a really great weekend and beat a lot of teams that we weren't able to catch in our first two eights, which was awesome to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having completed the team racing portion of the season a week prior, the Harvard sailing team kicked off its fleet racing schedule with top-ten finishes in each of the four events it competed in over the weekend, highlighted by a third place result in the Thompson Trophy.
THOMPSON TROPHY
With northeastern winds fluctuating between eight and 28 knots throughout the weekend on the Thames River in New London, Conn., weather conditions were highly variable to say the least, but this variance did not seem to affect the Crimson as much as its competitors.
In the Coast Guard Academy hosted event, Harvard was able to cap off its best performance of the young fleet’s racing season.  With its most experienced racers competing in the tri-divisional regatta of Z420s, the Crimson accrued 358 points in its third place finish.
Besides the B-Division crew of senior skipper Marek Zaleski and senior crew Sydney Karnovsky finishing in the top four in four of its first five competitions, the results any one individual race varied widely as the crews finished anywhere from first to seventeenth with relatively equal likelihoods in all three divisions.  By the end of the weekend, the A, B, and C-Divisions had amassed 142, 94, and 124 points, respectively.
Rival Yale won the competition with 294 points.  Second place Roger Williams was the only other squad to best Harvard on the weekend.
PRESIDENT’S TROPHY
Racing on the Charles River Basin in a bi-divisional inter-conference event hosted by Boston University, the Crimson finished tenth in a field of 17.  High winds ruled the day on both Saturday and Sunday, as breezes in the low-to-mid teens and gusts reaching the low-twenties led to quite a few downwind capsizes.
With fellow sophomores, skipper Taylor Ladd and crew Kirstin Anderson, at the helm of the FJs in the A-Division and freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and sophomore crew Ariana Gross in the B-Division, the group totaled 161 points over the weekend.  While Ladd and Anderson placed in thirteenth among the A-Division crews with their 95-point performance, Gavula and Gross finished fifth in their division after accruing 66 points.
“The women’s team started out well, struggled a bit towards the end of the regatta, but finished in a decent place overall,” freshman skipper Nicholas Karnovsky said.
Even though Gavula and Gross retired after finishing their first race of the weekend, they bounced back quite well, as their result signifies.  After their misstep, they won the very next event, and placed among the top five finishers in the next six afterwards. This form could not be sustained until the very end of competition; however, as they finished 15th and 11th in their final two races, respectively.
MOSBACHER, OWEN, KNAPP TROPHIES
On Cayuga Lake at the Merrill Family Sailing Center in Ithaca, N.Y., Harvard also placed tenth in a bi-divisional Cornell hosted race that fielded sixteen competitors.  The Crimson posted 216 points over the weekend with 124 of those points coming from the A-Division compared to the 92 from the B-Division crew.
After very little wind prevailed earlier in the morning on both Saturday and Sunday, most of the racing was postponed to afternoon sessions. But once midday hit, the conditions fared much better as consistent gusts in the mid-teens became the norm.
Hobart and William Smith Colleges won the weekend their 100-point performance, while Fordham and Yale rounded out the top three finishers by accumulating 131 and 148 points, respectively. Fellow Ivy League competitors Princeton and Columbia both placed in the bottom three, while the two teams brought to the event by Dartmouth tied in seventh with identical 206 point marks.
OBERG TROPHY
The youngest contingent of Harvard sailors stayed in the Boston area this weekend, competing against fifteen other in-conference schools. A sixth place finish in the tri-divisional regatta resultantly followed in extremely variable conditions, as the team totaled 293 points over the weekend’s 42 aggregate events.
“Saturday, it was incredibly windy; it was pretty consistently above 20 knots,” Karnovksy said. “But on Sunday [the wind] was very light, between five and ten knots all day, and sometimes even lighter than that.  So they were two very different days of sailing. The first day was very fast and tricky, the second day was slower and much more tactical.”
The B-Division led the way for the Crimson.  Freshmen Karnovsky and Alejandra Resendiz placed second among their division by posting 70 points, the lowest point total of the group and just one above the first place finisher in their fleet.
“[Finishing in second by one point] was a little bit frustrating, but we were happy with the performance,” Karnovsky said. “There were a couple of mistakes that probably cost us the win, but we were happy with the experience that we got. There was no way that we could have won it easily.”
In the other fleets, the A and C-Division crews finished with 128 and 95 points, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year away from Cambridge in Los Angeles, former Harvard women’s basketball standout Temi Fagbenle was drafted 35th overall in the WNBA draft to the Minnesota Lynx. Fagbenle transferred to the University of Southern California to pursue a graduate degree after playing three years for Harvard. She is the second Harvard player ever to be selected in the WNBA draft.
During her time in Cambridge, Fagbenle was voted rookie of the year and was a three-time All-Ivy selection. In her senior year she paced the Crimson squad with 14.4 points and 10.4 rebounds a game and set a single game school record of 24 rebounds against Temple. She was also the highest ranked women’s basketball player to play for an Ivy League team and as a sophomore she represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London where she was youngest player on the team. Despite only suiting up three years, she is one of 19 players to score over 1,000 points for the Crimson.
At USC, Fagbenle lead a Trojan squad to a 12-0 start as she led the team in scoring and rebounding with 13.6 points and 8.7 rebounds a game. She also led USC in blocks, steals, and minutes per game. She was one of seven PAC-12 players to be drafted on Thursday night and the only one from USC. The Trojans finished 8th overall in the PAC-12 and made it to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering this past Saturday, the members of the senior class of Harvard men’s lacrosse had beaten every team in the Ivy over the course of their careers except Penn. A trip to Philadelphia to face the Quakers presented one final chance to do so, and with the Crimson coming off a big road win against Cornell a week earlier, a victory over Penn seemed within its grasp.
Franklin Field has historically not been kind to Harvard, as the team has not earned a victory over the Quakers there since 2006. However, when Crimson senior attackman Devin Dwyer found the back of the net with 1:12 remaining in the fourth quarter, the score was tied at 13 and the game was there for either team’s taking.
Penn won the ensuing faceoff, and after a composed possession in which almost everyone on offense touched the ball, sophomore attackman Reilly Hupfeldt capitalized on an opening on the right side of the field to fire a shot home. The goal came with just 0:15 remaining, leaving Harvard no time to respond.
“We broke down systematically on the last play,” Crimson captain and defender Stephen Jahelka said. “They got a good matchup in their favor and we didn't support well enough off the ball.”
Hupfeldt’s strike proved to be the difference in the contest, as the Quakers (6-5, 3-2 Ivy) sent their fans home happy with the 14-13 victory over Harvard. The win ensured that the team will qualify for the four-team conference tournament following the regular season, as they hold tiebreakers over Cornell and Princeton by virtue of head-to-head results against them. The Crimson (6-6, 2-2 Ivy), meanwhile, slip down to fourth in the Ivy standings, only a game ahead of the Big Red and the Tigers.
While Harvard and Penn went back and forth throughout the game, a three-minute stretch in the first quarter during which the Quakers scored four times gave them an upper hand for the rest of the afternoon. Three of the goals were unassisted as the Crimson simply had trouble stopping Penn players from penetrating.
“Our lack of energy at the beginning of the game really cost us,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “It’s hard to play with a deficit, and doing that for almost the entire first half made it difficult to maintain pressure towards the end of the game.”
The Crimson did have the energy for a big run at the beginning of the second half, however. After entering halftime down 6-4, it ripped off five straight goals in the first ten minutes of the third quarter to take a 9-6 lead. Sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek led the way with two goals and an assist during the sequence.
Not rattled, Quakers countered with an even bigger rally. They found the net six times in nine minutes spanning the end of the third period and beginning of the fourth, flipping the score and taking the lead themselves. Five different players contributed goals, with Hupfeldt tallying two more on his way to finishing with four goals in total.
“It was a game of big momentum swings, and you never want to get into those on the road,” Wojcik said. “We needed to do a better job of maintaining possession and getting smarter shots when Penn was getting on a roll.”
The Quakers remained in control for the rest of the fourth quarter, and ended up outshooting Harvard 16-5. In a few minutes of efficiency on offense, however, the Crimson scored three times on three shots to tie the score and set up the frantic finish.
With the game knotted up at 12-12 at that point, Penn sophomore defender Connor Keating and Dwyer traded goals. Dwyer finished with four for the afternoon just like Hupfeldt, who scored the game-winner.
“Penn is a great team that finds a way to make winning plays at crucial times,” Jahleka said. “We are looking forward to getting back to work this week, and hopefully we’ll earn another chance to see Penn in the Ivy League tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The regular season is over. The field has been set for the CWPA Championships.
The seeding for the tournament, to be hosted by the Harvard women’s water polo team at Blodgett Pool from April 29 to May 1, was determined by conference play over the last couple of weeks.
The No. 18 Crimson (22-8, 3-4 CWPA) solidified itself as the number five seed in the field of eight schools after going 2-1 this weekend to close out its CWPA slate. Harvard traveled to Princeton, NJ, where it defeated No. 21 Hartwick (15-12, 3-4) on yet another fourth-quarter comeback and rolled past George Washington (7-16, 0-7) for its first win by double-digits since March 17. However, the Crimson fell to Bucknell (16-14, 4-3) by one goal to become the Bison’s first ranked victim all year.
Harvard thus finished with a losing record in conference play at 3-4, but still walked out of DeNunzio Pool having set a couple of school records. The Crimson’s 21st win set the mark for most wins in a single season, surpassing three other 20-win seasons, while sophomore goalie Cleo Harrington broke the school record for most saves in a season by recording 25 saves on the weekend and upping her season total to 253.
Michigan, Indiana, Bucknell, and Princeton claimed the 1-4 seeds, respectively, while Hartwick, Brown, and George Washington rounded out the conference tournament seeding.
HARVARD 18, GEORGE WASHINGTON 4
Harvard had its way from the start, opening up a 6-2 first-period lead and shutting the Colonials out in the next frame en route to an 18-4 victory over last-ranked George Washington.. Freshman attacker Kristen Hong and senior attacker Yoshi Andersen led the Crimson with four goals apiece, while Harrington made seven stops in net before being replaced by freshman goalie Sam Acker.
“We knew what we had to do,” junior attacker Melissa Balding said. “We knew we needed to secure a win, and we wanted to prove that we were the better team early on in the game, so we came out with a lot of energy.”
Hong’s four-goal performance constituted her ninth game of the season with four or more goals. Both Balding and senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix added hat-tricks; Balding has caught fire recently, scoring nine goals on the weekend and recording 22 over the team’s last ten games.
Meanwhile, Harrington’s 247th stop moved her into the school record book for most saves in a single season, past Ariel Dukes ’15, who held the previous mark.
“Cleo’s just an unbelievably talented goalie and she works so hard all the time,” Andersen said. “She’s just been a huge part of our team’s success this year—I think she’s definitely the best goalie on the East Coast.”
BUCKNELL 7, HARVARD 6
A lack of execution haunted Harvard in an otherwise tight game against Bucknell (16-14, 4-3). The Crimson entered the fourth quarter in a 5-5 deadlock with the Bison, but was outscored 2-1 in the final quarter and stripped on the final possession en route to losing, 7-6.
“We had a lot of opportunities,” Balding said. “We just didn’t capitalize on our opportunities and that’s what cost us that game.”
Balding and Martinelli led Harvard with a pair of goals apiece, while Osborne and Hendrix rounded out the scoring for the Crimson.
After going down 4-1 to Bucknell early, Harvard scored four unanswered to take a 5-4 lead in the third quarter. The Crimson, however, could not maintain that lead, as the Bison reeled off three straight in the third and fourth quarters to take a decisive 7-5 lead.
Sophomore attacker Colleen Barron and senior attacker Eleanor Marrs led Bucknell with a pair of goals apiece. Marrs has now scored 60 goals and dished out 53 assists on the season.
HARVARD 12, No. 21 HARTWICK 11
Another game, another comeback.
Sitting at 1-3 in conference play, and facing an 11-8 deficit with 3:52 remaining in the game, Harvard mounted a three-goal rally in just over two minutes to knot the game against Hartwick (15-12, 3-4) at 11. Andersen then came up with the winning goal with 1:27 to go to give the Crimson a 12-11 victory and 2-0 season sweep of the Hawks.
“[I] just kind of read the goalie and saw that she wasn’t fully paying attention to me,” Andersen said. “So I decided to flip it into the cage and it went in.”
Martinelli and Balding netted four goals apiece to lead Harvard, and Andersen also added a pair to overcome three different Hartwick players scoring hat-tricks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the No. 48 Harvard men’s tennis team (16-10, 4-2 Ivy) extended its winning streak to four, hosting Yale (12-12, 0-6) on Friday and traveling to Brown (8-18, 0-6) on Sunday. With its 4-2 in-conference record, the Crimson ranks fourth in the Ivy League.
“It feels great to get these four wins in a row under our belt,” co-Captain Nicky Hu said. “The team really deserves it and I'm happy they were able to perform up to their capabilities over the past couple of weeks. We are still at the mercy of the rankings but if things go our way... we should have a small chance to make it into NCAAs this year.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
The Bears took an early lead with a win at first doubles, but Harvard came back to even the score with a 6-0 win at second doubles from co-Captain Nicky Hu and senior Kelvin Lam. For the deciding point, co-captain Conor Haughey and freshman Andy Zhou eked out their opponents in a tiebreaker to give the Crimson the doubles victory.
“Honestly the aura around this team right now is electric. People are more motivated than ever and finally playing up to their talents,” Hu said.
On the singles side, since Brown only had four indoor courts available, the players at fourth and fifth singles had to wait until other matches had finished to start. As a result, the team had to adjust to extra wait-time and interrupted momentum.
“I think it took some time for people to adjust to the courts, but a lot of our guys did really well to cope with this environment,” Zhou said.
Harvard and Brown split the top four spots, with the Bears claiming victories at first and second singles while sophomore Kenny Tao and Lam earned points for the Crimson at third and fourth singles.
In the second round of singles matches, sophomore Jean Thirouin solidified Harvard’s victory with a straight-set win at sixth singles. At fifth, Zhou dropped his first set 6-2, but managed to come back in the second set and ultimately take the third set for a decisive 5-2 win.
“I’m used to transitioning immediately from doubles to singles, and my opponent was playing really well so that was reflected in my first set. But I was able to adjust, and I was lucky enough to come away with a few extra points than he did,” Zhou said.
HARVARD 5, YALE 2
In front of an energetic home crowd Friday evening, the Crimson earned its third-straight Ivy win with a 5-2 sweep of the Bulldogs.
“I think everyone played really well and having that support and atmosphere made it a really enjoyable experience. It was perfect,” Zhou said.
Harvard took an early lead by claiming the doubles point. Hu and junior Brian Yeung dominated first doubles for a handy 6-2 victory, while junior Sebastian Beltrame and Thirouin managed to edge out their opponents 7-5.
Going into the singles competition, Harvard continued to widen its lead. Thirouin found success on the courts again at sixth singles, taking a quick 6-2, 6-1 win. Lam finished close behind in another straight-set victory, fending off his opponent with a tiebreaker win in the second set.
After dropping the first set 6-4, Beltrame fought back to take the next two sets 6-3, 6-2 for a victory at second singles. Zhou also found victory in a close three-set match. After taking the first set and dropping the second, Zhou managed to close out the third set with a tiebreaker win.
Harvard’s only losses of the day were at first and fifth singles. Yale sophomore Ziqi Wang edged Hu out in a tiebreaker first set before claiming the next set 6-4 at first singles. At fifth singles, after dropping the first set, freshman Christopher Morrow managed to push his second set to a tiebreaker, but failed to nab the win.
“If we can get one more [win] and sneak into NCAAs, I think we will have the momentum on our side and anything can happen. Nothing would make me happier than to see the guys on the team compete in the postseason this year,” Hu said.

Ah, Harvard. Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate...wait, it’s only 50-something degrees out.
Still. These breezy warm temperatures are certainly a welcomed shift from the random cold spell that hit Cambridge just a few weeks prior, and we at Flyby are not complaining.
To the colorful chairs, which are finally making their reappearance: it’s been too long. Now is my final opportunity to steal one of you before the year’s over.
To the masses of tourists that come with the nicer weather: yes, I’ll take a picture for you in front of Widener. But not multiple pictures. I’m already late to my section in Sever.
To the fat squirrels: thanks for reminding me that sometimes, fat things that eat all the time are actually kind of cute. Did you hear that, mom? My freshman fifteen is cute. 
To the grass that will be green again soon, and the pretty flowers starting to bloom once more: thanks in advance for all of the great Snapchats I’ll feature you in. Can’t wait for #springhassprung #spring #harvard #igohere.
To the happy couple cutely picnicking in the middle of the Yard: please share your secrets to maintaining a relationship. How do you do it? Do you even go here? Do people really fall in love at Harvard? What a magical thing.

Although we aren't sure if this is good news or bad, there are less than two weeks left of the semester. Two weeks, people. Whether that makes you jump for joy or sink deeper under you growing pile of papers and review sheets, Flyby’s got you covered with the best ways to take advantage of the beautiful spring weather and looming deadlines.
Have a mid-college crisis…or a three-quarters college crisis…or a one-quarter college crisis…whatever works for you.
We kid, we kid. As we (hopefully) proved to most of the pre-frosh this weekend, Harvard is a fun and happening place. But being swamped in work and behind on your projects is not a bad time to start wondering what you’re doing this all for. If you’re stressed, you can take a run or two around the Charles and watch happy people picnic along the river.
Complain because it’s finally warm out but there’s too much work to  enjoy the weather.It feels like only last week there was a massive pile of snow in the Science Center Plaza...because it was a week ago. With temperatures in the 60s--70s by Thursday!--Lamont is the last place you want to be. That’s what Lamont Cafe is for: strike up a conversation and complain your heart out to anyone who will commiserate with you.
Spend time with friends.Not that there aren’t some who you’re going to Skype everyday over the summer. But, really, you’re not going to see them for a few months, so it’s better now than never to form a closer bond with that pset group, or share more memories with your blockmates. You could find yourself across the world from one another this summer, so enjoy the little time you have together until next semester. And, if you’re up to it make a new friend. The school year isn’t over just yet!
Use that Boardplus.Or loan some to a needy friend. Whether you have 50 dollars left or five, word has it that it doesn’t carry over to next year. Use it buy yourself a late and caffeinated night in Lamont Cafe, or treat yourself to some Greenhouse goodies. I personally recommend Greenhouse’s Odwalla smoothies--trying all the flavors will put that money to use.
Clean your room.Even if it’s the first time all semester. Or year. It’s a great way to convince yourself you’re starting anew, even though (shocker!) there are less than two weeks left of the semester. It’s also the best end-of-the-year gift you can give your roommate. More than that, it’s the perfect way to procrastinate studying.
Work Hard.Finals are coming. This is your chance to watch your GPA soar! Or plummet, if you wish. Isn’t it fun to have so much control over your fate?
