After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LISBON, Portugal—As it has done to so many people before me, the glinting, electric blue water entices me as foamy waves lap against the white steps. A long ship, Maersk perhaps, passes by, and the water becomes more persistent, approaching with a rakish intention, mesmerizing me. The ship leaves and the waves are soft again. But they have charmed many people, many explorers, many poets, many before me. I am not unique to them. Just another human. But, perhaps, they singled me out. I feel almost Pessoan, but how can I not in the beautiful, quaint city of Lisbon.
Fernando Pessoa, one of the greatest Portuguese poets, wrote, “The value of things is not the time they last, but the intensity with which they occur. That is why there are unforgettable moments and unique people.”
Sitting here on the white steps that overlook the water, I can’t help but feel some sort of Pessoan intensity overtake me. I will remember this moment.
Later, as I walk through the streets of Lisbon to go home, saxophone music resounds . A woman plays an accordion in front of a classy Japanese store. Snippets of Indian music and American pop tunes float through the air, as well. And I even hear Fado… traditional music of Portugal. Fado is a music genre that was placed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Fado music is generally associated with the Portuguese word “saudade” which is high on many lists of untranslatable words. I asked several Portuguese people to give, in their own words, a translation. Saudade is a sense of longing, but greater than that. It is not necessarily a sense of missing. It is a sense of wanting some-thing, some-when, some-what, or some-one. A woman described it to me as, “You become the feeling.” I can’t tell if I have fully understood the meaning, not in terms of words, but in terms of deep sentiment. But maybe two months from now, I’ll look back at my time in Portugal and I’ll think of the narrow streets, the delicious pastel de nata (egg tarts), the friendly men and women, the relaxed main square in Lisbon, the music of the streets, the midnight picnics, the beautiful waves, and I’ll get a sense of saudade for Portugal.

SHANGHAI, China--This is a postcard, according to The Crimson. That constitutes an interesting claim from an epistemological standpoint, or at least a nitpicking one. How does The Crimson know it’s a postcard? The United States Postal Service has a particular definition for postcards. “You may think your mailpiece is a ‘postcard,’ because it is a single sheet of paper,” its website chides unctuously. But according to USPS standards, a postcard must assume a rectangular shape within a specific band of length-width-thickness dimension. Still, even the everyday conflation of “postcard” with “single sheet of paper,” cannot apply here. This Crimson postcard is not even a “mailpiece,” to borrow the phrasing from our latter-day Pony Express. Instead, it is an amalgam of zeros and ones, encoding words too long to fit a standard card. And on top of that, the purest sacrilege of all: I don’t have a picture.
My postcard should have a picture of the country I am in. It should have a picture of China. But you know what China looks like, or you can find out with a Google image search (if you reside within Chinese borders, Bing or Baidu may serve better). Besides, I have neither aptitude nor energy for photography, and no camera without a smartphone attached to it. Another problem remains, too. A picture, a single picture—that could do more harm than good.
In one sense, China is a marvel of age-old oneness and continuity in culture, in political centralization, in language—in civilization. In another, it presents a pastiche of old and new, North and South, communist, Confucian, capitalist. I could attach a photo of Shanghai’s Lujiazui financial district where I’m interning this summer, an expanding skyline fertilized by rapid economic growth and a ripening credit bubble. On the Huangpu River’s opposite bank stretches the Bund. I could photograph that unfurled streak of historical buildings, marks of Shanghai’s past and the roles foreigners played in it (one building features a miniature Big Ben; another district’s name, the French Concession, says a lot as well). One night (before the too-early 11 p.m. closing), I could photograph the sleek and timely Shanghai subway, cheaper (in the per-ride sticker cost, at least) and more efficient than the New York counterpart I know better. Or I could photograph the weekday rush, dense with humans, to pack aboard the trains amid a rainy rush hour. Would a photograph of the Nanjing Ford factory I saw be better? Or one of the sweatier factories I didn’t see? Or of rural Guizhou or Yunnan, where I haven’t been? I might still have a shot of Mao Zedong’s portrait in a certain Beijing square, stored inside my computer from the time I visited.
Of course, it’s not just China. In 2012, the United States’ most photographed location on Instagram was Disneyland. That Minnie and Mickey’s domicile topped the list might say something about America (or its Instagram-indulging subset), but it leaves out a few facets. As for the Middle Kingdom, add several millennia of history and a billion people. Then try to find a picture to sum it all up. Words fail too.
Now we’re back to an epistemological dilemma, shifted from deltiology to sinology. During my pre-internship, weeklong Shanghai-Jiangsu tour, my group’s Chinese tour guides didn’t help solve it. We were brought to a village outside Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, billed as a nearby representation of rural Chinese life. I don’t know whether every other Chinese village sports an indoor theater, a cheerful, baseball-capped head official, and a quaint, lush sense of idyll. But the next day, in a move that makes something of a microcosm for modern China, the guide halted us for an hour in a tourist-geared silk factory’s conveniently adjacent silk store. At the time I yawned; now I can chuckle. A tinge of capitalist tact to follow a day spent commune-ogling.
Tours are not the way to understand China, and using simplistic phrases like “understand China” doesn't help either, presupposing false premises a) that China is a single entity to be understood and b) that China can be processed in the way we understand theories, equations, and mechanisms of the physical world. Instead, I might aim to experience a bit of life in this country—not as an alien subject to be studied but as a different home in which to live, however briefly.
Over the course of the summer, I plan to write four more of these, hopefully with less mailpiece musing and more thoughtful recollection. They will be myopic, myopic as any photograph. They might not capture your experience of China or even enough of my experience. Still, I hope to spell out one smallish slice of my own small slice. It’s just a postcard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JERUSALEM, Israel—Like all girls hoping to de-kosher a BBQ, we were on a mission for cheese.
We walked, step-in-step on the tracks of the light-rail on Yaffo. We passed kids playing tag and religious men on bikes, but in all of our journeying we did not see a single neon “open sign.”
We should have known that our quest would not be easy; it was it was noon on a Saturday—Shabbat in Jerusalem.
Loosely translated into English using the one word I know in Hebrew and lots of context clues, Shabbat means something along the lines of  “nothing is open,” or “the day of rest for your credit card.”
If you want to spend money, commute, or rip toilet paper from Friday night at sundown on to saturday, you can't. Everything shuts down and all the toilet paper is pre-ripped. It is like Christmas Day in the States, except here even the Chinese restaurants are closed. The streets are empty, and the 24/7 markets are actually just 24/6, so you have to trek miles to find your pack of Kraft American Cheese.
Which we did.
30 minutes into our walk we were getting desperate, we were hungry, and in need of some calcium. I’m not going to be dramatic, but we were probably on the verge of osteoporosis or scurvy. I was at the point were I would milk my own goat for cheese, which is pretty desperate considering the fact that my goat has been dead since 2003.
Now I am not a particularly religious person, but I was praying to god that we would find a supermarket, and if I did still have a goat I would consider sacrificing it.
But then, in the distance, the calming sight of flashing neon red and green materialized. We found our open sign. Our oasis. Our cheese. And boy was it overpriced.
We bought it anyways and went home and to celebrate a job well done by day drinking Kiddush wine and napping. Because quite honestly, there is nothing else to do in this sleeping city on Shabbat.

SHANGHAI, China—I shouldn’t be so surprised.  I’m from America, the land of mega malls and super savings.  As we know from Morgan Spurlock’s “Super Size Me,” more American kids recognize Ronald McDonald than Jesus Christ or George ‘Dubya’ Bush.
Yet, my jaw drops at the sight of a Harbin beer fountain in front of a Shanghai shopping complex.
It’s not actual beer pouring out of the two cans, which are larger-than-life (or at least larger than a fridge).  But there is something so brazen about this symbol of the NBA’s brand partnership with Harbin Beer.  This naked advertising is not the first I’ve seen in Shanghai.  For the first month of my stay, I walked by a Bailey’s bottle statue on my way to work; the liquor sculpture has since disappeared, or rather, evaporated.
I’m uncertain as to why I’m so shocked, but, as most tourists do, I snap a picture and walk away.
As I sort through my photos later through that day, I find myself focusing on this corporate art, if you will.  It’s not the exact term, but product placement wouldn’t be correct either.  Product placement is subtle and subconscious.  It’s Reese Pieces occupying a few frames of the movie E.T. It’s conspicuously clean Hyundai Tucsons in the AMC series, “The Walking Dead” (no matter how grimy and sordid the zombie plots are, the vehicles of escape remain pristine).
The artistic merits of the overt advertising I’ve seen in Shanghai are debatable.  It’s art for the masses and by definition; it’s not art for art’s sake.  Yet, aestheticism is definitely a chief concern.  This is a culture that turns takeaway boxes and cups into miniature works of art.  When you close the takeaway boxes from the Japanese chain, Tako Boy, the two halves of the top form a Manga-esque picture of a child in an octopus costume.
This commercial art form isn’t limited to the fast food or alcohol industries either.  Even the Michelin star rated restaurant chain, Din Tai Fung, has its own cartoon mascot.  The mascot, an anthropomorphic dumpling, features sixteen folds on his dumpling head, just like the restaurant’s specialty.
Perhaps these blatant displays of commercialism are simply the extension of a culture that believes that the devil lives in the details.  The exact reason why these peculiar creations thrive in Shanghai is unclear, but the cause for my shock is less so.
In the United States, advertisers attempt to occupy our fleeting moments of unoccupied time.  The pauses between Pandora songs, Hulu shows, turns on a Solitaire app are all fair game.  Any inch of space that might grab our attention—even the sidebar of our Facebook News Feeds—represent chances to infiltrate the minutiae of our lives.
The Harbin beer fountain did not have to steal my attention.  It earned it the old fashioned way: shock and awe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald H. Pfister, a longtime Harvard faculty member and administrator who chaired a committee that reviewed the Administrative Board from 2008-2010, will serve as interim Dean of the College as it begins to explore a proposal to give students a role in adjudicating some disciplinary cases, Harvard announced Tuesday.
Pfister, dean of Harvard Summer School and a former Kirkland House Master, is also a professor of botany and curator of the Farlow Reference Library and Herbarium. On Wednesday, Pfister will assume the position held by former dean Evelynn M. Hammonds until the start of this month. The announcement in May that she would leave her post came nearly two months after she told faculty she had authorized the secret search of a resident dean’s faculty and administrative email accounts without the necessary permission, breaking faculty email privacy policy.
Tuesday’s announcement did not specify how long Pfister will serve, though it did say that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith will convene a committee and begin the search for a permanent dean in the fall.
