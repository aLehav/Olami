After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's sailing team is set to kick off its spring season with the Sharpe Trophy regatta this weekend. After a successful fall season with six first-place wins, including the Open Atlantic Coast Championship, the team hopes to continue its momentum through to the upcoming season.
The team is preparing for over 25 regattas throughout the season, including five hosted in Cambridge, and aims to qualify for the ICSA National Championships in May. Harvard sailors will also adjust to the additional style of team racing, where they will rely on strong team dynamics and cohesion. For Harvard, the ultimate goal is to win the New England Championship, which would give it a chance to win or place on the podium at Nationals.
With regatta-packed months up ahead, Harvard is braving the low temperatures and ready to set sail as it gears up for its first regatta of the spring season, the Sharpe Trophy, which takes place this weekend in Providence, R.I., hosted by Ivy foe Brown University.
Harvard will enter the Bay State armed with its successes from a tremendous fall season, which saw the Crimson exhibit strong results across disciplines and qualification teams. Harvard accumulated a total of several first-place wins, most notably, the Open Atlantic Coast Championship (ACC) in October. The strong tally of results from the season translated into a stellar first-place overall ranking for the co-ed group within college sailing.
Head coach Michael O’Connor hopes to channel this momentum through into the upcoming season, but he reflected on several critical learning points from the fall.
“We were pleased with our performance for most of the fall season. There were opportunities where we could have performed better in certain conditions, and this is something we’re going to try to improve on as we always do,” O’Connor said. Nevertheless, he is confident that the expectations and successes will “translate well into the spring season.”
This spring, Harvard will host five regattas in Cambridge and compete in four others within the Boston area. To compete in the ICSA National Championships, college teams must first qualify through conference championships. Nationals is the main target for success for the spring, as it is widely regarded as the most defining college-sailing regatta of the year.
“The spring season is where everything major happens,” first-year sailor Kennedy Leehealey said. “Everyone's super stoked for the next season because of how we came out of the first season. The fall was a trial period, and with Nationals coming up, this is the season that really matters.”
Similarly, O’Connor stressed the importance of Nationals for Harvard’s overall ranking, emphasizing that “our goals are to win the New England Championship, which gives us a very good chance of winning Nationals or even getting on the podium.”
Harvard sailors are preparing to dedicate themselves to success in the impending event of the season. “It is important to peak at the right time towards the end of the season when Nationals occur,” first-year sailor Mitchell Callahan said. “Up until then, I think it’s about learning and developing as much as we can, learning as a team together, building chemistry and a bond to implement later in the upcoming months.”
However, in preparation for the upcoming season, all college sailing teams must adapt to team racing. Diverging from last season’s main format of fleet racing, wherein boats from three or more teams compete, team racing only entails two competing teams, which each sail two to four boats of the same class.
Nonetheless, the Crimson is confident in its ability to harness this modification in racing style and reap strong results. While Leehealey recognizes that “team racing is a whole other ballgame,” first-year sailor Justin Callahan is looking forward to this racing style and hopes for a fluent team dynamic.
“Mitchell and I have done a lot of team racing before. In team racing, you’re relying on each other for results to make the right plays, and to have each other’s backs on the water. A strong team dynamic creates a cohesiveness and trust between us that allows everyone to execute the plays properly,” Callahan said.
As the Crimson heads into the spring season this weekend, the value of a strong team effort and dynamic in the prospect of continued success will be critical, according to the head coach.
“I’m very happy with the team’s effort up to this point, and of course, with their racing results [from the fall]. I’m really proud of who these people are and how they represent Harvard, and I hope that we can make a run at the National Championships,” O’Connor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s lacrosse faced two strong opponents in the opening two weekends of play: the No. 21 University of Michigan Wolverines and the Georgetown University Hoyas. The Crimson battled through the two hard-fought games in freezing temperatures, ultimately coming out unsuccessful in both competitions.
Harvard traveled westward to face the Wolverines to kick off its 2023 campaign. The Big Blue entered the game with three previous games under its belt and more experience on its side. However, the momentum was fiercely swept by an eager Crimson side, notching the first goal of the season from first-year midfielder Charlotte Hodgson. The relentless pressure and pace did not prove enough on the day, with the final score 17-10 in favor of the Big Blue. Junior midfielder Riley Campbell felt there was a lot to learn from this game, as well as a good response to pressure.
“Michigan was a super aggressive team and we were able to respond and also be aggressive, especially on the draw. Maddie Barkate has been killing it and really stepping up,” Campbell said.
Junior midfielder Maddie Barkate stepped in to take the draws after senior midfielder Grace Hulslander was sidelined due to injury in the first minutes of play. The team faced adversity throughout the game but came away with areas to improve and sharpen that will ultimately make a big difference in the coming games.
The Crimson did not disappoint, with chances created edging Michigan in number of shots at 34 to 26. Head coach Devon Wills is looking for ways for the team to be more clinical in their approach to converting on these chances — in regards to the opening two games, Wills is proud of the team overall for handling adversity, but looks for minor improvements that can create significant changes.
“I think the team responded really well in Georgetown to everything that happened in Michigan and improved a lot,” the head coach reflected. “I think going into these next games we need to focus on our shooting and finding ways to put pressure on the opposing attackers’ hands.”
On Saturday, the Crimson opened home play against the Hoyas. The game was a back-and-forth frenzy of goal scoring. Harvard’s pressure was incessant, responding with big tying goals late in the third period by junior midfielder Ilana Kofman and late in the fourth period by sophomore attacker Caroline Mullahy. Georgetown found the game winner with under two minutes left in the game, making the final score 10-9 in favor of the Hoyas.
According to Coach Wills, there were many positives in the match despite the loss.
“We have had a lot of contributors already. It is not the case that we are just having two goal scorers, it is our first-years that are contributing a lot,” Wills said.
First-year midfielder Hannah Shields stepped up to score two crucial goals against the Hoyas, the first goal tying the game in the second and the other putting the Crimson up 5-4. Shields was not alone in contributing a pair of goals to the game on Saturday. Campbell and junior midfielder Callie Hem also scored twice for the Crimson, with Campbell notching two assists driving at the opponents, and picking and threading passes on the attack. Campbell and Hem lead the team in goals at four each.
Coach Wills further commented on the team’s mentality through these two games and next steps leading into its commencement of Ivy competition against Brown this weekend.
“It’s tough to play an Ivy game this early, so there is not a ton of information on either side. We are just trying to prepare for anything and everything just because it is so early in both of our seasons,” Wills said.
“We are trying to get the team to feel confident and see the growth that they made. The team is still trying to figure out its identity, especially after some big personnel losses. It takes a couple games to get that rhythm, fill those voids, and see who is going to step up.”
Campbell echoed the sentiments of using the first two games as conference learning experiences to prepare the team for the battle that is Ivy League play.
“We know that Brown is going to come out on Saturday looking for revenge after last year, but we know how important this game is for the rest of our season and playing in the Ivy League,” Campbell stated. “I think we are going into it with a super focused and driven mentality.”
The Crimson will travel to the Bay State to play Brown this Saturday at 1:00 p.m. EST on ESPN+. The game will reflect an important response following the opening games that will kickstart the beginning of what the team and fans hope to be a successful 2023 Ivy League campaign.
