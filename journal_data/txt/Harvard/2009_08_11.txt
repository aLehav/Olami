WASHINGTON, D.C. — Maybe the sangria had something to do with why it was so crowded. But I had to hope that many in the teeming horde were here for the jazz.
Today, it was the Krupa-Pilzer Quintet. Last week, it was Dixie Power Trio. All summer, it’s been jazz in the Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Art. Every Friday from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., the museum brings in talented jazz musicians to play for picnicking interns and locals after a long week of interning or being local. They come out in droves because it’s great music—and they come out in droves because it’s all free.
I don’t know much about jazz, but I liked the stylings of the Krupa-Pilzer Quintet. Of the adjectives I have heard others use when describing jazz, the quintet was the following: toe-tapping, exuberant, soulful, and versatile. The quintet was proudly highlighting women in jazz—a medium that, I’ve been told, is all about self-expression through music. On this Friday, some extraordinary women musicians were throwing their personal doors open to a captive public audience.
That’s why this entire summer concert series was actually artistically significant. It occurred outside, first of all, in the open air of the National Mall, “America’s front yard,” where any passerby could stop and listen. Then, it took place among art of a different kind—the modern visual pieces in the Sculpture Garden. As my ears learned new ways of making a piano and a trombone combine, my eyes tried to dissect what looked like a giant pulley—Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen’s Typewriter Eraser, Scale X, I later learned. 
Like the Friday jazz sessions, the Sculpture Garden itself is artistically ideal, because it, too, is always free to the public. More than creating a great deal for broke students and starving artists, the lacking cover charge makes art as accessible as it can and must be.
That’s always a challenge when art gets tied up in economy, as Brandeis University found out early this year. Its Rose Art Museum faces permanent closure in response to the current recession, ripping its collection from the public domain and reversing the progress of open expression.
There’s clearly an attitude that views art as the most expendable “luxury” we own—and therefore the most dispensable during tough times. But because of what art is there to do—express, provide escape, inspire—the truth is actually the exact opposite. Depression is when we need art the most.
We should count ourselves lucky that residents of the nation’s capital seem to understand this best—they appear committed to both solving the economic crisis and promoting the arts at the same time. The tenacious, successful performance of the summer jazz series and the open-air Sculpture Garden constitute a significant step forward for accessible art. In addition, the National Gallery of Art has no admission fee. Neither does the world-famous Smithsonian Institution, designed to serve as the nation’s attic. 
Even the White House has lent its stage to musicians this summer as part of Washington’s overall effort to put art at every American’s fingertips. Although the concerts hosted under the White House Summer Music series weren’t exactly open to the public, each threw its doors open to a group of child musicians who cherished a chance to learn from the best. They got free advice, and the rest of the country got a free sample of national art forms like jazz and country music (by way of television news coverage).
The Obama administration may be embracing art because, as the economy gives us reason to be pessimistic, art gives us good reason to hope. But more likely, this particular brand of hope has clearly been present in Washington for a long time. Instead of stemming from a campaign slogan, art is the logical end product of a country that values free expression. 
Now, like in our capital, that expression needs only to remain ubiquitously free of charge as well. From Waltham to Wasilla, all of America should come down to Washington and enjoy this principle in action.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Until Labor Day, an altarpiece from the Italian region of Abruzzo will be on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Its burnished surface will stand out in one of the main circular foyers on the second floor, not due to its narrative structure or vivid colors, but because it is a diplomatic missive from the Italian government to the American one.
The altarpiece itself is not spectacular. Certainly, it is visually pleasing—it is called the Beffi Triptych after the village for which it was painted, and narrates the lives of the Virgin Mary and Christ in an expressive and vibrant style. One panel depicts Christ’s nativity, another the death of the Virgin. Yet, this piece of art communicates numerous messages. It represents how— in a political world of words and numbers—a gesture can speak more loudly.
The ceremonial altarpiece-cum-thank-you-note expresses a formal and polite appreciation for the assistance that the United States government provided in the aftermath of the devastating April 6, 2009 earthquake. The disaster affected more than 25 percent of historically important buildings in Abruzzo, and so the churches and museums that hosted cherished artworks faced the tough reality of restoring the region’s cultural treasures. Therefore, the altarpiece constitutes not only a declaration of gratitude to one of the governments that was first to provide support, but also a declaration to the Italian government itself, solidifying the immense importance it places on rebuilding the region’s former artistic wealth.
In some ways, the symbolism present in such a gesture can be manipulated. This summer has shown a wealth of seemingly diplomatic symbols that have invited much criticism. Silvio Berlusconi—the Italian prime minister—seems to have gambled with the choice of L’Aquila for the July G8 summit in order to draw attention away from recent accusations that his social life resembles that of a sordid playboy’s. Since people use symbols to convey something beyond the obvious, Berlusconi’s political symbolism at the G8 summit might be cynically viewed as having a particularly hollow and manipulative motive.
Back in Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama learned the enduring value of a well-intentioned gesture with another kind of summit. He felt that he needed to retreat from the inflammatory words that he uttered in judgment of the Cambridge police department after Henry Louis Gates, Jr. was arrested there, sparking a national debate about race in America. Though the discourse about the arrest, its aftermath, and the realities of race problems in the country spread far and wide, Obama thought that a simple gesture might soothe the ire of the affair—an invitation to relax over a beer. 
Evidently, different types of summits and early fifteenth century triptychs speak louder than sheer words. The symbolism that surrounds these actions is a testament to the extent that diplomacy relies on signs and signals. As those rebuilding the Abruzzo region have realized, the art of actions remains more powerful than just what meets the eye.

DALLAS, Texas — “Welcome Home, George and Laura!” 
The little white yard signs are all over my neighborhood, where the former President and First Lady moved after the Obama inauguration this past January. And these poster-board rectangles with the former Bush campaign logo put to a new (and arguably more effective) use have an interesting story behind them, apocryphal or not.  
Apparently, some enterprising kid made several hundred of the signs last December and sold them for an extremely high price to neighborhood residents eager to show their support for the past president, who the liberal American media “just didn’t understand.” I should mention that these are largely the same individuals who put white crosses in their yards every spring bearing the phrase “He is Risen!” within clear view of the street, so it’s really no surprise that the “Welcome Home” signs fared so well. The kid (at least in the version of the story I heard) is said to have made some serious jack—we’re talking several thousand dollars here, and all for little pieces of poster-board he probably designed at Kinko’s one Saturday afternoon. Perhaps he earned enough to make “George”—as he’s often referred to around here, sans the last name—proud. 
What gets me most about the whole Bush “homecoming” down in Dallas is that so many people here have no idea that the rest of the country—I’m thinking of the two coasts, not the giant landmass north of Dallas and south of Canada—would probably not, to say the least, be impressed that they know “George” personally and/or still believe him to have been a terrific president, irrespective of the numerous economic and political disasters that characterized his presidency. 
But in Dallas, it’s almost as though a hero has finally come home after years in the midst of a bitter struggle with “the Arabs” overseas and the evil intellectuals on the domestic front. And the extent to which Bush has been welcomed with open arms down here sheds light on one of the oddest things about Dallas—the way in which it decides who belongs and who does not. 
It is possible to be a “Dallasite” without having lived in Dallas for all that long, just as it is possible to live in Dallas for a lifetime without anyone extending that invitation.
When a prodigal son like our very own “George” walks back in after more than a decade in Washington and Austin, he is hailed as the very essence of the city. But the millions of others who come to town for a piece of the (formerly) booming North Texas economy will likely never really fit in with the establishment, even if they become wildly successful. 
Just as in other places, money alone really isn’t enough to “make it” in Dallas, so it’s not really surprising that the city’s elite were quick to grab hold of a former president coming back into their neck of the woods. Having Bush around, knowing him, and calling him “George” have thus become signs of membership in the Dallas establishment. And the zeal with which the former president has been defended, celebrated, and championed is a testament to the city’s obsession with social hierarchy. 
The “Welcome Home” signs are, in one sense, tangible evidence of typical Dallas exclusivity. . In other words, George Bush is one of “us,” and together, “we” belong. 
But my question isn’t about this exclusivity itself—I wonder about its display.
Do you really “belong” if you have to tell people you do? Are you really one of “us” if you have to advertise it on your front lawn?

ANDOVER, Mass. — For the past month and a half, I have taught at the summer session of Phillips Academy. Although working close to home in this sylvan corner of northern Massachusetts was a joy to me, I have to admit a certain amount of moral struggle that I faced as a faculty member of an institution whose students condescendingly referred to me as a “local” while I grew up in neighboring North Andover.  Now, at the end of the summer, I have seen the other side of the campus’ New England brick and, I hope, gained a great lesson in moral growth. 
My mentor teacher and I taught Othello to our Prep for AP English class and, in my rereading of the tragedy, I found one character who struck me as unmistakably familiar.  This one character has knowledge, power, and smarts, knows when to show sympathy, or when to march up indignation.  He is the supreme politician.  This one character struck me as devoutly Harvardian in his understanding and use of human weakness.  I could envision him campaigning amongst important friends for student office, dashing up to an extra-curricular office in Hilles, or whispering knowingly with a TF after section.  This one character was Iago, the villain.
I will enter my senior year at Harvard in less than a month, and in my time here I have seen myself grow more and more “well tuned,” to use Iago’s words, to the art of politics.  We learn quickly here how to court both professors and classmates, to attend the proper dinners and shake the proper hands.  This is not specific to a particular group of students, either.  Whether vying for President of the International Relations Council or admission to the Delphic, it is quickly made clear to us that we need to know the right people, make the right early moves, and smile when we need to.  But I realized early this summer that teaching smart, capable people to be politicians does not necessarily make them leaders.
I had the pleasure this past year of living with another transfer who had spent the first two years of college enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point.  He left to become an academic, but never lost the values of duty, honor, and leadership that are instilled there.  We left straight from our last final to dash to South Station, took the Fung Wah bus to New York City, and then boarded a night train headed north towards West Point.  We camped clandestinely in the woods, dodging the military police, and rose with reveille in the morning to see the young leaders he had trained with graduate.  
The commencement speaker, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, did not focus specifically on the tasks at hand in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Instead, he strove to arm those cadets with an ideal of leadership, telling them, “I've come to believe that few people are born great leaders. When all is said and done, the kind of leader you become is up to you, based on the choices you make.”  He characterized a leader as someone willing to understand and care for those led, but more importantly, as someone who has “moral courage.”  “The hardest thing you may ever be called upon to do,” he said, “is stand alone among your peers and superior officers. To stick your neck out after discussion becomes consensus, and consensus ossifies into groupthink.”  And while Harvard’s commencement speaker, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, did nod briefly in his speech to the class of 2009 as “future intellectual leaders,” in that very same breath he asked them to “join” in his task-at-hand, not to lead.
Harvard today is lucky to house many naturally-gifted individuals, but as Gates admitted, “few people are born great leaders.”  As Harvard students, selected for our abilities and given every advantage, we should be expected to become stewards for the rest of our society.  However, this cannot happen on a wide scale unless the University, its administration and its culture, begin to cultivate a new ethic of leadership.  We are given knowledge and power, but we are afraid to be openly conscious of ourselves as leaders, perhaps out of noblesse oblige or a fear of seeming arrogant. 
However, when we refuse to be conscious of our need to be leaders, and honorable ones at that, we become highly empowered but morally vacant.  One of the founding principles of my summer employer is that while goodness without knowledge is weak, knowledge without goodness is dangerous.  I ask our administration, whose refusal to be open with those it leads and whose desperate flailing in the economic crisis have done little to exemplify good leadership, to recognize this, too.  I ask those who guide Harvard to cultivate this new ethic of leadership, to see us as potential leaders and instill in us the great duty by whose will we should be formed.

LONDON, England — Last night, my friend invited me over to his house, where he was roasting a wild boar. Such an invitation was impossible to reject, and although my images of a spit-skewered animal turning over an open flame turned out to be purely the work of my imagination, I was not in the least disappointed by the actual product. Our host’s girlfriend had recently purchased the beast in Corsica (“I carried it in an ice bag on the plane!” she claimed), and together with the olives, salad, and pasta, it was far better than anything I’ve recently eaten in a restaurant. The atmosphere of relaxed conversation and domesticity far surpassed the hyper buzz of eatery ambience, and we chose to view the bust fuse and lack of light as simply an extreme version of a traditional, dim setting. Even our willingness to sip wine from mugs could not detract from the dinner-party tone of adult independence.
I’ve been to a few such soirees this summer, and have done my best to cook for my friends in return. These are usually students’ versions of a dinner gathering—without the luxury of a dining table—but its absence only adds to the laid-back mood of joviality. Dinner parties seem to encourage generosity far more than any other event, and guests’ gifts of wine or dessert generate a communal pride in the collectively assembled meal. 
Elaborate dining events are definitely an indulgence of holidays, with the time and kitchen space to prepare a meal. However, for my remaining month of vacation, I plan to eschew restaurants as much as possible. And I have every intention of searching out the nearest kitchen when I return to Harvard.

GENEVA, Switzerland — I came to Geneva to study international relations and learned a little lesson about citizenship in the process. In addition to studying at a hub of diplomatic activity, I’ve had the privilege to observe how the Swiss envision their obligations to their country and to each other. 
A widely known fact: Switzerland hasn’t seen combat in roughly two centuries. A less widely known fact (at least in the United States): All able-bodied Swiss men are obligated to enroll in the military at the age of 18 and, after an initial training period of nine months, perform additional local training every year until the age of 30. Women may volunteer. 
On the surface, this makes little sense.
An overwhelming 95 percent of the Swiss military is conscripted. Conscripts have the right to ask for civilian service in place of military service, but this choice has to be one of a conscientious objector, and is voted upon by committee.  Those who are found physically or psychologically unfit for service are required to pay an extra 3 percent tax and perform some other civic service, such as fire department duty.
Each soldier keeps his or her weapons in the private home. 	
Why does a country often parodied for its neutrality policy have a conscript army? This makes especially little sense when one considers that Switzerland is now surrounded by countries beginning to look more and more like Switzerland itself: friendly, peaceful, and law-abiding. The Swiss have no threatening neighbors and it is popular sentiment that the army would quickly be blown to smithereens if an invasion did occur.
The answer to this paradox lies at the heart of the Swiss tradition of the citizen-at-arms, the fully-committed participant of direct democracy. Compulsory conscription is part of the Swiss identity.
In the far past, a nationally drafted militia kept the cantons from raising armies against each other. But it quickly became enshrined as the ultimate symbol of solidarity and subsidiarity. As Dr. Sabine Mannitz at the Peace Institute Research Frankfurt (PRIF) writes, “the Swiss concept of the citizen-soldier aims at the lowest possible degree of institutionalising military structures and at a maximum of immediate democratic control.” Compulsory militia service, the obligation to defend the polity on equal share, is the other side of the coin of semi-direct democratic participation rights. If you have equal decision-making power, you have equal responsibility.
There have been numerous referendums to change the policy. But old traditions are stubborn. 
A 1989 movement to abolish the Swiss military as a whole was based on an economic assessment: The costs of operating such a vigilant and locally prepared defense system when the apparent external threats seem so low are quite high.
The referendum failed by a vote of 64 percent to 36 percent (a margin many Swiss found surprisingly thin).
By 1995, a few changes had been made, including the introduction of alternative service for conscientious objectors and the opening of the forces to women. Overall, the level of conscripts available for call at any one time dropped from 10 percent of the population to 5 percent, due to a lowering of the retirement age.
A second referendum was held in 2001. It failed by a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent.
For all its anachronism, most Swiss still highly regard (nearly) universal conscription.  For many who have served, the militia is a school of life, and teaches invaluable lessons. One former soldier noted that Swiss middle-class men cannot rise in the corporate world without a good show in the army. 
Many Swiss will tell you that there are multiple problems with the current policy, especially economic inefficiency, gender inequality, and a clash with popular pacifist sentiments. But compulsory service lives on. 
The scheme would be impractical and undesirable in a large republic.  But one still cannot help but admire the Swiss commitment to serve. As a citizen of a country once again reflecting upon what civic responsibility means, I have come to hold a certain appreciation for the Swiss sense that "everyone is in this together"—even if there are no enemies to fight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NY — If you wanted to express what you admire most about the United States to two young, Muslim men visiting this country for the summer, what would you say?
Two weeks ago, I found myself outside the New York University dorm I was living in, sitting on a plastic crate and talking late into the night with two affable fruit vendors, Yasin and Royal, as they sipped Dunkin' Donuts coffee. They often work for 15-hours shifts that last until 7 a.m., six days a week, for about $100 a day. Though they earn low wages, Royal attends college in Azerbaijan, and Yasin is a student at one of Turkey's best universities. They came to New York this summer on short-term visas, hoping to improve their English. But they have mastered the names of every variety of fruit—and little else. In Turkey, Yasin told me, vendors often give gifts to their customers as they make small talk. Americans, he said, quietly hand over the money.
Yasin and Royal live far away from my Manhattan dorm, in the cheaper outer boroughs, so they must commute for hours each day. They have never been to Central Park or even to Washington Square, just a few blocks away from Yasin's stand on 14th Street. They have never been to Central Park SummerStage or the Metropolitan Museum of Art, even though they are free. Not surprisingly, in their nocturnal isolation, they feel alienated. New York City is home to every variety of humanity, and at times it seems that everyone is rich, and comfortable in the main stream. A young Muslim man may feel that he is part of a very small minority. The two grocers work night and day, but, unlike many of their customers, do not shop with diverse groups of friends in the trendy Greenwich Village boutiques down the street.
Relations between the sexes, too, pose a problem. Royal told me that it is difficult to watch young men and women walk by on the street, flirting and touching each other with limbs exposed. In Azerbaijan, he said, a woman generally speaks sweetly and softly while looking only at her male partner. Royal feels that in New York he cannot express his opinions about relationships, or about religion more broadly. He believes that his English is bad enough that he could not hope to express the truths contained in the Koran, and encouraged me to read it for myself. Though they attend services at a nearby mosque, Royal and Yasin, working their long hours, do not have the opportunity to pray daily. The young Muslim men feel that many Americans are so hostile to Islam that they would not hesitate to ridicule their faith. Royal told me that he is frustrated because, while he must watch pedestrians flouting Islamic traditions all day, he cannot say to anyone that he believes they should convert to Islam. 
Seeking to offer a good word for America, and for Harvard, I asked the two men what they thought about our culturally sensitive policies. Sarkozy might want to ban burqas in France, I said, but in America, women can wear what they want. In recent years, I added, Harvard has constructed a private prayer space for Muslim students, and given Muslim women special hours for working out in the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center. My words fell on uncomprehending ears. I was as powerless as Royal to communicate my beliefs. The two friends did not understand what I meant when I spoke of "cosmopolitanism" or "multiculturalism." In the process of trying to talk about protecting traditional Islamic cultural practices, I had mangled their identities. Yasin's female friends in Istanbul do not wear head garb, or need special times to work out. In many ways, Royal is not a traditional Muslim, either. He feels alienated from American materialism, but he wants to study business in the United States for the next four years. And though Yasin and Royal do not approve of many American romantic customs, they are interested in the possibility of relationships with American women. Sometimes, while trying to accommodate what you imagine to be a people's culture, you can lose sight of the people themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LOS ANGELES, Calif.—I recently returned stateside from a trip to France and Holland where I was visiting family. Over the course of the trip, conversations with friends and relatives repeatedly turned to the president of France Nicolas Sarkozy’s declaration earlier this summer that the burqa “will not be welcome on the territory of the French Republic.” Although the French have yet to issue an outright ban on wearing burqas in public, a bipartisan committee of 32 lawmakers has been dispatched to come up with ways to prevent women from donning the head-to-toe garments whose only aperture is veiled in mesh. 
Everyone I spoke to—left-leaning, flexibly minded, young and middle-aged people—was, at least on the gut level, sympathetic to the ban. Yet, as abhorrent as the burqa is to me, the notion of legislating an outright ban was something that, with my American gut, I could not swallow. 
What drives the opposition to burqas? Is it that Europeans feel the person wearing it is the victim of a mind-control culture that subjugates women, or is it that they find the presence of burqa-wearers to be a fundamental blight on European society and culture? 
France and nearby countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy that have curtailed or given consideration to curtailing the presence of burqas in public have tended to conflate these two issues—individual as victim versus affront to society. The assumption among Europeans is that the onus is on the immigrant to conform to traditional European society. This sentiment is prevalent even among some politicians who are the sons and daughters of Muslim immigrants. The attitude is: “If you want to stay in our country, then adopt our customs, language, and values, or else go home.” These arguments, common currency now in Europe, used to be confined to extreme-right parties like that of Jean-Marie Le Pen in France.
By contrast, the America that I knew growing up in California seemed to operate under different premises. What I have observed is a constantly evolving society that meets the immigrant halfway, thereby taking the edge off of the cultural confrontation and facilitating assimilation. What it has meant to be an American has been a work-in-progress for 200-plus years. Immigrants arriving here generally join family and/or move into ethnically congenial neighborhoods. They typically work in a commercial culture where, if need be, they can get by only dealing with their fellow countrymen. Television, radio, music, church services can all be consumed in their native language. Indeed virtually all one’s needs—from restaurants, supermarkets, and karaoke bars, to medical, legal, insurance and real estate services—are readily available in one’s mother tongue. Major cities such as New York and Los Angeles are as much or more about a polyglot patchwork of such self-contained ethnic communities as they are about anything that could be called a dominant culture. Indeed, even whatever could loosely be called a “dominant culture” derived from white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, is like the croutons in a soup whose broth and flavor come from African-Americans, Jews, and other historically oppressed minorities. The immigrant can imagine him or herself adding spice to this soup. The melting pot beckons. The very ease with which one can defer assimilation in the United States seems to facilitate it. There are estimated to be 6.5 million Muslims in the United States but when was the last time you saw anybody wearing a burqa?
Contrast this accommodating attitude with France’s, a country with a more rigid traditional culture that is perceived to be under attack.  Universities in Michigan last year installed footbaths in dormitories to meet the needs of Muslim students who washed their feet before praying. France, by contrast, outlawed headscarves (as well as yarmulkes and large crosses) in schools. And in spite of wide gaps in achievement and employment between Arab immigrants and the rest of France, affirmative action policies have never been implemented and remain deeply unpopular. The positions and arguments of left-wing politicians in France on the subject of affirmative action could be lifted verbatim from arguments of conservative purists in America, such as Supreme Court Justices Anthony Scalia or Clarence Thomas. 
A similar contrast can be found on the issue of “mind control.”Swastikas, among other offensive symbols, are banned in many European countries. Scientology has failed to obtain religious recognition in France, Germany, and the UK, among others, and Greece has banned it altogether. The mind-control argument in relation to burqas is easy to make. Absent the expectations of fathers, brothers, and husbands, what woman would choose to wear a burqa ? It deprives them of ordinary human interaction and makes them wholly subservient to the men in their lives. Burqas, it can be argued, infringe on freedom of expression. 
By contrast, the United States is not a society that protects its members against cults and perceived mind control. We tolerate the existence of skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan, flag burning, the swastika, and the hammer and sickle. We don’t interfere with the Amish, although their lifestyle represents a wholesale rejection of mainstream American society. We have a history of tolerating open expression of life-styles that are antithetical to mainstream values. Hippies in the 60’s were not only extremely objectionable to most of American society, but belligerent towards that society, and yet there were no serious bans on long hair and tie-dyed t-shirts.
Where to draw the line in the twenty-first century is by no means clear. 
 Some conflicts between Western values and traditional immigrant cultures will be easy calls, like footbinding, or East African immigrants who seek out doctors to perform genital mutilation on their daughters. Other issues, like burqas, are more problematic. Fundamental values, like gender or racial equality, need to be weighed against freedom of expression. Each country has to find its own balance between tolerance of immigrant cultures and preservation of its own distinctive national values and traditions.

TIANJIN, China — The railway station in Wuhan is typical of most such structures in China. The building is flat and sprawling, and it is mostly comprised of one large, non-partitioned waiting room. There are designated waiting areas, and these have seats and gates. So, if you are looking for a train to Shenyang, you might be looking for Waiting Area 10, which might already be fully occupied, and you might start forming a line in front of the gate that keeps the public separated from the escalators, which lead downstairs to the tracks. And as you wait, you might begin writing metaphors in your head.
The people form a sea around you. The gates open like dams, and passengers stream through the bottleneck and swarm around the trains, oozing into the cabins. 
And these gates—how like the Chinese examination system. It is bigger and badder than the SAT, because Chinese colleges look at nothing else but this single test when accepting students. Gao kao—a phrase feared among high school seniors—represents a one-time chance to determine a significant portion, if not the rest, of your life. It is one of China's most unrelenting dams, after which students trickle into universities and later ooze into the job force.
These metaphors are abundant and easy to create, because they all revolve around the same, very familiar problem: There are too many people in China. In a hole-in-the-wall bun shop in Tianjin (the famous Tianjin goubuli baozi), three people are arguing about the People's Communication Party while pinching dough. Human rights, they complain. Disrespect for human rights. My cousin turns to me and says, yes, he thinks there are problems, but the government’s method achieves efficiency and growth. He's a member of the Party. It is the only party in China.
Impersonal, bureaucratic, and practical—these have been key words involved in defining Chinese Character for a long time. Parents invest suicidal amounts of energy and money in creating a super-child who will make the bar and beat the odds. And there is nothing more expensive than space, and nothing more rare than silence. Yoga is a new and lucrative business in China, because its centers (expensive and exclusive) offer both. 
But practicalism is coming to a boil. Now, there is only one child per family, and the importance of birth order and gender is an obsolete concept. Now, the New Oriental School is singing a self-important and idealistic tune. Now, drunk Leo at the bar is asking me what I think of the Chinese. There is a struggle for self-definition, for introspection, for something newer, more ideal. 
Idealism is a sputtering flame, a fragile sapling, a whine and buzz in the ear.Maria Y. Xia ’11, a Crimson news writer, is an English concentrator in Mather House.

SEOUL, South Korea — I’m going to miss a lot of things when I leave Seoul. I’ll miss green tea ice cream and jjimtang chicken. I’ll miss being obligation-free after 6p.m. I’ll even miss living in "the Pink Zone"—a.k.a. the area surrounding Ewha Womens University. But most of all, I’ll miss the people I’ve grown close to over the past two months.
I have two good friends here who I may not see for a long time, if ever again. Da Eun is a recent graduate of Korea University—and the former bass guitarist of a rock band called Adrenaline. When I first asked her why her music group broke up, she answered: “Because all my bandmates are now lawyers.” Since it is one of my greatest fears that I’ll go into a years-long slumber only to wake up surrounded by friends-turned-litigators, I knew we would get along.,Caroline, is a French intern at my company. She’s lived in Korea for almost a year, so in terms of Seoul street smarts, she’s way ahead of me. Last weekend, she bargained a dress down 25 percent—in a boutique.
As a veteran traveler and a serial friend-leaver, I know what happens to these relationships when one of us departs for a different continent. Emails are exchanged every few months, along with a badly connected phone call or two. But everyday life is all-consuming wherever you are, and at school I can barely remember to call my parents, let alone my former host family in Honduras. 
Nevertheless, a lack of communication does not erode my international connections. Two Australians I worked with in Honduras came to New York City last year and I made a six-hour bus journey from Boston to see them for an evening. In contrast, for a year I’ve neglected to visit close high school friends who live nearby. When I exchange updates with folks abroad, no matter how long it’s been since we’ve spoken, I’m struck by how easily we can pick up where we left off.
I think the difference is that my international friendships have always been based on our differences, rather than our similarities. Therefore, even if our paths grow far apart the dynamic doesn’t break down, it improves. In the course of Harvard life, I don’t often get to send emails that start off with, “How’s the Chinese medicine practice going? Are you still living on the commune?” (To Caite, my titian-dreadlocked Australian neighbor in Zanzibar.)
Next year Da Eun will finish up her contract with our company and take the Korean law school exam. These days she only pretends to go home after work, and instead climbs two floors up to an empty office and studies her thousand-page prep book until 9 or 10 at night. Caroline’s starting her fourth year of a five year bachelors-masters program in Nantes, of which she hasn’t decided her major. (“I’ll figure it out when I get [to registration],” she claims.) We may never live in the same country again—but that's why we will always enjoy sharing our very different lives.

PARIS, France —  France, a country with nearly four million Muslims, is now considering a ban on the traditional Muslim burka. President Nicholas Sarkozy recently declared that the garb is “not welcome” in his country, since France would not accept that “women be prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity.” While some have touted this move as a chance to remove women from the strictures thrust on them by an oppressive fundamentalist culture, others disagree. 
Some women wear the veil of their own volition, and not to comply with rules imposed by their husbands or parents. “I am happy behind the veil, I protect myself from depraved stares. Neither my father, nor my brother, nor my husband forced the full veil upon me; it's a personal choice," wrote one Muslim woman on LePoint.fr, as quoted in The Christian Science Monitor.
After living in Paris for the summer, I have found that it is a rare sight to see women in this traditional Muslim attire. Here, it is doubtful that anyone actually avoids stares by wearing the burka in public, because they do stand out. However, a personal choice of how to dress, even if it does have religious associations, should not be proscribed by the government. 
In a seemingly prescient coincidence during Paris fashion week, Riccardo Tisci, creative director for Givenchy, showed a collection that incorporated black gowns, veils, and stunning metallic face coverings, undoubtedly references to traditional Muslim garb. This creative take on Muslim attire defies the idea that burkas deny individuality or “deprive all identity.” 
France, a country on the cutting edge of haute couture, should not attempt to save women from oppression by dictating what they wear. On my last day in Paris, I glanced at a newsstand and saw 50-year-old Sharon Stone topless on the cover of Paris Match. In a country so seemingly liberal, the ban on burkas feels even more out of place. I agree that measures should be taken to ensure that citizens are not forced into wearing this traditional attire against their will, but a universal law prohibiting them is not the solution. However, a ban on nudity over the age of 50 is something that may have wider appeal.

VENICE, Italy — He’s been a glass-blower for the last ten years. Specializing in beads, he now teaches the skill to college students on Murano, the Venetian island renowned for the craft. I ask the man whether he lives here. He smirks and responds, half in jest, “No one lives on Murano.” Leaving him, I walk along the boardwalk-turned-sidewalk, watching as the never-ending line of shops begins to close. It’s a wonder that they all stay in business, as each is the same as the next, full of cheap glass trinkets: small clowns, a little perfume bottle (the majority of them are not actually Murano glass, but imported from places like China to be sold to unsuspecting sightseers). It was only early evening, but shopkeepers were already beginning to pull down grates in front of their windows. The tourists had departed and, suddenly, the street had become almost deserted.
“No Jews really live in the Ghetto,” the tour guide said as he directed a group of Americans around the five synagogues in Venice. “ Maybe 20 or 30 at most.” No one lives on Murano, no Jews live in the Ghetto. It is all part of the strangeness of Venice, where the aesthetic beauty is overwhelming until one realizes that the whole city seems to be set up for the amusement of outsiders. Hot and bothered middle-aged parents shuffle their young children along, filling their hands with glass bobbles and Carnival masks. They eat gelato and large margarita pizzas; they wait an hour in line to see the Doge’s palace and listen to one of the many tuxedoed string quartets in San Marco play Vivaldi (though they prefer it when the quartets strike up The Sound of Music). They say they have seen and done Venice and, in a sense, they would be correct. 
Henry James wrote in The Italian Hours that of all the cities in the world, Venice is the easiest to visit without actually going there.  Indeed, even if one has never set foot onto the sinking metropolis, it is hard not to have a pretty good idea of what it’s like: canals, gondolas, bridges, sleepy alleyways, crowded piazzas. The sights and images of Venice are everywhere in our own culture. 
This attitude is reminiscent of Czech writer Milan Kundera’s character Sabina in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, whose lover wants her to visit Palermo. He asks how she can possibly live without seeing it, to which Sabina responds, “I have seen Palermo. A friend of mine once sent me a postcard from there. It's taped up over the toilet.” 
And now, as I walk past stall after stall of glossy images, I feel that they accurately, collectively capture what the tourists see. As I check off all the sites I hit in Venice I wonder if in twenty years this “in person” aspect that we so desperately seek will make any difference. I don’t remember distinctive qualities about half the sites; my pictures are not nearly as good as the ones sold. 
So perhaps James is right. But there is another way in which it’s easier to go to Venice without actually going there, and this is because of people like James himself—because Venice has become a source of interest for those who produce and consume literature. Writers have become obsessed with the city, not simply as a setting for their narratives or  to detail its wonders, but because they can use the city as a metaphor for issues of humanity, the arts, the past. These authors have not allowed the cheery, glossed-over tourist vision to take hold, but have always seen a darker side of the city: a once powerful trade and cultural capital transformed into a sinking, aesthetic skeleton. For Balzac, it was the perfect frame for a Prince with only a title and no wealth; for Mann, it allowed for the exploration of beauty tainted by disease. 
And so while we often aim to visit other places through literature, it seems that, in this case, words and phrases might actually give us a truer experience of the city—allow us to move past the superficiality of the average tourist experience without, as James said, ever visiting.
But maybe it is unrealistic to try and separate the tourists from the city, to try and say that the hustling and bustling, the sites, the souvenirs, are somehow a façade for a sadder and darker place. Perhaps along with gondolas and bridges, the city should be thought of as a place where, as you dine along the Grand Canal between the mainland and Giudecca, you should expect small cities to float by you: cruiseships so enormous that they form a shadow over the island as the passengers onboard wave down to you. Perhaps you should expect that in viewing the sites, you, too, become a part of the display. Over 130 years ago James was able to make the observation, “The everlasting shuffle of these irresponsible visitors in the Piazza is contemporary Venetian life. Everything else is only a reverberation of that..” His words demonstrate that the tension between being boxed in as a tourist and yet having nothing to escape to is not a recent phenomenon to Venice, but reflects what Venice is, and, in a sense, what it always has been.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — As one of many Harvard students who remained in Cambridge this summer (woot woot, job market!), I soon learned that there are three types of Harvard affiliates on campus during the warmer months: those who eat in Annenberg, those who take their meals in Dudley, and those who make do with neither (generally subsisting on stale bread and a single jar of peanut butter over the course of three months).
Since I managed to finagle my way into a proctor position, I fell into Category 1. And I was not alone: The ‘Berg served a legion of high schoolers, here to get a taste of the Ivy League; international college students, sampling the U.S. collegiate scene; Summer School Program proctors, who relished the opportunity to catch up with their young charges at meals (in addition to every other minute of the day); Activities Office proctors, like myself; Philips Brookes House volunteers, only allowed to partake twice a week; and a smattering of other diners who contributed to the stampede. As we all remember from freshman year, eating in Annenberg is rarely a calming experience. And, I am here to tell you that this summer, it got a heck of a lot less calm.
Dudley Café, on the other hand, was home to a very different scene. Daily, it fed dinner to members of the Harvard College Program for Researching in Science and Engineering (better known as PRISE).
After seven weeks of less-than-excellent ‘Berg fare, and circulating rumors about Dudley House’s stellar dining services, my curiosity got the better of me. I decided to sneak in, and taste it for myself. 
Since every real criminal needs an accomplice, I convinced my friend and PRISE participant Kenneth Gotlieb ’10 (also an inactive member of the Crimson IT board) to serve as my right-hand man.  He showed little to no hesitation when I informed him of my very dangerous and risky plan.
Together, we infiltrated Dudley House—a complicated process that involved avoiding eye contact with Harvard University Dining Services staff as I paused in front of the unmanned card swiper, and pretended to produce my ID.
Once inside the servery, I was floored.  Perfectly-crisped onion rings, lightly steamed vegetables, beer-battered cod. A salad bar showcasing chilled salmon, cherry tomatoes, olives and mushrooms in brine, tabule, baby corn, tortellini, a variety of meats. A dessert section complete with sliced peaches from the can, grapefruit wedges, fresh fruit salad (at dinner!), a humongous tub of Richardson’s chocolate ice cream (which Kenny said was nearly a nightly standard). He added that, for a while, the dining hall boasted strawberry and blueberry smoothies. As he spoke, Kenny was drinking Dudley House coffee—also known as Starbucks Sumatra, Extra Bold (he said it was—extra bold, that is). Apparently the salad dressing is also a crowd pleaser: When I arrived at our table, plate laden, my accomplice lost no time in telling me, “Get your ass back up there and try that raspberry vinaigrette.”
At first, I felt betrayed: This high-quality bounty had been close at hand all along. Instead, I’d been stuck where they served turkey cold cuts—straight from the sandwich bar, but topped with a little garnish—as an entrée.
Don’t get me wrong: I’m thrilled and grateful that I spent the summer eating free, relatively healthful food, especially after witnessing members of Category 3 scrounge around for frozen pizza at 7/11.  And, considering the University’s current budget crisis, it doesn’t surprise me that the ‘Berg tries its best to economize in June, July, and August. In fact, anything else would be irresponsible. And, according to HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin, PRISE arranges for its own food, which explains the quality difference. Still, all that being said, I couldn’t help but envy those lucky, soon-to-be scientists and engineers. I suppose the grass is always greener, especially when that grass is covered in strawberry and blueberry smoothies.

LONDON, England — “Hi, I’m doing some research for The Financial Times on the pink pound: how the recession has affected the gay community…”
“We’re nothing to do with pink pound, love, we’re spanking.”
Ah. I belatedly noted the masochistic schoolgirl posters on the wall, and made my way across the road to a gay sex shop, where I struck up a conversation with the manager.
“Now, are customers buying sex toys in bulk, or less so since the recession?” I asked. 
“Oh, much less so. Sex toys are a luxury item, so we’ve had far less business. It’s the same with porn—why buy a DVD when you can download it for free online, like I do?” replied the sexually open manager.
I nodded sympathetically, and noted the details he gave me. Having uncovered the erotic-toy purchasing habits of the gay community in the area, I set out through the rest of Soho, armed with my fetish map. 
As I walked through the crowds of flamboyant males, I was somewhat self-conscious of my formal work attire (and gender), which marked me as a clear outsider. Customers in gay bars eyed me with bemused curiosity, but after a brief chat with the manager I was granted a seat amongst the regular clientele, and felt unusually safe as a lone girl at a pub.  My status as a reporter provided a credible reason for admittance, and it was exhilarating to infiltrate the generally closed-off community. 
I’ve never pondered the contents of gay fetish shops before, let alone yearned to enter, but once inside it was intriguing to explore such a foreign world. This was my first taste of the access a reporter’s badge can grant. True, it wasn’t quite as high profile as a fashionable gig or exclusive interview, but I thoroughly enjoyed my glimpse into the restricted areas of London’s gay district.

KAMPALA, Uganda — He is young, no older than 19.  “My name is Yoweri,” he declares, “like the president.” I learn this detail only after I’ve climbed on his motorcycle and weaved through traffic in silence for five minutes. 
Yoweri decides to strike up a conversation mid-swerve around a rotary, as he snakes by visibly frustrated drivers in rush-hour congestion who are forced to abide by traffic laws in their larger, relatively cumbersome, and decidedly safer vehicles. I respond through gritted teeth as I clutch my purse and hold onto the seat like my life depends on it, probably because it does.
Yoweri is a “boda boda” man, one of tens of thousands in Uganda. The term was christened in the small eastern town of Busia, which spills across the border with Kenya. Legend has it that the passenger bicycle operators used to call, “border, border” to communicate as they ferried their customers across. Over the years, the “boda boda” phenomenon has spread throughout the country as an independent and unregulated transit system. 
While “boda bodas” are ubiquitous up country, there they are often of the humbler bicycle variety. In the overcrowded capital, where virtually all operators cruise around on motorbikes, the passenger vehicle is an entirely different beast. 
For commuters, the “boda boda” ride is an indispensable daily ritual. But despite their utility, operators like Yoweri occupy a position among the most universally reviled inhabitants of the city center, hovering somewhere near corrupt politicians and prostitutes. 
In fact, when I first arrived in Kampala, a Ugandan friend gave me a tutorial on living here. The number one warning: beware the “boda boda.” She recounted harrowing tales of drive-by purse snatchings, gory hit-and-runs, and lecherous propositions. For many in the city, the term “boda boda” man suggests an attitude as much as a profession.
And the same tactics that render the “boda boda” the most convenient transit system in Kampala also make it the most dangerous. To wary city drivers such as my friend, “boda bodas” are rogue marauders careening around the congested traffic like an accident waiting to happen. And they do happen. Often. “Boda boda” crashes are the second leading cause of admission to the city’s main hospital, Mulago. 
So at first I avoided them. I found myself begrudgingly paying premium for special-hire taxis or taking hour-long hikes up Kampala’s unavoidable hills, while turning down dozens of “boda boda men,” who have a habit of driving up to every lone pedestrian and expectantly saying, “We go?”  “No,” I would say, “we don’t.”
But about a week into my time here the inevitable happened. I had a meeting across town and 10 minutes to get there. It was 8:30 a.m. and I knew it would take at least a half hour in traffic—there was only one choice.  I saw Yoweri driving by my apartment on a Yamaha and flagged him down. 
Soon enough, I became a regular customer. I’ve had a few drivers who see the sidewalk as an extension of the street and some who find the speed limit impossibly slow, but I’ve yet to meet the lewd thief I was so sternly warned about. Though I’m sure he exists, over two months I’ve met many more Yoweris, young and earnest men from up country, just trying to make a living in the city, and perhaps cutting a few corners in the process.

BELGRADE, Serbia — 
2:30pm: Outside Nikola Tesla Airport, cab drivers approach us in quick succession after I arrive with my boyfriend and his sister for a three-day trip to visit his friend from college. We've been warned to be wary of unmetered 'gypsy' cabs run by drivers eager to overcharge clueless tourists. My boyfriend tries to reason with one, insisting that his friend, a Belgrade native, assured us that a cab would cost no more than 1,500 dinars— nothing close to the 2,500 the cabbie has quoted. The driver retorts, "Well, why doesn't your friend pick you up then?"
2:45pm: We make our way upstairs to Arrivals and catch a metered cab that has just dropped off a passenger. After letting us out at our hotel, the driver advises, "Be careful with taxis" and hands us the business card of the company he is affiliated with.
3:32pm: We get dropped off in city center, where outdoor cafes crowd lengthy stretches of pedestrian streets. Our monstrously-sized hotel room exemplifies communist chic. If I could describe it in one word, that word would be "brown."
4:10pm: Late lunch in a cafe high above the ruins of the city fortress. The long-anticipated meal followed a substantial walk through the park that now occupies the formerly bustling community within the fortress. We stay for nearly three hours, snacking on the tastiest salads I've ever eaten. Serbian cuisine, which is all locally grown, is definitely the best part of the trip. I'll never be able to return to my genetically modified diet.
8:20pm: We meet friends of our host at a second cafe and discuss options for the evening. We're told that cafe and nightlife culture are defining characteristics of the city. Another characteristic I've noted? Extremely stylish restrooms.
10:35pm: Quick stop at a fast food joint that serves sandwiches, pizza, and baked goods. Definitely better than 7-Eleven.
11:41pm: We walk to the waterfront, where the Danube and Sava rivers converge, to meet friends at Cantina de Frida, the former home of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, located on a long strip of trendy lounges.
12:00am: The first drink of the evening. Vodka all around. While everyone else mixes their own cocktails, I chug a shot in two gulps. Much better to just get it over with.
1:14am: Tipsy for the first time in months, I decide that a cigarette is in order. Thus begins the chain smoking.
2:10am: Cantina de Frida now closed, we make our way across the river to a bar on a raft. Both sides of the waterfront are lined with floating clubs open until dawn.
2:38am: It appears that the cigarettes have run out. I'm slightly distraught until someone offers me a long, thin one. I tell her that an English nickname for these is "hooker sticks."
3:40am: The guys are uncertain about my ability to ingest yet another drink, but I assure them that my liver can handle a final shot. They order rakia, a mildly sweet regional liquor that tastes to me like fruit-flavored rubbing alcohol. We say cheers, turn up our wrists, and down the concoction, but I only make it halfway through before determining that my liver has, in fact, had enough for tonight.
3:53am: Now well-lubricated and still chain smoking, I engage in a conversation with the only two patrons on the raft who are not members of our group. The man claims to be a magician, the woman a novelist, and they have been lifelong friends. They'd like to invite all of us over to their place, just to hang out.
3:57am: Someone informs them in Serbian that we are absolutely not going with them. My boyfriend's sister and I determine through drunken logic that they must be either cult members or swingers.
5:04am: More than ready for the furry comforter awaiting us at the hotel, I find myself instead dozing off on a sidewalk curb. One of our friends has just gotten a flat tire and a drunken five-man team is attempting to fix it. Even the pack of cigarettes I ingested over the past few hours isn't enough to keep me awake through this comedy.
5:47am: A cab ride later, we're finally back in the room. My boyfriend tosses me three bottles of water from the minibar and insists that I drink at least one lest I wake up with a hangover. I'm already happily horizontal on the questionable-looking bed, when he joins me and pulls my hips against his. It's already light out, but why not?
