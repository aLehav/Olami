“Most people’s lives are novels, but yours is a series of short stories” — or at least that’s how it seems for Oona Lockhart, the narrator of Margarita Montimore’s second novel “Oona Out of Order.” On New Year’s Eve, 1982 — which is also the day before Oona’s 19th birthday — Oona discovers something unimaginable. When the clock strikes midnight and the new year begins, instead of turning one year older she is catapulted into a different time, destined to live her life out of order. Although the premise seems gimmicky, “Oona Out of Order” is a delightful read full of surprises and thoughtful retrospection on the past four decades.
After her first leap, Oona is 19 at heart but 51 in body. All she has to go on is a note that 50-year-old (in body) Oona has left for her. It’s a bit on the nose, as a way to explain the situation, but the exposé also sets out an important rule: Although Oona could easily Google or ask about the fate of her friends, it’s best not to. In Oona’s letter to herself, she writes, “I won’t be able to protect you from all the bad surprises, but I don’t want to ruin the good ones for you, either.” For the first half of the book it’s easy to forget this rule — Oona herself does so many times — and scream in frustration that Oona didn’t listen to the warnings of her past, or future, selves. But the book holds true to the message of the older, wiser Oona: What’s the fun in life if you already know what’s going to happen?
With time travel comes various issues — Is it a multiverse? Can the past be changed? — but the novel eventually addresses these problems. Oona herself tries several times to change her past. It often doesn’t seem to work, but it’s refreshing to witness Oona and her mother, who is aware of Oona’s situation, try to figure out if time can be rewritten — and if so, what should be rewritten. Instead of providing a quick scientific answer, learning the rules of time travel proves to be a lesson on how to best live one’s life.
Above all, “Oona Out of Order” is simply fun to read. There are exciting twists coupled with reveals the reader knows are coming. There’s also something liberating about truly not knowing where the story will go next: Will she be 50 or 25? What year is it? At the beginning of each year, the reader learns about Oona’s current life along with Oona herself. It’s fascinating watching her learn to navigate Google, then be catapulted back into the early ‘90s. But at the heart of this story lie the deep human connections Oona forges despite her strange lifestyle. These relationships, with their ups and downs, are what will keep readers on the edge of their seat.
The novel has a few shortcomings, though these often get lost in the sheer enjoyment of the story. Given the premise of the novel, entire months of Oona’s life are often glossed over. The novel is told in yearly chunks for clarity, but sometimes entire months are reduced to sentences (“By June…. By July…”) that culminate into a laundry list of semi-important facts. And while the book’s dedication to reimagining different periods in time is admirable, the slang peppered throughout the dialogue will sometimes elicit a cringe. Ironically, perhaps the most cringe-worthy section for this is Oona’s 2015 year, where her younger assistant, Kenzie, uses phrases like “Hashtag truth,” which Oona inevitably also picks up.
“Oona Out of Order” is equal parts a light-hearted romp through the last 40 years and a thoughtful look at what makes life worth living. Sure, it relies pretty heavily on bizarre, unexplainable phenomena, but as older Oona might say, “It be like that sometimes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vanessa Wye believes she’s “not a victim because I’ve never wanted to be, and if I don’t want to be, then I’m not.” She doesn’t consider her relationship with her teacher, Mr. Strane, to be abusive, even though it began when she was 15 years old. In fact, she sees her affair with Strane to be the great love of her life, even 10 years later. When other students come forward accusing Strane of sexual harassment, Vanessa is left to confront her past. Even then, she resists the label of “victim.”
Kate Elizabeth Russell’s debut novel, “My Dark Vanessa,” is an uncomfortable book. Headlines describe it with words like “controversial” and “shocking.” It was originally chosen as a pick for Oprah’s Book Club, but the novel was dropped because the book club was wary of another controversy so soon after the one involving Jeanine Cummin’s “American Dirt.” Yet even without the backing by Oprah, it still became a best-seller.
Words like “controversial” and “shocking” don’t begin to describe the feelings this book brings up. There are gut-wrenchingly awful depictions of rape, made all the more horrific by their highly erotic descriptions given through Vanessa’s point of view. And while it is so apparent to the reader that Strane is a pedophile — a 42-year-old is asking his student, a minor, to dress in childish pajamas and to say, “I love you, Daddy,” infantilizing an already underage girl — Vanessa shies away from describing him as such. In fact, the word “pedophile” doesn’t appear until over 100 pages in, followed by Vanessa’s immediate insistence, “But no, that word isn’t right, never has been. It’s a cop-out, a lie in the way it’s wrong to call me a victim and nothing more. He was never so simple; neither was I.” It’s always difficult to read as a character processes trauma; it’s even harder watching Vanessa destroy herself by reliving it.
There are many ways to evaluate a book, one of which is to look at it as an object of art. It’s difficult to critically assess “My Dark Vanessa” because it is so deeply tied to such a heavy topic. To criticize the book feels too much like criticizing Vanessa, or anyone like her who may have had these experiences. But this may be due to the fact that the book offers little else. Often the minor characters feel flat, like pawns placed solely to take part in Vanessa’s story. It’s hard to imagine those characters having a life off the page. This one-dimensionality makes the book feel all the more oppressive, and it’s hard to decide if the effect is purposeful or a problem of writing fundamentals.
Perhaps the most salient part of this novel is its discussion of power. The book is riddled with the term. Of course, Strane has a great deal of power in this situation: He’s older, he’s the teacher, and early on in the relationship, his word means more than hers. But Vanessa comes to a realization: “I have power. Power to make it happen. Power over him.” She believes she has a hold over Strane since he’s risking his job to be with her. She could send him to jail. This is Vanessa’s main reason for not speaking out against him. If she claims victimhood, Vanessa believes she’s relinquishing all the power she believed she had. That, along with the fear that comes with speaking about her past (“But if someone doesn’t want to come forward and tell the world every bad thing that’s happened to her, then she’s what? Weak? Selfish?”), is enough to keep Vanessa silent.
“My Dark Vanessa” is a troubling book. It’s difficult to imagine recommending this to an acquaintance. There are scenes that are so upsetting it seems impossible that you’ll finish. And there are a few plot inconsistencies and characters that could use some fleshing out. After all of that, there come the uncomfortable questions: Does Vanessa enable Strane as an adult, helping him rehash his pedophilic fantasies? Does she hold power? Can a 15 year-old consent to a relationship with a much older teacher? The book doesn’t provide all the answers, leaving its reader with lingering questions that will haunt you for days.

For obvious reasons, the phrase “quarantine haircuts” has been trending on Google. With no exact timeline ahead, it seems like self-isolation might be the perfect time for a daring reinvention. So why waste precious time asking yourself if you should get bangs when you could consider any one of these more dramatic possibilities?
5. Colette’s Bob
A lot of people might mistake this for the bob Audrey Tautou sported in “Amélie,” but French Nobel-Prize novelist Colette did it first when she chopped off her long, brunette hair in order to embody the eponymous character of her debut novel, “Claudine à l'école.” To reach even greater levels of authenticity, consider perming and adding a fringe.
4. Naomi Campbell’s Curly Locks
Though she is known for her iconic glossy, long hair, supermodel Naomi Campbell has never looked more gorgeous than when she embraced her natural texture and coiffed her curls into a short, bouncy style at the 2019 Vanity Fair Oscar Party. Accurately replicating this look will require a little more than shears and a wide-toothed comb, as Campbell also sported beautiful caramel highlights, but one can only hope a razor and vivid imagination will do.
3. Zoe Kravitz’s Pixie
After wearing long braids for a number of years, Zoe Kravitz returned to one of her previous styles with a stylish, close-cropped pixie cut. A pixie cut might seem like a drastic change to try at home on yourself, but don’t let this frighten you. As long as you cut recklessly and somewhat evenly, you too can channel your inner gamine with this style.
2. Harry Styles’ Shag
Last year, I showed my hairdresser an image of British singer Harry Styles in 2015 as inspiration. After asking Fran to cut all my long hair off into this layered shag, I feared I had committed a “Fleabag”-esque mistake, since hair is everything. I cried for many hours, happy that I didn’t look like a pencil, but sad that I looked like a triangle. Since then, I’ve realized that this style is both effortless and easy to upkeep as long as you go heavy on the layering. To replicate at home, use bouts of extreme anxiety to chop off random sections: presto, layers.
1. Jane Fonda’s Mullet
Few political activists can set a trend like Jane Fonda. After speaking at an anti-Vietnam War event in 1970, Fonda was arrested at the Cleveland Airport on suspected drug smuggling charges. In her mugshot, her characteristically blonde lob has been traded in for a dark, uneven mullet that hairstylist Paul McGregor gave her when she desired something more punk. Though a haircut should never be mistaken for activism, you might want to give this one a try if you are looking for some edge.

We’ve all felt it. These past weeks have been a seemingly endless blur of Zoom meetings spent staring inexplicably into the void, wondering why we can’t stop watching TikToks, and somehow missing the taste of dining hall staples. Some days are bursts of productivity: We get started on that paper we’ve been putting off, grind out our problem sets, and attempt to pick up the same hobby for what feels like the sixth time. More often, however, we wander like zombies around the house in the same clothes we’ve worn nonstop for the past week (read: Definitely not our best). This jazz-adjacent playlist is for those days when we’re in need of something to break that rut and make us feel a little bit better about ourselves — and a little bit classier in our sweats.
“Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino” by Arctic Monkeys
We start the playlist with alt-rock icons Arctic Monkeys and the titular track off their newest album, “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.” The smooth track features frontman Alex Turner playing the part of an upscale hotel’s receptionist, inviting you to pamper yourself just like “Jesus in the day spa” or the “mama [who] got her hair done.” Turner is practically begging you to get up from your bed, take a shower, and change out of the outfit you’ve worn all quarantine. Matt Helders’s drumming is just funky enough to motivate you to do exactly that.
“In A Sentimental Mood” by Duke Ellington and John Coltrane
Once Turner’s avante-garde melody has inspired you to get out of bed, Duke Ellington and John Coltrane’s “In A Sentimental Mood” is the perfect song for a long, relaxing bath (or shower, if that’s more your speed). The lilting saxophone and soft piano melody blend beautifully together and create a sense of warmth and comfort as they engulf you in their swirling musicality.
“Cantaloupe Island” by Herbie Hancock
Herbie Hancock’s classic “Cantaloupe Island” is upbeat and perfectly jazzy, a great pick-me-up after you’ve been lulled into serenity by “Sentimental Mood.” The piano melody is fun and vibrant against an incessant drum beat that makes you want to get ready to seize the day, whether that means actually doing your school work or finally trying out that Zoom yoga class you’ve been eyeing.
“Moondance” by Van Morrison
This playlist would not be complete without Van Morrison’s “Moondance.” The song’s walking bassline alone is enough for it to merit a mention. Morrison’s jazz influence here is incredibly palpable, and “Moondance” gives you something fun to dance around to while you pretend you’re in a ’60s coffee house and not stuck indoors as you have been for the past month.
“Mine” by The 1975
The 1975 tried their hand at a jazzy track on their last album, “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships,” and it was surprisingly good. The light, jazz-inspired drumming paired with the melancholic piano and Matty Healy’s brooding vocals blend seamlessly with the song’s more modern elements, making the sultry track a beautiful addition to your classy quarantine.
“And I Like It” by Jefferson Airplane
Congratulations! You broke the rut! To celebrate: lie in bed, close your eyes, and listen to Jefferson Airplane take jazz, blues, and rock influence and mix them all up only to break them down into the monstrous and awe-inspiring “And I Like It.” That's it.

It’s impossible to argue that “Dear Evan Hansen” is bad. Outright rejecting the show that won the Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical, Best Original Score, and more would be too sacrilegious for any self-respecting musical theater devotee to bear. Dismissing countless rave reviews would diminish the credibility of arts criticism in general, which is probably a bad move for an art critic. But New York Times writer Charles Isherwood’s praise is telling: He commends the smash hit for its “haunting score… matched by a book of equal sensitivity.” He does not comment on the lyrics.
Undoubtedly, Steven Levenson’s brilliant book for the musical tells a unique and topical story. Evan is a lonely teenager struggling with mental illness. When he fakes a friendship with a suicide victim, his lies spiral into a wide-reaching social media movement of which he is the ambivalent star. Perhaps more importantly for the musical theater genre, the score, a product of the writing duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (of “Dogfight,” “The Greatest Showman,” and “La La Land” fame), pushes the story forward in every bar. The electrifying Act One finale “You Will Be Found” gets a special shout-out in Isherwood’s review, but even the less well-known songs are just as powerful. In the angst-ridden “Good for You,” for example, an urgent septenary meter reflects that Evan is running out of time to rectify a soon-to-be-broken relationship with his mother.
Still, lyrics are a central component of a well-crafted musical. Great canonical musicals, exemplified by the collaborations between composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist and book writer Oscar Hammerstein II, use the nexus between music and text to house character development, plot propulsion, and thematic exploration. One particularly appropriate example is “The Sound of Music,” a personal favorite. Some songs are moving: “Here you are, standing there, loving me / Whether or not you should / So somewhere in my youth or childhood / I must have done something good,” Maria gushes in “Something Good,” with Rodgers’ chromatic melody bringing a shadow of tentativeness to Hammerstein’s humbly beautiful words of affection. Some are funny, clever, and topical: In “Sixteen Going On Seventeen,” Rolf spends the entire song warning Liesl about the dangers of the title age before satirically justifying his expertise by explaining that he is “seventeen going on eighteen,” so she can trust him. Lofty echoes from winds and strings underscore the frivolity of the lyrical conversation. In all cases, music and lyrics work together toward a common goal, accomplishing more together than they could separately.
This is not the case, however, in “Dear Evan Hansen,” with lyrics also by Pasek and Paul. Their phenomenal score, which critic Steven Suskin has called “one of the strongest… in years,” is marred by lyrical platitudes, cliches, and conveniences. Admittedly, there are standout lines, such as in the chorus of the now iconic “Waving Through a Window.” The words “On the outside always looking in / Will I ever be more than I’ve always been? / ’Cause I’m tap, tap, tapping on the glass / I’m waving through a window” have become the poignant refrain of a generation of bullied youth, and are especially resonant in the era of coronavirus-based self-quarantine. Yet these words are followed by one of the least imaginative bridges in musical theater history, which simply repeats the line “When you’re fallen in a forest and there’s nobody around / Do you ever really crash or even make a sound?” four times. “Did I even make a sound?” is then sung twice for good measure before the orchestra reaches a rest at “Will I ever make a sound?” Quoting a particularly appropriate cliche — which this one is, since the musical opens shortly after Evan falls out of a tree — is inventive once, and acceptable twice. But four times (or eight, if you include the variations)? By the end of the sequence, the pleasant surprise of recognition fades, and the words fail to pack further emotional punches. They become mere vessels for the music as it builds in preparation for the sudden cutoff before the final chorus’s modulation, arguably detracting from the power of that musical contour. In short, the lyrics aren’t pulling their weight.
This trend continues throughout the musical, even in “Requiem,” which from its title alone is one of the most lexically interesting songs in the show. The content of the song, in which the suicide victim’s family members express nuanced feelings towards him and his death, is heartbreaking. The melody, meter, and orchestration are original and innovative. But monosyllabic rhymes like “right” / “white” and “through” / “true” / “knew” make the lyrics uncomplicated and predictable. More unique words like “remember” and “monster” are left hanging, depriving audiences of the satisfaction of rhyme, assonance, and/or consonance. Despite their evocativeness, the lyrics fail to keep audiences on the edges of their seats. They lack the ingenious intricacy which has defined musical theater from Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, and Alan Jay Lerner decades ago to William Finn, Lisa Kron, and Lin-Manuel Miranda today. They’re missing a spark.
“Dear Evan Hansen” holds a secure place in the musical theater canon. But its unconditional critical celebration paints an incomplete picture, glossing over the areas where musical theater has room to grow. Imagine how much more stirring — and how much more reflective of the musical theater tradition — Pasek and Paul’s score might have been if it were paired with lyrics in the vein of “Everything is balanced and serene / Like chaos never happens if it’s never seen” (“Welcome to Our House on Maple Avenue” from “Fun Home”) or “It’s time we just let this thing go / It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn’t it though?” (“Bad Idea” from “Waitress”). The almost universally positive reviews of “Dear Evan Hansen” sometimes make it seem like the musical to end all musicals. Once Pasek and Paul’s brand of powerful music joins forces with writing of a similar caliber, those reviews will have another thing coming.

{image id=1278945 align=center size=large caption="Cover art from Fiona Apple's "The Idler Wheel..."}
“This world is bullshit,” 20-year-old Fiona Apple famously said about the music industry in her acceptance speech at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. In the two and a half decades since she released her debut album, Apple has become a pop music legend despite rejecting celebrity culture and avoiding the spotlight.
In 1996, Apple skyrocketed to fame with “Tidal,” a nuanced record that paired sweeping instrumentals and percussion with searing, poetic lyrics. Apple, who was still in high school, caught the attention of the music industry with tracks like “Criminal” and “Shadowboxer” that spoke to deep pain, sadness, and anger — at mistreatment, at betrayal, at cyclical relationships. Then and now, the striking honesty of Apple’s lyrics can be traced back to her childhood practice of writing letters to her parents when they wouldn’t listen to her. “If I was making an argument, everybody thought I was... trying to manipulate them, so I could never have my side of the arguments heard," Apple told the Washington Post in 1999. "I'd go back into my room and I would write a letter and an hour later, I'd come out and read it — 'This is how I feel' — and I'd go back into my room.”
Apple’s well-reviewed sophomore album, “When the Pawn...,” again showcased her powerful ability to sing how she felt, even when it wasn’t pretty. “Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills — cause I know I’m a mess he don’t want to clean up,” she croons on “Paper Bag,” a wrenching ode to longing overlaid with catchy drums.
Apple has distinguished herself not just through her soul-baring lyricism but through her innovative use of percussion, which has become more and more prominent in her records over the course of her career. Where “Tidal” was awash in symphonic instrumentals, Apple’s third and fourth studio albums, the bright “Extraordinary Machine” and agonized “The Idler Wheel...,” combined punchy piano riffs and fast percussion to riveting effect. In the bizarre but intoxicating “Hot Knife,” Apple pulled poetry from a few simple phrases, artfully layering stripped-down vocals.
“Fetch the Bolt Cutters,” Apple’s long-awaited latest album, displays her hallmark strengths but, in an interesting turn, moves away from the raw anguish and slow-burn rage which characterized much of her previous discography, showing new closure and serenity. On this record, Apple looks back at her painful past from a distance, even sympathetically commiserating with her manipulative ex’s new partner on standout song “Newspaper.”
Ultimately, Apple’s career has defied the precepts of pop stardom — she’s openly rejected oversexualization and celebrity idolization and tried to stay out of the spotlight, leading to scorn from the media. The turmoil of Apple’s lyrics mirror her private struggles with the intense, scathing public scrutiny she faced in the wake of her early breakout. Media outlets first pigeonholed her as a waifish, unhinged girl genius, then as a crazy eccentric, attacking her for mental instability and flakiness. When she retreated from public view, she became known as a recluse and took yearslong breaks from touring or releasing music.
Through this, Apple has maintained a devoted and impressively multigenerational fan base, one which raised a social media storm when her most recent album was released. The flurry of tweets and memes illustrate that Apple’s unfiltered self-expression strikes a nerve with listeners, especially with women drawn to her message of feminist defiance.
Ultimately, as her latest release shows, Apple has remained a singular, commanding artistic voice. She continues to deliver unexpected, provocative music.

Jordan Peele, horror-movie and comedy extraordinaire, is returning to strike edge-of-your-seat fear and thought-provoking awe into the hearts of moviegoers nationwide. After the successes of “Get Out” and “Us,” Peele (as co-producer and writer) has partnered with rising-star director Nia DaCosta for the upcoming motion picture “Candyman.” The film figures to be somewhat of a departure from Peele’s first two hits: “Candyman” is a reinterpretation of the 1992 horror film of the same name. That iteration of “Candyman” drew criticism for its troublesome treatment of race. Now, almost 30 years later, DaCosta and Peele have set out to give their own telling of the story. While the coronavirus pandemic has postponed the film’s release to September, the “Candyman” trailer offers clues as to how this iteration will play out.
This debut trailer gives viewers much to digest in just over two minutes. It first lays out the basics: a refresher for those who know the original and background for those who do not. It opens as a man named Anthony (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), dressed in a red beanie and grey t-shirt, tells the ominous legend of Candyman: “If you say his name five times looking in the mirror, he appears in the reflection and kills you.” The trailer cuts to a group of schoolgirls repeating “Candyman” into the school-bathroom mirror. Nothing happens for a moment, and the teenagers breathe a sigh of relief. This feeling is premature, however, as a flourish of camera angles and chilling sounds follow. Afterwards, the only thing left is a makeup mirror, covered with blood and bees. In the edge of the mirror, we can barely make out the reflection of a figure with a bloodied yellow coat and a hook arm.
Suddenly, the trailer turns on its head and gives a glimpse into the undercurrents that drive the film. The setting, viewers learn, is Cabrini-Green: “It was a projects,” Anthony says. Anthony –– who is apparently a painter and photographer new to the area –– comes across an old church and compares it to an old, grainy photo. The church, once exposed dark brick, is now painted white –– a not-too-subtle visual signal that Cabrini-Green has been gentrified. The artist soon sees and hears about the dreaded Candyman, graffitied on walls and etched in the minds of older residents.
Anthony becomes obsessed with Candyman and creates an entire art exhibition devoted to the figure, full of paintings and mirrored exhibits. The trailer jumps around: Anthony dares visitors to say “Candyman,” and people oblige. One woman –– perhaps out of context, but presciently –– warns, “Don’t say that.”
What comes next isn’t clear –– it’s obvious, though, that things turn very bad. In the closed art exhibition, an invisible force with a man’s reflection drags, lifts, and attacks visitors. In the next cut, Anthony gazes into the mirror and gasps as he sees what can only be Candyman –– yellow coat, hook arm, bees, and all – staring back. “I brought him back,” Anthony professes. Soon, he exchanges the red beanie and t-shirt for a painter’s disheveled garb. Next, Anthony screams in seemingly mental agony. As a booming voice (presumably Candyman) proclaims, “I am the writing on the wall,” the trailer races through scenes with plenty of fear, death, and gore. The art museum, the local laundromat, the abandoned church –– it seems nothing is left untouched by Candyman. All the while, an ominous-sounding remix of “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child provides the pulsating soundtrack.
In the trailer’s final seconds, a young boy walks to a bathroom, only to find a body blocking the door. Peering nervously through a small gap in the door and into the bathroom mirror, he recoils at the sight of blood, bees, and a hook reaching around the bathtub curtain. Here, the trailer ends, leaving the viewer with plenty of unanswered questions. What is Candyman’s story? What does “I am the writing on the wall” imply? Why does Anthony see himself as Candyman in the mirror –– does it hold a literal and metaphorical meaning? Only by peering nervously at the screen will we find the answers. It’s clear that “Candyman” promises much more gore, thought-provoking commentary, and many more scares.
The “Candyman” trailer can be seen here.

“Survivor” is a game of elaborate, televised rituals.
One such ritual, known as the “loved ones visit,” occurs when six or so contestants remain. After 30 days of grueling challenges, chronic malnourishment, and demanding strategic play, “Survivor” flies out one loved one per player, usually a family member or spouse. Jeff Probst summons the visitors onto the beach one at a time from behind the trees. The clean loved one and the dirty, smelly player embrace, briefly, before the player (and occasionally the loved one) must compete in a challenge to win more time with each other. The winners traipse back to camp to enjoy a feast together. The losers get nothing; their loved ones wave goodbye and blow tear-stained kisses before disappearing back into the forest. Families across America are left verklempt.
The loved one’s visit is premised on a simple idea, one that Probst propagates freely in his pre-challenge banter: The mere experience of being held by someone who knows and loves you, of sharing a conversation with a person you can actually trust, is not just restorative but physically and emotionally energizing. It’s a reward that can sustain a player through the final nine days of the game, like peanut butter (an oft-referenced and highly treasured energy booster on “Survivor”) on steroids. It’s Day 30’s eleventh-hour savior.
So imagine the genuine surprise of “Survivor” devotees when, on April 15, they tuned into the 10th episode of this season — at which point ten players still remained — only to hear these words from Probst: “Even in a war like this, it’s important to lay down your weapons and remind yourselves what, and who, you’re playing for.” In came the loved ones, four weeks ahead of schedule.
The visible shock on the players’ faces, followed immediately by convulsive, joyful sobs and a fair bit of confusion, reflected my precise emotions. It was too early for this, I thought. The players weren’t truly exhausted yet, their emotional and physical resources insufficiently depleted. Not to mention, what would sustain them in the final days? Actual peanut butter?
Of course, the unusual visit fits the unusual season. “Survivor Season 40: Winners at War” is the first in show history to bring together a full cast of past winners. Each of these players has won the million; some have played the game two, three, even four times. They all owe their fame, desired or not, to “Survivor.” Some owe their entire careers, or formal lack thereof, to the show. But more importantly, “Survivor” owes them — their stars, the fan favorites who permit themselves to be sprinkled among seasons like viewership fairy dust — big time.
It felt cosmically fair, then, that CBS would fly out the players’ entire families for these most epic of competitors. Gaggles of young children poured out of the woods, some barely recognizing their parents and others running full-force into their arms. I couldn’t help but grimace at the thought of these kids being dragged back towards the waiting Fiji Airlines jet when their beleaguered parent inevitably lost the challenge.
But in an unprecedented first, there was no challenge. The players and their spouses and kids were sent back to camp to eat and be merry in one giant reality/“Survivor” crossover cookout. This is all not to mention the simultaneous loved ones’ visit to the castaways on the Edge of Extinction, a second beach where the very famous and popular players who have already been voted out are fiddling away the hours in televised purgatory rather than their homes. There — in a particularly heartwarming moment — Amber and “Boston” Rob Mariano, who met 20 years ago on “Survivor,” embraced their four children under the merciful auspices of the maniacal show that brought them together in the first place.
The resulting episode — a maximalist waterworks show covering a whopping 19 different family visits at once — wasn’t good, per se. There was little of the dramatic momentum that catapults the best episodes towards Tribal Council. Fully half of the episode was plotless — a sort of stylized Bring-Your-Kids-To-Work Day for “Survivor”’s royal families — filled with shots of cute kids frolicking in the Fijian waters. As such, all of the gameplay was squeezed, tepidly, into the back half of the hour.
But none of that mattered.
Much like the existence of the Edge of Extinction, the post-filming press junkets have indicated that the full-family loved ones’ visit was an important condition of return for some winners. “Survivor” wanted them back; they came, but with stipulations.
Herein lies the evolution of the twisted, loving push and pull between the game and its players. Imagine any “Survivor” contestant in the show’s first 10 years making public demands in exchange for their return. The show controlled them; it would have been inconceivable. Even today, the producers are the gods. Once on the island, players can do nothing but adapt to whatever’s thrown at them.
Yet in this episode, with its early and aggressively generous loved ones’ visit, “Survivor” bowed to gods of its own creation — literal totemic deities, even — as they finally dictated their own rituals.
These are the people’s gods. Nothing is more thrilling to us, the viewers, than an increasing sense of collective control over the game. It’s less a power struggle than a strong-willed crew of fans, players, and producers growing together into a real “Survivor” family where we get the kids on weekends.
I enjoyed every minute of this episode, melodramatic as it was. It might have had a little something extra to do with the sight of loved ones, kept far apart for an extended period of time, finally getting to hug and kiss each other again.
There’s no way the show could have predicted that this episode would strike a painfully relevant chord today, as many of us pine for a loved one’s visit of our own. And yet — with “Survivor”— anything’s possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Switching my 120 students in Gov 1005 from the lovely Tsai Auditorium to creepy Zoom has been a pedagogical challenge. Is my virtual course as good as it was in person? No. But, after six weeks, I have learned how to make it not suck too much. Those lessons may be helpful to graduation planners.
The secret to a successful virtual commencement ceremony is the extensive use of small groups. The more time students (and families) spend talking and connecting, the better their experience will be. The more time that they spend passively listening, the worse.
First, each undergraduate House should have its own Zoom session, and within that session, 20 or so breakout rooms for its seniors, ranging in size from 4 to 10 graduates. Students will spend most of the ceremony in these senior rooms, chatting and reminiscing with their closest friends. Creating these rooms will require collaboration between house staff and the students themselves. Everyone needs to go somewhere; no one spends graduation alone. Yet neither is any group allowed to be so big that conversation is difficult. The natural starting place is rooming groups, but adjustments around the edges will be necessary.
The students in each senior room will submit a list of visitors they would welcome: anyone who has touched their lives at Harvard. Who wouldn’t want a chance to say goodbye to a friendly professor, to share one last laugh with a beloved tutor? You can be sure that every Harvard coach would love to swing by and say hello to their players. Most thesis advisers would be pleased to be invited and happy to visit. Faculty deans will probably do their best to visit all senior rooms in the House, as will many tutors. Indeed, the one big advantage of a virtual ceremony is that, with planning, it makes it easier for seniors to see many of the faculty and staff who mattered most to them.
Second, each house should have a family room counterpart for each senior room. Parents also need a place to celebrate. Many of them may already know each other, and all will be happy to talk, reveling in their joint membership in that most desirable of clubs: Harvard parents. When I teach on Zoom, like a maître d' at a fancy restaurant taking a tour of the tables, I try to visit as many of my breakout rooms each class as I can; good faculty deans will want to do the same with the family rooms, saying a few words to each group. The best faculty deans will have a funny story to tell about a student or two from each group. Personal attention makes for a memorable and meaningful experience.
Third, we need 50 or so activity rooms. These are separate Zoom sessions, one for each student extracurricular. Each sports team should have one, as well as most student organizations. Toward the end of the ceremony, these rooms will be filled with graduating members of these student groups who want to spend a moment together, even though they live in different houses. Families might join them. These organizations could also produce content — video highlights, photomontages — which chronicle their time together, their four years at Harvard.
Fourth, to unite these three different tiers of Zoom sessions, we need some common public channels. The main one, identical to the programming that Harvard has produced in past years, will have two hosts providing commentary and discussion. It will show the traditional three student speeches, the common awarding of degrees, and so on.
With this infrastructure in place, the College commencement schedule is simple:
10 a.m.: The main public channel starts broadcasting fun content: student-produced videos, a cappella groups, sports highlights, and student photos from the last four years. Then, the House Zooms open, where students are sent to their senior rooms to chat with their friends. (One big advantage of this, beyond building in time to get the technology working, is that students in senior rooms with missing participants will text those sleepy roommates and tell them to log on now!)
11:00 a.m.: The formal event begins with some digital equivalent of a student procession. Given Harvard’s global audience, 11:00 a.m. is the best start time. (Though apologies to Hawaii and New Zealand!) Then University President Lawrence S. Bacow will speak briefly. Everything on a screen is much more boring than it is in real life, so this speech must be short, perhaps no more than 15 minutes. Students can see this speech both on the main channel and in a shared screen via their House Zooms. After the speeches, students return to their senior rooms, where visitors come by to chat. This is the heart of graduation in the era of COVID-19. At the same time, families have a choice: hear a speech from someone on the main channel or go to the family rooms where they can talk amongst themselves.
12:00 p.m.: Students are brought back from their senior rooms into the House Zoom. A student from the house will give an amusing speech, and there will be main addresses from the faculty deans, after which students return to senior rooms. Again, this period, this private time with your closest friends and visits from those faculty/staff who know you best, is what makes the whole event work. More visitors come by.
12:30 p.m.: Graduating seniors can visit the activity rooms to reminisce with those outside their house, and may want to check in on the family rooms to see how their parents are faring.
1:00 p.m.: Commencement ends with final congratulations from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
This won’t be nearly as nice as the real thing. But, with luck, it won’t suck too much.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you ever pulled an all-nighter? Do you remember the next day, when a mental fog clouds up your brain and simple tasks get 10 times harder? What if you felt like that every day? Some people do.
In a 2017 experiment, researchers found that simply thinking about an expensive car repair bill significantly worsened the cognitive performance of low-income individuals. These same researchers also studied sugarcane farmers in India, who make the majority of their annual income all at once. At harvest time, the farmers quickly go from poor to relatively rich. The farmers performed much worse on cognitive tests before the harvest when poor than after, despite controlling for stress and other factors. The researchers concluded that poverty “imposes a cognitive load and impedes cognitive capacity” and that these effects are equivalent to losing roughly 13 IQ points — comparable to missing out on a full night of sleep.
This is an example of the scarcity mindset: a mental shift due to the perception of scarce resources. Our brains have limited bandwidth, so any attention afforded to one immediate problem cannot be used somewhere else. The scarcity mindset is not always a bad thing; it was once an evolutionary advantage. When early humans lacked essential resources like food and shelter, this mindset helped them focus on acquiring what was most important. Even today, it can help us concentrate on tasks in the face of deadlines.
But the scarcity mindset makes escaping poverty extremely difficult. You can’t invest in the future when your present needs are not met. Limited money and extreme focus on the short-term make it hard to plan ahead. It’s having to repeatedly buy cheap pairs of boots versus buying one expensive pair that will last your whole life. While it makes sense at the time to buy daily necessities like food rather than pay bills, putting off those tasks ends up costing more in the long run when you have to pay late fees. People are not poor because they make bad decisions; people remain poor because poverty inhibits their ability to make good decisions.
The effects of poverty and scarcity go beyond just the brain. The link between poverty and poor health is well-established, and to guarantee adequate healthcare to all Americans, we have to fix the economic conditions that make them prone to sickness in the first place. Chronic stress, often the result of constant financial worries, puts millions of Americans at increased risk for a litany of preventable illnesses like heart disease, depression, weight gain, and more.
Furthermore, kids who grow up in poverty suffer from the consequences their entire lives. Child poverty can impact brain development, which may lead to mood disorders such as depression and substance abuse later in life. In the United States, children in poverty have lower standardized test scores, are more likely to drop out of school, and are less likely to go to college.
And there’s an important — but hard to measure — effect on our communities too. When we feel that money and goods are scarce, we start to think of our neighbors and fellow citizens as competitors rather than teammates united by our shared humanity. When we believe that the economy is zero-sum, we also come to believe that helping another person comes at our own expense. Helping our fellow humans escape poverty, debt, and misery becomes a disservice to the wealthy, rather than an expression of compassion and justice at the foundation of a society of equally free and valued people.
As I argued in my previous column, the U.S is more than capable of establishing a universal basic income — a monthly payment to all citizens sufficient to meet their basic needs. This proposal could virtually eliminate poverty overnight and start shifting our collective mindset from one of scarcity to one of abundance. We have more than enough food, water, shelter, and other goods to meet everyone’s basic needs. Scarcity is dead — technology killed it decades ago. The scarcity that remains is a result of poor allocation of resources, not a lack of resources.
A recent basic income trial in Ontario, Canada, despite being shut down less than halfway into its three-year run, offers a thrilling peek at what we can achieve by rejecting our societal scarcity mindset. A vast majority of participants reported improved physical and mental health. Many quit or reduced their use of tobacco and alcohol. Not to mention more exercise, better diets, better jobs — over a quarter enrolled in school or training programs, and nearly half of respondents said they volunteered more often. People were able to spend more time with friends and family and on activities they enjoyed outside of work.
We must understand that investing in people is never a waste — not only do we have the resources to provide for everyone, but also we will get far more out of it than we put in. When more people are encouraged to learn and go to school, we all gain from a more educated society. When we cure the stress that results from financial insecurity, we will all be healthier. When we give people the ability to choose the work they do, our economy will be more productive and we will all be freer. If we choose to base our society around mutual trust and cooperation rather than competition, we will all be happier and less stressed.
Basic income can shift our society from a mindset of scarcity to a mindset of abundance. It recognizes that we are all human beings with a right to existence. It says that all citizens have inherent value. It reminds us that we do not have to compete — that there is enough to go around. And it encourages us to cooperate, to trust, and to build up our fellow Americans. It’s time for a society of cooperation, not competition. It’s time for universal basic income.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates studying the impact of COVID-19 on the internet have concluded that while the Internet has thus withstood additional pressures amid the pandemic, the long-term consequences of skyrocketing demand remain unclear.
Though the Internet has successfully handled increased usage, people working from home may still experience connectivity issues, Minlan Yu, an associate Computer Science professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, wrote in an email.
“We have a much higher volume of traffic (video calls, games, etc.) from a much broader set of places (homes instead of a few offices),” Yu wrote. “Fortunately, the Internet works just fine in that we do not see major large-scale outages due to the surge of usage.”
“However, people do experience network congestion at home too. We may not have enough bandwidth to carry all the traffic in the local network,” she added.
Yu added that she thinks the novel coronavirus pandemic will change the way people use the Internet, anticipating heavy traffic will persist.
“Before, we were worried that online meeting or large-scale video conferencing may not be as good as in-person meetings,” Yu wrote. “But if the Internet can sustain this growth of usage and give people good experiences online, then these behaviors will become permanent behaviors, which means we will see such large volumes of traffic after coronavirus as well.”
Harvard Business School student Daniel J. Park, who took Yu’s course Computer Science 145: “Networking at Scale” this spring, studied the impact of COVID-19 on cloud providers for a class project. He noted increased professional demand for applications such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, as well as an uptick in users watching Netflix or playing games online.
“The good thing for companies like Zoom or Netflix is that they’re running their applications on cloud providers, and they have elastic compute,” Park said. “That means if their systems detect an increase in usage, then they just automatically get that increasing capacity that they need without even having to ask for it. They are sort of protected from increases in demand, but then the work falls on the cloud providers.”
Park focused his research on three cloud providers: Google Cloud Platform; Amazon Web Services, which supports Zoom, Slack, and Netflix; and Microsoft Azure. These providers were able to handle the pandemic-induced demand surge smoothly because they had already prepared extra capacity for worst-case scenarios, according to Park.
He added, however, that he wonders how long these cloud providers can continue to handle this intense capacity strain.
“If something other than COVID happens, if something additional happens, we don’t know how prepared they are,” Park said. “They need to build more capacity, but this is not something that you can do overnight. Building a data center takes more than two or three years.”
Xiaojing “Annie” Yang ’14, another Business School student in Yu’s course, conducted research on wireless community networks and broadband connections in the United States. Coverage drops in traditionally underserved and rural areas have motivated study of novel ways to connect people to the Internet, according to Yang.
“One of the things that some communities are doing to address this is actually looking for alternative solutions, one of which is known as wireless community network,” Yang said. “The idea there is that you’re kind of doing what’s known as [peer-to-peer] network sharing, so pretty much sharing your Wi-Fi bandwidth with your neighbors.”
“There’s also other projects out there, like municipality Wi-Fi, that’s separate from wireless community network,” she added.
Yang said the differential impact of remote-work expectations underscores the infrastructure requirements that will need to be examined moving forward.
“I think this just highlights a little bit of what are already known to be problems, at least within the U.S. in terms of broadband capabilities,” Yang said.
James H. Waldo, a computer science professor at SEAS, wrote in an email that he has been most surprised by how well existing infrastructure — including his personal gadgetry — has scaled to meet present demands.
“I’ve run a physical cable from my home router to my office which is significantly more robust than wireless,” Waldo wrote. “But the network itself has survived, even with an increase in load that my local provider (Comcast) has publicly stated at around 350%. This for a technology that is about 50 years old.”

The City of Cambridge announced Thursday that a Small Business Advisory Committee will counsel local policymakers on their “Small Business Back to Business” plan — a guide for how the city can safely reopen businesses forced to close amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all nonessential Massachusetts businesses to close in late March in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. Many businesses have continued remote operation, with restaurants relying mostly on delivery and takeout.
The new committee will consist of eight members — including representatives from business associations across the city, such as Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson and Cambridge Chamber of Commerce President David P. Maher.
Members of the committee will also collaborate with staff from the City Manager’s Office; the Economic Development Division of the Community Development Department; the Public Health Department; the License Commission; and the Inspectional Services, Public Works, and Traffic, Parking, & Transportation departments.
“Cambridge’s economic recovery plan for small businesses is going to require input from a diverse array of business leaders,” Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a joint statement Thursday.
Over the past week, state governments across the country have begun making plans to reopen their economies. In the Commonwealth, Governor Baker has extended nonessential business closures to May 18, but his administration also announced a Reopening Advisory Board to create a timeline for restoring the economy. The Commonwealth has also joined a multi-state council, composed of several northeastern states, that will endorse a regional approach to reopening their economies safely as the pandemic continues.
Cambridge’s “Small Business Back to Business” plan will include policy recommendations from the committee, as well as from the Cambridge Public Health Department, the City’s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Panel, and the Commonwealth’s Reopening Advisory Board.
In addition to providing input on policy, the committee will help distribute information regarding resources and relief available to small businesses at the local, state, and federal levels.
“Through the work of the Committee, we will be able to adapt to a business environment that is constantly evolving due to COVID-19,” Siddiqui and DePasquale’s joint statement reads.

Researchers at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Georgia Tech have created an interactive online simulator to help policymakers better respond to the novel coronavirus.
After more than a month of development, the eight-member team released the simulator Friday. It features state and national projections of how different intervention scenarios would impact case counts, deaths, and healthcare capacity.
Project lead Jagpreet Chhatwal, a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School, said the biggest challenge the researchers faced was accounting for unknown variables — considerations that are becoming more apparent as the pandemic continues.
“We don’t know many factors, many variables, that will go in the model. So how do we really account for uncertainty? Many times, we had to change our approach,” he said. “Even going back from scratch and starting again as things are evolving.”
To create the simulator, the team relied on an SEIR model — an approach that depends on a system of differential equations to model shifts in susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. Özden O. Dalgıç, a mathematical developer on the team, said they incorporated additional statistical tools to project the future course of the pandemic.
The researchers also acknowledged that the model does not take into account other potential interventions, such as vaccines and increased testing capacity.
Though Chhatwal is unsure if the simulator has informed state policy decisions, he said his team presented preliminary data to Monica Bharel, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
HMS postdoctoral research fellow Peter C. Mueller, who previously worked with Chhatwal on a hepatitis C simulator, said small shifts in the timing of when policymakers impose or lift restrictions can have disproportionate effects on case counts.
Georgia, for example, reopened some businesses on Monday. Lifting restrictions over the next month, even gradually, could result in more than 23,000 deaths in the state, according to the simulator. Chhatwal and Dalgıç said their current model predicts that restrictions could be safely lifted by the end of June.
“This pandemic is just so contagious that every little subtle difference can make a huge impact,” Mueller said.
The team hopes to impart some of the most important takeaways from its research to the general public using the simulator, which has already garnered page views from all 50 states, according to Mueller.
“The two things that people should really learn from this is we weren't prepared enough to begin with, and we didn't act fast enough,” Mueller said.
Mueller said the team is considering a feature that shows what case counts would have been if restrictions were imposed sooner. Additionally, Dalgıç said, they plan to add the White House’s proposed phased reopening plan to the list of scenarios.
“Going forward, we're definitely gonna keep updating the data,” Mueller said. “Keep adding more projections.”

Huntington “Hunt” D. Lambert — former Dean of the Division of Continuing Education — said in an interview last week that he believes colleges’ smooth transition to virtual education is partially owed to Harvard Extension School’s years-long partnership with videoconferencing platform Zoom.
In March, the University transitioned all teaching online in light of the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Other institutions across the nation quickly followed suit, vacating their campuses and forcing millions of students to complete their coursework from home.
But even before the current pandemic struck, the Extension School — Harvard’s distance and nontraditional learning arm — offered over 200 courses per semester that met primarily on Zoom.
Lambert credits the quick nationwide transition to online learning partly to the Extension School’s innovation in virtual teaching and learning.
“Because the features were there and because the methodologies were now widely known — we have been presenting them for three, four years at all the major online and technology education conferences — I think Harvard actually really accelerated the ability of people to adopt it,” Lambert said.
Lambert — who came to Harvard after serving as the administrator of Colorado State University’s online program — said he began his work as dean in 2013 with a guiding vision for expanding online offerings.
“The question that HES faced as we went online was not how do we go online, but how do we make Harvard accessible to people who cannot come to campus but can do Harvard rigor of work?” Lambert said. “Let’s extend Harvard to them.”
Lambert said as dean, he sought to mirror the distinctive character of a traditional Harvard education for Extension School students learning online.
“Harvard is about personal relationships, lots of discussion, and ways for people to have lots of contact points,” he said. “We started working on technologies that would allow us to make the classroom available to these people in a highly interactive way.”
Lambert then worked with then-Chief Innovation Officer of DCE, Henry H. Leitner, to find an online platform that could accommodate those goals, he said. Since Lambert’s retirement last year, Leitner has served as DCE’s interim dean.
About four years ago, Leitner’s team approached Zoom — a fledgling company at the time — hoping to collaborate on features conducive to an intimate and interactive online learning experience, according to Lambert. The partnership brought lower costs for Harvard and a significantly enhanced platform for students.
Lambert said the Extension School was the only major online academic institution to work with Zoom for about two to three years. During that time, Harvard and Zoom continued to work together on improvements for the platform.
“One of the things we had Zoom do was build an LTI interface into Canvas, so the way to our Zoom classes is through Canvas,” Lambert said, referring to an online course-management site accessible to professors and their students.
Zoom, he added, was “highly secure” because it was built within Harvard’s online security apparatus.
Under his leadership, Lambert said, a key focus of the Extension School was developing teaching strategies for Zoom, as well as sharing this knowledge with peer institutions.
“Our digital teaching and learning group documented all the methodologies, and actually put it online with training courses,” Lambert said. “And over the last four years or so, we’ve been hosting one or two university delegations every month, teaching them everything we know so they can copy us.”
Lambert said that he hopes the experience of using online education during the current pandemic demonstrates the potential for online education to complement traditional in-person classes.
“The argument of one or the other is a false dichotomy,” Lambert said. “The issue is what learner is at what stage in their life, and how can they succeed in the learning they need for their personal and professional success.”

Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui spoke about the challenges of leading through a crisis — as well as the “supportive” response of the City of Cambridge — in a virtual forum at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics Thursday.
Moderated by Belfer Center Executive Director Aditi Kumar, the event concluded the IOP’s Fast Forums series, a virtual continuation of its usual JFK Jr. Forum programming; other recent events featured former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and activist LaTosha Brown.
During the forum, Siddiqui said partnerships with Cambridge’s biotechnology industry have been important to addressing the outbreak in the city. Biogen and Takeda — biotech companies based in Cambridge — donated $1 million and $2 million, respectively, to the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund.
The fund, which currently totals more than $3.6 million, provides emergency assistance to individuals, families, and small businesses in Cambridge who are experiencing financial hardship amid the pandemic.
Siddiqui added that research conducted by biotech companies also has the potential to benefit people outside of Cambridge.
“Some of these companies are actually doing a lot of COVID-19 related work that's not going to only help Cambridge, but hopefully the rest of the world,” she said.
Moderna, a Cambridge-based biotech company that focuses on mRNA in drug discovery and development, is working on a potential vaccine against the coronavirus. The Broad Institute — which previously partnered with the city’s health department to test all residents and workers in Cambridge nursing homes — is currently developing new diagnostic approaches that could augment the scale of coronavirus testing.
Small businesses in Cambridge have been hit hard due to coronavirus-driven shutdowns, especially around Harvard Square, where business after business would “shutter even before COVID-19,” according to moderator Kumar.
When asked how the city is supporting those local businesses, Siddiqui cited multiple grant programs and a newly developed small business advisory group that would help with planning and reopening. However, she said these resources are “simply not enough.”
“How do we make it as easy as possible for these businesses to come back?” Siddiqui said. “It’s something that we are thinking about, and we have to be really nimble and flexible if we want our mainstream back.”
During the audience question-and-answer portion of the event, Siddiqui spoke about the plethora of resources available in Cambridge compared to other cities that makes it “almost easier” to do her job.
“We need Chromebooks. We need hotspots. We got everything ordered. We got immediate emergency meals plan in place — there's these things that we've been able to do very quickly,” she said. “I think it's all in the caveat of Cambridge is a very well-resourced city, so we have it much easier than our gateway cities.”

Economics Professor Melissa L. Dell ’05 was named the recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal for her research on the role of institutions in economic development.
The Clark Medal — awarded annually by the American Economic Association — recognizes an American economist under the age of 40 “who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.” According to the AEA’s website, several previous winners have gone on to become Nobel Laureates.
In a press release announcing this year’s award, the AEA described Dell as giving “a new energy and direction to the entire field of political economy and development.” Dell has conducted research on the long-lasting effects of institutions, conflicts, and historical economic conditions on modern economic development, primarily in countries across Latin America and Southeast Asia.
“Through her pioneering careful and creative data collection and empirical work, Melissa Dell has advanced our understanding of the role state and other institutions play in the daily lives of and economic outcomes of ordinary people,” the press release reads.
Jeremy C. Stein, chair of the Economics department, said he admires Dell’s work to shed light on institutional differences within countries, which had previously been examined primarily through the lens of cross-national studies.
“She gets very deep into the details, and then manages to pull that together and bring a lot of data to bear,” Stein said.
Economics Professor Michael R. Kremer ’85, whose Nobel prize-winning work also focuses on development, concurred that Dell’s research has uncovered a flurry of important insights in the field.
“Her work focuses on economic history and she spends the time to really understand the history,” Kremer said. “Using that knowledge of history, she finds ways to convincingly estimate the impact of particular institutions or of particular insights.”
“She also demonstrates the pathways involved were much more complex than sometimes assumed,” he added.
Stein added that Dell’s selection as the 2020 Clark Medalist is indicative of her overall intellectual prowess.
“She is just absolutely brilliant, incredibly creative, and very broad-ranging in the kind of work that she does,” Stein said. “And I think it’s just inspiring for the students.”
Dell — who graduated summa cum laude from the College with a degree in Economics — has amassed several other honors for her work in the past few years, including being named by The Economist one of the decade’s top eight young economists in 2018.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, Dell said she was excited not only for the personal recognition, but also for the attention the award brings to the field of development economics in turn.
“This recognition shows that people are interested more broadly in the sorts of questions that we study in the political economy of development,” Dell said. “I think it’s really exciting for the field and for the sorts of questions that we think are really important.”
Dell’s recognition comes on the heels of Kremer’s receipt of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences last fall.
“It has been a pretty good year for development economics at Harvard,” Stein said of the pair of prizes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An international research team that includes two Harvard professors has determined that the Spinosaurus is the first known swimming dinosaur, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.
Study co-authors Stephanie E. Pierce and George V. Lauder ’76 — professors in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology — constructed a plastic two-dimensional model of a Spinosaurus tail and tested its swimming ability against that of other species’ model tails, including other dinosaurs and crocodiles. Their experimental findings were consistent with the concept of a water-dwelling dinosaur.
Lead author and University of Detroit Mercy professor Nizar Ibrahim has been studying a Spinosaurus aegyptiacus fossil since 2014. After analyzing its anatomical structure, the team only had circumstantial evidence pointing to an aquatic lifestyle.
Persevering through sandstorms, flooding, and close encounters with snakes, his team returned to the fossil’s Saharan dig site over years to unearth a near-complete Spinosaurus tail, Ibrahim said.
“We realized the tail was actually utterly unique,” Ibrahim said. “We’ve never seen anything like this in another dinosaur.”
In 2019, Ibrahim contacted Pierce and Lauder to run an experimental analysis of the tail in a water flume — an artificial chute of water.
After testing, Lauder — who works with biomechanical hydrodynamics and fish robots — concluded that the tail must have been used for swimming.
“The tail of Spinosaurus is an aquatic propulsive structure,” Lauder said. “Crocodiles use a big flat tail to swim in the water. That’s really what this was like, but on a huge dinosaur.”
The lengthy pad-like tail is befitting of the 30- to 40-foot-long creature. At its most aquatic, the Spinosaurus — along with many other dinosaurs — was once thought to only wade in water. There were previously no water-dwelling dinosaurs in the fossil record.
Ibrahim commented on how the past scientific consensus was that dinosaurs were exclusively land animals.
“They’re basically firmly grounded in the terrestrial world,” he said. “It became like a dogma. You can see this in every children’s dinosaur book. They’ll tell you dinosaurs are land-dwelling animals.”
“It just really opened our mind, I think, to the tremendous diversity of dinosaurs that now appears to be much greater than we thought before,” Lauder added.
Lauder said the next research step is to pursue a three-dimensional tail model to get a better sense of the dinosaur’s hydrodynamics. For Ibrahim, he said he hopes museum collections will reevaluate unusual specimens for potential aquatic characteristics, now that the dam has broken on swimming dinosaurs.
The paper, published on Wednesday, has already stirred considerable online discussion.
“I think it broke the internet yesterday,” Pierce said in a Thursday interview. “The top four papers [on Nature] are Spinosaurus and three COVID-19 papers,” Pierce said.
The spinosaurus study has garnered a Twitter following. #Spinosaurus was one of the top trending hashtags, “up there with Elon Musk and COVID-19,” according to Ibrahim.
“I’m choking up, I can’t put it into words,” Ibrahim added. “If people are using hashtag Spinosaurus instead of hashtag insert-name-of-celebrity, great news to me.”

R. Martin Chávez ’85 and Beth Y. Karlan ’78 will serve as the Board of Overseers’ President and Vice Chair of the Executive Committee for the 2020-2021 academic year, the University announced in a press release Friday.
Both Chávez and Karlan were elected to the Board in 2015; they will serve in its top leadership positions for the end of their six year terms.
The Board of Overseers — Harvard's second highest governing body — is charged with advising the University’s top administrators, providing counsel on the University’s direction, and authorizing certain actions taken by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
The Board was previously led by Michael Brown ’83, the co-founder, former chief operating executive, and now senior adviser of the public service organization City Year, and Lesley Friedman Rosenthal ’86, the chief operating officer and corporate secretary of The Juilliard School.
In the release, University President Lawrence S. Bacow called Chávez and Karlan “widely admired leaders” and “deeply dedicated alumni.”
“Marty’s expertise in technology and finance, and Beth’s expertise in biomedical research and health care promise to serve Harvard especially well in these challenging times,” he said. “We are fortunate to have two such experienced and devoted Harvard citizens to lead the board. I look forward to working even more closely with both of them during the next academic year.”
Chávez studied biochemical sciences at the College while concurrently earning a masters degree in computer science, and went on to study medical information science at Stanford. He is currently a member of the Stanford Medicine Board of Fellows, the board of trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study, and the board of directors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
On the Board of Overseers, Chávez leads the standing committee on finance, administration, and management.
“It is an immense honor to be elected president of the Board of Overseers,” Chávez said in the press release. “Under the extraordinary leadership of President Larry Bacow, and alongside the members of the governing boards, administration, faculty, students, and alumni, I will do my part to guide the University through and beyond this most challenging time.”
Karlan, who graduated magna cum laude from the College, is also an alumna of Harvard Medical School. She previously served as the vice president of the Medical School’s Alumni Council and as chair of the Alumni Fund Committee.
A member of the faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles since 1989, Karlan is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.
Serving as an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, Karlan is a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board and leads the scientific advisory committee of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance.
As a member of the Board of Overseers, she leads the standing committee on natural and applied sciences.
Karlan said in the press release that she is “honored” to work with the University’s leadership.
“As a physician-scientist and caregiver, I bring my clinical experience and perspective to our discussions of strategies that support students’ personal transformation and promote their wellness — especially in the midst of this pandemic,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is launching an Emergency Support Initiative to provide funding opportunities and fellowship appointments for graduate students impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, GSAS Dean Emma Dench announced in an email to students Friday morning.
Under the Emergency Support Initiative, graduate students will be able to apply for lost-time funding, summer 2020 research awards, and visiting fellowships and postdoctoral writing fellowships.
The measures come after graduate students have repeatedly expressed concerns that the coronavirus crisis will negatively impact both their studies and their entry onto the job market. When the University switched to online learning, Harvard’s graduate student union and the GSAS Graduate Student Council advocated for a fully-funded “COVID-19 bridge year” to compensate students for disruptions to their research projects in light of the outbreak.
They also asked GSAS to provide accommodations for students currently on a dissertation completion fellowship, a guaranteed year of University funding to support Ph.D. students writing their dissertations.
The GSAS Emergency Support Initiative will allow graduate students to apply for a year of “lost-time funding,” prioritizing students whose completion of their dissertation completion fellowships has been delayed due to the pandemic.
GSAS first focused on addressing “personal safety” and “emergency needs” in light of the outbreak before developing the support program, according to Dench.
“Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, GSAS has heard directly from students and their advocates, including faculty and directors of graduate studies, about the many ways this public health emergency is affecting PhD students,” Dench wrote. “In the coming weeks, we will continue working with our University partners to augment and expand this program.”
The initiative also attempts to address graduate students’ concerns about the scarcity of job opportunities in academia amid the COVID-19 crisis. In light of the pandemic’s financial toll, many universities — including Harvard — have announced hiring freezes. Harvard also suspended some searches for its College Fellows program.
In response to those issues, GSAS will now allow students planning to graduate in May or November 2020 who do not have a job lined up to apply for a one-year visiting fellow appointment, granting them research opportunities, waived tuition, and University health insurance as they continue their job search. GSAS will also create ten one-year postdoctoral and writing fellowships over the next two years.

We’re all going to come out of this socially awkward and in tie dye sweat suits — do you really want to throw bad DIY bangs into the mix? For those moments when scissors become tantalizing, and you keep telling yourself that “hair grows back,” here are a few alternative makeovers to try instead.
Change Your Linkedin Headshot
Maybe you don’t actually need to change your style — you just want everyone to think you look like a young professional bound for Goldman. Give your whole resume a makeover while you’re at it, because you probably don’t need the lawn mowing business you started at age 11 to be the first thing all those recruiters see.
Stop Wearing Your Retainer
You can’t sneak out to go to parties, can’t wear an outfit that would get you dress coded, and can’t tell your dad that playing basketball is “Your dream, Dad,” so find a new way to rebel: Don’t wear your crusty old retainer for a few days. See what happens. Maybe you’ll get a fabulous new smile, or maybe you’ll just waste all the money you spent on orthodontia and all those years you spent with a mouth full of metal. But at least you’ll be a rebel.
Draw All Over Your Arms and Legs
Tattoos are like bangs: best left either to a professional artist or an indie girl with soothing vibes to do. The low-budget version of getting a really cool tattoo is to draw on yourself with a (nontoxic) marker. Bonus if you accidentally stain your entire tub trying to wash your DIY tattoos off. Double bonus if your mom tells you you’ll get a skin condition.
Shave Your Eyebrows
Sure, eyebrows are cool, but what’s even cooler is no eyebrows. Shave ‘em off. See what happens. After all, you’re not going to see anybody for the foreseeable future. What do you really have to lose?
Feel like that dorky girl turned bombshell from every 90’s teen movie yet? You look great. So in order to avoid any America’s-Next-Top-Model-Makeover-Week-level catastrophes, maybe leave the bangs cutting to the professionals. And if you must cut, cut up, not sideways.

Chances are you’re currently stuck in your childhood bedroom, surrounded by the same four walls of your youth. Since we're all reverting back to our teenage selves, let's take some time to re-examine some of our favorite Young Adult storylines in the context of the times!
Harry Potter
This one is a classic. After all, everyone says Harvard is basically Hogwarts, right? You come in as an eager first-year, excited to eat in the Great Annenberg Hall and be sorted into the best House. For a modern day twist, though, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named comes in the form of Miss Rona: healthcare workers and emergency responders are undoubtedly the Aurors, saving the world. Be sure to learn those important spells like Sanitizium and Stayinside-dumbassicus to keep Miss Rona at bay!
Divergent
One world, five factions: Economics is Dauntless (The Brave), Psychology is Amity (The Kind), CS is Erudite (The Intelligent), Pre-Med is Abnegation (The Selfless), and Social Studies is Candor (The Honest). But those who are Divergent are the most fearsome of all — the joint concentrators. As a dystopian Harvard bubble traps you into figuring out your concentration as quickly as possible, a global pandemic suddenly threatens to upend this carefully structured world. With twists and tourists at every turn, will you be able to survive?
The Hunger Games
Only a select group of individuals are selected to compete in the Harvard Games each year, a coveted yet dreadful position to fill. Entertained, the Final Clubs of the Capitol sit back and watch the ensuing battle as the Tributes fight to the death over LinkedIn connections and internships. After years of refusing to acknowledge the dirty, treacherous history of the Harvard Games, a tragic uprising led by Miss Rona finally brings the cyclical tradition to a halt. Only time will tell if Panembridge will be able to rise from the ashes…
The Mortal Instruments
While you might think you’re a mundane at first, you soon realize your full Shadowhunter potential upon arriving at Harvard Yard. With training in Science Center Hall B, learning runes in the majestic Widener Library, and hunting Yale Downworlders, the Shadowhunter life feels too good to be true. Unfortunately, you soon learn that the evil Shadowhunters of the COVID-19 Circle are determined to destroy the world with their devastating plague. By returning to your Shadowhunter home country of Zoom-Idris, you must work with your Nephilim brethren to figure out how to take COVID-19 down once and for all.
While TikTok dances and banana bread recipes are valid forms of entertainment, why not embrace this period of mental regression and revisit those old YA favorites from your childhood? Stay safe, stay inside, and read a book or two! With everything going on, these dystopian stories are feeling a lot more relatable than they should…
