Names: Ashley K. Reynolds ’13 and Tim D. Reynolds
Concentration: Neurobiology
House: Dunster
Hometowns: Texas
Dating since: October 2011
Where you met: A church beach volleyball game
When you got engaged: January 2012
Most memorable date: On their first date, they talked outside of Crema for four hours. AKR: “We just got each other. We could totally be ourselves.” It helped that both are huge coffee fans.

Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Silly, chai, adventurous
What your friends would say about you: A softball player, Ashley missed her senior season because she was married. “We just heard a lot of people say your first year of marriage is so foundational, you really need to commit to getting to know how to live together.... It was hard not to play. I love the game. I love my teammates.”
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: Texas is the best country ever.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: They sleep in a twin-size bed, in their graduate student housing near Mather. They’re soon moving to a two-bedroom apartment in Watertown with a yard, a garage, and yes, a queen- or full-size bed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Boy Scouts of America finally ended their ban on gay youths joining the organization, though the position of adult members is still unclear. As the debate reaches a partial degree of closure, it is worth reflecting on the course such a controversial issue took.
While BSA leadership vacillated over the past years, the public debate over whether their ban was morally acceptable or constitutional carried on. The Supreme Court ruled in BSA v. Dale that constitutionally mandated Freedom of Association protected the BSA’s right to accept or reject people as they saw fit. The Crimson published a roundtable debate on the subject, asking whether such a decision was just.
Passing a moral judgment on a group in our free society is a potentially treacherous thing to do. Enforcing the views of the majority over the minority is precisely the kind of thing the United States tries to strictly limit, especially when it comes to highly sensitive social issues. But if legal reform is thus limited, how can change be effected? Often it seems, that the champions that rise for these causes are those with the loudest voices, and the most endorsements, and the money to bring it all the way to the Supreme Court. This characterizes the cumbersome, often ineffective response which has sadly become the norm.
Yet, while the debate raged on, there was one group that actually made a statement. Not by talk or media campaigns, but by the simple act of saying: “I want no part in this.” I am talking, of course, about the Eagle Scouts who returned their medals to the BSA, renouncing their claim to the title, in light of the organization’s prohibition against gay members. The act was small, but its impact enormous. Those Eagles have become the centerpiece for the movement for Scouting Equality, each of them honored by organizations like Scouts for Equality. Out of all the bluster of the media, these few who sacrificed something for their beliefs are the ones driving this movement. Beyond all the celebrity endorsements and petitions, court rulings and advertisements, the simple act of putting an end to involvement is what speaks most powerfully.
After all, it is our time, energy, and money—even our attention—that keeps organizations alive. Therefore, by removing ourselves, we can exhibit a powerful force over the behavior of large organizations. The institution of the boycott is nothing new, with the Montgomery Bus Boycott probably being the most famous example. Nevertheless, the actions of these Eagle Scouts have been overshadowed by the louder debate over legal action in the media.
While a media firestorm might help to raise awareness of an issue, nothing is going to upset the balance of power more than those willing to exercise their own right to free association. Because the power of an organization lies in the people it represents, the threat of a morally driven resignation has the potential to affect policy. Making a change is as easy as refusing your support.
So while it might be beneficial to keep the broader public debate alive, we might also advocate a change in focus in that debate. Rather than asking whether the BSA is permitted to carry on with its admissions policy, perhaps the time would be better spent asking if we want to support an institution that does discriminate based on sexual preference. The answer to the latter question is likely far easier to find than to the former.
At Harvard, we are exposed to a marketplace of ideas and outlooks that are alien to our own, and with that exposure comes an understanding of respect for those ideas, even if they might be quite contrary to our own point of view. However strongly we might disagree, it is rare for one student to morally condemn another for his views. All of this is contingent on the idea that, even if we disagree, there is nothing to say that I must follow the edict of another.
We can bring that sense of respect beyond the confines of the college experience and into the world at large. There will undoubtedly be things that offend our sensibilities, and even might be considered unjust, the BSA’s membership rules being a good example. But it is within our ability to bring an end to such offenses, not by loudly condemning them, but by firmly choosing a different path.

"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”
By quoting President James Madison, President Obama, for the first time since taking office, has suggested the possibility of an end to the War on Terror. This war, which dominated both Bush-era and Obama-era foreign policy, may not be finished yet, but President Obama—in a momentous speech on Friday—has made it clear that he intends to commit to reforms which will shift America away from perpetual war after a decade of international conflict.
We welcome President Obama’s announcement that the operations of the CIA’s morally hazardous drone program will be transferred to the Pentagon and that there will be tougher standards for when drone strikes can be authorized, with targeted killings being scaled back. Limiting drone strikes to active war zones is the first step to removing America from a state of continuous warfare, and it will do much to ameliorate America’s abysmal reputation in countries that are often subject to CIA drone strikes. Further, the government’s admission that four Americans were killed in CIA drone strikes is also a welcome moment of transparency from an administration currently beleaguered by transparency-related scandals.
Obama’s speech addressed many proposed reforms to the U.S. military and foreign policy, including the closing down of Guantanamo Bay and a renewed focus on the war against Al-Qaeda. But the announcements concerning the CIA’s drone program carried particular weight given the increasingly large role played by unmanned aerial vehicles in U.S. military operations.
It is clear that unmanned warfare is where the US military is headed, and we herald efforts made by the Obama administration to legitimate the military’s drone program by scaling back the extra-legal actions of the CIA. The United States currently operates 7,500 drones, which make up 40 percent of the Department of Defence Aircraft. The Air Force has been training more drone pilots than fighter and bomber pilots combined since 2009.
The CIA’s operation of merely 30 drones composes a fraction of the U.S.’ drone programs but is both constitutionally dubious and immensely damaging to the U.S.’ reputation abroad. Damning testimony from an American-Yemeni Ibrahim Mothana for the Senate Judiciary Committee in April revealed that support for Al-Qaeda had likely grown in Yemen because of the CIA’s targeted drone strikes and prompted calls for the U.S. to drop the CIA drone program (including from The Crimson). Thus we approve of Obama administration’s ability to reform military policy, having apparently recognized the unconstitutionality of the actions undertaken by the CIA’s drone program and the repercussions on America’s reputation abroad.
Although Obama’s much-anticipated speech may have been a political manoeuvre given the recent scandals which have plagued the administration, the president’s admission that the U.S. was complicit in the targeted killings of its own citizens is a welcome moment of transparency. However, it appears that Obama’s emphasis on the shift away from perpetual war by limiting drone strikes to active war zones is more than just a political manoeuvre. Rather, we commend the President for progressing from the inertia of out-dated, preventative war tactics of the Bush Doctrine and understanding that drone strikes in countries such as Yemen and Pakistan merely serve to aid Al-Qaeda and its affiliates rather than undermine them.
For the Americans of this generation, President Obama’s speech is a potential springboard into a future where war does not preoccupy our foreign policy or our worries. We hope that the president follows through on his rhetoric and makes legitimate reforms to the U.S.’ use of drones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I like to think that I received a fairly well rounded education prior to setting foot on Harvard’s campus. And with one main exception, I can do so with confidence. I may not choose to pursue a degree in English or in theoretical math, but I’ve been reading, writing, adding, and subtracting since kindergarten. I may not become a historian, but I know enough to understand the basics of the Great Depression or the Aztec Empire. And I definitely will not become a chemistry concentrator, but I can still comprehend the fundamentals of chemical bonding. Yet I use a computer every day and I barely know how to write a single line of code.
Sure, I could suffer through lengthy problem sets and stressful exams and walk away with a solid footing in computer science, proudly wearing a T-shirt proclaiming that “I took CS50.” But I didn’t have to wait until college to learn how to write a thesis statement or to learn what happened in the Revolutionary War. With technology so central to society, computer programming should be treated as a basic skill, just like math and writing, and should be part of any average grade school curriculum.
A new non-profit organization called Code.org that launched this January aspires to achieve just that. Their mission, to build a database of programming schools and to spread the word that programming is both easy and important to learn, is spot-on.
The benefits of an increased focus on computer science education are clear. Statistics show that there are more jobs available in computer science than there are workers to fill them, and these jobs are growing at above-average rates. Specifically, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a total of 746,500 new jobs to form in the computer and information technology field between 2010 and 2020. Yet a study by the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the number of students studying computer science actually decreased from 1990 to 2009.
With so many people struggling to find jobs at all, a shortage of workers available to fill positions that pay very well is a big deal. Simply increasing the number of computer science majors could actually go a long way toward advancing the future U.S. economy. Further, an increase in computer science education can help the U.S. protect its international standing. With more programmers, the U.S. won’t have to outsource as many programming jobs, and can remain a global leader in technology and innovation.
Yet programming skills are also useful for those who don’t want to pursue computer science as a career. Computer science is commonly seen as inaccessible, as an independent field exclusively for the nerdy and mathematically-minded (think Mark Zuckerberg). These misperceptions arise because computer science has only recently surged in importance. The current generation of professionals may not have grown up using the internet, and so don’t fully recognize the relevance of becoming technologically literate.
With technology only growing in importance, however, programming skills can pay off in almost any field. Business, medicine, and agriculture all use computers, spreadsheets, and robotics, and even a basic ability to communicate about the programming behind this technology can spark innovation and cooperation. Plus, computer programming is a valuable form of education purely in terms of the way it makes us think. Elementary school education is not professionally focused, but rather gives students the basic skills they need to live adult lives in the future. Computer science helps students think logically and develop critical thinking skills, and it gives them more knowledge about technology they will use all throughout their lives. In this way, programming is a basic skill, just like math and writing.
Perhaps the most important message to take away, however, is that computer programming is easier than we think it is. One thing in particular stands out after a quick look at the educational resources linked to by Code.org.
“Drag commands to move a robot. Age 4+.”
“Help a robot-arm solve puzzles. Age 8+.”
“Design a 3D game world. Age 8+.”
“Learn to program using Ruby. Age 12+.”
4-year-olds can learn this stuff. Sure, computer programming can get very advanced, as can any field. But we teach addition to students far too young to be calculating triple integrals, and there’s no reason we should see computer science any differently. If I’m 18 years old and I know nothing about a topic vital to almost every aspect of modern life, there’s something amiss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A character on TV’s “The Odd Couple” once explained his philosophy: “Find out what you like in life and drink it.” If a ban on serving large sodas in Cambridge restaurants that was proposed by Mayor Henrietta Davis is approved, this might become (though, my guess is, not appreciably) harder to do. Regardless, soda bans of this sort are misguided, paternalistic, and ultimately a little defeatist.
To start, it seems all too clear that they can’t be effective. Had it not been struck down, New York City’s 16-ounce maximum on sugary beverages might have induced buyers to opt for big Mountain Dews instead of really, really big ones. But policymakers had overlooked a relevant economic phenomenon—the refill. I can’t help but think of the Seinfeld episode in which a waitress tells Elaine that, while the restaurant can’t make her characteristic “big salad” (“We don’t have any big bowls”), she can bring her two small ones.
If Prohibition and The Wire taught us anything, it’s that the substance-dependent will go underground for a fix. But don’t expect a showdown between a modern Al Capone and Eliot Ness. The NYC regulation, which a judge ruled was “fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences,” would have exempted supermarkets and convenience stores. Ironically, that means the 7-Eleven Big Gulp in Sarah Palin’s defiant hand at CPAC would have been kosher. In other words, the proposed Cambridge ban would only force the particularly thirsty to go to supermarkets to buy their soda in bulk.
The soda ban is, of course, couched in the language of health promotion. While it’d be tempting to write off the health effects of soda as no different from those of bacon, Fritos, and Seinfeld reruns (mercifully, last I checked, still legal), evidence suggests that high fructose corn syrup may be particularly harmful, leading to more weight gain than the calorically equivalent amount of table sugar. Given that the monetary cost of the obesity epidemic means that even rail-thin folks pay for it in the form of higher taxes and premiums, a theoretical, robust ban—not the toothless kind discussed by the Cambridge City Council—could be defended on the grounds that it addresses a negative externality.
But even this simple chain of logic may be worth questioning. A recent review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that being slightly overweight was linked to a lower risk of death, suggesting that the negative impact of extra weight on health outcomes may be overstated.
Soda’s quantifiable ills aside, there may be more fundamental reasons for its vilification. I suspect that, with religion and traditional morality passé for a certain segment of society, almost arbitrary rules have arisen to assuage our anxiety over whether we’re leading righteous lives. Maybe skipping soda and eating locally sourced, non-GMO soy nuts are the new signs of justification in our city upon a hill.
Admittedly, puritanical discipline may improve health—but is a longer life really better if it’s gained through excessive asceticism?
Anti-soda crusaders seem to think so. Earlier this year, Coca-Cola unveiled its first “obesity aware” advertisement, acknowledging that sugary drinks are a major driver of obesity in America. Mark Bittman at the New York Times wrote: “It’s good that Coke…is beginning to apologize.” Jezebel, for its part, was scandalized: “Coca-Cola is attempting to appear caring and responsible. When all the corporation really cares about is cash.”
It’s true—Coke probably likes you for your money and not your sparkling personality. But Coke isn’t the problem. We don’t blame Chevrolet or Budweiser when there’s a drunken car accident or unplanned pregnancy. We kick ourselves for not putting on sunscreen when we get sunburns; we don’t demand that the sun resign. Asking others (people, companies, balls of hot plasma) to apologize for their existence illustrates a worrisome lack of confidence in personal responsibility and lack of respect for individual choice.
It may well be “bad” to drink soda. But a critical part of freedom is the freedom to make bad choices. A useful feature of reason is that it allows us not to. Given that Cambridge’s proposed soda ban will not be effective, it won’t constitute a major infringement on personal liberty. But it nonetheless does citizens a disservice, suggesting that they are incapable of exercising dominion over their lives.
Though Professor Nicholas A. Christakis might disagree, fat is not like the flu. It’s not contagious. The headaches caused by paternalism—now that’s another story.

Most memorable date: Just after Elizabeth returned from a semester abroad in the Czech Republic last fall, the couple went to a Build-a-Bear Workshop in Manhattan and made a teddy bear. They named it “Bliz”—a combination of their two names—and still have it at home.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Laughter, Jewish, “Bliz”
What your friends would say about you: Finally. And, usually, they say, “mazel tov.”
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: Our family had been a bit worried that we got married before graduating college, so we would tell them that we made it!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Names: Nicholas B. Waldo ’13 and Hannah M. Hostetler
Concentration: Engineering Sciences
House: Kirkland
Hometown: Juneau, Alaska
Dating since: Nov. 1, 2010
Where you met: September 2006, in high school. He took me to my freshman prom.
When you got engaged: Aug. 4, 2011, in Juneau
Most memorable date: Thanksgiving weekend, 2010.  I hadn’t seen him in 10 months, and we had been dating for one month, so over Thanksgiving, I flew from Seattle to here, and I spent four days here. It’s a four-hour plane ride, and I was just thinking, well, I can always change my plane ticket if it doesn’t work out. But it ended up working out.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Resilient, stubborn, loving
What your friends would say about you: Weird. When we’re in couple mode, we kind of have our own sense of humor. Never boring. I just ran an ultra marathon, and Nick climbs. Nick was there every step of the way. We’re dedicated but with a dysfunctional sense of humor.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: If there’s something that you really want, and it’s a lot of work, it can be worth a lot of work. In high school, we lived 90 miles apart. The only way to see each other was by flying or ferrying. That was why we initially didn’t start dating sooner. But you should never write anything off because it seems like a long shot.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: HMH: It was 2009. It was his senior year [of high school], and he was going to school here, and I was still in Alaska, and we were at a track meet. And I had a ring on my right hand, and Nick said something rude, and I went like this [slapping motion], and it gave him a bloody nose. He went inside and got Kleenex, and we went outside to talk. NBW:  The kiss didn’t happen until I was about to leave. HMH: But I had to punch him first.
In 15 minutes you are: I’m going to make him start packing his room, because that needs to get done.
In 15 years you are: Back in Alaska, working for the police department. We have one child or two and a German Shepherd husky.

Dating since: Fall 2011
Where you met: Kleber was bartending at Grafton Street, and I was a regular there, I guess, and we just met then. So romantic. Should we make up a really romantic story?
When you got married: We were married on Oct. 25, 2012. The ceremony was at Boston City Hall with just us, followed by a small reception with about 30 people at one of our favorite restaurants, Posto.
Most memorable date: There’s a restaurant in Boston called “Teatro.” That was our first actual date. We were supposed to go see a movie, but we ended up staying at dinner for five hours.

Names: Esther S. Wu ’13 and Matthew G. Tung ’12
Concentrations: Psychology, molecular and cellular biology
Houses: Winthrop, Dunster
Hometowns: Cincinnati, Ohio; Sharon, Mass.
Dating since: January 2011
Where you met: We were both serving in the prayer ministry for the Asian American Fellowship at the beginning of the 2010–2011 school year.
When you got engaged: Oct. 20, 2012: Widener Steps. He had set up a scavenger hunt, and each note had memories from our relationship.
Most memorable date: Our first official date was on Valentine’s Day in 2011. He got a Zipcar, and we drove down to Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea. That’s when he officially asked me to be his girlfriend.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Faith-centered, honest, solid
What your friends would say about you: Very close. We spend a lot of time together. We’re usually deep in discussion or lost in thought. We also almost always know where the other person is and what they’re up to. Our relationship is pretty cutesey and gushy, but that’s a very small portion of what we talk about.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: A lot of people can’t be a good boyfriend or a good girlfriend if they’re not given the opportunity to grow into being one. A relationship is really what you make of it. If you want a relationship to be easy, then it’s not going to mean very much. That’s just how it works.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: MGT: That jet-skiing time, but that is hard to describe in words. ESW: It was over J-term. We went on a cruise down to the Bahamas. We decided to go jet skiing. Matt drove first. It was fine. It wasn’t brilliant; it was very vanilla jet-skiing. You know, he is the rock of our relationship. Very solid. Next, we switched, but I couldn’t get the concept of slowing and easing down. Matt said he has never been more terrified in his life. MGT: She has trouble sticking to the beaten path, but it’s always very exciting and terrifying.
In 15 minutes you are: Getting Berryline!
In 15 years you are: Probably finally getting a paycheck! ESW: You’ll be a real doctor at that point, right? MGT: Yeah, and you’ll be just putting out your first paper as a psych researcher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the first-ever Convocation exercises in Harvard’s history, University President Drew G. Faust faced our class from her perch on the steps of Memorial Church and proclaimed, “Thirteen is a magical number. You are proof of that.” She was unquestionably correct. We’re amazing. But pinpointing, capturing, or defining precisely what makes our class so special is somewhat challenging.
What defines a class? Is it our cumulative array of interests, talents, and accomplishments? Is it the immense progress its members will make someday in the realms of science, medicine, education, or law? Is it the number of Last Seniors Standing? (We had 21 seniors attend every single bar, more than ten times the number in the Class of 2012. Not to brag or anything). Or is it the number of matches made through Match13? Probably not—though we do have at least 22 couples engaged or married in our class, which is more than three times as many as last year’s graduating class. Again, not to brag.
One way to try to capture the essence of the Class of 2013 is to revisit some of our most memorable shared experiences. These are the moments we’ll remember and reflect upon at reunions for years to come. We have selected four in particular that brought our class closer together in powerful ways.
The first is Convocation—the ceremony that opened our Harvard experience with such pomp and circumstance that we thought this inaugural event was a time-honored tradition. Remember the processions, the cheering PAFs, the completely arbitrary dorm divisions, the pride you suddenly took in being affiliated with Pennypacker or Stoughton or Lionel?  The wise words conferred by Reverend Peter J. Gomes? The chaos that was our class photo? Our whole, original class sat in the same place at the same time, thinking about the same things—how excited and scared we were to learn here and find our friends and make our mark. It was a moment like no other, and a nice parallel to the ceremony we’ll participate in on May 30.
In keeping with the theme of memorable moments in Tercentenary Theater, we also wanted to dredge up memories of the sopping 375th Anniversary celebration. Yo-Yo Ma was there. As was an enormous cake, what felt like four tons of cocoa beans from Taza, and tubs upon tubs of crimson-colored ice cream. We danced in the pouring rain on the technicolor stairs of a Gutenberg-Bible-housing library erected in 1915. We let the mud creep up our ankles and didn’t worry about psets and papers and summer plans. I think we all stopped at one point or another and looked up at the tower of Mem Church, which we walk by almost every day, thanking our lucky stars that we go to school at such a crazy, historic, beautiful, vaguely ridiculous place filled with incredible people.
The next set of memories are slightly more somber in tone. This year, our community was rocked by some truly unprecedented crises. In the past school year, the University shut down for the first time in decades, and it shut down several times: for a hurricane, a blizzard, and a terrorism scare. These episodes—particularly the tragedy at the Boston Marathon and its aftermath—were indescribably painful events that broke our hearts and tried our spirits. The only redeeming quality in any unthinkable tragedy is the sense of community, compassion, and support that inevitably emerges as part of the long recovery process. We gave standing ovations to our dining hall workers; we signed cards, designed T-shirts, and changed our profile pictures; we held vigils and shared hugs and reached out to friends in need. We helped keep Boston Strong. We never felt so connected to our House, our city, our class. And we continue to heal and grow together every day.
Finally, Senior Week. You lived it, you loved it, you could never do it again. How many times in your life have you lounged in the Quad with all your favorite friends listening to the Nostalgics, or partied on a boat surrounded by hundreds of familiar faces? When will you next get the chance to invade the biggest club in Boston and dance like you haven’t an obligation in the world? Or traverse Boston on foot inciting flash mobs, chasing squirrels, photographing MIT students, and walking like an elephant? Or file into the gorgeous Sanders Theatre, where you took notes during Justice or Ec 10 lectures three years ago, to attend a free performance by some of the most talented people you’ll ever meet? The only other time we’ve had this much freedom to socialize and have fun together is Freshman Week, and we didn’t know each other then. Now we do. And we’re pretty damn good at celebrating all that we’ve achieved and experienced as a class. Job well done, 2013.
It’s been an absolute pleasure to facilitate some of these moments of gratitude, reflection, unity, and celebration for you all this year—from the Champagne Brunch to Senior Bars to Senior Soiree. We could not be prouder to serve and represent the most magical class in Harvard’s history. We are so grateful and so excited—and a little sad that we won’t be making more shared memories like all of these as frequently after May 30. But hey, that’s what reunions are for, right? See you all in five years. And every five years after that. Congratulations, Class of 2013—you’ve got the magic in you!
With love,
Your 2013 Class Marshals
Julie R. Barzilay, Danny P. Bicknell, E.J. Blair, Nadia L. Farjood, Margot Leger, J. Arturo Villanueva, Nina M. Yancy, and Scott J. Yim

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three seniors who synthesized police software into a unified system to save time for law enforcement officers have won the 2013 President’s Challenge for social entrepreneurship, University President Drew G. Faust announced in a statement last week.
Team Nucleik, comprised of Scott E. Crouch ’13, Florian Mayr ’13, and Matthew N. Polega ’13, was awarded $70,000 to advance their fledgling company.
“In many ways winning the President’s Challenge is a vote of confidence for an up-and-coming venture tackling social issues,” Gordon S. Jones, director of the Harvard Innovation Lab, wrote in an email. “Nucleik’s online platform can have a huge impact in supporting law enforcement officers as they fight crime.”
The Challenge, sponsored by the Harvard i-lab, was launched by Faust in February 2012 with the purpose of helping “students develop and execute solutions to complex systemic problems by attacking and addressing truly important issues facing the world today,” according to the contest’s webpage.
Polega said that Nucleik will use the prize money to pay rent, living expenses, and hardware and software costs.
“[The prize] is definitely going to help out in a huge way,” he said.
Nucleik software has already reduced the time police spend on paperwork by 90 percent in Springfield, Massachusetts, where it is in use by the state police’s Special Projects Team. Crouch, who has deferred admission to Harvard Business School to focus on the social venture, said he foresees deploying the software in other cities and expects the team to expand to 10-15 people over the next year.
All three co-founders will work on the project full-time after graduation, according to Polega.
A total of 127 teams entered the Challenge, with focuses ranging from the arts to disaster preparation and relief.
“A really fun part of the Challenge was getting to meet other people doing similar types of things,” said Eric D. Kelsic, a Ph.D candidate in the Harvard Systems Biology Department and member of runner-up team Flume. “All the projects were very exciting to hear about.”
Teammate Ben S. Kuhn ’15 said that Flume aims “to collect all [biological] databases in one place...to make an up-to-date, easy-to-visualize map of everything we know about how the human genome works.”
“I’m very excited to be working on a startup that is trying to accomplish something useful for humanity at large,” he said.
The two other runner-up teams, each of which received $10,000, were Team PlenOptika, which produced a low-cost handheld device for prescribing eyeglasses in remote or low-income areas, and Team TerraTek, which works to secure land and property rights for individuals and communities in developing nations.
Polega said that he is grateful for the resources, mentorship, and workspace that the i-lab has provided his team. Crouch added that he appreciates the legitimacy that winning the President’s Challenge bestows to their project.
“I think the President’s Challenge is the one of the most unique things about Harvard’s startup ecosystem,” he said. “I really applaud what it’s doing for our entrepreneurial scene.”
“If you’re interested in [entrepreneurship] it doesn’t matter if you don’t have an idea—just join [a start-up],” Crouch said. “Boston has such a vibrant community of start-up jobs that are always looking for new people—go out there, find a team that has a problem that motivates you...and see what it’s like to build a product from the ground up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a year marked by a major cheating scandal at Harvard, more than 30 percent of graduating seniors admit they have cheated on a homework assignment during their four years as undergraduates.
Fewer say they have cheated on an exam or on a paper or take-home assignment—about 7 percent for each type of assessment.
But when asked how many of their classmates had cheated, students’ estimates were much higher. They guessed, on average, that 53 percent had cheated on homework, 32 percent on papers, and 18 percent on exams.
Whether the rate of cheating stands at 30 percent or 50 percent, students on the whole were not optimistic that an honor code—which the Committee on Academic Integrity proposed in March—would make Harvard students any more honest. Just 25 percent said they felt an honor code would reduce cheating.
The numbers come from a survey of the Class of 2013 conducted by The Crimson from May 11 to May 21. Nearly half of the senior class—780 respondents—answered questions on topics ranging from drug use to House satisfaction to post-graduation plans. We assume the sample is a random selection and therefore discount any selection bias.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING TO?
The results paint a picture of the class that graduates this week.
On geography:
• 42 percent came to Harvard from the Northeast. 55 percent will stay in the region after graduation.
• Though 10 percent of students are international residents, 17 percent will be living in foreign countries next year.
• 27.4 percent of the class grew up in urban areas; 64.1 percent come from suburbs; and 8.5 percent come from rural areas. These numbers look quite different from the general breakdown of the U.S. population: According to the 2010 U.S. census, 71 percent of Americans live in cities, 10 percent in suburbs, and 19 percent in rural areas.
On post-graduation plans:
• 61 percent of graduates will be employed next year. 18 percent will enter graduate school right away. The rest will pursue fellowships or travel or are among the 10 percent who have not yet determined their post-graduation plans.
• Of those who will be working, the most popular industry is consulting, drawing 16 percent of employed seniors.
• Another 15 percent will be working in finance, nearly doubling the 9 percent who entered the sector last year but still paling in comparison to 2007, when before the financial crisis, 47 percent of graduating seniors went into finance.
• The next runner-up is the technology and engineering sector, which 13 percent of the employed members of the Class of 2013 will enter.
Asked what industry they would like to be working in ten years from now, students made very different choices.
• The consulting sector went from the very top choice to the very bottom. Just 1 percent see themselves as 32-year-old consultants.
• 5 percent said they still want to be working in finance.
• Health was by far the dominant field of choice in students’ 10-year plans, attracting 20 percent of students. Just 7 percent will enter the industry right away—the years it takes to get through medical school likely account for much of this difference.
• 11 percent would like to be working in arts, sports, or entertainment, though just 5 percent will start out there.
• 9 percent envision a career in government or politics, though only 4 percent will pursue one right away.
PAY DIRT
Salary, of course, plays a large role in determining students’ plans just out of college. The average employed graduate will make roughly $60,000 in his or her first year out of Harvard, according to the survey results. But salaries vary tremendously across industries.
• Among students working in consulting, the most popular field, 72 percent expect to earn between $70,000 and $90,000.
• In the nearly equally popular financial sector, salaries are even higher—a full 21 percent of students entering that field will earn more than $110,000 in their first year on the job.
• And technology can be still more lucrative—almost half of students entering the field will make $90,000 to $110,000 in their first year, and some will make even more.
• For the 12 percent of employed students who will work in education—largely thanks to the popularity of Teach for America—70 percent expect to make between $30,000 and $50,000. Another 15 percent will work for less than that, and 9 percent do not yet know their salaries. Only 6 percent expect to earn more than $50,000, and none more than $70,000.
Salary differs noticeably between male and female students. Men are much more likely to appear in the highest pay brackets than women: Of the students who expect to earn more than $110,000 in their first year of work, three-quarters are male. Of those who will earn $90,000 to $110,000, men represent nearly two thirds. And those numbers come from a pool of respondents which included more women than men, suggesting that the true tallies are in fact slightly more weighted in men’s favor.
The difference in industries chosen by male and female students partially accounts for the difference in pay. Men enter finance, consulting, and technology at higher rates than women, while more women pursue education, media, and health after college.
But industry alone does not explain the wage gap. Among students entering finance, men are still nearly four times as likely to earn more than $110,000 per year, and three times as likely to earn $90,000 to $110,000. Admittedly, the sample sizes are small. But the same holds true in consulting. And in technology and engineering, 79 percent of men expect to make more than $90,000, compared to just 44 percent of women in the same field.
SEX, DRUGS, AND PRIMAL SCREAM
Some differences between men and women might be simpler to explain than the complex factors behind these differences in pay. Take porn.
Men like it so much that 52 percent of them watch it online at least once a week. 14 percent of male students have never watched porn at all. But among women, just 6 percent watch porn as frequently as the majority of the men, and 63 percent have never watched any.
On drinking and drugs:
• Nearly a quarter of the class said they drink more than twice a week.
• 9 percent never drink, and 7 percent drink less than once a month.
• Among students who drink, 60 percent started before they came to Harvard (though 10 percent waited until they graduated from high school).
• At Harvard, most started right away, but 9 percent waited until they turned 21.
• 38 percent of students have tried marijuana, and 3 percent use it more than twice a week. Of marijuana users, 44 percent started at Harvard; the rest started before college.
• Almost a quarter of the class uses tobacco at least occasionally, with about 40 percent of users having started at college.
• 16 percent of the class has tried at least one of cocaine, ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD, and other illicit substances. Very large majorities of those who have used these drugs first tried them after starting college.
• 9 percent of the class has used drugs like Adderall and Ritalin, which are prescribed for attention deficit disorders but often abused by students who hope the pills will help them focus on their studies.
The survey also questioned students about their sex lives, finding that 72 percent enroll at Harvard as virgins and 27 percent graduate without having sex. Of those who do have sex at Harvard, most have just one partner during their four years, but 7 percent of students have 10 or more sexual partners in college.
The daring do it in the library—13 percent of the class, it turns out. Sex in Widener is the least commonly achieved of the “big three” tasks known to Harvard students: 23 percent have urinated on John Harvard’s shiny foot, and 32 percent have run Primal Scream. Just a few hardy folks—4 percent of the class—accomplished all three.
HEALTH AT HARVARD
Students reported being quite happy during their time in college—on average, they rated their happiness at 3.87 on a one-to-five scale, with higher numbers representing more positive feelings.
They rated their satisfaction with their Houses, on average, at 3.92, and gave even higher marks to their concentrations—4.04 on the one-to-five scale, though 27 percent said they would pick a new concentration if they could start over.
But mental health, long a cause for concern at Harvard, has again emerged at the forefront of campus conversation this year, especially after an anonymous opinion piece in The Crimson about a student’s struggles handling schizophrenia sparked a protest outside University Hall. And the survey results show that frustration with Harvard’s mental health services extends far beyond one anonymous writer.
• 39 percent of respondents said they sought some form of mental health care during their time at Harvard.
• 29 percent visited Mental Health Services, 17 percent visited the Bureau of Study Counsel, 12 percent visited an off-campus professional, and 4 percent used a peer counseling group.
• UHS received an average satisfaction rating of 2.9, while the Bureau of Study Counsel’s lesser-used therapy sessions earned a 3.5 rating. Those who received mental health care off campus were most satisfied, giving their treatment a 4.0 rating.
Sexual assault also loomed large in campus dialogue during a school year that started with two rapes reported on campus in a span of five days over the summer. Though the Harvard University Police Department announced that the two assaults were the first stranger rapes reported at Harvard in 12 years, students still voiced safety concerns as they returned to campus.
In the survey, 45 people—41 of whom were women or transgender students—said that they had been sexually assaulted at Harvard. Just eight of those victims said they reported the assault to Harvard administrators. And just one, a male victim, went to the police.
The average self-reported GPA was 3.63. While the mean self-reported GPAs of varsity athletes and of students on financial aid were slightly lower than this average, the differences were within the margin of error at a 95 percent confidence interval. The class saw little change in religiosity from the beginning to the end of college. Twenty percent of the class reported never dating anyone during their time in college. The numbers quantifying the Class of 2013 go on and on.
But perhaps one number speaks loudest of all.
Ninety-three percent: That’s the number that, given the chance to do it all over, would choose Harvard again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 28, 2013, at 10:27 p.m.
Evelynn M. Hammonds will step down as the Dean of the College on July 1, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email to the Harvard community Tuesday, ending nearly two months of speculation about the embattled dean’s future.
The resignation ends a semester rife with controversy for Hammonds, who announced to faculty on April 2 that she had broken their email privacy policy in authorizing secret searches of a resident dean’s FAS email account. Those searches were a part of a broader probe to plug a leak of Administrative Board information connected to the Government 1310 cheating scandal that marred the final year of her tenure.
“Being dean of Harvard College has been an immensely rewarding experience for me, but I miss engaging deeply with my scholarship and teaching,” Hammonds said in a story posted Tuesday morning by the Harvard Gazette. Smith wrote in his email that Hammonds will take a sabbatical and return to teaching thereafter.
The Gazette’s story did not address the email search scandal that has made headlines since March. But on Tuesday afternoon, Hammonds made a statement through an outside strategic communications company saying that the scandal “was difficult but it was not a motivating factor in my decision to step down.”
In that statement, Hammonds also addressed the suggestion that she had been asked to resign.
“I was never asked to step down. I have been in discussions to return to academia and my research for some time,” she wrote.
The Crimson first reported that Hammonds had been in negotiations to step down as dean on May 17, at which time Hammonds did not confirm the news. “I have not been asked to resign as dean, nor have I offered. I am dean of Harvard College and I think speculation to the contrary is unproductive,” she wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
In Tuesday’s email announcing Hammonds’s resignation, which was sent to students, parents, and faculty members, Smith wrote that he will begin working on finding an interim dean soon and will appoint a search committee of students, faculty, and staff to find a new dean in the fall.
The announcement comes as thousands of alumni and visitors are arriving on campus for Thursday’s Commencement exercises. Hammonds attended the Baccalaureate Service for the College Class of 2013 on Tuesday afternoon, though as customary she did not deliver remarks. She is still expected to address graduating seniors at Wednesday’s Class Day ceremony and to attend Thursday’s Commencement exercises.
Tuesday’s announcement engendered mixed reactions among faculty members and students.
Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department, said that Hammonds was a good leader and responsive to the needs of students, but that the email searches controversy eroded trust that was crucial for her ability to serve effectively.
“I just felt that this incident of the email searches, I think, went overboard, where you’re violating the privacy of faculty,” Asani said when asked about the expected resignation earlier this month. “I think because of that loss of trust, maybe it is really in the best interest [that she step down].”
Currier House Undergraduate Council representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who in April sponsored UC legislation expressing “tremendous concern” over the searches, said that the resignation is an “important first step” in rebuilding trust between students and administrators.
He said that given the strife that plagued Hammonds’s year, he is glad to see that “there has been some leadership change and closure to signal to faculty, students, and alumni that someone will ultimately be held accountable.”
Looking beyond controversy surrounding the email searches and the Government 1310 cheating case, other professors praised Hammonds’s leadership at the helm of the College.
Religion professor Diana L. Eck, the co-Master of Lowell House, said Tuesday that Hammonds “worked tirelessly” on behalf of students.
Eck commended Hammonds’s decision to serve as Dean and “to put aside her own work and research at this difficult period of time—and a difficult period of time for the College. Most of us would not think of doing that.”
Eck added that, along with her co-Master of Lowell House Dorothy A. Austin, she was grateful to have had the chance to collaborate with Hammonds.
“It has been a real privilege to work with her for five years,” Eck said. “House Masters like Dorothy and I see her work relentlessly behind the scenes for programs and facilities that benefit our students.”
Upon her return from sabbatical, Hammonds will lead a new program at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research on the intersection of race and gender with science and medicine.
“I am looking forward to redesigning my classes in light of new technologies and modes of teaching,“ Hammonds said in the Gazette. “I’m eager to return to my teaching and research on race, genomics, and gender in science and medicine.”
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., a professor in the Department of African and African American Studies and the director of the DuBois Institute, said Tuesday that he sees Hammonds’s decision to step down and return to academics “in nothing but the most positive terms.” Gates, who learned of Hammonds’s decision to step down in a personal email from her Tuesday morning, would not comment on the specific motivation behind the decision.
“From my point of view, it’s wonderful,” Gates said. “Evelynn and I have for several years directed a working group at the Du Bois Institute about genealogy and genetics, and I have wanted her to pursue this area of scholarship rather than remain in administration.”
Hammonds was selected to be the first woman and first African-American to serve as Dean of Harvard College in 2008. Her tenure saw the full implementation of the General Education program, the launch of Wintersession, and the beginning of House renewal construction. Though she taught few classes during her time as dean, Hammonds remains a member of the History of Science and the African and African American Studies departments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alone behind a slender microphone, Evelynn M. Hammonds gazed somberly over the assembled members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Prepared script in hand, the Dean of Harvard College was about to tell the University’s most influential faculty that she had broken their rules in an effort to safeguard the confidentiality of her students.
Her audience already knew that she and other University officials had secretly probed the email accounts of the College’s resident deans. But in the Faculty Room in University Hall on the second day of April, they were to learn that she had conducted a second set of email searches—this time, illicitly.
The revelation lasted only a couple of minutes, but that was time enough to bring into focus the mindset that guided Hammonds through the most extensive academic integrity investigation in Harvard’s history. Admitting to damaging mistakes in the way she handled the searches—mistakes that some have suggested would ultimately cost her her deanship—Hammonds stood by her vision of the College as an institution meant to protect students as they learn and grow.
With Hammonds’s five-year tenure drawing to a close this summer, students and faculty say that this strong commitment to safeguarding her students was often impeded by unforeseen crises and administrative shortcomings. The dean who cared so much about protecting students, they say, could not get the job done.
THE REACTIONARY DEAN
Hammonds would not agree to be interviewed for this story, but one of her close advisors, College Dean for Administration D. E. Lorraine Sterritt, suggested in an email that the Dean of the College position is meant to be in part about caring for undergraduates.
The Dean of the College, she wrote, is “both the chief administrative officer of the College and the person who must enact the vision of the College,” charged with overseeing “the education and wellbeing of the undergraduate body.”
Observers say that Hammonds has embraced this mandate during her time as dean. But despite her efforts to protect and nurture students, they said, Hammonds was hindered from the start by events beyond her control and problems with her approach.
Hammonds arrived at University Hall in the summer of 2008, just months before the beginning of the financial crisis. From the start, she had to deal with widespread budget cuts and administrative restructuring across FAS.
As hot breakfast disappeared from the Houses, staff size shrank across the College, and one or more students died each school year, Hammonds was forced into a reactionary position from which she never really recovered, several former College affiliates said. Instead of laying out a proactive vision for what the College should be, they said, Hammonds was forced to protect and defend it.
“I think that just made it much harder for Dean Hammonds to focus on the big picture—where do we want the College to go? Instead she was focused on the small things—how do we address these things?” said Van C. Tran, a Lowell House tutor from 2005 to 2011.
Despite these circumstances, Hammonds did push through several efforts to care for undergraduates, including the implementation of Administrative Board reforms, the launch of winter break programming, and the expansion of campus social spaces.
But former Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said that Hammonds’s approach was often an obstacle in such initiatives. He said that while Hammonds was open and engaged when presented with student concerns, she had trouble proactively reaching out and following through.
“In my opinion, I honestly think she was 100 percent in the right place in her aims,” he said. “I only expected the best from her, because she really cared about the students, and I think she had a similar perspective in a way that was shockingly progressive from her position as dean. The problem was just in the delivery space.”
By the summer of 2012, the problems of her early deanship would confront Hammonds head on. As international scrutiny descended on the College and the cheating investigation she would lead, the dean who aimed to protect saw her students come under unprecedented levels of scrutiny.
ON THE DEFENSIVE
On Aug. 30, Harvard made headlines when it announced that it was investigating approximately 125 students for inappropriate collaboration on a final take-home exam. Although the University took the unusual step of publicly announcing the case, as usual it did not release the names of the students in question because the disciplinary proceedings of the College’s Administrative Board are kept strictly confidential.
But that did not stop more information about the case from getting out. On Sept. 1, The Crimson printed portions of an advising email that Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison sent to resident deans suggesting that athletes under investigation consider taking a year off for eligibility purposes. After a Crimson reporter approached Ellison with a leaked copy of his advising email, Ellison emailed all resident deans asking if anyone had shared it. Upon receiving that email on September 1, Senior Resident Dean Sharon Howell reached out to most of the resident deans to talk personally, but no one had an explanation.
As the leaks continued, Hammonds and her College administrators were growing increasingly worried that new information could threaten the confidentiality of students.
On Sept. 9 the college news and gossip blog IvyGate published information about a potential tiered punishment scheme for students convicted in the case discussed at an Ad Board meeting.
Two days later, on Sept. 11, The Crimson approached Ellison with a leaked copy of assistant Government professor Matthew C. Platt’s original complaint letter, sent to the Ad Board the previous May. The letter, which showed that a typo was at the root of the case, identified two groups—graduating students and members of the baseball team—implicated in the scandal.
Later that night, the fears of Hammonds and other administrators were realized. In a development unrelated to the leaked Ad Board information, Harvard basketball players Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13 made headlines in Sport Illustrated—but not for their widely admired athletic prowess. The year before, the team co-captains had helped the squad earn its first NCAA tournament appearance in 66 years, but now the media was reporting that the two were withdrawing from the College in connection with the Government 1310 scandal in an attempt to preserve their athletic eligibility for the 2013-2014 season.
With students in the headlines, Hammonds and Smith proceeded to secretly authorize an initial round of searches that probed the email accounts that the deans used for administrative work. When in September those searches occurred is unclear.
Months later, on March 9, the Boston Globe broke the story. On March 11, Hammonds and Smith offered an explanation of the searches in a statement to the Harvard community. Although neither leak contained information that could be used to directly identify an investigated student, the statement invoked the confidentiality rules that govern the Ad Board in defense of what Smith and Hammonds portrayed as limited probes into the deans’ administrative accounts.
THE GUARDIAN
In the faculty meeting on April 2, faculty members sat in stunned silence as Hammonds revealed that account to be incomplete. After the first search identified a single resident dean, she told them, she ordered an additional round of queries into that dean’s administrative and faculty accounts. Although she consulted with a lawyer in the Office of the General Counsel, Hammonds admitted that she did not get the necessary authorization from Smith, therefore breaking faculty email privacy policy.
Hammonds’s remarks suggested that concerns over the personal identification of students in the media—an outcome faced by Casey, Curry, and a few other athletes—had influenced her actions.
“I might just say parenthetically: many of you are parents, and I ask you to imagine that it was your son or daughter who showed up on the front page of the newspaper,” Hammonds told the gathered faculty. “We needed to act in order to protect our students and the integrity of our Ad Board process.”
But that concern for student confidentiality, some said, led Hammonds to violate the privacy of and abandon her defense of another constituency at the College—the resident deans. Howell and three other College administrators have challenged portions of Hammonds’s and Smith’s narrative of events, claiming that the resident dean who had been targeted was threatened with severe sanctions, even though that dean forwarded the email to two investigated student for innocuous advising purposes.
“There was really absolutely no reason for them to think that the resident deans had any responsibility” for the public outing of Casey and Curry, Howell said.
Even as Hammonds humbled herself before the faculty on April 2, she defended her decision to protect student confidentiality and the integrity of the Ad Board at all costs.
“Indeed, had we not sought to discover the source of the exposure, and further information was released, I would now be standing here trying to explain why we did not take action,” she said.
But she closed her remarks, her last before the assembled faculty, on a more conciliatory note. Evoking the image of her own young son, she reminded her colleagues that she approached her duties not just as an administrator, but as a parent as well.
“I stand before you as parent of a 10-year old boy who I am raising to what I hope will be a good man,” she said.
“I always tell our son how important it is to own up to your mistakes, to apologize, and to make amends,” she said. “I have to model that behavior for him.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: May 28, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that the mistakes regarding the email search scandal that Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds admitted to at the April 2 faculty meeting had cost her her deanship. To clarify, while some have suggested that Hammonds’s resignation was linked to her role in the email searches scandal, she was quoted in the New York Times Tuesday saying that the affair was “not a motivating factor” in her decision to step down.

Inside and outside the gates of Harvard Yard, students responded to the emerging Civil Rights Movement. While some remember campus as an insular community that looked at the movement from afar, many black students within the school worked to create a sense of community, and individual and group efforts among both the student body and the administration emerged to support racial equality through activism at Harvard, in the local Cambridge and Boston area, and in the South.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On August 30, 2012, news broke that propelled Harvard students into the national spotlight, but not to reaffirm their oft-touted position as the world’s best and brightest. Instead, about 125 students—nearly two percent of the student body—faced accusations of inappropriate collaboration and plagiarism on a final take-home exam for Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
In the words of Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, the “Introduction to Congress” debacle was a scandal “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory.” But Harvard continued to face unfamiliar territory as the initial story evolved throughout the year: In March, the Boston Globe reported that Harvard administrators secretly searched the resident deans’ email accounts in conjunction with the scandal. In April, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds revealed that she had called for a second round of secret email searches without the approval of Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, in clear violation of University policy. To make matters worse, this development directly contradicted an earlier statement by Hammonds and Smith in which they had assured the Harvard community that no further searches had been conducted.
On the heels of that disheartening news, we called for Hammonds to step down, so that we could begin to repair the deficit of trust between administration, faculty, and students that had deepened during the email search debacle. Tuesday, May 28, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email that Hammonds will resign her post as Dean of Harvard College on July 1.
We are pleased to see that Hammonds is vacating her position, and we hope that this move will aid the Harvard community in beginning the process of reestablishing trust among students, faculty, and administrators. However, we must recognize that Hammonds’ departure alone cannot cure the ills that triggered this chain of events in the first place. The shameful saga that began with the cheating scandal, intensified with the email searches, and now draws to a close with Hammonds’ exit is symptomatic of more endemic problems at Harvard.  First, administrators, professors, and students at the College face a mutual deficit of trust and communication. Second, students study in a stressful and competitive academic environment where they are subject to pre-professional pressures that often push them to learn not for learning’s sake, but instead to gain an edge in a brutally competitive job market.
Hammonds’ actions—ordering searches that only occur in “rare instances” and then “fail[ing] to recollect” a round of those searches that blatantly circumvented University policy—undermined values essential to any institution of higher learning. We understand that Hammonds acted with the ultimate goal of preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the Administrative Board. But, as we have opined before, her failure to seek the necessary approval of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, combined with her decision not to inform both search subjects and the Harvard community as whole of the details and extent of the email searches makes it difficult for students and faculty alike to have faith in their administrators.
The lack of trust that many at Harvard inevitably feel in the wake of the email searches, however, will not simply disappear as Hammonds departs University Hall. Harvard College has made it its mission “to identify and remove restraints on students’ full participation, so that individuals may… develop their full intellectual and human potential.” A fraught relationship with the administration constitutes such a restraint, and could prove a serious challenge for Harvard in the near future. Students as well as faculty here must feel confident that the administration will obey its own policy and be forthright with information about issues as sensitive as email searches, or more distractions will continue to draw attention away from the top-notch education, groundbreaking research, and overall excellence that defines us.
Not only must the administration strive toward more transparency in the future, but faculty must also ensure clarity in their interactions with students, especially when it comes to collaboration guidelines. The cheating scandal likely would not have involved so great a percentage of the Government 1310 class if the course had not had a history of collaboration on exams. This does not excuse the behavior of the students, who flagrantly disobeyed written instructions, but it is nevertheless important to understand that certain environments are more conducive to good behavior than others. Faculty must work to maintain consistent, explicit standards for collaboration, while continuing to foster a healthy teacher-student dynamic founded on trust and communication.
But the onus also lies with students to maintain academic integrity. After all, if Government 1310 enrollees had not breached the course’s collaboration guidelines, Hammonds would have had no cause to conduct even one round of email searches. As Harvard enters a new academic year, seeking to leave the cheating scandal behind, members of the student body—ourselves included—would do well to reassess their priorities and renew their commitment to academic integrity.
A Crimson magazine story on “The Fall of Academics at Harvard” identified a troubling trend among many professors who, according to Nicolaus Mills ’60, a literature professor at Sarah Lawrence College, display “an increasing loyalty to career interests and entrepreneurial interests, and decreasing loyalty to students.” Perhaps even more worrisome is the tendency of students to show a parallel devotion to pursuits that they perceive could advance their prospective careers over academics. Pre-professional pressures abound in extracurricular activities—including our own—which require a substantial time commitment that cuts into the hours students would otherwise reserve for classwork.
This focus on the professional over the academic does encourage students to work hard, and it may prepare them for life after Harvard.  But, at the same time, busy students with a singular focus on obtaining the most competitive internships and getting into the most exclusive grad schools are more likely to take an at-all-costs approach to maintaining their GPA than those who learn for its own sake. These high-pressure students might, in moments of undue stress, resort to the very academic shortcuts that can eventually build up to something as explosive as Government 1310 scandal. Perhaps we students ought to reevaluate our priorities to include a deeper appreciation for learning as an end unto itself. Paying more attention to academics would contribute to a better classroom environment, while reducing the pressure to cut academic corners. In the end, students should come to college to learn, not just to snag a position at the best consulting firm or most exclusive law school.
This year-long drama has demonstrated the importance of taking responsibility for one’s actions. The entire Harvard community must move forward with a renewed commitment to honesty, so that we may be worthy of the trust we are working to rebuild. This has been a troubled year for Harvard. We hope that, with increased communication from the administration, clarity from faculty, and cooperation between these and students, next year will hold real promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust urged members of the Class of 2013 to pursue “lives of running toward” in her Baccalaureate Address Tuesday afternoon.
Citing the various first responders, runners, and spectators who ran to the aid of those injured during the Boston Marathon bombing, Faust said that “running toward” entails facing unknown challenges in pursuit of service and individual passions.
“‘Running toward’ is a way of being, an attitude, a capacity for courage, a kind of grace,” she said, according to a copy of her remarks as prepared for delivery. “Living a life of running toward is what a liberal arts education has helped prepare you to do.”
She related the theme of “running toward” to what she called her “Parking Space Theory of Life.”
“Don’t park 10 blocks away from your destination because you think you won’t find a closer space,” she said. “Go to where you want to be. You can always circle back to where you have to be.”
She also addressed the Government 1310 cheating scandal that made national headlines earlier this year, asking graduates to consider the value of winning and its relation to success.
“We recognize that winning, or the need to win or to present ourselves as winners, can at some point become a form of losing,” Faust said. “A meaningful life can recede in an endless string of contests.... What, after all, does “success” mean? What does a good life look like?”
She made reference to various accomplishments of members of the senior class, including the launch of “Sex Week,” the creation of the world’s largest box fort, and—eliciting an especially resounding round of applause from seniors—Harvard’s first victory in the NCAA basketball tournament.
Faust’s speech was one part of a larger service that included a salutation and concluding blessing from Jonathan L. Walton, minister in Memorial Church and Divinity School professor. Students performed readings from the texts of five different religions in both English and their original languages. A Commencement Choir, conducted by Memorial Church Choirmaster Edward E. Jones, sang several anthems and hymns at various points throughout the service.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, whose departure was officially announced hours before, was in attendance, but as per custom, she did not speak during the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s inaugural Title IX coordinator Mia Karvonides has convened a University-wide working group of individuals from various Schools and offices to “consider options” for sexual misconduct policies and procedures on campus.
The group, composed of individuals from across Harvard, will evaluate both School-specific and University-wide policies in an effort to ensure that Harvard’s practices conform to federal Title IX regulations.
The group’s members met for the first time this month and will meet periodically over the summer, Karvonides wrote in an email to The Crimson. Karvonides, who worked as a federal civil rights attorney before coming to Harvard earlier this semester, added that it is too early to tell what form the group’s recommendations and conclusions will take.
This step is part of an ongoing investigation of sexual assault policies and practices across the University. In spring 2010, the Office of the Assistant to the President began collecting data and reviewing policies to evaluate Harvard’s adherence to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX prohibits sexual harassment and broader gender-based discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding.
The endeavor became more relevant when the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released an April 2011 Dear Colleague letter outlining stricter guidelines for university sexual misconduct policies.
As peer institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and Yale University modify their standards of evidence required to prove guilt in a sexual misconduct case, Harvard has faced increased pressure from students and faculty to reevaluate its sexual assault policy.
In fall 2010, New England School of Law professor Wendy J. Murphy filed a federal complaint claiming that Harvard Law School was failing to comply with Title IX mandates, launching an ongoing 2011 investigation by the Office of Civil Rights.
Students have also joined the push. In November, a referendum on the Undergraduate Council presidential election ballot calling for Harvard’s sexual assault policy to be reconsidered passed with 85 percent of the vote.
Kate Sim ’14, founder of the student group Our Harvard Can Do Better, called the occurrence of the working group’s first meeting “promising.”
Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student campaign that describes its mission as “dismantling rape culture at Harvard,” advocates for the College to change its sexual assault policy to one of affirmative consent and clarify what it means to be mentally incapacitated in a sexual assault case, among other demands. The group also calls on Harvard to “actively engage” students in any such review, according to its website.
“It’s an exciting time for Harvard along with other peer institutions to be working on [sexual] assault policy that really needs to be revised and set up to date,” Sim said.
The working group convened by Karvonides will solicit feedback from faculty, students, and staff across the University before bringing any proposals for policy changes to the School-level deans, Karvonides wrote in an email to the Council of Deans, a group composed of the heads of each School.
