After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the foreword of “Feel Free,” Zadie Smith admits to feeling “anxiety [which] comes from knowing I have no real qualifications to write as I do. Not a philosopher or sociologist, not a real professor of literature or film, not a political scientist, professional music critic or trained journalist.” She is selling herself short, of course: She has taught fiction at both Columbia and New York University and has frequently contributed to both magazines and newspapers, as this book later confirms. What’s more, her five widely-acclaimed novels, numerous short stories, and essays—some of which are amassed in her previous non-fiction book, “Changing My Mind: Occasional Essay”—have already solidified her as one of the greatest writers of our time. In the newest addition to her bibliography, Smith covers topics as political as Brexit and gentrification, as personal as grief and love, and as unexpectedly philosophical as Jay-Z and Justin Bieber. Spanning the eight years of Obama’s presidency, the collection of essays is more than a call against library closures or a social critique of people’s obsession with social media, both being issues she raises throughout the book. As she delves into the intimacies of her life, Smith reveals an underlying vulnerability beneath the confidence with which she writes, resulting in a letter to those she’s both loved and lost.
The book is organized into five different parts: “In the World,” “In the Audience,” “In the Gallery,” “On the Bookshelf,” and “Feel Free.” Though Smith’s writing is consistently strong, her voice is weakest in the first part of the collection. “In the World” is the shortest, in which she most directly engages with her political opinions, and rightly so due to the section’s lack of strength. Her writing verges on the prescriptive: She is speaking at us, not to us. Her views are informed, but feel insipid. Smith delivers a lackluster take on crucial and timely events. “I bore myself with these stories,” she admits, alluding to the reasons why she opposes the systematic library closure campaign plaguing both the US and the UK. They are “boring” because she barely articulates her stakes in any given situation, an absence that soon becomes glaringly obvious in her subsequently deeply evocative and personal musings.
Her insecurities reveal themselves most frequently in her unveiled aversion to aging. The first hint comes in “Generation Why?” as she betrays her own weariness of people her age: “You want to be optimistic about your own generation. You want to keep pace with them and not to fear what you don’t understand,” Smith says. Later in “Alte Frau By Balthasar Denner,” in which she deconstructs the aforementioned painting, she worries she is projecting her own insecurities onto the woman depicted in the work of art: “Whatever concerns I may bring to her—I’m forty-one! I’m scared of aging!—it’s clear she’s heard it all before.” With aging, though, as is apparent with Smith, comes a certain latent wisdom about life the author is newly becoming aware of: “Oh, right, I get it now! This is what Mum and ‘Auntie’ Ruth were like; and this is why, after about 6 p.m., they stopped telling us what to do, and we got to stay up an hour or two hours later… I get it now,” she says of having a glass of wine with her best friend Sarah, while watching her kids.
For all her fears of aging, the universally experienced process of growing older has—in addition to her increasingly apparent sagacity—given her an important perspective and recognition of her privilege, which frees her from the many financial constraints her parents had at her age. In “The Shadow of Ideas,” she remembers feeling “too big to fail” as her apartment building burned down: “I understood at last what it means to have money… Everything lost can be replaced.” Smith asks: How will she raise her children to recognize their own privilege in comparison to how Smith was raised? How will she ground herself when, “under the protection of a university I live on one of the most privileged strips of built-up beach in the world”? The answers lie in the very medium she uses to articulate and share these concerns: her writing.
Though not a self-proclaimed philosopher, Smith’s contemplation about the significance of joy in her closing essay, “Joy,” encapsulates her philosophy about relationships peppered throughout the collection. Smith makes the distinction between joy and pleasure, and why she would—contrary to popular belief—much rather experience the latter on a regular basis. For Smith, to feel joy is to love something or someone beyond words, and with that comes the definite devastation their loss would inflict on her: “You hope to leave this world before your child. You are quite certain your dog will leave before you do. Joy is such a human madness.” Pleasure, on the other hand, is much easier to find, sustain, and appreciate regularly. The joy she feels comes from her relationships, and manifests itself in her motherly worrying about how she wants to raise her children, her grief for her father and the moments they shared together before he passed away, her drunk shenanigans with her best friend, and her time in Italian parks with her husband.
“Feel Free” is more than just a collection of essays. It is a letter to her loved ones. Smith bares herself to the world, leaving it all out in the open. But a fool she is not. Curious, humble, and wise, Smith reminds her readers once again that her nonfiction is just as powerful as her fiction.

Terese Marie Mailhot’s “Heart Berries” was awash with praise before it even debuted. The memoir holds a spot on “Most Anticipated Books of 2018” lists in major publications, and for good reason. This book is an exciting step forward for representation in literature, and the arts in general.
Mailhot, raised on the Seabird Island Indian Reservation in the Pacific Northwest, writes with heart-wrenching earnestness about her upbringing, mental illness, poverty, broken romantic relationships, and her experience as a Native woman in a society controlled by white people. Her story is unpolished in a way that is sometimes distracting, but ultimately speaks to her honesty.
The book’s structure is a bit unclear. Mailhot wrote most of it during a short stay at a psychiatric hospital. She checked herself in after trying to commit suicide on the condition that she be allowed to write in a notebook she brought with her. In a way that feels random, the narrative switches between very raw, but very thoughtful journal entries and letters, to former lovers, to more polished sections where Mailhot sets the scene as would an author of a novel.
Similarly jarring is the way Mailhot goes on tangents without shame. Often in the same paragraph, she will be describing a setting, and then her thoughts will creep in to take over the rest of the paragraph. She doesn’t bother to use transitions, perhaps because she is experimenting with narrative writing as she writes her journal, and is therefore not concerned with committing herself to a specific form. Her decision to do so feels more unprofessional than it does raw and unfiltered.
Mailhot’s writing is filled with many clichés. Her description of a psychiatric hospital doesn’t add more description than those in Ned Vizzini’s young adult novel, “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” a quintessential novel describing life within a psychiatric hospital. Mailhot excessively describes drab cafeteria food and, as can be a common trope in memoirs, asks herself, “What am I doing here?” when she encounters other patients who, unlike her, suffer from psychosis. While these kinds of observations are appropriate for a book like Vizzini’s geared toward a younger audience, they feel out of place in a work written for older readers.
But other clichés feel appropriate. Mailhot’s letter to a former lover is filled with dime-a-dozen lines such as, “You used me,” and “Do you still love me? I still want you,” and “I was dramatic and unhinged.” However, a letter to a former lover is meant to be messy, and these lines communicate the universality of Mailhot’s experiences despite the specificity of her struggles. This universality is important because it contributes to the humanizing representation of a Native woman, demonstrating to readers of all audiences that they can relate to her experiences.
Beneath the amateurish outer layer of Mailhot’s writing, her artistry shines though. She writes about the pain of her experiences with crushing realism in statements such as, “I chewed the top and bottom of my lip so much that I chewed part of my Cupid’s bow off permanently—the most protruding part on my heart-shaped mouth never grew back.” Mailhot is able to capture significant poetic sadness with her prose, making “Heart Berries” worth reading.
“Heart Berries” is ultimately a gorgeous piece of writing that would have benefitted from a better editor. A tighter narrative structure would have allowed Mailhot to truly showcase the beauty of her writing and her story.

On Feb. 9, performing arts director Ifeoma Fafunwa brought her evocative and critically acclaimed play, “HEAR WORD! Naija Woman Talk True,” to the Loeb Drama Center. The production displayed an array of obstacles that many Nigerian women face regularly, and promoted the necessary steps to hurdling these barriers. Following the performance, Fafunwa sat down with Professor Timothy Patrick McCarthy, the Core Faculty and Director of Culture Change & Social Justice Initiatives at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy for a 30-minute long discussion fueled by his questions, after which Fafunwa gave the audience the chance to ask questions of their own.
Almost as soon as Fafunwa and McCarthy settled in their chairs underneath the soft red glow of the center-stage light, the remainder of the audience from the show gave their undivided attention to the pair sitting on stage while Fafunwa fielded McCarthy’s questions about the production. When queried about what led her to direct such a powerful piece, Fafunwa answered that she obtained her inspiration from Tyler Perry’s “For Colored Girls”—a film that portrays a series of women experiencing the issues that affect women of color.
Fafunwa’s spin on this idea was a piece that displayed a series of women from her own country, and the social issues that they face in their culture. Fafunwa asserted that her motivation was to make a production that gave agency to the people from her homeland, whom she felt were in great need of a voice. “Let’s empower. Let it all be about the mind-shift of the women. This entire piece is [about] not waiting for men or for institutions—its saying, we’re responsible, here’s what we can do, here’s where we contribute to the problem, and here’s where we can shift our minds and get away from those situations,” she said.
By taking responsibility for their own social wellbeing, Fafunwa encourages young Nigerian women to take control of their own narrative. Though misogyny is a major problem upheld by many males in the Nigerian culture, Fafunwa insists that rather than wait for the wrongdoers to see the errors of their ways and decide to change, it is up to women to take matters into their own hands.
Though the entire essence of Fafunwa’s play is about grievances that women face in Nigeria, “HEAR WORD!” takes a decided stand in refusing to paint these women as helpless victims. “I was particular about flipping the narrative around what you saw of African women on television….I thought [it would be better] if ten women stood on stage looking powerful, and strong, and not covering up the core problems, saying, we bear it all these are issues, and this is how we’re going to solve them,” Fafunwa said.
Fafunwa’s talk following the show was well received by the audience, who all seemed to have only one complaint: They wished for the opportunity to hear her speak for a longer duration of time. “You always want more,” A.R.T. subscriber Joan FitzGerald said. She went on to express her great appreciation for the amount of time for which she was able to listen to Fafunwa speak. “There are lots of issues that are certainly resonant in this country,” FitzGerald said.
Actress Yewande Odetoyinbo of the Boston Conservatory at Berklee agreed. “I agreed with everything [Fafunwa] said, and this piece is so relevant not just for [women in] Nigeria, but for everywhere,” she said.
Fafunwa’s sister-in-law, Hughette Fafunwa, also present in the audience was equally pleased with the work of her family member. “[Fafunwa] did a great job about giving answers that were important, useful, and true,” she said.
Towards the end of her talk, Fafunwa told the audience the meaning of the phrase that begins the title of her production. “‘Hear word’ is Pidgin for ‘listen and obey,’ you know, ‘listen and comply’ and men would say [to women]....[The production] is not just about listening, you have to adjust your behavior … and say that the community should ‘hear word’ because Nigerian women are speaking the truth,” she said. Fafunwa challenged her audience to “hear word,” and judging from the response of the crowd who intently observed the talk, it seems that they are listening.

In an opening line of the animated film “Your Name,” one of the main characters muses about the universal feeling of having the contents of a dream slip away during the early moments of wakefulness: “The sensation that I’ve lost something lingers long after I wake up,” Mitsuha says. The film, adapted from the novel by Makoto Shinkai, director and screenwriter, follows Taki, a city boy, and Mitsuha, a country girl, who inexplicably switch bodies in what they initially think are mere dreams. A 2016 release, the film was so successful in Japan—it is the country’s second highest-grossing domestic film, behind Hayao Miyazaki’s acclaimed “Spirited Away” (2001)—that the Museum of Fine Arts offered two sold-out screenings of the beloved romantic drama for the inaugural Boston Festival of Films from Japan. Both tragic and hysterical, frustrating and rewarding, “Your Name” is a cinematic masterpiece that explores the consequences of trying to grasp the intangible.
Shinkai updates a familiar trope—famously depicted in America by a mother-daughter duo in “Freaky Friday” (2003) and by a teenage boy and girl in “It’s a Boy Girl Thing” (2006)—by further complicating it spatially and temporally. Mitsuha and Taki come to understand that—surprise!—their switches are more than just a figment of their imagination, a horrifying reality they navigate by leaving each other messages and advice on Taki’s phone and Mitsuha’s notebook. Each comes to appreciate what the other takes for granted: their home. Shinkai alternates between the warmth of the gorgeous green scenery of Japan’s countryside that Mitsuha yearns to leave behind and the scintillating glare off the windows of metropolitan Tokyo’s skyscrapers that Taki glazes over. The two live completely different lives, finding what they were missing each other’s bodies: in Mitsuha’s case, a city to explore but never fully discover, and in Taki’s, a sense of purpose. But as the two grow more accustomed to literally living in each other’s shoes, you begin to wonder when their time will be up, an anticipation Shinkai is acutely aware of. Indeed, the movie’s chief twist forces the crucial question—the answer to which is key to the film’s genius—not just of who or where you are, but of when you are.
“Musubi—knotting. That’s time,” explains Mitsuha’s grandmother to Taki-as-Mitsuha, introducing a metaphor Shinkai actualizes in the animation itself. The lines and strokes that make up the animation are a soft kind of crisp, imitating the precarious but very real situation the characters find themselves in. At a pivotal moment in the film, the animation briefly takes on a more medieval style as Taki and Mitsuha transcend time and space, knotting together their separate realities. Visually stunning, “Your Name” leans on time as a backdrop to beautifully represent the physical and metaphysical world its main characters inhabit. It’s no wonder the film has been compared to “Spirited Away”: Both capture a surreal beauty that reality simply cannot replicate.
The film’s comedic brilliance lies in its subversion of gender norms, both linguistically and behaviorally. Shinkai plays with the complexities of the Japanese language in a hilarious scene when Mitsuha, having woken up in Taki’s body for the first time, addresses herself to Taki’s friends in three different ways before thankfully landing on the appropriate pronoun. “Watashi... “ she begins, using the feminized word for “I”, followed by the more neutral but formal “watakushi,” the informal but youthful “boku,” and, finally, the adequately male and informal “ore.” Meanwhile, across time and space in Mitsuha’s body, Taki succeeds at basketball and defiantly calls out classmates who would gossip about Mitsuha and her relationship with her father, the mayor of their village. Both switched bodies ultimately succeed where the other would otherwise have failed—Taki scores a date with the colleague he has a crush on but is too inexperienced to woo, and Mitsuha becomes more popular as she stops tolerating her bullies’ teasing.
Above all else, “Your Name” is a story about missed connections and the lengths to which two people will go to find that missing link. It questions your understanding of time, space, dreams, and reality. It makes its extraordinary graphics an unforgettable reflection of its narrative. And most importantly, it encourages you to reach out to that person you think you recognize—from a dream, a past life, an accidental glance at an old photograph—and ask for their name.

On paper, NBC’s “A.P. Bio” has all the makings of a successful sitcom. Created by former “Saturday Night Live” writer Mike O’Brien, the show boasts a team of fellow SNL alums, including Seth Meyers (“Late Night with Seth Meyers”) and SNL creator and comedy legend Lorne Michaels. Its plot rests on two overused-because-they-work premises (Disgraced Big Shot Returns Home and Unqualified Teacher Forced to Teach Quirky Group of Students) that, combined with America’s rich tradition of excellent high school-centric television, promises a perfectly entertaining, if not especially inspired, 22 minutes.
This was not the case. Despite the odds stacked in its favor, “A.P. Bio” whiffs spectacularly in its series premiere, an episode that left me wondering whether O’Brien and his team were even trying to get on base.
The episode opens with former Harvard philosophy professor Jack Griffin (a painfully unlikable Glenn Howerton) crashing his car into the sign in front of the Toledo, Ohio high school where he is about to start a new job teaching Advanced Placement Biology (that’s right, this show takes place in the Midwest, baby!). In the show’s first “joke,” he runs at a cyclist with a crowbar. Then, he heads inside to teach without so much as a backward glance. This incident sets the tone for the rest of the episode: disjointed, confusing, and a little upsetting, featuring a string of jokes that range from not-funny to deeply uncomfortable. For instance, Jack bragging about his plans to “bang [his] high school ex as hard as [he] can” is an especially tone-deaf moment given today’s social and political climate.
Right off the bat, as a character, Jack doesn’t give us much to work with. He’s a snarky, self-centered caricature with a bad attitude, whose largely one-dimensional personality is of interest to the viewer only when juxtaposed against his dead mother’s stereotypically “old-womanish” house, where he is living (think florals, crucifixes, and a stair lift—plus, there’s a raccoon on the upper floor somewhere). Unfortunately for the show (and for you, the viewer), the stereotypes don’t end with the Griffin family. Quite the contrary. “A.P. Bio” seems to tick through as many character stereotypes as possible when introducing its cast of characters. The premiere introduces, among others, the awkward, somewhat bumbling principal (Patton Oswalt), the intense-but-dumb gym teacher, the goth “Prince of Darkness,” and his bully (who literally grabs his backpack and throws it into a pond, a display of old school bullying reminiscent of Ice and Jay in the 1993 movie “Hocus Pocus”—for those of you keeping track at home, that means 25-year-old bullying techniques), and several variations on “nerd”—this is A.P. Bio, after all.
However, “A.P. Bio” is not completely without merit. One of the show’s few bright spots is the positively delightful trio of female teachers who seem to be permanently seated in the teachers’ lounge (Mary Sohn, Lyric Lewis, and Jean Villepique). They are witty, real, and immediately engaging. And frankly, the show could stand to see a lot more of them and a lot less of pretty much everyone else. It is also worth mentioning that “A.P. Bio” sees the return to the small screen of Allisyn Ashley Arm (a Disney Channel star of the Demi Lovato era, most notably of “Sonny with a Chance”).
Aside from being deficient in memorable or engaging characters, “A.P. Bio” is also surprisingly lacking in any real plot. Aside from the two tropes that make up the show’s very basic premise, there is very little indication in the premiere as to what direction the season will take. Judging from all of the focus on Jack’s rival, Miles Leonard—who Jack believes has his rightful teaching job at Stanford—it seems likely that the show will follow Jack’s attempt to take down Leonard. We have to assume that the students will factor into this larger plotline, but the pilot gives us no hint as to how.
Not only is there no obvious overarching storyline to the series, but the episode itself is all over the place—and not in a fun “more is more” way. This first episode alone features a surprise rap, a disastrous “date” (spoiler alert: Jack does not actually get to bang his ex as hard as he can), an academic exercise in catfishing, and not one, but two arrests (both involving public urination). All this and more in 22 minutes!
For all its potential on paper, “A.P. Bio” misses the mark in execution and, in several moments, taste. These shortcomings seem largely to be a result of a lack of effort and imagination that is not altogether surprising from a team that has already had their names attached to a show many consider to be the height of TV comedy. As with the show’s protagonist, we know O’Brien and his team are capable of more than they’re giving us now, and we can only hope that going forward they’ll be able to clean up their act.

In an age when Rotten Tomatoes can decide the fate of a movie before it’s even released and streaming keeps people home from theaters, studios have to be more careful than ever about planning their programming. Or they can have someone like Christopher Nolan direct their movies. The 47-year-old London filmmaker is a consistent source of both critical acclaim and box office glory.
10. “Following”I’ll be honest up front: I haven’t seen it. Coming in at 70 minutes, this black and white crime thriller was Nolan’s feature film debut. A little know movie, “Following” shows the life of a writer who stalks strangers for stories until he meets a thief who takes him under his wing. The premise sounds interesting, but it is certainly not known for being his best.
9. “Insomnia”Set in a small, rural town in Alaska, “Insomnia” follows two cops as they investigate a teenage girl’s murder. It has a great cast—Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank—but this movie isn’t as innovative or emotionally powerful as a typical Nolan movie. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that—plenty of directors make movies with common tropes and themes that turn out to be great. But for someone like Nolan, a crime movie set in the middle of nowhere seems too simple and overused a premise for a director whose previous movie was the mind-spinning thriller “Memento,” perhaps because Nolan didn’t write “Insomnia” himself.
8. “Batman Begins”The first installment in Nolan’s “Batman” trilogy, “Batman Begins” starts the trilogy off well. As the introduction to a comic book franchise, it inevitably has to take care of some origin history. We meet young Bruce Wayne and follow him to the League of Shadows, where he trains before becoming Gotham’s caped crusader. What sets “Batman Begins” and the rest of “The Dark Knight Trilogy” apart from other comic book movies is its focus on human emotion and realistic portrayals. The film never feels like an alternate universe—rather, you’re right there with the characters, feeling the impact of every move they make. Many such moments arise from discussions between Wayne and his butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), who serves as the film’s voice of reason: In one powerful scene, he criticizes Wayne for using Batman to prove something to Rachel, rather than helping others out of pure generosity. Alfred says, “Well, we both care for Rachel, sir. But what you’re doing has to be beyond that. It can’t be personal, or you’re just a vigilante.” Such poignant scenes set the tone for the rest of the series.
7. “The Prestige”It’s a shame that this movie has to go so low on this list, but these are Nolan movies after all. Christian Bale hangs up the cape to play Alfred Borden, a magician in 19th-century England. Hugh Jackman plays his competition, Robert Angier, as they battle each other for fame through escalating tricks, ending in…a debate on ethics? Trust me: It’s exciting. The film is fast-paced and requires a keen eye, just like trying to figure out a magic trick. It pivots when Angier goes to visit Nikola Tesla—played by none other than David Bowie—in an effort to replicate Borden’s new, show-stopping trick. Jackman and Bale both play complex characters who sacrifice everything to gain an edge over the other. Angier hinges his integrity and everything he has worked for on Tesla’s invention, while Borden chooses his career over his family. In the final scene, the intricacies of the two characters come to light, along with some major plot twists that are sure to elicit a few gasps.
6. “The Dark Knight Rises”The final installment of what I consider one of the best trilogies of all time, “The Dark Knight Rises” is a rousing send off to Christian Bale’s Batman. He must save his city one last time, which plays out in a paradoxically satisfying way. At first you’re upset with the ending: You watch as Batman flies off into the distance for the last time, carrying a bomb that would have otherwise destroyed Gotham. Batman dies, but Bruce Wayne does not. The day that Alfred sees him in a cafe overseas is the first time he sees the real Bruce Wayne—a fitting end to one of the most complex comic book heroes. And while any villain would have a hard time following Heath Ledger’s brilliant portrayal of the Joker, Tom Hardy proves to be decent as Bane. Fitted with a mask to help him breath, Bane’s deep, reverberating voice fits his menacing frame. The plot isn’t as plausible as the first two films’, with Bane cutting Gotham off from the outside world and threatening to detonate a nuclear bomb. Yet spectacle outshines script in this finale’s tense action scenes, particularly towards the end, when Bane confronts Batman in the center of a larger battle between Gotham police and Bane’s henchmen.
5. “Interstellar”Gorgeous to look at and Neil Degrasse Tyson-approved, “Interstellar” explored the infinite frontier like no other movie had before. When Earth begins to experience Dust Bowl-like symptoms, Matthew McConaughey and co. are sent through a wormhole to find a hospitable planet at the cost of leaving their lives and families back home. “Interstellar” is a voyage of hope and love that revolves around the concept of time, which changes the future of their humanity forever. The first 30 minutes are a little slow, but after that, the film shifts to a beautiful race against time in the depths of space, complemented by a haunting Hans Zimmer score.
4. “Dunkirk”Released last summer, “Dunkirk” represents Nolan’s transition from science fiction to historical drama. The film successfully avoids rehashing the typical style of World War II dramas. Instead of focusing on specific individuals and tackling common themes of the era, “Dunkirk” is a war movie in a literal sense, showing the British rescue of 400,000 people from the point of view of multiple characters whom the viewer never truly meets—Nolan structures the film so the viewer is never formally introduced to the characters. Instead of having long backstories and individual anecdotes show how war affects specific soldiers, “Dunkirk” makes the airlift the center of the plot, not the individuals involved. The result is a war movie that is much larger in scope, using the battle’s events to move the story along. It’s an unusual point of view, but combined with outstanding camerawork, a ticking score from Hans Zimmer, and a little time-bending flair from Nolan, this is one of the best movies of 2017.
3. “Memento”The film that put Nolan on Hollywood’s radar, “Memento” might be his best script. The film follows Leonard, a man who suffers from short-term memory loss searching for his wife’s killer. “Memento” is structured like Leonard’s brain: it is told backwards, revealing the true meaning at the end of the film, which is chronologically the beginning. This structure puts a unique spin on what would otherwise be a typical crime drama. Your head may hurt after this one, but it’s too damn good to pass up.
2. “Inception”Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the main character, which is all you really have to know. DiCaprio plays Cobb, a thief who steals corporate secrets from dreams. One day, he’s asked to plant a dream in someone’s head. “Inception” is another Nolan film that will make your head spin, but arguably in the right direction. What makes this film stand apart from the others may very well be its ending, a scene that has caused an immense amount of debate. Was the top still spinning, or did it begin to fall?
1.  “The Dark Knight”Captivating from beginning to end, “The Dark Knight” is Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece. It maintains the same themes established in “Batman Begins,” only this time, Batman battles a villain who pushes the trilogy from great to exceptional. Heath Ledger plays the Joker, my favorite villain of all time. He is one of the darkest characters to appear on the big screen, and Ledger’s portrayal is remarkable in its unpredictability, always teetering between the polar characteristics of the Joker: clinically insane and unassumingly genius. In his best scene, the Joker attempts to blow up a hospital, and when the detonator doesn’t go off as planned, Ledger improvises. First, he’s calmly disappointed. Then, he frantically pushes the trigger as though it were a broken TV remote. Ledger’s performance in this scene is subtle, but reflects the grueling work and amount of detail that he put into the Joker.
This is one of those movies that I have to watch every time it comes on TV. Not a moment is boring. I admit, it’s extremely dark and hardly uplifting. The Joker is the force behind this darkness, bringing it out of Batman and Harvey Dent, Gotham’s beloved district attorney and the Caped Crusader’s foil. When Batman confronts the Joker in the interrogation room, he is at his weakest, forced to choose between the love of his life and Gotham’s greatest hope. He tries to force answers out of the Joker by physically hurting him, even though he knows he can’t affect his nemesis—as Alfred says, “Some men just want to watch the world burn.” While Batman is only bent, Harvey Dent is broken. His misery transforms him into Two Face, killing whatever was left of Gotham’s “White Knight.” “The Dark Knight” is much more than a superhero movie: It explores law, justice, morality, and—most importantly—humanity. It is the ultimate Nolan film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot happened in the year 2007. J.K. Rowling published “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” Apple released the first iPhone. Will Ferrell, er, George W. Bush was still president. With so many memorable events, it’s not surprising that there were also many memorable movies. From childhood favorites to critical masterpieces, 2007 had something for everyone.
The most unforgettable animated movie from 2007 is undoubtedly that year’s Oscar winner for “Best Animated Feature”: “Ratatouille,” a Disney-Pixar film that follows a lovable rat named Remy as he tries to become a chef in the cuisine-dominated world of France. The movie promotes the message that you can achieve anything no matter who you are, but “Ratatouille” is much more than that. It’s enjoyable to watch, funny, and heartwarming in the best Disney-Pixar way possible. The film epitomizes each of these traits towards the end, when Remy must make a dish for the food critic Anton Ego. Ego’s first taste of Remy’s ratatouille transforms him from a cold, soulless food critic to a giddy kid again. I think that’s what this movie does best—it provokes intense nostalgia for the movies and books that are significant for a whole generation of children. Plus, it made ratatouille look tasty to my nine-year old self.
Another indelible animated movie from 2007 is “Bee Movie.” More of a recent cult hit than a true childhood favorite, this tenth season of “Seinfeld” showed what would happen in a world without bees. Or rather, what would happen if bees could go to college, spend time with humans, and file lawsuits. Both are equally terrifying. Vanessa Bloome (Reneé Zellweger) reflects this fear when Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) first speaks to her. Benson decides to go with a simple “Hi!” instead of the now legendary, “You like jazz?” As most people would, Bloome drops an armful of dishes. As most people wouldn’t, she stabs her hand with a fork to see if she’s dreaming. “Oh! That was a little weird,” responds Benson, who for some reason stays to have a cup of coffee. How was this even made? Regardless of how the movie managed to make it from script to screen, it’s absurdly funny and unorthodoxically amazing.
While our childhood selves focused on animated films and box office hits such as “Transformers” and “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,” the best films of the year were at the top of many critics’ Oscar ballots. Two of the best films ever to vie for Best Picture in a single year, “No Country For Old Men” and “There Will Be Blood” were two masterpieces made by auteurs at the top of their game. Written and directed by the Coen brothers, “No Country For Old Men” is an epic western set on the US-Mexican border in Texas. While the script and cast are both excellent, no one stands out in this film quite like Javier Bardem. His character, ultimate badass Anton Chigurh, is right behind Heath Ledger’s Joker in the running for best villain of the 21st century. Armed with a captive bolt gun that literally puts holes in heads, Chigurh has no backstory. He is only out for the money taken after a drug deal gone wrong. In a character-defining scene, he blows up a car at a gas station after suffering a shot to the leg, just to steal medical supplies. He later nurses himself back to health, all the while displaying little to no emotion.  It’s no wonder that Bardem received an Academy Award for this portrayal.
In “There Will Be Blood,” written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance in a career full of them, this time as oil entrepreneur Daniel Plainview in late-19th century southern California. Day-Lewis shines as a character who loses himself in his desire for fortune, ruining his relationship with his adopted son in the process. Paul Dano also stands out as a young preacher named Eli Sunday who chastises Plainview’s lack of faith. The film is incredibly visual—the first 15 to 20 minutes contain no dialogue. Aside from the acting performances by Day-Lewis and Dano, my favorite part of the movie is the final scene. There is, in fact, blood. Lots of it.
While “No Country for Old Men” and “There Will Be Blood” get most of the acclaim for film in 2007, the year is not complete without a mention of “Atonement.” A decade before Christopher Nolan released “Dunkirk,” Joe Wright gave a glimpse into the famous British rescue in this film. Starring Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, and a very young Saoirse Ronan, “Atonement” depicts how the lives of Cecilia (Knightley) and Robbie (McAvoy) change forever after an extreme misinterpretation by Cecilia’s sister Briony (Ronan) in early 20th century England. Cecilia continues to live her upper class life while Robbie joins the war effort. Both continue to wonder how their lives would have been different if they could have been together.
A beautiful love story anchored by an Oscar-winning score, this film boasts incredible visuals as well. One particular scene—an almost five minute take on the beach of Dunkirk—encompasses the fear, death, and hope of the stranded British. With smoke rising all around, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey moves the camera all around the beach, showing soldiers loading their guns, officers shooting horses, grounded ships, mothers clutching their children, an ominous Ferris wheel in the distance, and a group of soldiers singing in a gazebo. In a single, uncut shot, McGarvey shows the nightmare of war through every angle imaginable. War is hell, and “Atonement” shows it without flinching.

Diversity spans spectrums of race, gender, sexuality, mental health, and disability.  These spectrums, however, aren’t always obvious considering the straight, white heterosexual and cisgender perspectives that have dominated the young adult canon. To celebrate Valentine’s Day, here are the five Young Adult books that feature diverse romances.
5. “Call Me by Your Name” by André Aciman
“And I’ll call you by mine.”
Although the movie is much more well-known today, the novel, written in 2007, was a triumph in its own right. It features two gay, Jewish boys who fall in love with each other during a summer in Italy. The movie is beautifully-made, but the book evokes nostalgia and remembrances of love through the two main characters. If you want to cry over a modern romance, read this book about joyful heartbreak (yes, this is an oxymoron, but you’ll see what I mean).
4. “Six of Crows” by Leigh Bardugo
This book’s action-packed plot features racial diversity, bisexuality, feminine boys, and characters who cope with mental disorders like PTSD. Kaz and Inej’s romance is a heartstopping slow burn. Moreover, their relationship is based on a healthy friendship. While Kaz will simply melt your heart, Inej, a trained spy, will sneakily steal it. The other romance, between two of the male characters, is full of flirtation and coy dialogue and adds to the diversity of the novel.
3. “Fangirl” by Rainbow Rowell
The story follows Cath, who suffers from anxiety stemming from her introversion. She has to figure out her life without her twin and college smacks her in the face, which constantly makes her feel uncool compared to others. This book features a cute, feel-good romance where the male lead is fundamentally flawed, as all humans are. If you’re looking for a relatable, college romance that is, for once, realistic about family issues and anxiety, pick up “Fangirl” this Valentine’s Day!
2. "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian" by Sherman Alexie
This book is a classic. Sure, there are no couples or explicit romances, but reading a Native American teenager’s experiences in high school is eye-opening and beautiful. Junior, who goes to a school where “the only other Indian is the mascot” has to navigate his life as the only Native American among white people who just don’t get it. This book is a reminder to appreciate the big things before they get taken away. The story will nostalgically tug at heartstrings and open readers up to the thoughts of the much-needed perspective of one Native American teen.
1. “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” by Jenny Han
This three-part saga features the pastel book covers typical of YA romances, yet one of its main elements is uncommon for a YA book: It features Asian American women. The novel follows the life of an Asian American teenager, her first boyfriend, and—you guessed it!—all the boys she’s loved before. The book shines not because of its content, but rather for what it represents: The Asian American woman is not a geisha, a fetish, or a side-character. All in all, this is a fun read full of intrigue that is perfect for Valentine’s Day.

This past November, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston hosted a conversation with artist Steve McQueen in conjunction with “Ashes,” a video installation featured in the 2015 Venice Biennale and that had its U.S. début at the museum. By the time I arrived, exactly 17 minutes ahead of Harvard time, it was too late for me to secure a seat inside the theater. The alternative was the video livestream set up in the lobby, where a a small cluster of rather uncomfortable-looking chairs faced a large HD-television. I cleared a spot for myself on the concrete floor.
McQueen spent his formative years at premiere artistic institutions, and then entered commercial filmmaking, receiving critical acclaim in both fields. He holds an Academy Award for Best Picture—the first given to a black filmmaker—and won the Turner Prize in 1999.
Lectures and hosted conversations with artists, especially artists one admires, can be tricky territory. Not everyone can—or is willing to—be concise and articulate about their work. Some artists stray too far into abstraction, or fail to offer substantial details on their own process of artmaking. Dialogues can be stilted or exclusionary, and rambly, half-formed questions from audience members can be cringeworthy. Sometimes there is the feeling that we demand too much. Isn’t art all the more arresting when we let it speak for itself?
I saw “Ashes,” still on view now, for the first time this spring. I walked right into it without realizing who had made it and for what purpose.The room is cavernous, set up with a large screen in the middle and two benches for seating on each side. On the left portion of the screen is the title’s namesake, a virile and beautiful fisherman who moves into an ever-expanding horizon, occasionally glancing back at the viewer. On the other side—transporting us years into the future—is the painstaking making of his grave. The two sides continuously bound and transform each other.
Because of its vibrant tactility, I lingered longest in front of the left side. Ashes’ back is warm, gleaming and brown in a way that feels like kin. The creamsicle-orange edge of the boat that supports him still lingers in my mind. Then: the cream rope and shell around his neck, the muscular feet, the shock of blonde hair. And because he is a black body—a black body half-naked—his figure speaks not only to his own presence but to that of many others, both dead and alive, along with the various mythologies and gazes that inform our understanding of them. And he is beautiful.
Each time I see a black body in a work of art I think of what it carries—death, violence, transgression. I am never sure if this notion—that the black body exists as symbol, a thing to be read into, fragmented, figured—is warranted. Often, whiteness is the standard of measurement, presumed to be equally constructed as all forms of Otherness, but rarely ever dissected with the same frequency. I, above all else, value and aspire to joy and possibility. Thankfully, I also find this everywhere. I see it in the music of Sun-Ra, in the hieroglyphic imaginings of Afro-futurism, in Solange Knowles’ precise and graceful gestures on stage, and the monochromatic color schemes she and her dancers wear as the uniform of both now and forever.
Is black art just an ever-shifting pendulum swing between pessimism and possibility? In “How to See A Work of Art in Total Darkness,” cultural studies and art scholar Darby English writes, “Black art is never the obvious or inevitable result of a black artist’s creative labor. It is rather a regime whose sharp redress is sometimes required for meaningful aesthetic and intellectual advancement.” The idea of the “obvious” or “inevitable” is a prevailing throughline in how we interpret and discuss art by black people. Yet English prompts us to remember that its meaning should be contextualized and never taken for granted. The so-called definitive “black experience” is always being negotiated, and engages with many entangled systems of interpretation and representation—black and white, modern and post-modern.
That day in November, two American curators inquired into Steve McQueen’s relationship to the politics of representation. One was black, the other was not. With an impulse that was frustrating but admittedly familiar to me, the black critic’s questions would often pivot back to the art in conjunction to its supposed blackness, sometimes projecting the critic’s own experiences as a black American onto McQueen. Each time McQueen would insist on the importance of specificity, in regards to both the contexts that shaped him and his artistic practice. McQueen currently works and lives in the Netherlands, but grew up in the United Kingdom and has familial roots in Grenada, Trinidad, and the United States. He made reference to his personal history, expressing a definitively diasporic point of view and prioritizing individuality and contradiction.
Ashes is someone we are able to miss and mourn precisely because he is a person, a presence both solid and ephemeral, and perhaps like all black life, precarious. He is not a mere symbol, because McQueen created the installation with the weighty purpose of giving dignity to another human’s life. All other profound inquiries—the homoeroticism in the camera’s gaze, the reference to economic and social structures that resulted in Ashes’ death—arise naturally due to the attentive, artful recording of his bodily presence.
Pivoting towards the universal and human is not necessarily a cop-out. James Baldwin writes, “the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, temples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have.”  We are all bounded and responsible, part of systems both large and small. “Ashes” reminds us of the contradictions we continuously move through, and leaves us with the weight of what may soon be absent.
—Staff writer Elodie A. Saint-Louis' column, "In Total Darkness," is about black contemporary art in the Cambridge and Boston area.

In the first few moments of “The Alienist,” a shrivelled up mutilated face with blackened eyes fills the screen, and ominous chords play as the camera zooms in. Though its time period and setting are reminiscent of the darker works of Edith Wharton, the show breaks more rules than simply those of social decorum. Its combination of intriguing premise, seamless production, and haunting aesthetic bring to life the gritty underground world of crime and corruption in the Gilded Age.
Based on the novel of the same name, “The Alienist” is set in 1897 New York City. The premiere opens with the murder of a young boy prostitute on the newly-built Williamsburg Bridge. The police find the body butchered and mangled with its eyes plucked out, which draws the attention of German doctor Laslo Kreizler (Daniel Brühl). Kreizler is an alienist, a member of early psychiatrists who believed that those suffering from mental illness were “alienated” from their true natures. He recruits newspaper illustrator John Moore (Luke Evans), police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Geraghty), and Roosevelt’s secretary Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning) to investigate this brutal and heinous crime.
From the start, the series feels dark and grimy. The shots are moody and visually quite monotone to set up an ominous feeling. The mini-series jumps right into the crime scene where we see the wreckage of the body dressed in blood–soaked, gossamer white dress. When Kreizler is tipped off about the murder, he is instantly intrigued as it reminds him of a previous case. He sends Moore to illustrate the crime, which the police officers are almost refusing to investigate as it would involve antagonizing powerful and corrupt underlords. The audience is first introduced to Moore as he is in the arms of a prostitute with whom he shares a complicated relationship. The next few episodes explore their convoluted history,which turns out not to be the focus. Roosevelt is also introduced early on. He is a stoic commissioner with firm rules and principles, unwilling to have Kreizler involved in the case. From the start, it is easy to see that their conflicting methodologies will cause many bumps over the course of the investigation and these dark personalities are more than a match for their surroundings.
Meanwhile, Kreizler recognizes the butchering from a previous vicious crime and believes that both crimes were committed by the same disturbed mind. Three years ago, he treated a young boy from the Kreitz family, who liked to dress up in his sister’s clothes. When this boy and his sister went missing, panic was widespread until their dead bodies were eventually found. While his sister’s body remained relatively untouched, the boy Ben’s body was ravaged. Part of Kreizler’s interest in the crime stems from his own guilt as he believes that he is to blame. He asked the Kreitz family to tolerate and accept their son’s crossdressing, but it seems that it was precisely this habit which prompted the murderer to act.
Unlike many in its genre, this crime series does a good job of showing tragedies, particularly of these young innocent boys whose personalities were not accepted by those of their time. Rather than focusing solely on the lives of the detectives and the murderer, the show stresses the victim and his death’s brutality so that the audience does not forget why they are watching the show. Other scenes add on to the injustice and pity the audience feels: The doctor visits a criminal institution and mental ward where patients scream as they are brutally mistreated. The rattling chains and blood–curdling screams clearly take a leaf out of gothic books, and add to the chilling aesthetic that the show strives to create.
Daniel Brühl plays Kreizler with darkness that is balanced by his sensitivity, as his character earnestly tries to do the right thing, but gets somewhat lost in the intensity of the crime and politics of investigation. His approach to solving the murder is methodical and rooted in understanding—and almost becoming—the criminal. This in itself is not revolutionary at all, but Brühl’s charisma is inviting, keeping you riveted. Fanning (as Howard) is another great addition to the show, with her dry quips, strength, and concern. Her fierce, chain-smoking, high-society character remains wreathed in a cloud of mystery, but it is clear that she takes her position as the only woman in the police department seriously.
If you are looking for a revolutionary mystery and crime series, “The Alienist” will not provide that. However, its haunting intensity is intriguing enough to entice its audience to stick around for at least the first few episodes.

Netflix’s latest original show has sent us 300 years into the future, when they still curiously use the phrase “get laid.” “Altered Carbon” is a sci-fi series based on Richard K. Morgan’s novel of the same name, and stars Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs, a prisoner who has been forced to return from the dead to solve a rich man’s murder. In the show’s future time period, everyone has “stacks” stored within their consciousness so that when they die, they can be put in another “sleeve” (body). If the stack is destroyed, they’re dead forever. The main character is Takeshi Kovacs, a dangerous prisoner who’s committed more murders than he can count, who has been re-sleeved to work for Laurens Bancroft, a man with a mansion in the clouds and more money than he knows what to do with.
At first, the beginning of the episode is a bit hard to understand because the exposition is somewhat convoluted. The pilot’s director, Miguel Sapochnik, lets the first few minutes unfold with several different indications of what the premise could be. Is this a zombie show? Is this a zombie show about zombie prisoners?  If you watch, don’t allow yourself to become sidetracked with the new lingo and prison setup. All will be explained.
Some details about the future, in case you’re feeling curious: drugs delivered through eye–droppers, all of us appearing to be polyglots, shape-shifting strippers, a new name for the United States, hovering limos, and very cool visuals. The premiere suffers somewhat from inconsistent anachronism—the people of the future don’t use the word “body” anymore, but still have those red, white, and blue barber-shop poles—but the overarching concept is exciting. It’s a mystery, but it’s also an exploration of how society will change in hundreds of years. Capitalism is taken to the extreme, as we see that wealth gives people autonomy over the sleeves they’ll inhabit. At one point, a seven-year-old from a poor family is put in the body of an old woman.
Aesthetically, the best part is the contrast between the grimy city and the almost “Alice in Wonderland”–esque color scheme of Bancroft’s world. Its grand interiors are breathtaking. Laurens is married to the regal Miriam, who was the first of many women throughout the pilot to have her breasts exposed. I note this not as an inherent criticism of nudity, but as a reminder that intention is relevant. The periodic female nudity does not ring as a stab at a “free the nipple” sort of gender equality. Instead, it feels gratuitous. It feels like they were just working under the theory that sex sells—most, if not all, of the women in the show so far express some sort of attraction to Kovacs.

The Feb. 8 and 9 “Migration and the Humanities” conference, organized by the Mahindra Humanities Center, set out to illustrate a point: that the humanities are a powerful way of understanding the modern migratory experience.
The conference, held in the Piper Auditorium at the Graduate School of Design, spanned a range of activities, including a musical performance by the Silkroad Ensemble and a series of panels. On the first day, University President Drew G. Faust made opening remarks and author Junot Díaz gave a keynote reading.
Throughout the conference, isolation, hardship, and a certain physical transience that comes with being in motion emerged as the common themes of migration.
This poetic take on a gritty subject was at the heart of the conference’s message. Professor Homi K. Bhabha, the Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, placed strong emphasis on the role that art can play in political discussions. “The very thought of freedom in the mind brings freedom to the body,” Bhabha said in his opening remarks.
University President Drew G. Faust was equally committed. She began the entire conference with an assertion that characterized the rest of her speech: “Migration is a central and defining issue for this moment in history.” Bhabha and Faust both brushed up against politics (both speakers mentioned the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, for example), but their words centered on the human experience.
It was Junot Díaz, however, who took center stage as the evening’s keynote speaker.He set out to tell the audience what was on his mind both “aesthetically and politically”—a prompt that led him to far-ranging responses. Díaz discussed his native country, the Dominican Republic, the particular burden of the female migrant, and the intersection of the “Me Too” movement with what he deemed the USA’s desire to label Latinx people “rapists.”
Audience members said they appreciated Díaz’s demeanor and passion for his subject. Melissa Q. Tang, a Cambridge resident, initially came to see Bhabha speak, but she left as a Díaz fan. “I’m completely wooed by Junot Díaz and how down to earth he is, how connected to communities he is,” Tang said. “And how unafraid he is to talk about things that he says were, quote, ‘mushy,’ like love.”
Others were more drawn to the conversation between Bhabha, Díaz, and New York Times book critic Parul Sehgal. “I really loved it,” attendee Anna M. Agathangelou said. “I enjoyed Junot’s points a lot. I think he was actually making some crucial interventions, and crediting Homi Bhabha along with Sehgal’s ways of thinking about art and migration.”
The conversation tended towards the “art” side: All three speakers discussed how the humanities give specifics to an abstraction. While the topics ranged widely, the three often focused on individual words (“death,” “spectrality”) and the type of artistic representation that Díaz called “granular.”
The three panelists did not reach any conclusions about the complicated debates they brought up, but they weren’t supposed to do so. The point of the conference was to hold a public discussion, to get people thinking about how art represents the migratory experience. “Protest is, after all, another form of poetry,” Bhabha said in his opening remarks—and the “Migration and the Humanities” conference included a heavy dose of both.

The Weeknd is “ready for a war again,” but only if he can remain at a safe distance. In “Pray For Me,” the third single from the album accompanying the soon-to-be released film “Black Panther,” superstars Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd struggle to stuff their artistic expression into the prescriptive box of a pop film soundtrack. The Weeknd and Lamar are tasked with creating an impassioned, introspective track to reveal the psyche of the film’s protagonist, King T’Challa. In a failed attempt to embody the energy of the protagonist, these artists color so far inside the lines that they fail to promote the king’s journey.
The track begins with a few seconds of a distilling synth and then immediately focuses into a hyper-contemporary electronic sound. The sound is reminiscent of the bassline from Kanye West’s “On Sight,” but it is less effective at creating mood. The beat panders to the expectant audience rather than making a statement for itself. It rushes along, sweeping The Weeknd and Lamar along with it, which results in a track that seems more content with being finished than being completed. The Weeknd’s verse follows, and his often lofty, emotive voice lacks its usual force. His delivery is so casual and disinterested that it stands in stark contrast to his visceral lyrics “I'm always ready to take a life again/ You know I'll ride again.” Rather than celebrating King T’Challa’s spirit, The Weeknd’s tone trivializes it, making it feel like something to be diminished rather than to be appreciated.
A short pause precedes Kendrick’s verse, and it momentarily seems like the song is regrouping. Kendrick begins spitting, but it becomes immediately evident that he feels constricted. His inhibition is obvious, especially considering how, when autonomous, Kendrick is arguably the most versatile M.C. of the 21st century. He is capable of seamlessly incorporating intricate poetry and complex characters into his work,  but when he raps, “If I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good/ Then that’s what it gotta be,” it sounds like it could have been written by someone else. It would be too reductive to suggest this is Kendrick at his worst, though. This is Kendrick acknowledging his vision doesn’t fit within the scope of the project and ceding some of his creative rights. But if Kendrick is meant to be the internal monologue of a galvanized king, then he grossly lacks inspiration.
Lamar and The Weeknd vacillate between passive observers and champions of King T’Challa’s cause in a way that comes off as disorganized and unenthused. Taking into consideration the constraints of making music for a film soundtrack, it’s easier to excuse this result from two usually eminent artists. Even after acknowledging the film’s context though, Lamar and The Weeknd still complicitly pander to the status quo. In what at times feels more like contrived emotion than genuine expression, Kendrick and The Weeknd deliver a less than memorable performance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I woke up at 8:08 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 13. I sleepily rolled over and glanced, still bleary-eyed, at my phone. After a second of processing, I shot out of bed, sprinting down the hallway as my whole body throbbed in terror.
One minute before, at 8:07 a.m., my phone received the alert: BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
I nearly ploughed into my mom, who was on the phone with my brother. We were at my uncle’s house on Maui, and my brother was on the opposite side of the island warming up for his tennis tournament. My mom had already called my dad, who was home alone on the Big Island. My dad barricaded himself inside our bathroom with my dog, but after a few minutes he went and stood outside in our driveway—he refused to die in a bathroom. He left Sparky inside.
I sat with my mom and uncle along the hallway wall and frantically tried to call my tennis coach. Like any other Saturday, he held 8 a.m. tennis practice at the public park near my house. He didn’t answer the phone, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the elementary schoolers chattering away, wildly swinging at tennis balls and completely unaware of an impending North Korean attack. I texted my brother to make sure he was inside and told him that I loved him.
Then, we waited.
Military experts estimate that a North Korean missile would take 20 minutes to reach Hawaii, and residents would have about 12 minutes of notice before impact. After 10 or 15 minutes, we started to realize that it couldn’t be real. We scoured TV channels and online news for any information about what was going on. No one was covering it.
Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard tweeted at 8:19 a.m. that the alarm was false. She went on CNN shortly afterwards, which is when we finally heard that there was no immediate threat. The state did not send out an official false alarm message until 38 minutes after the initial alert.
My story is relatively unexciting compared to others. Some people pulled mattresses over bathtubs to shield themselves. Some stuffed their children down manhole covers in an effort to protect them from a blast. Some stood on their porches with binoculars. Many called their family members to say goodbye, certain they would be dead within minutes.
Once it became clear that the alert was false, emotions quickly turned from fear and sadness to anger, and rightly so. I’m angry, too. I’m angry that the state government is inept, and I’m angry that my home is at their mercy. I’m angry that 9 and 10 year olds asked me the “what ifs” of nuclear war on the tennis court when I got home, and I didn’t have any answers for them.
That was exactly one month ago today. For many people, especially on the mainland United States, the 38 minute Hawaiian missile crisis has faded away, a shocking headline that dissipated as the news cycle moved on. But it hasn’t gone away for me.
We drove out to Lahaina a few hours later to cheer on my brother in his tennis matches. I sat with my uncle and squinted through the fence, my shoulders becoming progressively more sunburned. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.
As I watched my brother change sides, I realized that I had never really paid attention to the unusual way he walks. He towers over me at six feet one inches tall, yet he has a remarkably short stride for his height.
I’m furious with myself that it took the threat of a North Korean attack to notice that about my own brother. I’ve always prided myself on being conscious of the ordinary, grateful for the small beauties around me. But I couldn’t even start to comprehend all I have to be grateful for before Jan. 13.
When you feel like your biggest accomplishment of the day is not being killed by a ballistic missile, everything becomes extraordinary. Of course, there was no missile; nothing happened. But somehow even brushing my teeth that night felt miraculous.
Since then, I’ve been tormented by forgotten things I should remember. Why couldn’t I remember the model of the car my teacher drove to school? Why couldn’t I remember the shape of the doorknob I use every time I walk inside my house? Why couldn’t I remember the way it felt when I hugged my dad for what really could have been the last time?
These used to just be incidental curiosities, observations that made me feel good for “being present” in the world. They have now assumed a fierce and immediate importance. Someone has to take notice of them, because I have reached the jarring conclusion that they could all be vaporized in a matter of minutes. Not just me, but everything and everyone that I love.
I hope no one has to ever experience what Hawaii experienced a few weeks ago. But don’t wait for a ballistic missile to notice the blessedness of the ordinary. Paying attention to the seemingly ordinary details of the world cannot be postponed or put off for a more convenient time.
It only takes a few extra seconds, and we never really know how many of those we have left.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s impossible to ignore that Lawrence S. Bacow is the second white, male economist named Lawrence to serve as Harvard’s president. And for a student of color who has constantly struggled to see himself represented at the University, the choice is uninspiring and frankly a bit disappointing.Since the beginning of the search, stakeholders noted the need for a diverse slate of candidates. In 2007, University President Drew G. Faust made history as Harvard’s first female president. This time around, there was hope the next president would be another woman or, for the first time in Harvard’s 381-year history, a person of color. Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and University Professor Danielle S. Allen were both floated as possible, and highly capable, candidates of color. The presidential search committee’s secrecy makes it impossible to know, however, if there were any other candidates of color and how seriously they were considered for the position. Ultimately, the search committee decided on a candidate matching the demographics of 27 of the last 28 presidents. There’s no reason to believe that Bacow will not be a capable president. He has administrative experience and an intensely intimate understanding of Harvard, having served on its highest governing body. If his track record at Tufts serves as any indication, he could be great for students from marginalized backgrounds. As president of Tufts University, he oversaw the near doubling of financial aid available and the establishment of an Office of Institutional Diversity. On paper, he could be better for students of color than any of his predecessors.Regrettably, his presidency won’t improve the extreme lack of role models for students of color to look up to.As of 2017, only 3.2 percent of Harvard faculty members were female underrepresented minorities. 5.4 percent were male underrepresented minorities. As of 2014, only 14 percent of executive, administrative, and managerial roles were filled by ethnic minorities. Meanwhile, 64 percent of service and maintenance staff members were minorities. Black and Latino Harvard students see themselves more represented in the dining hall and service staff than they do in the classroom or Massachusetts Hall. If the 29th president of Harvard were a person of color, non-white students could have looked to the most powerful position in higher education and seen themselves. At a time when the average university president in the United States is a 62-year-old married white male with a doctorate, Harvard could have stood out as an exception. An institution known for its history could have been lauded for choosing a leader that looked like the future. Instead, Harvard chose a 66-year-old married white male with a doctorate. Representation alone would not improve the experiences of underrepresented minorities at Harvard. Institutional support requires a commitment by administrators, regardless of their gender or ethnicity. But when the walls of our dining halls and libraries are dominated with portraits of white men, it’s important to see that brown and black faces have a role in influencing the trajectory of an institution we love dearly. The disappointment that I, and a number of other Harvard students of color, felt at the announcement of Bacow comes from the fear that people of color hold miniscule say in how our university is run. Bacow’s responsibility now lies in dissuading that fear. He has to make a concerted effort to meet with students and faculty of color and hear their complaints. He must learn from student activists instead of dismissing them. Bacow must acknowledge where Harvard fails and commit to making improvements that will ensure students don’t have reasons to doubt that they belong here.Harvard’s next president does not look like me. He does not look like the majority of the freshman class or classes to come. He does not understand, first-hand, what it means to be reduced to your gender or the color of your skin.He must listen when students explain that race and gender alter the kind of Harvard experience they have. And, more than that, he must prepare Harvard and its students for a future that is increasingly dependent on the expertise of women and people of color. Ruben E. Reyes Jr. ’19, a former Editorial Chair, is a History and Literature concentrator in Leverett House.

America.
Has a ring to it, doesn’t it?
I remember lying next to my grandmother in bed as a 10-year-old, tucked under the covers with my cousins as we attentively listened to her recount stories of Italy and communist Yugoslavia: of her idyllic Istrian childhood among the goats and chickens and bunnies and geese, of the prohibition of religion, the baptisms done in secret, and the secret police force, and of her father’s escape across the border to Italy in the dead of night chased by dogs.
But I remember most the stories about what came after. The stories about America—the place that gave her a chance. The place that allowed her and my great-grandmother to thrive.
As we both worked at the kitchen table late at night, I remember talking to my father about his childhood in Italy: of the summers playing soccer on Italian beaches, of the shenanigans and harsh experiences of Italian military school, of being an officer and living with my mother in the Tuscan countryside.
But I remember most the stories about what came after. How my father convinced my mother to come back to the States for a better life, and how that decision was the best they could have ever made.
Immigration is an act of defiance. It’s an upheaval of one’s current life in the hope (but never certain expectation) of something better. It requires a grit—a persistence—that not all people exercise. Furthermore, that grit not only stays with those who immigrate, but is passed down from generation to generation, and it affects every facet of one’s life.
Maybe that’s why I trust Lawrence S. Bacow, the 29th president of Harvard, to do his utmost to improve our community and serve the University well. Indeed, Bacow’s grit has already shown itself in his life as a servant to higher education.
As president of Tufts University, Bacow oversaw the largest fundraising effort in the university’s history. The Beyond Boundaries campaign, which took place during one of the most economically challenging times in decades, raised $1.2 billion for the university. This financial acumen and fundraising experience is especially vital given the University’s financial troubles, including an underperforming endowment and an incoming endowment tax that will likely affect University projects. Financial acumen, however, is useless without effective and just allocation of these resources to disadvantaged and underprivileged individuals.
Humble beginnings are a prominent facet of any immigrant family’s lore. Bacow’s parents, much like my grandmother, were refugees escaping persecution. His mother lived through Auschwitz. Obviously, these experiences don’t leave one unaffected. On the contrary, they imbue someone and their descendents with a sense of obligation to make the world a better place and aid those who need it most.
Bacow’s commitment to equalizing the educational playing field for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged exemplifies this sentiment. During the Beyond Boundaries campaign at Tufts, the university allocated $434 million towards financial aid and other scholarships. Additionally, under Bacow’s tenure at Tufts, the university instituted programs including scholarships for Tufts summer school, the elimination of student loans for families with modest incomes, paid summer internships at nonprofits, and Tuft’s first university-wide loan repayment assistance program. Overall, under Bacow’s leadership, Tufts increased the amount of financial aid it distributes by 94 percent.
These actions, positions, and initiatives more than clearly demonstrate Bacow’s commitment to creating opportunity for students who are less fortunate.
Diversity is also a vital part of the history of those who have immigrated to America. The United States certainly has deep problems concerning xenophobia. Nevertheless, without a baseline understanding of the fact that our differences make us stronger, eventual integration into American society would have been impossible for not only my family, but also all immigrants’ families.
In keeping with his immigrant roots, Harvard’s next president has shown his passion for diversity throughout his life. Although Tufts admissions statistics during his presidency show mixed results with respect to diversity, during his time at Tufts, Bacow founded the Office of Institutional Diversity and helped create other diversity-related initiatives. Furthermore, he served under the Obama administration on the task force advising historically black colleges and universities. This further demonstrates a dedication to publicly serve in the interest of creating a more diverse nation.
Yes, Bacow is a white male.  So, is he the most diverse candidate on the planet? Of course not.
But when I next talk to Papá and Nonna about why they came to America, I’ll know to approach this new chapter of Harvard’s history with optimism, confidence, and hope.

With the announcement of Lawrence S. Bacow as Harvard’s 29th president, the University is poised for new conversations, changes, and reforms. Few of those conversations will be as difficult, uncomfortable, or painful as those concerning sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. In recent days, this issue has again risen to the forefront amid reports that the federal government launched an investigation into Harvard in 2016 for failing to respond “promptly and equitably” to a complaint of sexual assault at the College. Although this case dates back two years, it is indicative of a much larger problem—Reports of sexual violence have risen by 65% since 2016. It is precisely for these reasons that Harvard must do more. We challenge the University to rethink and revamp the complex bureaucracy surrounding sexual harassment and assault.
There are too many dimensions encompassing sexual harassment and violence—including reporting mechanisms, counseling services, and academic accommodations—for us to fairly and effectively appraise the entirety of Harvard’s Title IX Office and Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. Rather than discuss these offices at length, we urge the University to focus on the following actionable steps to better protect students.
Harvard students, faculty members, and affiliates need to engage in thoughtful, carefully facilitated conversations about sexual violence in order to support and protect one another. Yet we find that the current sexual harassment and assault trainings offered are in many ways inadequate to fulfill this goal. In-person trainings are required only at the start of freshman year. This enables issues of sexual harassment and assault to recede into the dim recesses of students’ memories, only to reemerge after an incident has occurred.
These conversations further fade into the background despite the online training modules mandated each fall. We find these modules unengaging and ineffective—watching short video clips and answering a few multiple choice questions once a year does little to encourage critical thought about such a challenging issue. A better solution is an in-person group training, which we believe would facilitate difficult conversations to occur and allow peers to hold each other accountable.
Having attended trainings held by various student organizations ourselves, we find that they too often fail to provide clear suggestions on how to diffuse and respond to dangerous situations at student-run events. While a range of trainings are offered, we find that they more often nebulously ask organizations to consider their identities and values rather than provide opportunities for concrete conversations about rape culture or sexual harassment. These flaws leave student leaders without proper guidance on how to be active allies and protect their members.
While we believe it is undoubtedly the responsibility of OSAPR to improve these trainings, we also believe that, in the words of Joe Biden, preventing sexual assault is ultimately “on us.” We have an obligation to our friends, classmates, peers, and even total strangers to educate ourselves on sexual assault. This issue should carry additional weight on Harvard’s campus given that in 2015, for example, 31.2 percent of female seniors reported being assaulted during their college years. That percentage should be zero.
If current trainings are inadequate, we should proactively take the time to learn how to help one another. This can be as simple as writing down the number of an assault hotline, or as complex as researching Harvard’s tangled list of resources for survivors. But it is not enough for us to click through a few slides on a computer screen. We, along with offices dedicated to sexual harassment and assault, can and must do more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was a little girl, I was thrilled by the concept of marriage. Inspired by the Disney and Barbie movies I watched over and over, I daydreamed of being swept off my feet by Mr. Right and walking down the aisle in a poofy dress. In the years since, my views on why I want to get married, when I want to get married, and who I want to marry have changed. But, I’m still pretty sure that I do indeed want to get married.
Which is part of the reason why June 26, 2015 was a life-changing day for me. As a queer woman who’s considering marrying another woman, the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of marriage equality opened doors for me. And beyond guaranteeing the right to marriage, the Supreme Court ruling made national news, increasing visibility of LGBTQ+ people and issues. One study showed that the passage of marriage equality in individual states led to a decrease in the overall teen suicide attempt rate and an even greater decrease among the lesbian, gay, and bisexual teen populations in those states. Marriage equality has had a quantifiable positive effect, even on populations not immediately affected by the ruling. Clearly, it’s an important step forward. Before I continue, I want to point out that I am speaking from a privileged position because I’ve never been seriously concerned about the logistics of marriage. Marriage equality came about when I was only 16. Unlike many before me, I won’t have to move to live in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage, and I won’t have to worry about whether my marriage will still be recognized if I move to a different state. Because of the efforts of the movement that began decades before I was born, if I do decide to marry, the process will be a lot smoother than it was in 2014. Having discussed all the wonderful parts about marriage equality, it’s important to realize that marriage isn’t the end-all-be-all of the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. It never was, it never will be, and any suggestion that it is is naive at best and detrimental to the movement at worst. Unpacking the institution of marriage reveals its roots in heteronormativity and sexism. The history of marriage includes traditions of women being passed around like property from their fathers to husbands. Even seemingly sweet gestures, like the groom asking the bride’s father for her hand in marriage or the father walking the bride down the aisle while the groom stands alone and independent, all reinforce women’s dependence on men while men remain independent and authoritative.
Don’t get me wrong: I enjoy watching “Say Yes to the Dress” as much as the next person, but I recognize that the emphasis on the bride’s dress stems from the stereotype that women are inherently more interested in clothing and appearances. Even small details like the bride becoming a Mrs. while the groom remains a Mr. his entire adult life subtly remind us that a woman’s status is based on her relationship to a man. Although many people are slowly moving away from this model and trying to make the marriage process more equal, the marriage traditions that we grew up with and still see today covertly and overtly reinforce strict binary gender norms in heterosexual relationships. There’s nothing wrong with queer couples wanting to get married—in fact, it’s great to see the queering of traditional notions of marriage. But, marketing marriage equality as the most important goal for the LGBTQ+ movement implies that the most important people in the movement are monogamous gay couples looking to get married. This ignores queer people who don’t want to get married. Moreover, this overemphasis on marriage plays into respectability politics, in which queer people feel pressured to mimic heterosexual norms to make queerness more palatable to the rest of society. It adds to the idea that there’s a “right” kind of way to be queer, which is to settle down into a monogamous marriage and eventually get married and have kids. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with that life path, it’s one of many and should not be idealized. The myth of marriage being the “one” queer issue perpetuates the idea that our community can only focus on one issue at once. This ignores other pressing concerns, such as workplace and housing discrimination; violence against trans people (specifically trans women of color and queer homeless youth); bathroom access for trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people; and a lack of accurate representation in media. There are also concerns that some may not see as directly queer, but which matter to the LGBTQ+ movement because of the intersectional identities of members of our community. These include income inequality, police brutality, mass incarceration, immigration, sexual assault, and more. We must be as fervent in addressing these issues as we were in fighting for marriage equality. So, it’s totally fine to celebrate this June the passing of a landmark Supreme Court case that has helped advance LGBTQ+ rights. But, after you tweet out #lovewins and add the rainbow filter to your profile picture, think about the rights and protections that we still need to fight for. What can you do to help? And, long after your tweet has stopped racking up likes and you’ve removed the rainbow filter, think of the people who are marginalized even within queer spaces. How can you support them? There’s always more to be done.

On Feb. 1, several undocumented students and allies met with Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, who helped draft a bipartisan DREAM Act that would give a path to citizenship to “Dreamers” while increasing funding for border control. We held him accountable and protested outside the event because this was not the clean DREAM Act that we wanted.
During the event, I asked him how he could justify a plan that would divide our community and increase deaths at the border, and he claimed his hands were tied because he had to compromise with the demands of the Republicans. He looked at me and said, “We’ve got to turn this over to the next generation who’s willing to fight, and I can’t think of better leaders than those who have been through the struggle.” He was so happy to see how empowered immigrant youth were becoming because we were fighting for our rights.
***
The first thing I learned as an activist was how to tell my story. The summer after my junior year of high school, I met with leaders from Connecticut Students for a Dream for a storytelling workshop. Those who were comfortable sharing details about their life were encouraged to do so following the format we learned. I had never shared many details of my own story before then, because I had always been told it was something to keep secret.
But I shared that day, in a meeting room at a local community center. It was a very new experience for me, but I was comforted by the feedback given from others in the room. A few months later, I was invited to a youth leadership retreat. We met throughout the weekend in a retreat center where we learned about the immigrant rights movement and did several exercises to learn how to externalize this identity, and see it as something we could tackle together as opposed to something that was a part of us.
Each day, time was given for storytelling. Twelve of us sat in a circle. Tissue boxes were scattered around the room as we all shared. I felt safe in this space, but the tears fell as I went more in depth than I had when I first shared part of my story. I was handed tissues as I put into words what I had kept bottled up inside for so long.
Stories circled throughout the room. More tears were shed as I heard the stories of people my own age talking about their experiences crossing the border or having family members deported. This was a leadership retreat. We were being taught to be leaders by embracing our pain.
I continued sharing as I got more involved with activism in high school and at Harvard. Sometimes I shared longer stories. Sometimes it was just coming out as undocumented to another person. I shared in community gatherings, storytelling trainings, my high school graduation speech, and rallies, as well as news articles, op-eds, and more. Each time, I got better at speaking about something so personal.
Each time, I got better at holding back my tears and not shaking when I spoke. By telling my story, I felt like I could let go of some of that pain. At least, that’s how it began. But it slowly turned into something else. It was a tool for change—the only power I had. It slowly became something I felt I had to do and not something I wanted to do.
As one of many activists who have personal connections to their movements, I face the struggle of having to share my story to gain sympathy in the hopes that it will lead to change. I put my pain out there hoping that it won’t be returned, but rather, taken seriously. I put my story out there to fight the Trump administration only to be met with more and more exhaustion. In the constant attempts to find my strength, I have been left exposed and vulnerable.
The empowerment Durbin tried to romanticize that day is actually draining, as we must give so much of ourselves for basic rights that we deserve. We don’t have the power that he has. Our only power is in our voices. Yet, many politicians who claim to be on our side still expect us to waste our lives fighting for the right to live them.
***
The black fist on my forearm that I got this past summer as a reminder to never stop fighting now serves as a reminder for how present my status is in my daily life. When I think about the meaning of my tattoo, I realize it represents so much more than just my strength. It represents my pain, as well. Because it was from my pain that I learned to draw my strength.
I learned how to empower myself by making my identity public. I literally carry my status with me everywhere I go. I carry my employment authorization card in my wallet. I carry the conversation in my classes and my extracurricular activities. I carry it in my writing. And the black fist means I carry my activism on my body.
Our pain has been exposed. We don’t have the option of going back, and moving forward seems nearly impossible as we try to tear down the walls put in front of us. We must take care of ourselves and each other as we take on this pain together. But we are also forced to keep fighting because this is about our futures. This is our lives and our families on the line.
There has been pain in the past. There is pain now. We have no choice but to keep fighting until we finally put an end do it. Politicians have failed us time and time again. We should not have to fight alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a drizzly evening in Indonesia, Harvard anthropologist Mary M. Steedly met her friend Patricia Spyer at the airport and took her on a motorbike tour around the city of Medan. By then, Steedly knew well the tumult and traffic of the city streets: in her 1993 ethnography “Hanging Without a Rope: Narrative Experience in Colonial and Postcolonial Karoland,” she describes in vibrant detail the yellow sudakos triple-parked at intersections and the peddlers swarming the sidewalks to sell noodles and cigarettes.
As the two longtime friends caught up over dinner, Steedly recounted the details of her research on the Karo people of North Sumatra. Spyer remembered how impressed she was as Steedly showed her notebook after notebook filled with drawings of leaves, scribbled place names, and painstakingly-detailed field notes on the nuances of her interactions with the local people.
“She had an incredible ear for language, for tone, for silences, for shifts in attention,” said Spyer, an anthropology professor at the Graduate Institute of Geneva. “For how voices are inhabited and shot through with the voices of others. How they’re haunted.”
Steedly, remembered by friends and colleagues for her eloquent writing, unfussy demeanor, institutional dedication, and passion for dogs, died on Jan. 4 due to breast cancer. She was 71.
Born in Ann Arbor, Mich. and raised in Charleston, S.C., Steedly received her bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, her master’s in Folklore at UNC Chapel Hill, and her Ph.D. in Cultural and Medical Anthropology at the University of Michigan. She left the U.S. for the first time during graduate school, and somewhat unexpectedly wound up in Indonesia, where she wrote the dissertation that culminated in her first of two books and where she ultimately decided to devote her research.
In addition to years spent researching Indonesia, Steedly was fascinated by military culture in the U.S., the culture and history of her native South, and questions of memory and experience, gender and feminism, and colonialism and postcolonialism. She wrote on topics ranging from the process of collective memory and narration through Karo spirit encounters to the way Indonesian postcolonial anxieties manifested in horror films.
Steedly began teaching at Harvard in 1990 and was tenured from within the University in 1998, a feat her colleagues said was quite difficult at that time, when many professors were brought in for tenure from outside universities. For a significant portion of her career, she was also the only female senior faculty member in the department, according to her colleagues.
“She did it with a great sense of humor, never losing her cool,” fellow Anthropology professor Steven C. Caton said. “She was as far as I could tell totally unflappable, and with a sort of natural charm.”
Steedly rose up through Harvard’s Anthropology Department at a time when members of the “revered old guard” of senior male faculty began to retire, according to colleague Theodore C. Bestor.  Eventually she became the “institutional memory of the department,” said Ajantha Subramanian, Steedly’s colleague in Social Anthropology.
Anthropology professor Michael Herzfeld remembered Steedly’s ability to help junior faculty members navigate the complexity of a life and career at the University.
“When I entered the field of Southeast Asian anthropology, in which she was an established specialist and to which, as a Europeanist, I was a newcomer, her wise counsel, insight, and empathy helped me to craft a productive trajectory,” Herzfeld wrote in an email. “We used to argue about many things, but those arguments, in which Mary’s special brand of irony often cleared a practical path through clouds of bureaucratic nonsense, were full of mutual affection and respect.”
For many of her friends and colleagues, Steedly’s immense skills as a writer and ethnographer made her work stand out in the field. She developed ethnographic writing as a genre unto itself, Subramanian said, treating her books as more than just academic reports. Steedly was slow and meticulous, Caton added, always mulling over “writerly” questions: finagling rhythms, searching for voice, and assessing balance. It took her years to weave interviews, oral histories, letters, and research into narratives.
In her lifetime, she published two books in addition to a slew of articles, and left a third book unfinished at the time of her death. The possibility of graduate students finishing the book on her behalf in the years ahead would be a nearly impossible task, Caton said, crediting her unique style.
“Her voice was so distinctive that you couldn’t really reproduce it successfully by using her notes,” Caton said.
In the classroom, Steedly worked to overhaul the graduate-level introductory course she taught with Caton. Her hallmark undergraduate course was Anthropology 1850: “Ethnography as Practice and Genre.” She was not interested in her students sounding like every other anthropologist, Subramanian said, but rather encouraged their own unique voices.
“She liked their quirks and their idiosyncrasies,” Subramanian said. “She didn’t try to hammer those out of them. She wanted them to actually inhabit them fully.”
Steedly’s encouragement of creativity extended to her dedicated mentorship of students, particularly her graduate students. Several colleagues mentioned that one of her Ph.D. students, Tahmima Anam, went on to become a well-known novelist.
She was very serious about her students, Spyer said. She worried about them, complained about them, praised them, and was happy for them.
“There’s a kind of generosity there,” Subramanian said.
In addition to her teaching and research, Steedly spent several years as the chair, director of graduate, and director of undergraduate studies for Social Anthropology in Harvard’s Anthropology Department. She also served as a member on committees for Women’s Studies, Social Studies, Folklore and Mythology, and the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
As an active member of the Committee on the Status of Women at Harvard, she advocated for the hiring of women both in her own department and across the University. She did more than her share of labor in building the institution, Subramanian said.
“She never touted her own accomplishments, ever. Ever,” Subramanian said. “There was a kind of brusqueness to her. She kind of just went about her business,” she added.
Outside of Harvard, Steedly was a committed dog trainer and the president of a local agility club for dogs in Carlisle, Mass. She competed often in agility trials with her two Australian shepherds, adding medals and ribbons to a large bulletin board on display in her dining room, Bestor said. He recalled evenings in North Cambridge when she would walk her dogs by his house, stopping by for a glass of wine and a chat.
“The dogs were really integral to her life,” Bestor said.
She later moved to Lincoln, Mass. so she could have a backyard for her dogs to enjoy.
She loved to cook, and Spyer said she ate with relish whatever outlandish delicacies she encountered in her travels. Steedly especially enjoyed rooting for the Red Sox and the Patriots, reading novels, gardening, and birdwatching in her yard.
Steedly is survived by Nina DeLuca, with whom she shared a home for the last 18 years, her brother and two step-brothers, and her dogs June and Hopper.
Anthropology colleagues said a memorial service will be held later this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Soon after the announcement that Lawrence S. Bacow would be Harvard’s next president, congratulations started pouring in from deans of schools across the University. From community messages to personal statements, Harvard’s deans eagerly expressed their enthusiasm about their new boss.
John F. Manning ’82, the dean of the Law School, took pride in the fact that Bacow was an alumnus of his school, and complimented his “superb judgment” in a statement Sunday. He wrote that he was often directed to Bacow for advice when he first took on the Law School deanship last year.
“When I became dean, one of the most frequent pieces of advice I got from fellow deans was, ‘You need to meet Larry Bacow; he has terrific insights about how to lead a school.’  They were right,” Manning wrote in an emailed statement. “He is a proven leader in stimulating the kinds of collaboration and innovation that can make a great school even better. I am proud that he is our alumnus.”
Douglas W. Elmendorf, the dean of the Kennedy School—from which Bacow received a master's in public policy and a Ph.D.—discussed the president-elect’s connections to his school in an email to HKS affiliates Sunday.
“Larry is deeply committed to our mission, and his experiences at the Kennedy School clearly mean a great deal to him,” Elmendorf wrote. “I was so pleased when he made time in his schedule to attend the festivities opening our transformed campus, and when I talked with him this afternoon, he said that in his introductory press conference today he referred to his experience as a student at the Kennedy School.”
Even those deans who cannot count Bacow among their alumni still found plenty of praise to bestow on the University's next leader. George Q. Daley ’82, the dean of the Medical School, highlighted Bacow’s career and focus on the sciences.
“I have deep respect and great admiration for the substantial contributions Larry has made over the course of his remarkable career, both as an economist and as a leader of some of our finest academic institutions,” Daley wrote in an emailed statement. “Larry has a vast knowledge of the Harvard culture and tremendous respect for the life sciences, attributes that will serve Harvard University and Harvard Medical School well in the years to come.”
Others, including Michelle A. Williams, the dean of the School of Public Health, wrote in an email to school affiliates that Bacow was especially qualified to take on the challenges facing higher education today.
“I am confident that Larry will be a remarkable leader in the midst of these challenging times for higher education. He will be a champion of Harvard’s engagement in local and global communities,” she wrote.
William F. Lee ’72, a member of the presidential search committee and senior fellow of the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, said at the press conference announcing Bacow’s selection that his familiarity with Harvard and higher education was a significant factor in Bacow’s appointment.
“We wanted someone who could hit the ground running because neither we nor higher education have time to spare,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark D. Gearan ’78, former director of the United States Peace Corps and former president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, was appointed director of the Institute of Politics Monday.
Gearan has served as “president in residence” at the Graduate School of Education for the last year.  As a Harvard undergraduate, he was an active member of the IOP and said he attributes the $500 summer stipend he received through the Institute to be an “important” development in his life.
“It has really been an important part of the thread of my life that opened up my eyes to the world of public policy, public service and politics,” Gearan said, “I have been very grateful for that opportunity.”
Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School, made the decision to tap Gearan, though a search committee comprised of students, faculty, and staff provided guidance throughout the selection process.
“We were looking for the person we thought could best inspire the students and lead an organization that would inspire students to go into public service and politics,” Elmendorf said.
The IOP director position sat unfilled for approximately 10 months following the resignation of former director Maggie Williams in April 2017.
William D. “Bill” Delahunt has served as interim director since William’s departure. He also served as interim director while Williams was on leave in fall 2016 to serve on Hillary Clinton’s potential presidential transition team.
Dustin Chiang ’19, president of the IOP Student Advisory Committee, said it took time to consider all of the candidates and their qualifications.
“The position of the director of the IOP is a very important one and it was a very thorough process in which the dean considered a number of candidates, and we wanted to make sure we had the best candidate possible selected to be our director,” Chiang said.
A former Crimson news editor, Gearan will take the lead of an organization under scrutiny following a series of controversial fellow appointments. Last fall, the IOP briefly appointed Chelsea Manning, a former Army soldier who went to prison for leaking classified military documents, as a visiting fellow to the IOP. Her visiting fellowship was rescinded after backlash from CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Later that fall, Sean Spicer, the former press secretary for President Donald Trump, faced scrutiny for only hosting off-the-record events on campus.
Gearan responded to the controversy by addressing his willingness to listen to students about their opinions and focusing on the roles they can take in public service and politics.
“This is a unique time in American civic life but that was one of the motivations I had to seek the position,” Gearan said, “I think the mission is a brilliant one and one to inspire Harvard students to think of leadership roles in public service and political life.”
Gearan will officially take the helm of the Institute of Politics in March, according to a press release.
“For me, it will start with listening to those that are most engaged and listening to those who are most engaged. I think there are people very, very committed to the Institute,” Gearan added. “[The Institute] does have this rich history of thought and experience, and that’s a hallmark of higher education, so I have conversations that I can’t wait to get started with.”

Former Maryland Governor Martin J. O’ Malley will serve as a shared visiting fellow for multiple Kennedy School centers beginning this April, with a focus on local politics and student engagement.
O’Malley, who served as governor of the state for eight years and mayor of Baltimore, Md., will split his time between three centers: the Kennedy School Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, the Bloomberg Harvard City Initiative, and the Taubman Center for State and Local Government.
O’Malley entered into the national spotlight during the 2016 presidential election when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
The purpose for the shared fellowship comes from a desire from many students at the Kennedy School to pursue jobs in local and state government, according to Rafael M. Carbonell, executive director of the Taubman Center.
“We’ve been hearing a lot of interest in how we can collaborate more along our different centers and our different programs and initiatives to really better connect our students to those opportunities as they are looking at those careers in state and local government,” Carbonell said.
“[O’Malley’s] very much aligned with that vision to say who are the folks who have been there and done that in a meaningful, effective way at a state and local level,” Carbonell added.
O’Malley said he first started visiting the Kennedy School to discuss the modernization of city government and encourage students to pursue a job in local politics when he was the mayor of Baltimore.
“I enjoy working with mayors and universities across the country because that's where the most exciting innovations in governing are actually happening: delivering results, setting goals with deadlines, being open and transparent, doing what works and tackling big challenges,” O’Malley said. “That's why you see cities growing across the country.”
Stephen Goldsmith, faculty director of the Ash Center Government Innovation Program, said O’Malley will be a vital part of various initiatives focusing on state and local governance.
“At the the time that cities are more and more in the forefront of our country and the place where more and more people live, the reach of the Ash Center is considerable and the Kennedy School as well,” Goldsmith said. “Governor O’Malley will help us extend that reach and the value of that reach.”
In a Kennedy School press release, O’Malley was recognized for his use of data to increase accountability in policy decisions as a mayor and governor.
“We started pioneering a new way of governing when I was the mayor of Baltimore. Unlike the old way of governing in cities—it was often driven by patronage politics or constituent politics—this was a new way of governing for the Information Age,” O’Malley said.
“We didn't do it to win any awards. We did it to survive. We did it to make our city a lot safer, cleaner, healthier, and a better place as quickly as we could because we were facing some huge challenges,” O’Malley added.
O’Malley said he believes future urban sustainability is an important discussion for students at the Kennedy School to have.
“The drive for a more sustainable future for humankind on this planet and urbanization that is the migration of people to cities are now joined in one urgent movement of human development,” O’Malley said. “The only way to create a more sustainable future on this planet is to create more livable cities.”

Saloniki—a local Greek fast food chain—and Oggi Gourmet will be among seven vendors located in the new Smith Campus Center when the building opens this fall.
The two restaurants join the previously-confirmed Pavement Coffeehouse, Swissbäkers, Bon Me, Whole Heart Provisions, and Blackbird Doughnuts as vendors within the Smith Campus Center’s remodeled arcade. In total, the Smith Center will be able to seat up to 800 visitors indoors and outdoors. The seven vendors have received all necessary zoning approvals and have confirmed leases with Harvard, according to the University-run Harvard Gazette.
An additional restaurant and bar that will open on the top floor has not yet been determined. The bar and restaurant area will be only open to Harvard ID holders. The newly-renovated building will also have a remodeled exterior and patio area.
Saloniki’s Harvard Square location will be the third for the local chain. It currently operates two other establishments—a Boston location in the Fenway neighborhood and a Cambridge location on Mass. Ave. near Kendall Square.
Its menu touts a variety of pita wraps and Greek-style plates including vegetarian, vegan, and meat options. The restaurant also offers soups and salads. Its website presents the chain as offering “fresh, local, [and] inspired” food choices and claims to buy from local vendors whenever possible.
Oggi Gourmet opened in the formerly-named Holyoke Center in 2007, but was forced to move to 30 Dunster St., also a part of the building complex, when construction started in 2016. The construction on the Smith Campus Center has slowed business for Oggi at its new location as well as other restaurants in the area.
The owners of En Boca, a Mediterranean-inspired tapas restaurant that operated on the opposite side of Holyoke street, alleged in a lawsuit last year that the construction disrupted business and forced it to close its doors.
While some businesses have experienced challenges because of the construction, the seven confirmed vendors will bring additional dining options to the Square and potentially attract students to the renovated Smith Campus Center. University Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is excited about the new additions to the Smith Campus Center.
“We’re incredibly excited about all of the diverse new food venues, and believe that together they will bring an added energy and excitement to the Campus Center and greatly complement the already vibrant atmosphere that exists throughout the Square,” O’Rourke wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2018 at 5:02 a.m.
Swellbox, a health data startup hoping to encourage students to create a lifetime health account, is once again actively promoting its services to students on campus.
Stephen Cho, co-founder and head of business development at Swellbox, said the company allows users to see all their past and present health records at the same time.
“If your patient ever switches providers two or three times, you have medical data in a bunch of different places that you can’t access all in one place, let alone digitally. So Swellbox essentially builds a platform that allows you to unlock all those records,” Cho said.
Swellbox has been in discussions to work with Harvard for over a year, along with other schools, like Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania, but Paul J. Barreira, Director of Harvard University Health Services, said he would not call it a partnership.
“It’s just another way for students to get their records. I don’t see anything more than that. The health services concern is just to give it to you in any form you want it,” Barreira said.
“You could say ‘Jack in the Box,’ and we would give it to ‘Jack in the Box,’ if you had the right form and signed the form,” he added.
In Nov. 2016, the Undergraduate Council unanimously endorsed an open letter to HUHS administrators urging that students be given more access to health information.
Jefferson E. Seidl ’16, alumni chair of the Harvard Health Data Working Group, consultant to Swellbox, and one of the letter’s co-authors, said there is a need for greater access to health records.
“While UHS was providing good care to students, it wasn’t necessarily, in our opinion, empowering students with their health information in a way that the University as a whole was championing on the national stage,” Seidl said.
Seidl said he was encouraged by the response to the letter from HUHS.
“They actually got rid of fees for record requests, which we viewed as an impediment to data empowerment and also expanded their offerings in the portal,” Seidl added.
Now, Barreira confirmed, students can request their health records at no charge from HUHS.
“I think most students don’t even know they can get their medical records and sign and we’ll give them to you. There is no fee. There used to be but we removed it,” he said.
Though health records themselves may not be an issue, Mridu Nanda ’21 said accessibility to the HUHS website is still a concern.
“Getting [on the website] and it being more apparent what services they offer would be good,” Nanda said.
Conner P. Williams ’21 added, “I would love to see my appointment history, but scheduling is fine.”
Seidl said Swellbox could help address many of these concerns. By aggregating health data into one portal, Swellbox is able to seamlessly present a patient’s information, Seidl added.
Barreira said Swellbox’s mission is in line with larger trends in modern healthcare.
“I don’t think it’s neither good nor bad,” he said. “What they're saying is healthcare is moving in the direction where patients own their medical records and that we have to be able to have medical records that has all the ways you have been treated over your lifetime.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 14, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Stephen Cho is the vice president of Swellbox. In fact, he is the co-founder and head of business development at Swellbox.

Pointing to University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow’s past comments on labor issues, Harvard graduate student union members and supporters say they worry he will not support unionization efforts after he takes the helm as Harvard’s 29th president.
Unionization advocates trace their concerns to comments Bacow, whose selection was announced Sunday afternoon, made while serving as president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011. Bacow is slated to assume Harvard’s top post on July 1 after University President Drew G. Faust steps down.
During Bacow’s tenure, Tufts saw two major unionization efforts. Following a 2000 decision by the National Labor Relations Board to recognize graduate students as statutory employees, in 2002, graduate students at Tufts unsuccessfully attempted to unionize in conjunction with the United Automobile Workers.
“I believe it would be a mistake for graduate students to unionize,” Bacow wrote at the time. “The relationship between faculty member to graduate student is not one of employer to employee.”
Tufts’s graduate students eventually voted to unionize as a part of the Service Employees International Union in May 2017.
Sam S. Klug, an organizer for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, wrote in an email that he hopes Bacow has reconsidered his stance on labor since his tenure as president of Tufts.
“I hope that Bacow has reconsidered his views in the years since he was President of Tufts—especially now, when unions at Harvard are leading on protections for international and immigrant students, protections against campus sexual violence, and securing financial stability,” Klug wrote.
In 2009, staff members at Tufts attempted to join with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, Harvard’s largest employee union. Bacow wrote an open letter to his colleagues around the same time detailing his doubt that a union would result in material benefits for its members.
“To say that we could work with the union should not imply that I think unionization by the HUCTW is a good idea. Far from it,” Bacow wrote. “I believe that we are a stronger, more effective community when we all work together collaboratively and directly to address concerns in a cooperative manner. I don’t believe the formal process mandated by collective bargaining would help us address together the very real challenges Tufts faces in this economy.”
Bacow added Tufts would cooperate with the union if its organizing efforts proved successful.
“If the union succeeds in its organizing efforts, Tufts will do its part to foster a good working relationship with this union as well,” he wrote.
Undergraduates who support the Harvard unionization effort also said they find Bacow’s past statements on the topic problematic. Wilfried J.K. Zibell ’21, an HGSU-UAW undergraduate organizer, said he is “definitely concerned” about Bacow’s record.
“Based on what I’ve read about his positions on the Tufts unionization effort, he engaged in classic anti-union rhetoric, saying that he isn’t opposed to unionization, just this union, and saying that student workers don’t have an employee relationship with colleges,” Zibell said.
“But I remain cautiously optimistic that he may reverse his positions now that some time has passed,” Zibell added.
University representatives declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 13, 2018 at 8:19 p.m.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences scholars across disciplines praised University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow following the Sunday announcement he will succeed current President Drew G. Faust.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Robin E. Kelsey, dean of arts and humanities, both said they are optimistic Bacow will cooperate well with the Faculty.
Smith wrote in a statement that Bacow is a “fantastic choice” and “a true friend to the FAS.”
Kelsey, who served as chair of the faculty committee advising the presidential search, said he thinks Bacow has been faculty-friendly in his previous positions in higher education.
“My impression is that he has been a very faculty-focused administrator as both president of Tufts and chancellor at MIT,” Kelsey said. “I've heard him say time and again that universities do all they can to enable their faculties to do their best work. So I'm confident that the faculty at Harvard will find him a very supportive leader.”
David I. Laibson ’88, Economics Department chair, said Bacow’s combination of experience in university governance and academic settings will make him “a terrific leader.”
Bacow previously held administrative posts at MIT and Tufts and is a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest-governing body.
“His experience in so many different important academic settings is going to be an enormously valuable asset. His knowledge of our university, which comes as a member of the Corporation and a student, gives him so many important perspectives on our community and our values and our different schools,” Laibson said.
The issue of shared governance between the Faculty and Harvard administrators surged to the forefront of Faculty discussions in the last two years when Faust introduced penalties in May 2016 targeting  single-gender social organizations. In the wake of Faust's announcement, Faculty charged they had not been adequately consulted about the sanctions. In December, the Corporation voted to keep these penalties, causing some professors to assert the governing board’s involvement infringed upon shared governance.
Several professors identified the defense of a liberal arts education and higher education as a key challenge Bacow will likely  face in his new role.
Stephen J. Greenblatt, a University professor, wrote in an emailed statement that he was “delighted” when Bacow was named as the next president. He wrote that he he thinks Bacow will bring a strong focus on undergraduate education.
“I have had the opportunity to meet with and observe him quite a few times over the years,” Greenblatt wrote. “He cares deeply about undergraduate education and will, I am confident, continue the strong leadership that we have been fortunate enough to have through challenging times.”
Kelsey said Bacow is likely aware of hurdles he may face on the national stage, noting that Bacow acknowledged during a press conference Sunday that higher education faces strong headwinds.
He also said that he is optimistic Bacow will support the humanities during his tenure.
“I think for Harvard to deliver the best of itself to the world would require robust programs in the arts and humanities,” Kelsey said. “I have every confidence that Larry is going to do everything in his power to keep those programs robust.”
English professor James T. Engell ’73 wrote in an emailed statement that he thinks Bacow is an “excellent choice.”
“Bacow has thought long and deeply about higher education.  He has detailed teaching and administrative experience at the highest levels, all successful,” he said.
English professor Louis Menand said the future of the liberal arts education will be “important for all of us.” Menand added that, based on information he had read, he thinks Bacow has given “a lot of thought” to the issue.
“It could be exciting for Harvard to be in the forefront of the evolution of the idea of the liberal education. So that’s what gives me the most optimism about the choice,” Menand said. “He seems to be somebody who is intellectually thinking about those things and is on the path to thinking about the future.”

UPDATED: February 13, 2018 at 7:01 p.m.
Sunday’s announcement that Lawrence S. Bacow will serve as Harvard’s 29th president surprised and disappointed some College students who had hoped a person of color would take the University’s top job.
The search committee’s selection of Bacow marks the 28th white male to sit in the president’s Massachusetts Hall corner office. Over the course of the seven month-long presidential search, some alumni affinity groups requested Harvard’s search committee consider candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds; several undergraduates also said they thought the next president should be a person of color.
In the wake of Bacow’s debut as president-elect, several Harvard students critiqued the committee’s choice, sometimes turning to social media to express frustration with a pick they said too closely resembles presidents past.
“I think the one sort of thing I had in mind for the new president was that it would be a person of color, so it was really disheartening that that occurred,” Sebastian A. Reyes ’19 said.
“A thought that I had earlier was that, in a few years, if the diversity of the incoming class keeps increasing, [a] white president will no longer be representative of the Harvard student body, which is a big issue,” Diego Navarrete ’21 added.
The selection of Bacow comes at a time when the College is growing increasingly diverse: Among the admitted Class of 2021, more than half of students identified as non-white. Bacow also arrives at the presidency as some undergraduates are pushing for a wide array of initiatives meant to improve Harvard’s diversity. Over the past few years, students have advocated for a campus multicultural center and an ethnic studies concentration.
Some undergraduates said that, by choosing a president of color, the University would have signalled it takes these issues very seriously. Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, a representative for the Undergraduate Council who chairs the body’s Multicultural Center Coalition, said they would have been encouraged to see Harvard choose a president from a marginalized background.
“It would've been really encouraging for the University to choose someone who had a proven track record of consistently showing up for marginalized communities, not in just in words but in actions,” Whittaker said.
At a press conference Sunday, Bacow said he is committed to promoting diversity at Harvard.
“I think diversity is a pathway to excellence,” Bacow said. “There’s no way that you can recruit the best people, support the best people, if you're only sampling from a small part of the distribution of talent.”
“We need to look for the very best and, during my time at Tufts, I’m proud of the record of bringing women and minorities and people of color into the senior leadership, into the faculty, and also into the student body, and I hope to do the same thing here,” he added.
Bacow served as president of Tufts from 2001 to 2011. At the press conference, he said he spent much of that time working “very, very hard” to make Tufts more diverse.
William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Corporation and the chair of the presidential search committee, said Sunday he thinks Bacow’s record at Tufts proves he is a champion for inclusivity.
“He embraced diversity as a cornerstone,” Lee said Sunday.
In the past three years, Tufts has drawn headlines for its lack of diversity in both its student body and its faculty. Just 4 percent of the Tufts Class of 2021 identify as African American, 9 percent as Hispanic, and 13 percent as Asian American. By comparison, 14.6 percent of students in Harvard’s Class of 2021 identify as African-American, 22.2 percent as Asian American, and 11.6 percent as Hispanic or Latino.
Despite some disappointment with the University’s final choice, undergraduates said they are cautiously optimistic Bacow will prove strongly committed to advancing diversity once he takes office.
“If anything, I have hope that he will make Harvard more of an open and inclusive place,” said Aba A. Sam ’21, who serves as vice president of the Freshman Black Table, a subgroup of the College’s Black Students Association. “I think that there's been a very conscious effort on the part of Harvard to do that, so I hope he continues that, but in terms of him not being a person of color, again, slightly disappointing, but not necessarily surprising.”
Whittaker also said they  hope Bacow advocates on behalf of students of color, especially as the demographics of Harvard’s student body likely continue to become more diverse.
“I'll certainly be holding him accountable to do that,” Whittaker added.
Other students said they worry Bacow’s selection means Harvard is now trailing its peers in terms of diversity in senior leadership. University President Drew G. Faust—Bacow’s predecessor—was the first woman to hold Harvard’s highest office when she assumed the job in 2007.
Brown University appointed Ruth J.S. Simmons, its first African American woman president, in 2001. Dartmouth College appointed Jim Yong Kim, the first Asian American to ever serve as president of an Ivy League, in 2009.
“I think it puts Harvard behind a lot of other universities which have already selected people of color as their presidents,” Reyes said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Donald Trump’s recent repeal of Temporary Protected Status has led some student activists and TPS recipients to argue that the University should hire more staff for the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic.
The Immigration and Refugee Clinic, staffed by attorneys and students at Harvard Law School, provides legal support for immigrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers. The clinic recently hired a full-time staff attorney, Jason M. Corral, to protect University affiliates impacted by the Trump administration’s revised policies.
In recent months, the Trump administration has decided to end the Temporary Protected Status program for immigrants from Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, affecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants and potentially dozens of Harvard affiliates. For over a decade, TPS has granted temporary refuge in the United States to immigrants whose home countries are affected by armed conflict or natural disaster.
Trump’s decisions on TPS come on the heels of a Sept. 2017 decision to repeal DACA, an Obama-era program protecting individuals who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children from deportation.   Nearly 800,000 youth in the U.S., including many of the College’s 65 undocumented students, rely on DACA for their legal status.
The flurry of recent changes to immigration programs, however, has led some to claim that the Immigration and Refugee Clinic is overburdened.  In Nov. 2017, the undergraduate group Student Labor Action Movement published a petition addressed to Faust asking administrators to provide more information and support for those impacted by the changes to TPS. One of SLAM’s demands specifically requested that the University hire a second attorney at the law clinic.
Doris Reina-Landaverde, a Harvard campus services employee with TPS, said she thinks the Immigration and Refugee Clinic needs more staff to respond to recents changes in immigration policies.
“[Corral] needs help in the clinic because it’s a lot for him, even though he also works with students,” Reina-Landaverde, who is from El Salvador, said.
Landaverde’s husband Merdardo Landaverde, a campus building manager, said he thought the law clinic was burdened with a dual responsibility of handling cases and guiding Law School students.
“Jason had to be both helping me and helping the students. I think that shows right there the need for another lawyer,” said Merdardo Landaverde, who filed to renew his and his wife’s TPS status with the clinic.
Gabriela A. Rivero ’21, who works as a translator at the clinic, agreed that the clinic could benefit from having another lawyer.
“They’re doing a lot of great work, but they are spread a little thin,” Riverdo said.
In an email, Corral disagreed that there is a need to hire another full-time lawyer at the Immigration and Refugee Clinic.
“Despite how busy we are I do not feel like there is a need to hire additional attorneys at Harvard,” Corral wrote. “I feel confident that we have the needed resources to provide quality representation to the people on campus that are affected by Trump's immigration priorities.”
Corral said the clinic is supported by law students participating in the organization’s clinical program.
“Already we have trained approximately 50 law students on TPS applications and have conducted 4 TPS clinics in two weeks,” Corral wrote.
Corral also noted that the Immigration and Refugee Clinic partners with Greater Boston Legal Services, a legal aid group, and has an agreement with the law firm WilmerHale to represent Harvard affiliates pro-bono as needed.
Sabrineh Ardalan, assistant director of the Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinical program, wrote in an email that multiple part-time attorneys are present at TPS renewal clinics, and that her spring clinical students are required to volunteer for the clinics at least once.
A focus on the University’s response to the TPS repeals comes amid a broader discussion over the University resources for immigrant affiliates.
In the wake of the Trump administration’s travel ban in 2016, Harvard graduate students called on University President Drew G. Faust to increase support for undocumented and international students.
Faust herself has lobbied federal officials on multiple occasions, urging them to protect undocumented immigrants and refugees in the U.S. Last week, Faust wrote to congressional leaders asking them to consider permanent legislation to preserve the legal status of TPS recipients.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson emphasized the current immigration resources available at Harvard.
“The President’s Office has funded the hiring of a full-time attorney and paralegal at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, as well as a part-time social worker and administrative assistant to provide free legal services to support Harvard community members with DACA, Temporary Protected Status, and other immigration concerns,” Jackson wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the presidential search committee announced Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow would be the University’s 29th leader, some students scurried straight to their computers.
Undergraduates hurriedly googled the words “Lawrence Bacow” and scoured his Wikipedia page for answers.
“I guess my first reaction was, ‘I don’t know who this is. So I think I’m going to look into his background and what his vision is for Harvard,’” Katelyn X. Li ’21 said. “But then I just read the email—the mass email that was sent out to everyone—and I was like, ‘Oh. He looks qualified.’”
“Hopefully he’ll be good,” Li said.
As news of Bacow’s selection spread Sunday and Monday via email, push alerts, and on Facebook and Twitter, students began to come to terms with the identity of the man who may shape Harvard’s destiny for the next decade. Some praised Bacow’s extensive experience in higher education and predicted he will be a successful president, others worried Bacow does not represent a sufficiently diverse choice, and still others questioned his switch from presidential searcher to candidate.
Some simply had no idea who he was.
At least 20 students passing through Annenberg Hall, the dining hall for College first-years, Monday evening said they had never heard of Bacow or had not heard enough to make any kind of judgement.
Like Li, Bilal Wurie ’21—approached exiting Annenberg—turned to the internet for help. “I looked him up on Wikipedia and it seems like he’s got pretty good credentials,” Wurie said.
Jacob O. Howell ’20, pausing as he ate dinner in Adams House, agreed.
“I was happy with the selection,” Howell said. “He seems qualified for the position.”
Even some who followed the search more closely said Bacow had not been on their radar.
“I still don’t know much about him. I was really paying attention to people who were out there in the Business School and the Law School,” Roshan Padaki ’20 said. “He just kind of came out of the Corporation.”
A Corporation member since 2011, Bacow began the presidential search as the ultimate insider: a member of the search committee itself, which initially comprised all 12 members of the Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers. After some individuals consulted by the committee floated his name as a potential candidate, Bacow stepped down from his role as searcher to sit on the other side of the interview table in Dec. 2017, Corporation senior fellow and committee chair William F. Lee ’72 said at a press conference Sunday.
Bacow’s selection marks the first time in recent Harvard history that a University presidential search committee has picked one of its own for the top job. But he fails to break with tradition in another way—Bacow will be the 28th white man to sit in the president’s Massachusetts Hall office.
This apparent conformity with the past drew ire from some students Monday night.
“I think, honestly, who on the Harvard Corporation thought the solution to Harvard’s problems was to hire another white man named Larry?” Anselm Kizza-Besigye ’21 said. “As if that didn’t cause problems in the past.”
Malvika Menon ’19 said she had hoped the searchers would pick a woman to follow current University President Drew G. Faust—Harvard’s first-ever female leader.
“I thought it was interesting that they chose a man after having Drew Faust as Harvard president,” Menon said.
Still, some said they thought Bacow would work to expand diversity at Harvard, praising in particular his commitment to financial aid. Hunter D. Mollett ’21 said he thought Bacow will value financial aid for low-income students.
Other students focused on the committee’s decision to look within its own ranks for Harvard’s 29th president.
“I read the email that they sent out and there was nothing particularly surprising or shocking about it,” Franklin S. Hang ’21 said. “He seems like a normal bureaucrat that I can trust in the coming years.”
Padaki said he thought Bacow’s selection was “fine” given he stepped down from the search committee two months ago.
Still, some said they found the nontraditional move surprising.
“I have been keeping track of the president selection for a long time, reading news from a variety of sources, especially The Crimson,” Raymond Song '21  said. “And it’s a little bit unexpected to find a person that’s actually from the search committee.”
G.S. “Max” Shen ’18 agreed.
“That’s a little snek-y, I guess,” Shen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final weekend of regular season of play, women’s squash not only looked to breeze past its opponents, but also to complete its domination over its conference opponents. In straight sweeps of No. 5 Yale and No. 10 Brown, Harvard raised its undefeated streak to 50 matches—spanning more than three years—and claimed its third straight outright Ivy League title.
This final slate of contests comes in between the team’s toughest two weekends of the year. Last weekend featured matchups against then top-ranked Princeton and a rematch against last season’s national finalist in Penn. Next weekend is the apex of the collegiate squash season as the Crimson hosts the top collegiate teams in the nation, one last chance for any teams not named Harvard to challenge the Crimson’s position at the top.
“We haven’t lost yet this year, so I think there will be a lot of pressure on us next weekend, but hopefully we’ll do well,” junior Sabrina Sobhy said.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
After the raucous crowds of a week ago, the courts at home calmed down considerably for the Sunday matinee, which signaled the end of squash’s regular season. This atmosphere was appropriate as the Crimson (12-0, 7-0 Ivy) took care of business in straight games in all nine of its matches against the Bears (5-9, 0-7).
Brown has gotten the wrong end of the racket in Ivy play. The team continued its five-year drought against Ancient Eight teams and lost for the 48th time (out of 48) against Harvard.
HARVARD 9, YALE 0
The final challenge of the season came this weekend in a matchup in New Haven, which has not been the friendliest place to Crimson athletics this school year. The Bulldogs (10-4, 5-2) lost to the other three teams above them in the national rankings, No. 2 Princeton, No. 3 Trinity, and No. 4 Stanford. But a dramatic 5-4 win against Penn on Jan. 13 allowed Yale to escape to the final weekend of regular season play with just one loss against an Ivy League opponent.
This scheduling allowed the Bulldogs to go into the penultimate weekend of 2017-18 play with the ability to control its own destiny and grab a share of the Ancient Eight title. Heading into a Friday afternoon matchup against a team motivated by rivalry and the potential for a monumental upset, Harvard did not face the friendliest of circumstances.
But characteristic of a team that never loses, these circumstances presented a challenge that ultimately stood no contest against an unbreakable Crimson squad. The team collectively dropped two games against the Bulldogs. One was conceded by No. 7 Eleonore Evans and the other by No. 1 Gina Kennedy, who faced an All-American in sophomore Lucy Beecroft.
By virtue of giving Kennedy the tougher challenge against Yale’s top player, Sobhy played outside of the top slot for the first time in her collegiate career. Kennedy and junior Kayley Leonard had both previously played the top rung on the later when Sobhy was in the lineup, showcasing the quality at the top of the Crimson’s lineup.
Seven out of nine individual matches were won in straight games, but true to its high ranking, Yale put out many close games throughout the lineup. This depth has allowed it to separate itself from top-heavy teams like Penn and gives it a legitimate chance to challenge the top teams come championship weekend. But Harvard won on enemy turf, and now the Bulldogs must.
While Yale was looking for a weekend sweep to grab a share of the conference championship, the squad could have been confronted by an unsettling fact: there has never been a shared Ancient Eight title. This fact pays testament to the stratified nature of collegiate squash, in which the best in a given season beats everyone else.
“I think there is always the pressure to maintain it, especially having won it last year, and the last two times,” said co-captain Sue Ann Yong. “But, yeah, it’s my senior year, so I’m glad we managed to have the Ivy title again. But I think the job’s not done because we have nationals next weekend, so we want to make sure we don’t stay complacent.”
The Crimson has the Ancient Eight title for the 22nd  time and is once again the class of the sport. In the 2016-17 campaign, the most games it lost in a single match was two. The two previous seasons had them squeak out with 5-4 victories. This year the team has not conceded more than one game in a match. The statistics indicate a team that is getting better and growing into a dynasty. The team has the opportunity next week to win its fourth consecutive national championship. Doing so in the friendly confines of the Murr Center would be particularly sweet.
“I’m actually really happy that it’s going to be at home because I had it at Harvard my freshman year and having it my senior year is actually amazing, just because my friends can come watch and my parents are also coming too for the first time, so that’s going to be huge,” Yong said.

In case you missed it, Harvard finally picked its 29th President. Although we’re certain we’ll love Larry, we’re disappointed that the search committee overlooked some really remarkable candidates.
Scaramucci, “The Mooch”
No one has displayed as much Crimson pride as Anthony “I went to Harvard Law School” Scaramucci during his brief stint in the White House. Seriously, the man was communications director for ten days. That’s about 1.78 H-bombs per hour.
John from Annenberg 
This man literally knows every Harvard undergraduate’s name, and probably some grad students as well. Straight out of the book on leadership: Know your audience. He already knows how to handle the limelight (read: the dim illumination of the Berg).
Any former Punchmaster
It’s really hard work to judge that many people in such a short amount of time. They exemplify efficiency, attention to detail (“Upper East or Upper West?”), and the importance of having high standards. Everyone loves a lower admissions rate, and no one knows exclusivity better than a punchmaster.
The Spirit of Karl Marx 
To ensure that Harvard becomes the epitome of a safe space for all us special snowflakes, we need the left of the left of the left to save us. Who better than the Father of Communism himself? Our school color is Crimson, why not go completely Red?
A Literal Pile of Money
We all know they’re only looking for someone to up that endowment, so why not just cut out the middleman?
Again, no shade to Larry, but it might be worthwhile for him to reach out and ask for some tips from these folks.

Yesterday, the 29th President of Harvard was announced—Lawrence S. Bacow. Now, I don’t know much about him because I didn’t read William F. Lee's email. It looked really long. But the one thing that I do know about Larry is that he ended Tufts’s Naked Quad Run. As a student with questionable collegiate priorities, this concerns me. Is President Bacow going to terminate Primal Scream?
Primal Scream is one of the few nights of the year when I both go outside and interact with other human beings. In a 2011 op-ed, Bacow cited twelve student hospitalizations, an arrest, and two students with 0.3 blood alcohol content levels as sufficient reason to finally end the Naked Quad Run tradition. Now, as someone who watches Cops, I can confirm that getting arrested and getting boozily hospitalized does not seem fun or safe. As someone who goes to Harvard, however, I can attest to the fact that students here don’t really get the chance to go insane often. I suppose that one could argue that Harvard-Yale counts, but I would disagree that blasting ‘Mr. Brightside’ at 11 a.m. amongst a sea of students who don’t know what football is suffices as such an activity.  Plus, the Scream usually becomes an anxiously brisk walk by the time that the mob clumps up in front of the John Harvard Statue—nothing that a tube of Neosporin and a Band-Aid couldn’t fix up.
If President Bacow takes away Primal Scream, I probably won’t do anything, but boy, will I be mildly upset. My only solace after a semester of getting my self-confidence and intellect slain by classes that stress me out is donning my birthday suit and pretending that I’m in good enough shape to run around the Yard once. Primal Scream is beautiful. This December, I saw four guys hoist a freshman and carry him around as one unit of nude brotherhood. I saw a 'Seven Nation Army' chant break out amongst complete strangers. I saw half of the band see another person naked for the first time. Yes, it was a nightmare, but it was a wonderful one.
If there is one cause that Harvard ought to rally behind this spring, it is protecting our precious Scream. Without it, who knows how stressed students will be when finals start? I can only imagine the fear in the eyes of a poor freshman who doesn’t have a proper excuse for doing terribly on their first exam. Let us keep this, Larry. Primal Scream is what we want. Primal Scream is what we need.

Dear Veritawkward,I have been really close with my nextdoor neighbor all year, and I started developing feelings for her over break. I decided to share my feelings, in hopes of a romantic Valentine’s Day. Her response? “I just want to be friends.” How can I keep being friends with her if I want more?                                                      Sincerely,                                                      Friendzoned in February
Dear Friendzoned,First of all, props to you for making a move! No, seriously. While it may not have gone the way you hoped, having that kind of confidence and go-getter attitude will get you far in life—just make sure you don’t turn into section kid.
Anyways, you took your shot, and it missed the mark. Yikes. If you feel like you need to wallow, keep your self-pity contained to one night of eating ice cream and watching The Notebook on repeat. After that, pick yourself up and remember that just because she said no, that’s not a negative reflection on you! Channel all your angsty energy into acing your classes, actually doing that reading you’ve been putting off, and spending time with your friends. Regarding this Girl-Next-Door, if you truly value her friendship, you’ll find a way to make it work. Maybe you need your space right now, which is totally understandable, and definitely don’t feel forced to be around her if you feel too hurt. If/When you realize that you miss her as a friend, just tell her that. You know that she still wants to be friends, so that security will make it much easier when you attempt to move forward.
Long story short, take some time for yourself, and really evaluate what you want. If you truly enjoy having this girl in your life, you’ll realize that this one incident isn’t worth losing her over. Be warned, though...awkward encounters in the hallway might ensue in the next few days. That’s just life, my friend. It’s only awkward if you make it that way. Good luck, Veritawkward
Dear Veritawkward,Someone I like was only willing to be "friends with benefits." He insisted he didn't want a real relationship, but would then flirtatiously say we should get married or have kids, and say that he cared about me and that I made him happy. I would consistently get my hopes up only to be let down! We continued this for three months before deciding to end things. Now, we’re trying to be just friends, but I still have feelings for him. He's already seeing someone new and is willing to commit to them, which confuses me. I want to be friends, but keep getting hurt. What should I do?  Sincerely, Just Friends...with Benefits?
Dear Just Friends,Oh, boy. I hate to be blunt, but you need to cut this dude from your life. Before you inevitably start coming up with reasons not to, hear me out.
First of all, anyone who brings up marriage and kids in college (even if it’s a joke) seriously needs to reevaluate their priorities. The only kids you need to be thinking about are the food babies you’ll get at Jefe’s on Saturday night. Second, this sounds like the definition of being strung along. And seriously, Just Friends, nobody deserves to be toyed with, especially you. You are a strong person, and anyone who would keep leading you on when they know you have feelings for them is a jerk. It’s super selfish, and as much as you think you like this person, being in a real relationship with him would be miserable. Someone who doesn’t appreciate you and value you doesn’t deserve to have you in their life. Period, end of story. I know it’s hard to hear, but sometimes the truth is hard.
Regarding this new person he’s seeing, don’t waste your time wondering why Grade-A Jerk is willing to commit to them and not to you. It has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with Mr. Jerk-off not realizing he let an incredible person slip away. I’ve been in your shoes countless times before, and I know how it feels to be grasping at straws to keep a person you like in your life. But honestly, being friends with this person sounds like it’s just hurting you, and that’s not a healthy way to live. He needs to go. It’s for the best, and it’ll feel so liberating to not have to worry about him anymore. Keep your head up,Veritawkward
