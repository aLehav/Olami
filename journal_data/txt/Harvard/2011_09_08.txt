After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
America’s national anthem ends with the phrase: “O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.” Does the land of the free also have to be the land of the unemployed?
Over the past few years our nation has been struggling to recover from a recession marked by high unemployment. In 2009, President Obama responded to this situation by issuing a gigantic stimulus package worth $787 billion. While it may have averted a deeper recession, it did not correct our trajectory.
Last week’s report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that our country is in crisis with our unemployment rate stuck at 9.1 percent. More importantly American citizens and families are in crisis. In 2009 President Obama promised a reduction to an eight percent unemployment rate. Clearly, we are on the wrong path. President Obama now suggests municipal construction projects as a solution. At best, this will create temporary jobs, but will not fix the issue in the long term.
For 20 years, I have worked with major corporations and government agencies to identify what I call “lazy assets”—underutilized and often unrecognized physical, intellectual, or cultural assets in an organization—and have helped apply these assets in new ways to propel these organizations to reinvent  themselves to be successful in an ever-changing marketplace.
Following my strategic advice in the 1980s, Hewlett Packard moved from the instrumentation business to computers, in the 1990s to services, in the 2000s to the Internet. They are now moving to Web 2.0. HP became a dominant force in creating jobs, growing from 70,000 employees in 1980, to a workforce of over 300,000 in 2011.
As former Yale University President Kingman Brewster said when I lingered on the stage after receiving my degree, “Son, keep moving, keep moving.” Constant forward movement has made America successful, it is our culture to be entrepreneurial.
The Internet was created through a collaboration of academic, business, and government-sponsored ingenuity. Two billion people now use the internet, a third of the world’s population, and use is growing! Today, globalization is instant. Sharing of knowledge is rapid. Opportunities abound. Facebook did not exist seven years ago. Through the creativity of a group of students at Harvard, 743 million people now have Facebook pages.
What do we do next? Where are the jobs? Who is going to create them? How do we plan to continually adapt?
President Obama, we call upon you to give American entrepreneurs (that is, those who create jobs) and businesses the tools they need to create jobs.
First, fund and sponsor relevant research in such a way that the resultant intellectual property is released into the public domain particularly focusing on new rapidly growing areas such as regenerative medicine, cloud technology, and healthcare. The businesses established as a result of this research which will create new, good, jobs. A blind squirrel will find a nut in these areas!
Second, identify and publicly praise entrepreneurs and companies that start new businesses and create substantial numbers of jobs. Counter the seemingly strong hostility toward business in America.
Third, make it easier for businesses, small and large, to continuously take the risks demanded by a rapidly changing marketplace to create and sustain jobs for tomorrow.
Fourth, make capital available to small businesses. Currently, it is virtually impossible for small or new businesses to obtain capital. Many mechanisms could change that, including government-backed insurance for banks to take risks and share in the successes.
Fifth, leverage social networks and evolving technologies to encourage and empower entrepreneurship.
On the wall of Harvard  University’s Bush-Reisinger’s Museum, there is a German saying, “Du kannst, denn du sollst”—“If you can, you must.”
President Obama, if you can assist American citizens to create meaningful, lasting jobs, you must.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:
A former highly placed Harvard administrator has suggested that I train  train my sights on  the Freshman Dean’s kindness pledge—I teach First Amendment law and have written a book on liberty. Now to articulate why the Freshman Dean’s Kindness Pledge is both hilariously inappropriate and offensively coercive is a formidable intellectual challenge. As a character in famous novel said, “If you don’t understand it without an explanation, you won’t understand it with one.”  It is like trying to explain a joke.  It’s certainly not that the decanal heart isn’t in the right place, nor that kindness is not a surpassing value.  After all,   Dean (now Justice) Elena Kagan is justly celebrated for—among other things—making Harvard Law School a kinder, more agreeable as well as intellectually more thrilling place.  But she would no more have thought of proposing that students (and faculty—why not?) sign a kindness pledge than she would have prescribed a dress code or banned pizzas as too salty and fatty.  Ah, but that’s a law school and these are college freshman, the Taliban of 6 Prescott Street might reply. And they would have a point. It’s a matter of time and place.  There is a place for the Kindness Pledge: Harvard’s six excellent day care centers.  But the pledge does serve an educational function. It teaches incoming undergraduates that administrators can be as silly as the rest of us. And don’t forget that other pledge that is making the rounds: the Tea Party’s no new taxes pledge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday—Labor Day—while many of us might have been savoring one last bit of summer away from Harvard, or at Harvard wishing we were savoring it somewhere else, 500 unionized Harvard employees and their supporters marched for better contracts. The rally saw security guards and dining hall workers demand a mixture of improved working conditions. For security guards, year round pay and split hours were the issue; for the dining hall workers, it was a coveted 40-hour workweek and, intriguingly, more “sustainable” food production.
Although it’s a term often used but rarely defined, “sustainability” in this case means that dining hall workers want to see more food preparation moved back in-house, after the College’s increased outsourcing to industrial-like operations run by the likes of large catering companies like Sysco.
As students who have not studied the minute details of the carbon footprint left by Harvard University Dining’s Services’ operations, it’s difficult to assess how much of an environmental difference the dining staff’s demands would actually effect. Although the relatively novel occurrence of labor activism entwined with sustainable causes provokes welcome attention, onlookers should have good reason to be skeptical whether a marriage of convenience isn’t really the major motivating factor behind this move. To that end, Harvard and UNITE HERE—the HUHDS’ staff union—should, at the very least, investigate more seriously whether in-sourcing this massive culinary production will really be greener before making any decision on so-called environmental grounds. We’d be curious to know.
From a student perspective, however, these demands only shed more light on another aspect of what might be called the HUHDS “experience”—namely, the quality of the food produced. Many undergraduates at Harvard, not too mention other residents of the Houses, frequently express the opinion that the quality—in terms of both the taste and nutritional value—of HUHDS food has deteriorated considerably over the years. This can range from the absence of hot breakfasts in the Yard Houses to the obvious reality that much of the food served is pre-frozen and stands little chance of making it beyond standard institutional grade fare.
In that sense, regardless of its environmental impact, students have every reason to support the unions’ proposal. If the proposal entails more people spending more time to prepare better meals—and doing more of the actual cooking on-site with higher quality, healthier ingredients—then student-employee interests seem very much aligned.
Of course, Harvard’s entire community has a stake in helping our institution maintain a healthy budget, but—at the same time—resource allocations seem to have strayed too far away from prioritizing food and, to some extent, dining. It’s a reasonable and good thing to spend a lot of money on food. There’s also no reason to have lower quality food than peer institutions: Harvard, after all, remains by far the best-endowed higher education institution in the United States and the world. It seems that all too often, undergraduates share stories of leaving their House dining halls with a sour taste in their mouths, starting to get stomach cramps, and strangely not that full having just eaten a pile of assorted food.
Admittedly, UNITE HERE’s call for more “sustainable” methods of food production has yet to be convincingly substantiated with evidence that longer workers’ hours will actually have any impact on the environment whatsoever. That said, the prospect of more cooking brought back to our kitchens—including the massive, largely unused, bakery underneath Kirkland and Eliot Houses—makes the proposals worth supporting in any case.
Bottom line: Healthier, tastier food could be just over the horizon for Harvard. And, for once, we’re not just talking about next week’s department lunch at the Faculty Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
September 11, 2001 was supposed to go the way of December 7, 1941. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904 and former Crimson president, pledged that it was a date that would live in infamy, but today most Americans refer to that day as the “Attack on Pearl Harbor,” not December 7. Years after the September terrorist attacks, linguists wondered if “9/11” would follow suit, and be given a name that reflects the actual events that transpired that day.
Sunday marks the tenth anniversary of September 11, and the date is still nameless. Congress passed a resolution officially declaring it “Patriot Day,” but for some reason our country prefers to leave 9/11 just as it is, a date frozen in time, as though somehow, somewhere, the towers are still falling.
A recent article traces the etymology of the name “9/11” in the public discourse, but most New Yorkers know that “9/11” is the antithesis of a name—it’s a placeholder for one. In the weeks and months that followed, you couldn’t bring yourself to say what had happened, to put it into words. The moment the day came up in a sentence, you just paused and realized that there was something ineffable about the whole thing, something distant and unspeakable. “We were planning on going upstate,” an average sentence might have gone a few weeks after the attacks, “but after…September 11…we didn’t think it was appropriate.”
This phenomenon is far from foreign to me. In the Jewish tradition, the day every year on which one commemorates the death of a close relative is called a “yahrzeit,” roughly translating to “a year’s time.” The name captures the essence of the inexpressibility of what is often lost when one loses a family member. It’s an emotion that was conveyed to me quite vividly after I watched my parents mourn the deaths of their own parents, sitting in silence and attempting to comprehend what had just happened.
More than a mere memorial day, a yahrzeit represents the necessity to break from the rhythm of life every once in a while and reflect on the indelible and inexpressible imprint a tragedy has left on your life. You’ve not only lost a loved one, the tradition tells you. You’ve lost a part of yourself.
9/11 marks such a yahrzeit for our generation. And on its tenth anniversary, it’s worth reflecting on the meaning conveyed by the day’s namelessness—the sense that Americans our age, in particular, lost something more than just the lives of those who perished that day.
The Cold War ended before most of us had our first memories. We led our early lives during the Clinton Administration, an era that for the first time in decades wasn’t characterized by the paranoia of our parents’ generation, with overtones of defense spending, espionage, and enemies on our soil. I remember a television host when I was 11 toasting to the fact that the United States wasn’t at war with anyone, and I wondered aloud why the United   States would possibly be at war with anyone. With no foreign enemy threatening our very existence, our generation celebrated some of its best years during a climate of peace, before we had our innocence shaken out of us over the course of two hours on a clear September morning.
On that day, the principal of my school gathered my nine-year-old sister’s class together to tell them what had happened. He paused for a moment, hesitantly, and then prefaced his remarks with the following phrase:
“There are bad people in this world.”
Those seven words hovered in the background for the last 10 years of our lives. We soon came of age in a time of terrorism, deterrence, foreign wars, and security states—of Patriot Acts, detentions, torture, and drone strikes. Bin Laden’s death released some of the anxiety that had been building inside of us for the last decade, but lurking in the background there’s still this unshakable feeling left by the events of September 11—the feeling that, underneath it all, they had forced us to grow up far too soon.
The College is offering a number of programs this Sunday to help us share our experiences about the attacks. Together, we will continue to attempt to describe the indescribable, and coalesce as a generation around the day that changed us forever. And when we stand on the steps of Memorial  Church as a community on Sunday to commemorate a year’s time, we should not only mourn for those who were murdered in cold blood on 9/11, but for our childhood. For our innocence. For ourselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently at breakfast, a friend of mine remarked with feigned frustration that President Obama had selected a Princeton Professor, Alan Krueger, rather than a Harvard economist to head his Council of Economic Advisors. Much to my surprise, another person at the table offered sarcastically, “Yeah, that’s just what we need, another Ivy-League academic making policy in the White House. Whenever we do that, things get worse, regardless of party.”
It may be unnecessary to say that this person was Republican, but that is not without significance.  Though the mantle of anti-intellectual populism has been passed from party to party over the years, right now it rests squarely in the hands of the GOP.  Conservative America’s pervasive skepticism—if not flat-out rejection—of the beliefs of the intellectual elite is materially harmful.  It is this strain of thought that leads to the vilification of science among some circles in the Republican Party, ultimately resulting in a destructively cavalier attitude towards carbon emissions and global warming.  It allows a quarter of Americans to disregard evolution despite its nearly universal acceptance among those who know what it actually is.  Furthermore, when a candidate can be maligned for academic and intellectual accomplishments, not only is the quality of political discourse in our republic debased, but so is the quality of its leadership.
One recent high-profile example of anti-intellectual nonsense in our political discourse was directed at someone whom many would claim has not earned the right to receive anti-intellectual attacks: George W. Bush.  Rick Perry, in order to sure up his conservative credentials, contrasted himself with the notoriously profligate ex-president  by saying, “I went to Texas A&M. He went to Yale.” At face value it is a statement of apparent fact, but it is pregnant with meaning.  To conservatives emotionally scarred by Bush’s “compassionate conservatism,” Perry is offering an explanation of how someone who shared his no-apologies demeanor and Texas swagger could be such a lightweight conservative.  Clearly, Bush was either corrupted at Yale, or the same factors that made him spend the country into oblivion also led him to think going to Yale was a good idea.  Perry, not unlike Palin back when she loved to talk about “real America,” is trying to appropriate the distrust conservatives have for east-coast institutions, higher learning, and those select Gomorrahs where the two combine to bolster his ‘common-man’ reputation.
The delicious irony here is that it was George W. Bush’s father who in 1988 attempted to capitalize on anti-Ivy-League political rhetoric in a notoriously ridiculous way.  In a sentence, our forty-first president demonstrated the absurdity of attaching political value-judgments to someone’s status as the graduate of an elite university.   At the 1988 Republican National Convention, this multi-millionaire, Yale-educated senator’s son derided Governor Dukakis’ foreign policy as “born in Harvard Yard’s Boutique.” Aside from the fact that Dukakis attended Harvard Law School, which does not entail any time spent on Harvard Yard, Bush’s statement is self-evidently absurd.  Dukakis was the son of a Greek immigrant and a famously popular governor who could in no way be construed as more distant from the people than then-Vice President Bush.
Perhaps there was a time when attending an institution like Harvard signified a distance from the elusive “common man” or “common woman,” but one look at the life stories of the likes of Barack Obama, Ben Bernanke ’75, Michael Dukakis, or Deval Patrick ’78 quickly dispels this myth insofar as it applies today.  Yet the question remains as to whether there is any correlation between “commonness” and the promulgation of policy that benefits “common” people.  The careers of both Presidents Roosevelt seem to suggest not, while the humbly educated and lovably everyman Ronald Regan pursued policies that led to drastic increases in income inequality.
So what, after all, is wrong ivy-educated policymakers? If the implicit claim of those who attack candidates based on their prestigious education is that somehow these institutions harm their students by filling them with false or destructive ideas, then I would encourage them to demonstrate the superior policies of their chosen set.  If the claim is that the very fact of attending such a university proves that a candidate cannot understand his or her constituents, then I point to such examples as Bill Clinton.  Yet, if the claim is that students at these universities cannot be relied upon to espouse the kind of unwavering, slavish obedience to the most hard-line brand of conservative political and religious doctrine, then I guess they might have a point.

Some people say housing day is the best day of the year. For our blocking group, it was a little different. One of our blockmates cried, one threatened to get an apartment, and another stopped speaking entirely for seven hours. That’s right, we got Quadded, exiled to a neighborhood closer to our peers at Lesley University than  our 10 a.m. class in Sever, or any remnants of old Harvard ivy-enlaced grandeur, or—worst of all—the Hong Kong Restaurant, Lounge, and Nightclub.
Now we’re sophomores, and having just moved into the chicest nursing home on campus, Currier House, we’re here to dispel the myths that we believed as foolish freshmen on that fateful day in March when 12 tree huggers ran into our room chanting and dancing around in not-so-appealing green bathing suits.
The worst part of living in the Quad isn’t the distance, which isn’t that bad by the way. It’s telling people that you live in the Quad. People react as if you’ve been diagnosed with leprosy or you’re moving to Yemen. For instance, if one says, “I’m living in Cabot House,” one’s Eliot “friend” might respond, “I’m so sorry; you didn’t deserve that”—to which we would say, “No one died, y’all. Except maybe the cockroaches you had to kill last night in your infested room.”
We actually enjoy coming home to our huge singles at night, hanging out in Quad dining halls with our Quad pals, and making friends with Shuttle Boy. (No one ever told us he wasn’t real. Why can he only ever hang out in seven minutes? And why does he always want to take us to Mather? )
Sure, the 4:30 a.m. fire drills aren’t the best, and maybe February won’t be our favorite month, but the Quad has already become a cozy home base, and we’re in great shape from walking back and forth from the river and running to catch the party shuttle for our nightly dose of strobe and swerves.
We’re excited to see how it all turns out, and  we’ll be sending dispatches from the back of the magazine here throughout the semester. For now, at least, we understand that the worst part is the stereotype and the best part is not having to sleep on a bunk bed as a senior—hey, Winthrop!

Freshman males. Even the name sounds ridiculous: one part naïve plus two parts masculine is just like a recipe for intolerable, and generally it is. But never fear, assorted bros: the upperclassmen are here for you. And for those of you that haven’t got a teammate, FOP leader, or high school acquaintance to take you under his avuncular wing, FM has assembled its own special team to give the freshman male the make-over he desperately needs.
At ’em, boys.
FASHION SAVANT
Between scenesters and prepsters and philosophy doctorates, there’s no single Harvard look—so don’t try and fit in. Even still, it’s important to keep in mind the underlying principles of Ivy style, which are hard to decode when you’re new around here.
If there’s one thing people love, it’s privilege. If there are two things people love, they’re privilege and watersports. A real winner learns to combine the two: put some whales on your bowtie, some sailing boats on your short-shorts, and a harpoon gun on the front of your bicycle. Go hard for your habitus, bro.
There’s one other fashion item which is yours to rock and yours alone, and that’s the lanyard. In a place like this you’ve got to be in control. Oh shit, where are your keys? You know exactly where they are. Wait, have you got your ID on you? Fuck yeah, you do. So, uh, what school do you go to? You don’t even have to tell them. It’s dangling from your neck.
Because you’re in control, man.
A wide range of coastal-chic clothing is available at J. Press and The Andover Shop, and if you hunt well for bargains you can usually pick up a sock or two for below the $200 mark. You’ve already received a Harvard lanyard for free.
FOOD AND WINE CONNOISSEUR
Sometimes it seems like all the guys drink here is cheap beer in red cups. You get a chance to stand out from the crowd if you follow our advice and keep a few bottles of cheap red wine sitting around your room. Not only is it actually quite tasty—though tasty in a balsamic-vinegar-and-battery-acid kind of way—its presence in your room will lend your pad a sense of otherwordly sophistication that underage Americans just love.
If you end up actually having to serve this wine to other freshmen, then try to keep things modest. Just stab out the cork with your buddy’s Swiss Army knife, fill up those Solo cups, and continually draw attention to the fact that you’re drinking wine, and wine is really sophisticated. Just like you.
Don’t bother with Two Buck Chuck—that’s just passé. You can get a dry Pinot Noir [PEE-nott NOI-ah] at Trader Joe’s for $2.99 plus tax, which you should vindicate as “not a bad drop” in your best Queen’s English.
GROOMING GURU
College is the time for experimenting, and that goes for facial hair as well. There are too many guys out there wasting their best years on baby-bum chins and bald upper lips. Rookie error, chicos. Freshman year is the time to redefine yourself—sure, you like to work hard, but you’re a chill guy as well, and what better way to show you’re laid-back and interesting than a scraggly patch of man-shrub on your face?
A beardy fuzz works great with the ladies, but all insiders know that the moustache is the key to the city. When every square in the room is exposing his soft, pasty philtrum for the world to see, you’re the boss in the corner exuding rugged mystery behind your Charlie Chaplin toothbrush. And who cares if it’s still a little whispy? Swag it off, little brother.
Facial hair won’t cost you a cent, but “Free Moustache Ride” T-shirts are available on zazzle.com for under $20.
DESIGN DOCTOR
A man’s home is his castle, they say, so make sure that yours shows you really are a king. Posters are a great start. To show that your heart’s in the right place—and to really flip the bird to the man—grab an edgy looking stencil of Che Guevara or a Bob Marley with a marijuana leaf. Twinkly Christmas lights will showcase your sensitivity, and a giant tower of red cups functions both as a vague symbol of virility and as a tangible expression of your wild side.
If you really want to do something special for the freshman ladies, then your best bet is getting yourself a pet. Animals are illegal, hence a rebellious kind of sexy, but they also show you’ve got a well-developed capacity for nurturing. And to cap it all off, if your animal’s species is the same as a final club’s name, people will think you’re all up in the upperclass party scene every time you’re talking about your pet. I couldn’t tell you how much ass I got as a frosh because my roomies and I owned a fox called “The Pudding.”
Posters at Newbury Comics start at around $10; red foxes tend to be prohibitively expensive but there are easy-to-follow instructions for home-made fox traps on about.com.
CULTURE VULTURE
Freshman girls will tell you that they really just love nice guys. Don’t believe them. Freshman girls really love guys with accomplishments—and I mean all kinds of accomplishments. Take every opportunity to bring up your SAT scores, your high school extracurriculars, and how much you and your buddies drank over the summer. A good collection of conquest underwear displayed in your room can certainly help in this regard; wearing a Wellesley lanyard around can kill two birds with one stone.
At the end of the day, though, the key to your romantic success here is culture. Dance floor wooing is all about mouthing the words to the song that’s on—and nothing is quite so touching as when two beautiful young people stare into each other’s eyes across a party, two pairs of lips moving in perfect unison as they spell out the chorus of “Bitches Ain’t Shit” together. So brush up on your lyrics, bro.
Fake conquest underwear can be purchased from Tokyo vending machines for a few hundred yen.

Ames Brown is not your typical nerd.  One of the final four on this summer’s season of “The Bachelorette”, and a contestant on its spinoff, “Bachelor Pad”, he’s shown his fair share of both brains and brawn. With a B.A. from Yale, an M.B.A. and an M.S. from Columbia, and a D.B.A. from Harvard Business School, Brown credits his nerdiness as a major factor in helping him get so far in the reality dating show, chiseled six-pack aside.
Given his very public experience with dating, FM sat down with Brown to chat about what it’s like to kiss in front of the cameras, how he got involved in the reality show business, and what being sexy really entails these days.
Fifteen Minutes: What would you consider the perfect date in Harvard Square?
Ames Brown: In the two years I was on campus, I didn’t go on a date. It’s the only subject where I have no expertise. I was so romantically inept at Harvard. I thought I was screwed on the show; I didn’t even know why they took me. The one thing is that when you get out of Harvard, nerdy is pretty romantic, which was a total surprise to me ... not getting a date on campus was also not because I wasn’t trying, just want to say.
FM: Well, hypothetically, what would be an ideal date in the area?
AB: Hypothetically, an ideal date would probably be some walk along the river and walking by the Science Center so you can make fun of it together, that would be a unifying experience. Daedalus in the summer would have been really nice, and a picnic along the Charles would have been a dream.
FM: How did you get involved with “The Bachelorette?”
AB: They found me in the airport and said “Oh my god you’d be perfect for the show!” and I totally said yes because I was single. And I thought I was going to do horribly, but I did pretty well. The stuff that carried me through was all Harvard nerdy stuff. Apparently, nerdy can be sexy.
FM: You made it work in your favor.
AB: [Laughs] For once.
FM: Beyond having all the cameras around you, what’s the biggest difference between dating on the show and dating in real life?
AB: The biggest difference for me is going in for a kiss, because if you go in for a kiss in real life, your heart is beating, you don’t know if it’s going to work, if the kiss doesn’t go, you’re just going to be so embarrassed and it feels so high risk. But on the show if you go in for the kiss and the kiss doesn’t work, it feels like the world is going to end, and it makes it even more scary. Also, the pressure for good conversation is really high, I feel like in real life you can sneak by with okay conversation, but on the show ... that conversation better be interesting every minute.
FM: Since you did your undergrad at Yale, which place do you think is more romantic—New Haven or Cambridge?
AB: I would say Cambridge was a more romantic city, even though I never went on a date there. [Laughs] Anything with a river is pretty.

There’s an all-you-can-eat meat restaurant called Carnivore on a moored boat down the Nile from downtown Cairo. It’s one of those places you treat yourself to, because it’s expensive even by Western standards and because there is only so much meat you can eat in a month. I was in the city for two, writing for a local English-language newspaper.
I was eating dinner there at the end of June with my friend Pierre, a filmmaker, when his mother called. She lived in the area. They’re back in Tahrir, she told him.
What she meant was, at least partially, be careful. Protests had generally been peaceful since the regime fell nearly five months before, but everyone knew that when it got late—at midnight, they said—the police came out. By that time, the women and children had left, the foreign media was less likely to be around, and darkness provided easy cover for the sort of thing no police force wants caught on tape.
But she also meant, partially, this is something you don’t want to miss. This was something different. The protests were real again. She knows that Pierre carries a camera around with him for a reason.
Pierre’s parents are both Egyptian, but he grew up in Canada and the States. He went to film school in Colorado, and he was there, glued to al-Jazeera’s live online video stream, when Egyptians first flooded the streets in January. When classes ended in the spring, he moved in with his mom in Cairo to make a documentary on post-Revolution Egypt.
I made him wait for dessert to come—he blew me out of the water in our eating contest, having thirds of the ostrich meat, and I planned to make a comeback with the vanilla ice cream—but we were only halfway through when we changed our minds. We dropped our spoons and headed out.
The cabbie said he’d heard that the Interior Ministry—about four blocks from Tahrir—was on fire. If that were true, this was serious, this was something major: the Interior Ministry was a symbol of the old regime’s tyranny. Its security forces had shot at protesters, live bullets. The institution survived the Revolution, but then so did its repressive reputation.
He dropped us off at the end of the bridge, a short walk from Tahrir Square. He wouldn’t go any closer, but he was polite about it.
When we arrived in the Square on the other side of the Nile, the canisters of tear gas were falling sporadically.
It wasn’t the ocean of people like in the pictures. We walked straight up to the center, a grassy circle surrounded by normally-traffic-plagued boulevards. There were other people watching with us, advancing and retreating according to how much gas was up ahead. In front—the front being the corner of the square where the police had chosen to take their stand—hundreds of young men stared down their opposites in anti-riot gear at the end of the street that enters Tahrir Square. The Interior Ministry was well behind them. We found out later that it hadn’t been aflame.
First you would hear a horn from the police side. It seemed to be a warning. It was hard to tell in the back of the crowd. Then they launched the canister. It flew up in the air, crackling like New Year’s wands, and on the ground everyone waited, all eyes looking up. When you had an idea where it would land, you ran the opposite way—the opposite of baseball, fielding something that wasn’t there. We fled the poison gas.
Pierre struggled to focus the camera—a tripod was out of the question—as I yelled at him to run some way or another. He stumbled over a curb evading a canister that I’d seen too late to warn him, with the camera in one hand, catching himself. I laughed because it was funny. It was funny that we were here right then. We were wandering in somebody else’s Revolution.
There was one section of the Square that didn’t fall directly in the path of the police launchers. We found some relief there. Pierre lifted his camera towards the launchers. I took a break from scouting duties. I started to look horizontally. That’s when I saw Mahmoud walking by.
I’d met him at an American journalist’s house party. It was a party where we all wore galabeyas, traditional Egyptian clothing. It was a joke. Mahmoud is the type of person whom you wouldn’t catch wearing such long pantless clothing in the street. In Tahrir Square, he was calmly making his way over to the police blockade in a large group that was flowing back and forth with the intensity of the teargas shots, a school of fish swimming into the current.
Seeing Pierre and me, Mahmoud stepped out of his informal formation to greet us. He asked if everything was ok.
“I have to go,” he said apologetically. Lifting the end of his scarf to his mouth, squinting behind his thick glasses, he turned into the crowd. Most of the young people were wearing jeans, like Mahmoud, but there were some galabeyas too. I watched Mahmoud jog away, and then lost him as he blended into the mass of people and smoke and shouting, rejoining his generation.
When I wrote to my parents of the experience in the Square, my father said it reminded him of his days protesting the Vietnam War. He said to be careful, because at least back then, except at Kent State, he was reasonably sure they wouldn’t shoot live ammo, but in Egypt you never knew.
He’d told me about his trips to Washington with college buddies, but I never really imagined him facing down the National Guard on the National Mall. That was at Kent State, or Columbia, or at an SDS rally.
But my father was a freshman on May 8, 1970, when 4 million students the country over walked out on classes. Here at Harvard, 35,000 people rallied at Soldier’s Field. It was the only nationwide strike in U.S. history, and my father was a part of it.
I can imagine his protest days in D.C. It was an eight hour trip to the Capitol. There were four of them in a car, and they all took turns driving. One of them was a conservative, and my father and the others spent the whole ride arguing with him. When they got to Washington, three of them went one way, and one went another. My father and his friends marched to the White House front gate where, in line with thousands of others, they stepped forward, one by one, and called out the name of an American killed in Vietnam.
I’m sure he felt that same pull that drew Mahmoud into the thick of things, a feeling that was similar to but not exactly the same as standing there watching the gas canisters fall.
Egypt is a country of 81 million people, of which 29 percent are between the ages of 15 and 29.  In the United States, that figure is 21 percent. Since 1952 Egypt has been ruled by an authoritarian figure, and for the past 30 years by Hosni Mubarak, an air force officer who became President when Anwar Sadat was assassinated. Then, on January 25, which is National Police Day in Egypt, several activist groups hoped to draw a crowd to protest the brutality of the Interior Ministry police force. The Tunisian president had fled earlier that month under the pressure of popular protests, and while these protesters were less ambitious, they were riding a wave of popular sentiment.
That day, January 25, 2011, tens of thousands of people heeded the call to protest, storming the streets. What had been a minor event became something much larger. And the crowds hardly left—on Friday, after the Noon Prayer, the numbers skyrocketed.  Hundreds of thousands flooded the streets that day, labeled the “Day of Anger,” with incidents of violence erupting across the country.
It took 18 difficult days—days of families barricading their doors and vigilante police forces securing neighborhoods—to push President Mubarak out.
After that, the military took over, as an interim government. The Supreme Council of Armed Forces assumed power. It was during that time that the signs went up across the city, ones that said things like “Egypt first, Egypt forever,” and “God will protect Egypt.” They were still up when I arrived in June, at the airport, passing through immigration, one with a quote from President Obama with which I was unfamiliar: “We should raise our children to be like Egyptian youth.” Even in America’s most jingoistic moments I wasn’t used to seeing that kind of nationalism. It wasn’t until later that I realized that many of the signs covered posters of Mubarak.
Mahmoud wasn’t really an activist. He was going into his third year at Ain Shams University in Cairo, and not thrilled to be studying commerce. He had written a play with his sister about a young woman who suffers through cancer. He dreaded the mandatory stint in the military that was still two years away.
The real activists—the ones the newspapers love talking about—were coordinating protests on Twitter and Facebook. They were calling for doctors in the Square. They were holding press conferences and writing slogans. They were getting on the loudspeaker at the mosque beside Tahrir and barking orders.
They were big names like Khaled Said, 28, whose death at the hands of overzealous police in June of 2010 was a major catalyst for the January protests. There was Wael Ghonim, 31, the Google executive whose Facebook site, “We are all Khaled Said,” drew more than 100,000 followers. And there were people like Mohamed Adel, the 23 year-old spokesperson for the April 6th Youth Movement, a precursor to the January protests and now a part of the post-Revolutionary discourse.
But Mahmoud, no less a patriot, represented a different sort of youth activist. He believed in the ideals of the revolution and knew that his presence at demonstrations meant something. He wasn’t behind the bullhorn, but he showed up. He was part of a generation of some 20 million young Egyptian men and women grabbing the reins. Some days, for the more volatile protests, he needed his parent’s permission to come downtown.
Tahrir Square had been quiet for a month.  But that changed earlier in the afternoon when families of the hundreds of men and women who had lost their lives during the protests—the Martyrs of the Revolution—enacted their usual call for recompense elsewhere in the city. This time, it devolved into confrontation with the police. Arrests were made, activists remobilized, and Tahrir Square was once again center stage, filling with crowds and strangely quiet due to the absence of cars, that knew to avoid the area.
Sometimes you don’t see it coming. Pierre the journalist leaves the safe space and you follow suit. You aren’t looking. Or the police inconsiderately aimed horizontally and you don’t have time to see it. You find yourself in a gas cloud, running into the wind, whose direction you’ve determined long minutes ago. Holding your breath, breathing through your mouth when you must, your eyes tear up, your face burns. You can’t see so you just keep running.
They say Pepsi reduces the burning sensation—no one quite knew why, a Google search, the soda’s acidity counteracting the basic chemicals in the gas—and someone was always around to offer a splash.
They toss rocks and chant lines dating back from January. Then the teargas would come. The canister in the sky, the din of protests becoming shouts of warnings. When it hit the ground, spontaneous volunteers of all ages running to the canister and dousing it in water, covering it under a box, or picking it up, running it to the police line, throwing it back. You can’t tell what the police do when the gas comes back at them. Their helmets and shields are no defense, and they are as cramped up against the divide as the protesters, across from them, on top of them, us.
At some point, the police began to retreat. They shot off a final round of tear gas canisters and then they took a few steps back. The two police vehicles at the front rang their sirens and the whole line moved backwards.
Pierre and I followed along and watched as the whole process repeated itself. The protesters throw rocks, the police fire gas—I later heard accounts of bird shot and rubber bullets but saw none—the people run, the people return, the police retreat.
Soon we found ourselves a block behind the protesters. Motorcycles were carrying the injured—overexposure to the gas, hit by a rock or canister—back up the street, where several ambulances were stationed.
Glass broke at the KFC—colloquially known as “Kentucky”—midway down the block, and a semicircle immediately formed around the store. Possible looters were dissuaded.
“They must not have heard, Kentucky made its last call hours ago,” joked a young man next to us, fumes of smoke and teargas enveloping the area where the police had stood less than an hour earlier.
Two weeks from now, a “Million Man March” will take place, with all the momentum of the summer up till then. Nearly one hundred thousand people—families, women, children, university students, older men in galabeyas, journalists, activists, food vendors—will gather in the Square.
Loudspeakers will blast. Stages will be set up. Each faction of the protesters will be represented.
Leaders will hoist an enormous white tent over much of the Square’s green, providing shelter from the desert sun. Some will literally pitch their own tents, sleep in the open there.
Some things will happen. Some things will change, as a result. They will reshuffle the cabinet, they will speed some trials up, not everyone’s. But come August first, the first day of Ramadan, the army will kick everyone out of the Square. And they will go, quietly, without protest.
The part that I never asked my father about his Vietnam War demonstrations is the ride back. He put it all behind him and went back to school. But he had been there.  More than that, he had been part of it. It was something that didn’t wear off no matter how long the drive. When I lost sight of Mahmoud in the crowd, in Egypt, that June, he was surrounded by young men with their fists in the air, chanting. I don’t think he had his hand in the air. He didn’t seem the type, not yet anyway. I couldn’t bring myself to have my hand in the air either. I too believed in democracy, justice, freedom, but right now I was only watching.
Pierre and I turned back. It took us three minutes to make it to where we started, which had already developed into something of a carnival. Where tear gas had been fuming at the center of the square, a crowd of couples and curious observers mixed with the protesters still on location, the ones already setting up the stages. A couple kids were having a snowball fight of sorts with the stones still on the ground, the ones that had been chipped off the sidewalk earlier in the evening, for ammunition.
“So this is how you take a street,” Pierre said then.

Please describe your personal style: Comprehensive
How has your style changed/evolved since you’ve been at Harvard: I think in a sense my style has definitely become peppier, though I don’t mean it in a prim and pearls sense. It’s more that I think people in New England, particularly in Cambridge, embody a certain casual elegance that I’ve incorporated into my own taste. For example, I can’t seem to own enough button-down shirts, though mine tend to lack ponies or initials. I think they’re such an indispensable classic and even sexy piece and the perfect starting point for any outfit. Also, Harvard has made me obsessed with finding ways to remain stylish and comfortable in precipitation. I stalk rain boots.
What is your typical wear-to-class outfit: Wool tights, ankle boots, high-waisted shorts with a button-down shirt tucked in. Possibly something ridiculous in my hair.
How do you stay chic in the cold weather: Balance! The hardest part of cold-weather dressing is remaining chic in face of the inevitable and necessary bulk. Keep things streamlined with coats in flattering cuts. Even down parkas can be made slimming with the right length and quilting. Or, embrace the volume and go all out with a huge parka and a full scarf but balance it with very fitted bottoms: wool tights, leggings, jeggings, jeans—whatever you feel most comfortable in.
What is your one fall must-have: A fur vest
What’s one fall trend you wish would go away pronto: I hate calf-length boots. They hurt me. Not physically, just spiritually.
Name: Sonia S. Dara
House/Year: Eliot/2013
Hometown: Atlanta, Ga.
Please describe your personal style: Casual chic with the occasional sequin dress
What do you predict will be popular fall trends this year: Leather and tweed. Those two always make a “comeback.”
What is your one fall must-have: A great coat that you can throw on and automatically feel stylish in
What is your typical wear-to-class outfit: Jeans, boots, a top, and some sort of layer or sweater. I like to keep it simple.
What’s one fall trend you wish would go away pronto: Not sure how I feel about these bell bottom jeans from my middle school days coming back
What is your favorite single item of clothing/favorite accessory: A necklace I received a few years back. I never take it off!
Anything else you’d like to add about Harvard student style, fall style, style in general: Even though trends come and go, it seems to me that there are a few staple items in the Northeast that will never leave campus: Barbour jackets, Hunter boots, Tory Burch flats, and Longchamp bags.
Name: Oluwatobi “Tobi” T. Tikolo
House/Year: Adams/2014
Hometown: Lagos, Nigeria/West Sussex, England
Please describe your personal style: A mix of a ton of different things, sort of like me. Above anything else, it is an expression of my being. Glancing at it, my style is very classic, as bow ties and tassel loafers are core components of my wardrobe, but at the same time, like me, trying to find the fun in just existing as they are: case in point, my orange trousers.
How has your style changed/evolved since you’ve been at Harvard: My style has certainly become more experimental. I have been experimenting with a lot of academic fields and extracurriculars since my arrival, and this has influenced my style decisions, especially bold colors and patterns.
What is your one fall must-have: Colored socks
What is your typical wear-to-class outfit: Oxford shirt, corduroys, loafers, bow tie
How do you stay chic in the cold weather: I love tailored coats. A well cut coat can mask anything.
What is your favorite single item of clothing/favorite accessory: A shaggy wool jumper I bought in Scotland. Reason for this is that I bought it from a random factory while I was up there, it doesn’t have a label because they produce for a bunch of different brands, and it doesn’t have a distinct color, but nonetheless it is fantastic.
Anything else you’d like to add about Harvard student style, fall style, style in general: Can someone please tell me how to wear a bow tie with DHA?
What’s one fall trend you wish would go away pronto: Problem sets
Name: Jack Pretto
House/Year: Adams/2014
Hometown: Prospect, Conn.
Please describe your personal style: Urban Prep
How has your style changed/evolved since you’ve been at Harvard: In high school I dressed super preppy and only began to explore contemporary fashion trends in college. I experimented a lot in high school and feel more confident about my style as a result.
Who are your style icons/where do you look for fashion inspiration: I can’t say that I have a true style icon. As YSL said, “Fashions fade, style is eternal,” so the people I look to for inspiration change as fast as fashion. Right now I have been following Milan Vukmirovic, a fashion photographer, pretty closely. His laid back, casual style does not take away from his well-tailored, minimalist pieces.
What is your one fall must-have: A utility chambray shirt for guys and a fur vest for girls
What’s one fall trend you wish would go away pronto: Platform dress shoes
Name: Dae Won Lim
House/Year: Pfoho/2014
Hometown: S(e)oul City, South Korea
Please describe your personal style: Borrowing Tobi Tikolo’s words, “If your style was music, it would be electronic.” I would also add a little bit of Jazz.
How has your style changed/evolved since you’ve been at Harvard: Barbour has grown on me.
Who are your style icons/where do you look for fashion inspiration: Lapo Elkann and Scott Schuman. I often check the Sartorialist, and I always get the GQ and Esquire fall style issue. Also, I often ask my father for advice on ties and pocket squares.
What is your favorite single item of clothing/favorite accessory: I just stole my dad’s watch from the 80s. I think a leather strap epitomizes the classic autumnal touch.
Anything else you’d like to add about Harvard student style, fall style, style in general: Save the sweats for the winter and the mid-terms. Looking good: It’s a lifestyle.

Those 1990 June, July, and August babies who never had birthday parties in lower school because their friends were at sleepaway camp have returned to campus, 21 years old. Looking beyond the second floor of the Kong and the Daedalus rooftop, FM has compiled a list of lesser-known spots in which to enjoy newfound legality:
Cambridge Brewing Company
Located in Kendall Square, this restaurant and bar brews its own unique flavors, including beer infused with plum juice or heather flowers. It also offers patio seating and “beerunch” for those willing to forego Veritaffles.
Noir
This lounge in the Charles Hotel offers a seasonal cocktail menu with attitude. Scenes from “Mad Men” come to life in the bar’s sultry atmosphere, making it the perfect place for a retro night out.
Om''s Beer Garden
Although Charlie’s is more popular among most undergrads, Om’s beer garden is secluded and tranquil, even offering hookah. The prices are a little steep, but the exotic cocktails are worth the occasional splurge.
The Cellar
As its name suggests, this bar is located in the underbelly of a restaurant. Stylized stone and brick walls complete the cozy feel. Plus, it’s only a 10 minute walk from campus.
The Thirsty Scholar
Best known for its cameo in “The Social Network,” the Irish pub purports to be “just a stone’s throw from Harvard’s campus.” With a laid-back atmosphere and a large selection of beer and food, it’s worth the trek to Somerville.

Upon the recent celebration of my twenty-second birthday, I received at the dinner table what could only be described as a challenge, fuelled, no doubt, by an all-too-thinly-veiled sense of disappointment: “You know, your father and I were married by the time we were 22 ....”
My mother really is a wonderfully wise woman. She taught me that gin kills comparatively more brain cells than other clear liquors (doubtful) and that, when in need, your crotch can always serve as a god-given cupholder while driving (so simple!). Rooted as it was in the straightforward pragmatism of previous generations, however, her bluntly dissatisfied appraisal of my relationship status—and the trajectory of my personal growth more generally—seemed more than a little unfair.
Many of my generation, as I was forced to suggest, are not as bound to the imperatives of practicality as she and my father were. We ramble and we digress; we lose our way and waste our time.
Enter OkCupid, a site which promises users the potential for true love by collecting answers to such salient queries as the following hypothetical: “If a trusted partner asked you to submit to them sexually, would you? Assume that this would involve letting them collar you, command you, and have control over you during sex.”
When a friend first pitched the idea of my creating an OkCupid profile, the prospect of having to answer questions like these was never mentioned. In fact, she offered little description of the work that crafting an appropriately enticing online persona actually entails. (Her pitch, by the way, went something like this: ‘I mean, lots of the messages I get have spelling errors, and the one guy I went out with was an asshole ... you don’t want me to be the only person we know with one of these, DO YOU?!?’ Needless to say, three to four daiquiris and a hookah bar later, I was sold.)
Its inanities aside, with its addictively mindless interface and respectable Ivy League pedigree (Facebook’s brave first users were lonely desperate Harvard students too, right?!?), OkCupid seemed like a felicitous distraction during a final semester as an undergraduate; what’s more, by pushing the limits of my comfort with its incisive and reflective lines of questioning, OkCupid held the potential to lead me to previously unfamiliar, if perhaps extraneous, levels of self-exploration.
Disappointingly, however, I must admit that I’m frankly not getting much of anywhere with this thing (I can hear my mother’s smug grunt in my head). Despite the often-made prediction that the internet and its attendant social networking capacities will only serve to shrink the planet and open individual horizons, I feel remarkably affirmed in many of my familiar prejudices and anxieties.
For example: do you really expect a response to a message that consists of fewer than five syllables? Call me any number of nasty names, but a sophisticated grasp of the treacherous terrain of English punctuation is a definite prerequisite to potential interest, conversational or otherwise.
Even the act of creating an account was a source of intense internal debate, as I obsessively weighed which username might best display an adequate balance of wit and flirt only to collapse in failure five hours later after choosing to use my cat’s name as a pseudonym. And in perhaps an ultimate moment of irony, my tactical considerations backfired when the icon that accompanies my profile changed from red—“Replies very selectively”—to a depressing blue—“This user hasn’t been contacted in at least a week”—as a result of my ongoing (and apparently successful) attempts to maintain an aura of discerning selectivity.
Thus, a fleeting venture into the world of online dating becomes an occasion for reflection: am I really interested in testing comfort zones and making myself vulnerable? As the French are apt to note, “plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose” (‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’):  does the arrival another school year necessarily imply an interval of personal growth, or have I simply walked a circuitous route to the place where I began? If I am to trust my instincts, I must have faith that long-term progress is only achieved by the summation of many smaller steps.
To end, then, on a note of hope: I worked up the guts to respond last night to a message I received from a recent Boston-area graduate working in advertising. It isn’t quite marriage, but I think Mom would be pleased.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Allston Task Force argued in a letter to the Boston Redevelopment Authority that the Tata Hall project represents an opportunity for the University to develop the community.
Tata Hall is a proposed additional wing in the Harvard Business School that will house classrooms and living accommodations for professionals in the executive education program.
A formal presentation of the letter will be reviewed next Thursday by the BRA Board, BRA spokesperson Susan Elsbree said.
“Next week is when we will make a decision and a recommendation to our board whether or not we are going to move forward on the Tata Hall project,”  she said.
The recommendations—the product of a month-long discussion that continues to be open to public suggestions—stated that the construction could contribute green space and increase safe access to the Charles River.
“We believe it is imperative that there be no net loss of greenspace and that one acre of new, public greenspace should be created to mitigate the loss of greenspace created by the Tata Hall project,” the letter stated.
The Task Force wrote that the construction of Tata Hall would give Harvard the opportunity to reinvigorate Allston by improving the accessibility of the Charles River to the community.
“Right outside the Tata Hall pedestrian walkway there are no ramps, so people who are handicapped or pushing a stroller cannot use the thing,” said Allston resident Harry E. Mattison. “Wouldn’t it make a whole lot of sense to combine the construction of Tata Hall with the reconstruction of these overpass ramps?”
In June, concerns were raised over whether or not Harvard should be starting new development projects when construction on the Allston Science Complex—a would-be mecca for stem cell research—was halted indefinitely in 2009 due to financial constraints.
But if the $100 million project—funded in part by $50 million from Tata Trusts and Companies, a philanthropic wing of the Indian conglomerate Tata Group—is approved, Elsbree said it will also be an investment in neighborhood jobs.
“There are community concerns we need to consider,” she said.
Other suggestions for community development included preferential hiring of local residents for construction jobs; the use of third-party developers to build the project; and a confirmation from Harvard that the Education Portal—which provides University-run educational programs for the Allston community—will continue to operate beyond 2018, when the University’s obligation under the Science Complex Cooperation Agreement ends.
“We believe all stakeholders deserve a clear understanding of how and when future planning, development, and land acquisition by Harvard might occur,” the letter stated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Brooke R. Lee ’13 flew back home to Provo, Utah, for 31 days during winter break in her freshman year, she said she went on a total of 47 dates. Lee said her goal was not necessarily to meet a guy, but just to have fun in a low-pressure setting and forget about the stressful time she had during her freshman fall.
“I felt squished like a little bug at Harvard,” Lee said, adding that she was not aware of the numerous support groups on campus.
In order to promote the various well-being-focused resources on campus this year—especially to the new freshmen—students and staff from different organizations hosted the first ever Happiness Awareness Day, which took place yesterday in front of the Science Center.
Upbeat music blasted from a boom box, several booths were set up with giveaways, and students made silly putty, enjoyed free massages, and flung balled-up T-shirts from a giant slingshot aimed at a frowning face during the event.
Leslie R. Rith-Najarian ’12, one of the main coordinators of Happiness Awareness Day, said that a typical conversational starter among Harvard students is a bit different from the norm.
“Instead of starting a conversation about the weather, we talk about the hours of sleep we got, upcoming exams, and how stressed we are,” Rith-Najarian said. “But the go-to topic should be about what people did to be happy and things they are excited about.”
Though people often believe exam period to be the most stressful time of the year, Rith-Najarian said she believes shopping week is equally as hectic. She hopes to organize a Happiness Awareness Day every semester, she added.
The rain may have discouraged some people from stopping by, but Lee, who heard about the event from her House email list, said she decided to take a few minutes out of her busy schedule to check out the event.
Lee, who grew up in a town nicknamed “Happy Valley,” said the combination of culture shock, the weather, and schoolwork was very stressful. While she has a large family and supportive church community at home, Lee said she often felt alone at Harvard.
“Harvard itself is depressing and sad,” she said. “I am especially intimidated by the professors, and the questions I ask make me feel dumb.”
As she begins her junior year, Lee said she is much happier now. After talking with her friends and tutors, Lee said she even decided to change her concentration from the sciences to the humanities a couple days ago.
“One thing I do to make myself happier,” Lee said, “is to put on more bright-colored clothes.”
The organizations that participated in the Happiness Awareness Day included Art of Living, the Bureau of Study Counsel, the Center for Wellness, the College Events Board, the Happiness Project, StressBusters, and Student Mental Health Liaisons.
The Bureau of Study Counsel, a resource center for students’ academic and personal development, provides many different services, including counseling, peer tutoring, and workshops.
“It’s easier to live when you are feeling happy,” said Catherine M. Lehar, staff assistant at the Bureau of Study Counsel.
Another group, Student Mental Health Liaisons, collaborates with the wellness proctors and tutors to promote a supportive student community at Harvard and direct students to mental health resources available on campus.
“Mental health doesn’t have to be a scary label,” said Anne G. Douglas ’12, one of Adams House representatives. “There are so many resources at Harvard that it would be a shame if people didn’t take advantage of it.”
Vidur Chopra, a volunteer for Art of Living and a student at the Education School, said the group provides guided meditation and yoga classes for free.
“It’s important to leave behind the chaos of school and find your inner sanctum,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of education experts and terrorism scholars cautioned Wednesday against teaching the events of Sept. 11, 2001 simply as an attack against America, suggesting that teaching the history of 9/11 offers a powerful opportunity to encourage empathy in students.
At the event—the Graduate School of Education's first Askwith Forum of the semester—the panelists addressed the implications of teaching about the attacks to youth.
Christopher Ougheltree, a social studies teacher from Cranston High School East in Rhode Island who won a teaching award from the Tribute World Trade Center Visitor Center in 2010, said he was surprised by the fact that 9/11 was not taught more widely across the nation.
While attending a seminar with the World Trade Center memorial, he said, “I was amazed that many of my colleagues don’t touch upon it.”
Though Ougheltree was the only panel member to work directly with youth, Rutgers University professor Thea Abu El-Haj invoked her personal experience as a parent during 9/11.
Ten years ago, Abu El-Haj said her young daughter came home from school and told her, “A little girl said, ‘My daddy told me [9/11 happened] because Arabs want to kill Jews.’”
In the aftermath of 9/11, Abu El-Haj said she believes that educating children on the subject requires pushing aside the powerful emotions that still linger and focusing on the facts.
“One of the struggles,” she said, “is thinking about how to teach not just 9/11 but the context before and what has followed in ways that aren’t simply nationalist and patriotic.”
Abu El-Haj added that teaching about the tragedy allows young people to dispel myths and learn to be empathetic—a necessary trait in gaining a full perspective on the consequences of United States foreign policy.
“There’s a global illiteracy in this country about the US’s role in the global stage,” she said.
The panelalso addressed the difficulties of teaching about the attacks to young children—especially to those who have little to no memory of the actual event.
Diane L. Moore, a lecturer at the Divinity School, said these concerns should not be cause for educators to censor discussions about 9/11 in the classroom.
“Often times we hear others outside of education saying, ‘This is too complicated,’” she said, “but in my experience, it’s not only very appropriate, but [children] are also already dealing and engaged with controversy.”
Six of Ougheltree’s former students were in attendance at the event. Carley Rotenberg, currently a high school sophomore, took Ougheltree’s freshman World History course in which he taught about the history and consequences of 9/11 through various forms of media, such as raw videos of World Trade Center employees jumping out of their offices.
“He was probably one of the first teachers that taught it and didn’t sugarcoat,” she said. For Rotenberg, who was in kindergarten when the attacks were carried out, this style of teaching was important for her to fully understand the issues surrounding 9/11.
“Now that we’re growing up, it’s good to know what’s really going on,” she said. “It was pretty shocking to hear, coming from a [previously] wholesome learning environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last May, as the Middle East played host to a surge of pro-democracy protests and civil unrest, the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations announced the creation of a new undergraduate Modern Middle East Studies secondary field, an initiative that had been in the works for many years.
Ali S. Asani, NELC department chair, said the new secondary concentration is a stepping stone towards creating a new concentration in the field and represents a commitment to the undergraduate study of the region.
“It’s the dawn of a new era in modern Middle East studies here,” said lecturer Susan M. Kahn, who will teach the secondary field’s required introductory course Near Eastern Civilizations 100: “Approaches to Middle Eastern Studies”.
The gateway course, which invites professors from across Harvard’s schools and a variety of disciplines to teach a recent scholarly book of their choice, was shopped by 23 Harvard undergraduates for the first time last Wednesday.
While the course was offered to graduate students in the past as a requirement for masters candidates in regional studies, this is the first time it is open to undergraduate enrollment.
This year, the areas of expertise of the professors on the syllabus span from religion to politics to culture, but all of the books relate to Egypt, which Kahn described as a “linchpin” of the Middle East.
“That it is all about Egypt cuts back on the scattered nature of having different professors come in every week,” said John J. Corbett ’13, a NELC concentrator who plans to take the class this semester.
Kahn said she was pleasantly surprised by the interest in the class.
“I was expecting six [students],” she said, acknowledging that the high turnout could be partially attributed to the events of the Arab Spring.
In fact, shopping week attendance in many Middle East-related courses this semester has been unusually high, she said.
The recent turbulence in the Middle East and the subsequent spike in student interest highlight the importance of a strong modern Middle East curriculum. The recent developments in the NELC department “could not have been more timely,” Kahn said.
Both Asani and Kahn believe there is strong demand for the secondary concentration—Asani expects about ten people to pursue the secondary this year, and even more in the following year, when the “full impact” of the new secondary is felt.
The retooled course and the new secondary concentration represent the department’s move towards centralizing the opportunities available for undergraduates to study the modern Middle East.
While NELC has a long history at Harvard, its focus has generally been on the pre-modern, Asani said, with fewer options for students looking to study the region’s modern-day politics and society.
“I know a lot of people who would be more likely to do NELC if they had less of a historical approach and more modern Middle East courses,” said government concentrator Benat A. Idoyaga ’12.
He added that “decentralized”  nature of the course offerings forced students to search across departments—including History, Anthropology, and Government—in order to find modern Middle East courses of interest.
“The main problem was not the offerings, but that there was no point of reference,” Idoyaga said.
While Harvard is similar to some peer institutions—such as Princeton and Columbia—in lacking a separate modern Middle East concentration, other schools, like Yale, already allow students to major in the study of the modern Middle East.

Students and professors alike are finding ways to grapple with the growing prices of textbooks—a semesterly complaint among both parties.
Although many professors lament the cost of the textbooks for their classes, they say there is little they can do to reduce prices for students.
The cost of the custom textbook for Life Sciences 2: “Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy” has gone up in an “appalling” manner to over $200, according to Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology Daniel E. Lieberman, who teaches the course.
New editions of textbooks come out frequently, forcing students to spend money on the new editions, rather than  buying used versions of the old editions.
“What is really cruel is that the textbook company changes it every year a little bit,” Lieberman said, “So we have to buy new copies.”
In order to keep up with recent decisions made by the Supreme Court and the literature analyzing these rulings, the textbook for Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” comes out with a new edition about every five years. The latest edition is more expensive than the previous and cannot be found used because it was published only three months ago.
“It is awful, and I regret that it is so expensive,” said Harvard Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon, “but it is out of my control how much it costs.”
To help decrease the cost of textbooks, many students have turned to online retailers, such as Amazon, which they say tend to be less expensive and offer a greater selection amongst book formats and vendors.
“I feel like you can get more options online,” Amanda E. McGowan ’13 said. “The Coop is just so expensive.”
The textbook for Fallon’s class costs $270.85 at the Coop, but can be purchased for only $195 on amazon.com.
Another way for students to avoid the high costs of textbooks is to read the copies that the professors put on reserve in libraries.
Though Maya I. Anderson ’13 buys most of her textbooks online, she does not buy the coursepacks from the Coop, choosing instead to read them on reserve. During finals, there is a great demand for the course material on reserve, she said, but most of the time, it is easy for her to borrow the readings.
Not all undergraduates have as much luck accessing class materials on reserve in the library, especially for larger classes.
Fallon­—who put two copies of his textbook on reserve at Lamont—said that an undergraduate had complained that it was difficult to get the book from Lamont becuase so many students were using it to avoid paying for the book.
To alleviate this problem, Fallon said he plans to put more copies of the textbook on reserve.
Following the actions of some online retailers, the Coop is also attempting to lower the prices of textbooks by allowing students to rent the books for the semester.
“For the students, they have the opportunity to save a little more than 50% over the cost of a new textbook,” said Allan Powell, the manager of the Harvard Square Coop.
Powell has also noticed that some professors are requiring fewer textbooks for their courses or are not insisting on the newest edition of the textbook.
Assistant Professor Mariano Siskind takes a different approach to cutting book costs. For his class, Latin American Studies 70: “Modernity, Culture, and Politics in Latin America,” he uses no textbooks and a single coursepack.
Keeping in mind the financial constraints of students, he said he tries take advantage of Harvard’s other resources , as well as the website, to complement the coursepack.
“I wasa student in this country as a foreigner with little means,” Siskind said.
“So I take into consideration the cost of coursepacks.”

Harvard Divinity School Dean William A. Graham will step down from his position at the helm of HDS after a decade in the position, the University announced last week. Graham, who is also a professor of divinity and of Middle Eastern studies, said that he will take a year off from his duties at the University before returning to his role in the classroom.
“Bill Graham has been a dedicated leader of the Divinity School, helping to build on its important legacy within Harvard while also guiding the significant expansion of its work across religious and cultural divides,” said University President Drew G. Faust in a statement. “I am deeply grateful for his long and varied service to the University—as a scholar, teacher, and dean—and I am pleased that he will remain an active faculty member in the years ahead.”
Graham cited many reasons for his decision to step down after a decade-long tenure—a length of time he said he believes is appropriate for such a position.
“I feel that we have accomplished much of what I set out to see accomplished when I came over to HDS from the College,” Graham told The Crimson in an email. “I think that the school will need a dean who can take it through the coming University capital campaign beginning in two or three years from now and surely continuing for some years thereafter.”
Graham said that he is looking forward to focusing more on his academic commitments without the burden of administrative work. His year off will allow him to “make up for a decade of reduced reading” and potentially revive his writings, he said.
HDS has seen a number of changes during Graham’s tenure, including the expansion of its  faculty and course offerings. The past decade has seen the appointment of more than half of the current faculty of HDS and an increase in resources for the study of Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish religions, among others, according to a University press release.
The school’s commitment to financial aid has increased by more than 100 percent over the past decade, according to the release. More than 90 percent of their students now receive financial aid.
“I think that the strength of religious studies at Harvard, primarily in both HDS and FAS, is at an all-time high,” said Graham. “HDS will continue to be a major focal element of this strength.”
Graham added that he is hopeful that HDS will increase its collaboration with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
A search committee comprised of members of the faculty will be convened by Faust this fall to identify candidates to fill the position.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under Sunday’s clear, night sky, the lights shone brightly on Soldiers Field as the Harvard and Northeastern squads set up for a corner kick. The clock dwindled down, only seven minutes remaining in the scoreless match. With the eyes of over 2,500 fans on the pitch, the kick was taken. Bodies jostled, trying to make contact with the ball. One found success, dropping it back to the feet of Brian Rogers.
Shot.
Goal.
And the crowd was on its feet, cheering as the players piled onto each other in celebration. One student ran in front of the bleachers, waving a Harvard banner behind him to a roar of approval. The notes of “Olé” rang across the stadium, lingering on after the subsequent kick-off.
It’s moments like these when I realize the magic of college sports, the power of a game to unify a student body. Although there were eleven men on the field representing Harvard that night, the Crimson had a twelfth man in spirit: its fans.
We stood together, by the field and as a school, and shared in the squad’s 1-0 victory.
It’s hard to deny the home-field advantage of a stadium pulsing with supportive energy. The chants of “Let’s Go Harvard” as the midfielder takes it up the line, the collective sigh as the ball just misses wide, and the yells when the ref calls a questionable foul all combine to create an environment with the power to lift a team up and to give it an extra competitive edge.
Yet what does it take to draw the students from their dorm rooms across the river in these high numbers?
Is it the attraction of a night game? Marketing campaigns offering prizes for attendance? The excitement of a big match against a rival? A little bit of everything?
After all, night games are proven to be popular with the student body, with the first football match under the lights consistently being one of the most well attended contests of each season.
I cherish memories of watching my first college football game in 2009, seeing Harvard defeat Brown, 24-21, in front of over 17,000 fans under the stadium lights.
With a sea of crimson in the stands and an endless stream of cheers, it was my first real exposure to school spirit and what it meant to be part of the Harvard student body.
It’s something I always look forward to, a welcome back to the Crimson community and a way for us to unite at the beginning of the school year.
And students are typically eager to come to the big matches on campus, from The Game every year to the basketball team’s showdown against Princeton at home last winter, in which it clinched a share of the Ivy Title for the first time in the program’s history.
Yet when Harvard hosted its first Fall Fiesta last September, offering students various prizes for attending the soccer squad’s home opener against Stanford under the lights, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Although all the pieces were there and I myself had always been an avid soccer fan, I knew that it wasn’t a sport that typically drew huge crowds in America.
But I wasn’t disappointed. Over 3,000 fans attended, chants and cheers were plentiful, and Harvard rode its momentum to secure a goal late in the match for an exciting 2-1 win over Stanford.
Exactly one year later, at its second Fall Fiesta, echoes of that night were heard, with Crimson fans replicating their energy and the soccer squad delivering similar results. Harvard rode the support of the crowd and relentlessly challenged Northeastern’s defense to secure a game-winner late in the second half, a testament to the team’s character and to the power of the twelfth man.
As the Harvard Athletic Department kicks off this year’s Student Rewards Program, offering students Crimson Cash and a chance to be entered into a raffle for a grand prize at every featured athletic event they attend, here’s to hoping that higher attendance will be seen at matches for many different sports.
Let’s maintain big numbers for big contests, but let’s not stop there.
Trek across the river for that night game with your blockmates (even if there is no free t-shirt). Spend a Saturday afternoon watching your friends and classmates, and bring your other friends with you.
Let’s try to get a crowd at every game, show our school spirit, and raise the stakes.
Let’s all be on that field, together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 300 rookies reported to NFL training camps with the hopes of making a team this summer, including former Crimson captain, Collin Zych ’11. With the possibility of a future with the Dallas Cowboys, Zych had more on his plate than just the uncertainty of the NFL lockout and the grueling workouts during a stretch of 40 straight days of triple-digit heat this summer.
He was also working at Cogent Partners as a private equity markets analyst on the side.
“I haven’t really had much free time this summer,” Zych said. “During the lockout I was working during the day and staying in shape whenever I could. Then once training camp started, my days were packed full. It was tough, but it’s what I wanted to be doing.”
The discipline that is necessary to work two jobs is nothing new for Zych, an Academic All-Ivy Leaguer his senior season.
“It’s hard for people to understand how good he is, because it isn’t just that he can run and jump and hit people hard—he has a gift that not many people have,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “Everything happens for him in slow motion.”
While quarterbacks are often credited with leading direction on the field, Murphy attributed this to Zych in addition to a keen awareness of the play around him.
The Dallas Cowboys’ defensive playbook contains calls as complex and varied as any class syllabus. In order to be considered for the team, Zych had to learn all of them.
“I went to training camp with the backpack that I had used while at Harvard and I ended up having to buy a duffle bag just to fit all the playbooks,” Zych said. “It was definitely an interesting experience. The learning curve is steep.”
Zych, a Dallas area native and two-time first-team All-Ivy accolade winner, will be the first to tell you that he played both with and against many talented players while in the Ivy League. But nothing the Ancient Eight has to offer can compare to the level of competition that exists in the NFL.
“Some of the guys here are amazing, but I think my time at Harvard prepared me in some ways for what to expect,” Zych said. “Juggling multiple things at the same time was something I definitely got used to as a student-athlete at Harvard. During training camp, I’d come back to my room and be studying the playbook all night in the bathroom while my roommate was passed out on the bed.”
Though Zych is hardly the first Harvard graduate to try out for the NFL, it is his path to the Cowboy’s tryouts that sets him apart. Unlike most recruited athletes who have enjoyed his type of success, Zych had to reach out to Crimson recruiters his senior year of high school, not the other way around. He did not appear in a single game during his freshman year—not even for the JV squad.
Similarly, at 5’11” 195 pounds, he is at a physical disadvantage. The next Cowboy on the depth chart at safety is 6’1” 222 pounder Danny McCray out of Louisiana State University.
“He may be a little undersized, but he’s athletic enough to play corner, he’s a tremendous tackler, and he’s extremely savvy,” Murphy said. “He is always, always, always in the right place at the right time.”
Hopefully for Zych, his run of success in football hasn’t ended yet. With the NFL season officially starting on Thursday night, it is still unclear whether Zych will be signed onto the Cowboys practice squad or be left to pursue his dream elsewhere.
“A lot of my future depends on the right opportunity arising,” Zych said. “Being one of the final cuts, I’m confident that the coaches liked what they saw with me, and hopefully if something comes up, they’ll come calling.”
Regardless of how things go with the Cowboys, if there’s anything the past four years have taught us, it’s that, true to form, Collin Zych is preparing himself to be in the right place at the right time.

After two laps on an Olympic-level cycling course, four riders separated themselves from the pack in the women’s road race event of the USA Cycling 2011 Collegiate Road Nationals last May in Madison, Wis.
And as the 72.2-mile race drew to a close, it was Harvard’s Anna McLoon ’04 (GSAS ’11) who pulled away with a gutsy win in 2:58:44, becoming the first cyclist in Crimson history to place first in this event.
“[The road race at Nationals] was really a race I’d been focusing on throughout the year of training,” McLoon said. “It gave me a great opportunity to bring back a national championship for Harvard.”
Of the 67 female cyclists that lined up for the non-interval start of the road race, three were Harvard athletes—McLoon, Eun Young Choi, and poobah Sophy Lee ’12. The course—which Lee describes as “very challenging”—features a gain of 8084 feet.
“The course had a pretty big hill, which was a major determiner in race,” McLoon said. “After the second time around course, a group of four of us [that were] contending for the win worked to get a several minute lead.”
McLoon’s eventual victory did not come as a huge surprise to many of her teammates, as the Harvard cyclist placed second in the 2009 national road race and was seeded to come out on top in 2010. But she missed her shot when she opted not to compete at Nationals when it conflicted with a semi-pro race.
“Bike racing is not just about how strong you are but about how smart you are in conserving your own energy,” McLoon said. “On the way up the hill during the final lap of the race, I broke away from...the other competitors to cross the finish line first.
“The three other women I was competing with [during the last lap] were friends of mine I’d rode with in the past,” she continued. “This time we were all representing our [respective] schools.”
Because cycling is a club sport, the rules allow graduate students to compete for their university on a national level, an opportunity not available on varsity teams.
“Anybody earning a degree at a degree-granting institution can race,” Lee said. “Grad students, undergraduates, PhD candidates...It just explodes the number of people that can compete together.”
McLoon—who also placed second in the overall omnium event at nationals last spring—was a multi-sport athlete as a Harvard undergraduate, earning a place at the NCAA Championships in Nordic skiing for four straight years and two years in crew.
“Both [skiing and crew] contributed to my aerobic fitness and strength in muscle groups used in cycling,” McLoon said. “Obviously fitness level is important, but what it really comes down to in cycling—and in sports—is the mental aspect, your determination and commitment.”
According to Lee, McLoon acted as a mentor for many other Harvard cyclists, helping novice riders learn the ropes on a team without a coach.
“She had a massive impact on the team, just by setting an example,” Lee said. “She’s a very high level cyclist. A lot of times, she had to train by herself because we can’t keep up with her, but Anna’s been a good influence.”
After a year of weekly meetings with McLoon, Lee—who started cycling as a college sophomore—qualified for nationals as a junior.
“Without her, I wouldn’t have improved as much as I did,” Lee said. “I was really inspired by her.”
McLoon wasn’t the only rider who fared well in Wisconsin this past year. Stuart McManus, another graduate student, placed third in the men’s division one road race.
“Stuart has been racing for at least 12 years,” Lee said. “He has a better sense of how tactically to win a race than almost anyone else in the United States. He’s an excellent climber, which helps a lot on a very mountainous course.
“Looking at the top 10 riders or so of both the men’s and women’s national championship races, these people could easily be pros,” she continued. “[It’s really amazing] if you take into consideration that they’re all full-time students.”

You get French fries. Local businesses draw in customers. Charities make money.
It's easy to imagine how one or even two of these events can coincide. But to make all three happen at once, it takes a project like the new charitable website founded by Annemarie "Annie" E. Ryu '13 and Leverett House affiliate Raviv Murciano-Goroff '09.
The pair recently started a site called GeneroCity Boston, which lets citizens donate to featured causes and receive vouchers for deals at local businesses in exchange.
Ryu said the project was inspired by her travels throughout developing countries. "I realized I can just donate 5 dollars and I can really make a difference and help people," Ryu said.
The sum can doesn't even have to be that high. Right now, if you donate $2 through GeneroCity Boston to Project Bread—an organization which combats hunger in Massachusetts—you will get a coupon for free fries or sweet potato fries from b.good.
"We worked up something that brings together community members and businesses and local charities, working in all their interests,"  Ryu said.
She and Murciano-Goroff aren't pocketing any of the proceeds; all the money collected goes straight to the featured charity.
What companies offering socially-conscious goodies will appear on the site next? "We'd like to keep that a surprise,"  Ryu said.

Several rooms in Cabot House's D entryway were evacuated around midnight tonight after a sprinkler flooded room D-41.
According to messages sent to email lists, the water headed downward to rooms D-31, D-21, and D-11, causing more than 10 students to evacuate to friends' rooms for the night. It is unclear what caused the sprinkler to burst.
A resident of D-41 reported that "gallons upon gallons of brown water flooded over the top of the pipes closet" in an email to the Cabot open list.
House personnel responded to the incident immediately by placing fans to dry out the affected rooms.

With a 6.2% acceptance rate, Harvard is one of the most selective schools in the world. Those are good odds, however, when compared to the 2.4% percent acceptance rate of the Trinity School in New York City. But students applying to this school aren't trying to get into an elite university—they're just trying to get into kindergarten.
 
The New York Times reports that after accounting for the number of sibling and legacy students admitted to Trinity's kindergarten class, those with no connection to the school make up 2.4% of those admitted. This statistic has led the school and others like it to question their admissions practices.
 
Although Trinity has become more selective over the years, qualified legacies still have a huge leg up. Despite creating a close community at the school, this phenomenon has made it difficult for the school to survive the tough economy. "You get more money from five families than two families with five children," said a head of the school.
 
Questions of admissions and diversity aside, one must wonder what makes this kindergarten so elite. Is 'How to Use Scissors' taught by a Nobel Prize winning paper-cutter? Does The Count himself teach numbers? Is Bill Nye the Science Guy chair of the science department?
