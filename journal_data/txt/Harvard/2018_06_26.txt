After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years after her debut novel, “Red Queen,” Victoria Aveyard has returned with “War Storm,” the fourth and final installment of her series. After hundreds of pages of political meetings and battles throughout the series, an agreement is finally reached between the ruling Silvers and the oppressed Reds. Although sequels often lose focus with each iteration, “War Storm” manages to pack just as powerful a punch as “Red Queen,” with its many powerful female characters and quickly paced narration. Aveyard has provided a satisfying ending for her thought-provoking series.
Aveyard has cleverly constructed a dystopian world that is similar enough to our own to make it particularly poignant. The Silvers, who have silver blood and special physical and mental powers, rule over the Reds, who bleed red and lack the abilities of the Silvers. That is, until it is uncovered that some Reds are genetically gifted with Silver-like powers, but stronger. This discovery fuels the Scarlet Guard, a vigilante group of Reds who hope to liberate the Reds who spend their lives working in sub-optimal conditions for little pay or face conscription to fight a war only the Silvers care about. This genetics-based discrimination vividly depicts the full potential of such hatred against a group.
There has never been a lack of strong women in the “Red Queen” series, but until “War Storm” the point of view came primarily from Mare Barrow, the protagonist who stands as the face of the Scarlet Guard. “War Storm” brings more points of view with Evangeline, a Silver (used as a pawn by her father) who would rather be with her mistress than the king she is betrothed to, and Iris, a princess of a different kingdom who is determined to use her new marriage to her advantage. There is also a stronger focus on Farley, a general in the Scarlet Guard who controls a rebellion as a single mother, and Anna, the grandmother of a king who tirelessly works behind the scenes.
Although on different political sides, these women are not afraid to admire the powers of others like when Evangeline compliments Mare’s talents for “upsetting Calore men” to further her agenda, or when Farley tells Mare, “I’m damn proud of you,” for her hard work. These women often fight against one another for their varying beliefs, but aren’t there to senselessly tear each other down. They respect power, even in those they wish to defeat. It is satisfying to read a dystopian novel that features so many well-rounded female characters, each with their own hopes, dreams, and weaknesses.
Unfortunately, the prose itself leaves something to be desired. Some sentences and paragraphs feel disjointed and out of place, “making everything that has occurred since that day be for nothing.” There is a good deal of repetition, particularly of Mare’s heartbreak, Maven’s loss of humanity, and Cal’s choice to be king. At a certain point, the emotional impact of these plot points is stripped, leaving these sentences lacking emotive meaning.
Aveyard’s prose could be more sophisticated, but if a reader has made it to the fourth installment, her repetition and disjointed sentences can be overlooked in order to reach a satisfying ending. Over time, Aveyard has added more powerful female voices to her story, and each enrich the narrative. Along with an ending that wraps the entire series up in a neat bow, Aveyard has succeeded in writing a YA dystopian series that is worth reading.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I watched summer die and autumn turn cold and gray through a broken slat in the blinds.” Henceforth begins the year-long “hibernation” of Ottessa Moshfegh’s unnamed narrator in her newest novel, “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” This Ivy League graduate uses the inheritance left by her father, who died of cancer, and mother, who soon after committed suicide, to pay for a nice apartment. Through an eccentric therapist, she acquires a slew of pills to help her sleep, and besides visits from her college roommate Reva, the narrator is left alone to her thoughts, her sleep, and her VCR. Moshfegh’s prose is captivating and this novel asks some of life’s big questions. The writing, however, does not make up for the lack of a cohesive plot.
The characters are unlikeable, but they’re supposed to be. The narrator herself is clearly struggling with mental health, yet often her thoughts about others are cruel while her thoughts about herself are kind. She continuously reminds the reader of her beauty: She can’t help if “people were always telling [her she] looked like Amber Valletta” or reminding her how pretty she is. Yet simultaneously, she describes her best (and only) friend as “a slave to vanity and status” and finds “her desperation especially irritating.” Reva suffers from bulimia, but instead of sympathizing with her friend, the narrator is annoyed at Reva’s impulses and even imagines “Reva would gasp if she saw all the food [she] was throwing out, as if eating it all and vomiting it back up wasn’t just as wasteful.” Although Reva has many redeeming qualities—she does, after all, still check in on the narrator despite never receiving any emotional support in return—they are hard to see through the lens of the narrator. The narrator’s therapist, Dr. Tuttle, is quite odd. At the first appointment, “she wore a foam neck brace because of a ‘taxi accident’ and was holding an obese tabby, whom she introduced as ‘my eldest.’” It is a wonder Dr. Tuttle is allowed to practice: She often forgets key facts of the narrator’s life, such as her parents’ deaths, and writes prescriptions for the narrator for over 10 drugs without any proper diagnosis. Although initially the unprofessional and odd behavior is funny, the flippant way Dr. Tuttle practices medicine quickly becomes alarming.
Although the likeability of the characters is not necessary for a good book, it poses a particular problem for a character-driven novel. There are very few events within Moshfegh’s storyline, so character development is essentially the story itself. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to care for most of these characters and this dulls their possible emotional effect and the story’s overall ability to make a lasting impact.
Regardless, Moshfegh has written a book that examines what it means to live a happy life. Are we really living if we don’t remember what we did? When the narrator wakes up three days after taking a pill with no memories and 12 boxes of Chinese food lined up on her kitchen table, the reader can’t help but ask this question. This book questions what it means to live a fulfilling life, what happiness even is, and how we look at those with mental illness.
Despite the novel’s faults, it is still a thought-provoking piece of literature. The prose, just barely, drives along the story even when there is very little story to tell. “My Year of Rest and Relaxation” will leave you frustrated, but it will also make you think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently asked two classmates as we were passing the undergraduate Houses by the Charles River what the architecture of those buildings evoked for them. I wasn’t exactly shocked to hear them utter words like “rich,” “private,” “country club,” and “old money.” Architecture is certainly one of many areas where Harvard could be made to feel more inclusive.
Like much of what can be termed “Imperial Harvard,” the River Houses were designed and conceived in the waning years of the Gilded Age, and embody its exclusivity and excess. (After all, Gore Hall was modeled on Hampton Court, which in turn was a mini-Versailles). It wasn’t long before a new generation of postwar Harvard architects, including Water A. G. Gropius and Josep L. Sert, began to agree with my classmates, and swung the pendulum dramatically away from the neo-Georgian style in an attempt to create a more modern physical environment. The results, however—Peabody Terrace, Mather House, the Carpenter Center, the Science Center—were either brutalist concrete masses that feel like transplants from the outskirts of Kharkov or structures so complicated as to defy functionality. The Carpenter Center managed to be both. More recently, Harvard has moved away from brutalism to deliver unremarkable structures in the style of the suburban office park, buildings like Tata Hall and Esteves Hall.
Where does this leave us? The result of the postwar dialectic is that neither Harvard’s neo-Georgian excess nor the Modernist reaction to it produced good results. This is because both are out of touch with Harvard’s roots in an earlier—and in some ways much more open and inclusive—phase of its architectural history, long before this university became wealthy.
It’s surprisingly little-known, but for roughly its first two centuries, Harvard was essentially what we would today call a public university. It received regular—though voluntary— funding from the Massachusetts legislature and, after independence, was written into the state constitution. Not only was eighteenth-century Harvard public, it was relatively poor and unprestigious. It stood on a tiny lot surrounded by outdoor latrines, pig pens, and cowyards. The University presidents themselves lived in a series of glorified farmhouses, and patrolled the Yard with a lantern nightly to ensure curfew.
Because of its penury, Harvard’s early Georgian architecture was relatively simple and unostentatious (compare, for instance, Holden Chapel to King’s College Chapel, Cambridge). It was also remarkably open. As an expression of its connection to the people of the commonwealth—or perhaps reflecting a lack of money—Harvard chose not to build the typical high walls which cloistered European colleges like those of Oxford and Cambridge. Instead, it built a series of freestanding buildings open to a town common. As a result, Harvard created a radical, new, and more public-facing model for the layout of a university.
Ironically, modern Harvard has turned its once open Georgian core inward and inverted itself. The erection of the nine-foot high spiked and gated fence which surrounds the Yard circa 1900, along with the construction of outer buildings in the 1920s, accomplished this effect. But an 1808 drawing preserves an idea of how accessible Harvard’s original Georgian arrangement once was. Changes to Holden Chapel, built in 1744, provide evidence of this extreme volte-face. The original chapel featured its famous white and blue decorated tympanum on one side only (the front, that is, the side facing Cambridge Common). After the University turned inward and the front of the chapel effectively became the back, a duplicate tympanum (the one most people now see from the Yard) was fabricated and added on in the 1920s.
Of course, despite this open plan, Harvard as a whole in the 1700s was not what we would consider a very inclusive place. Massachusetts, along with every other state in the north, practiced slavery. At least two of Harvard’s presidents bought slaves to work on campus. No female or Jewish students were admitted. Puritanism inspired religious intolerance. But Puritanism also contained elements of radical egalitarianism, like its insistence on literacy for all and personal interpretation of scripture. And the Georgian period saw the Enlightenment gaining steam, smashing Puritan religious orthodoxy, along with many other old doctrines, at Harvard. Under the influence of new ideas, then, this public institution was creating a built environment that was remarkably accessible compared to its fellow universities in Europe.
Perhaps that is why the most frequented part of today’s University is not the palatial environs of the River Houses, but the Georgian Old Yard, where we find a vibrant commons filled with students, locals, and out-of-town visitors, where you are as likely to meet someone from Medford as Kathmandu. University President Drew G. Faust’s decision to place chairs in the Yard as part of the Common Spaces Initiative, as well as the decision to keep the Yard open to the public, continues an earlier tradition of openness and connection to the wider community, despite the fact that that Yard has been fenced and turned inward. In a way, the Yard’s low-slung Georgian architecture now provides a kind of sanctuary or oasis from the towering, cemented world beyond the walls.
As it prepares to undertake major building projects in Allston, Harvard shouldn’t engage in more neo-Georgian excess. Nor should it create more Modernist sameness. It should take a cue from the best parts of a forgotten past and construct open, creative, and humble spaces. Though a bit vertical and imposing, the newly-completed portions of the Kennedy School, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, provide some good cues as to what can be accomplished. Rejecting the Late Modern fanaticism of the school’s bewildering original building and Forum, which can make one feel trapped inside an M.C. Escher print, the additions present linear and airy interior spaces. They feature red brick and wood as tributes to the building materials of Harvard’s original Georgian architecture, and create a welcoming, unfenced courtyard open to the public. They show that Harvard can both honor its heritage and build an inclusive future. To do so, it just can’t forget where it came from.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a hallowed Harvard classroom last fall, I asked Dominican-American performance artist Josefina Baez what she thought about Cardi B. In response, she said that, like any other musician, Cardi B puts on a persona. Yet Baez told us she thought the lines, “And I pay my mama’s bills, I ain’t got no time to chill” from Bodak Yellow, were “tender.”
The things we find tender are often those we can empathize with, those that we understand. Born to a Dominican father and a Trinidadian mother, Cardi B identifies as Afro-Latina. She’s said that “I expect people to understand that just because we’re not African-American, we are still black.” In a country where Latina is often thought of as a racial category at odds with blackness, Cardi B’s expectation is refreshing.
Like Baez, I feel Cardi B’s tenderness in a private piece of my soul. But as the son of immigrants from a country that banned black people from entering the country in the 1930s, Cardi B and I don’t share a link that she and Baez do—their relationship to the legacy of slavery. Instead, Cardi and I share other intimacies, primarily what it means to have parents from Latin America and to fit under the expansive, contradiction-ridden label of “Latinx.”
There is no universal version of what it means to be “Latinx,” but there are more than enough stereotypes the ethnicity conjures. Even with the efforts of shows like Jane The Virgin and One Day At a Time, accurate representations of Latinx life in media are scarce.
Cardi B herself falls into the trap of wielding popular stereotypes that cater to the most uninformed listener. On Migo’s Motorsport, she raps “I’m the Trap Selena, dame mas Gasolina.” “They call me Cardi Bardi,” she raps on “banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale.” In the chorus, she commands,“Beat it up like piñatas.”
Though her fluid use of Spanish and Latinx pop culture references bring an element missing from the U.S. media-scape, they’ve devoid of the tenderness Baez spoke of. “Spicy Mami” is a worn out stereotype for Latina women, and the other references to food and entertainers feel hollow. Music and food are two of the most popular aspects of Latinx culture in the United States, but they don’t always reveal tons about the people who produce them. After all, people continue to hate immigrants while loving their food.
And yet, listening to Cardi B’s discography as a whole does offer an accurate snippet of what it is to be Latino in the United States, with a tenderness that feels like home.
In the intro to the song “Sauce Boyz,” she says that she tells men “Listen I'm a hoe I don't cook I don't clean like / trust me you don't want me to be the mother of your kids. I don't / like mother-in-laws.” Though abortion is illegal or heavily restricted in several Latin American countries, and a moral shame in many more, the chorus of the song starts “I don’t do no sauce niggas (lil bitch) / Pop a pill I abort niggas (lil bitch).” Many Latinx immigrant home environments still pressure women to live domestic and chaste lives, but Cardi B challenges those expectations with the rebellious flare of a second-generation daughter.
And yet, God is no stranger in Cardi B’s life. On a song with the king of “gospel-rap,” Chance the Rapper, Cardi raps that she “had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this / To my surprise, He replied, said, ‘You made for this,’” and later that “that only goes to show that only God knows.” Cardi B centers her work around her faith. An outspoken Catholic, she is like the children of many Latino immigrants who come from countries that account for 40 percent of the world’s Catholics.
It is in these lyrics, and not in the Spanish words or pop culture references, that I share a sense of mutual understanding with Cardi B. Her unabashed embrace of her sexuality reminds me of the way my sisters and cousins navigate the gender roles imposed upon them. The way she speaks about God reminds of me of Sunday afternoon mass, vacation bible school, and the quick recitation of prayers. Her music is the end result of 25 years of life as a Latina, with all the nuances, complications, and fullness of an experience that is too often reduced to stereotypes—the maid, the criminal, the Latin lover.
Cardi B speaks to a common experience, a modern one, one for the children who learn English before they learned Spanish, if they learn Spanish at all. Her work is not just a set of incredibly well-produced songs, itching to be played at a party to energize the room. Cardi B’s discography is faithfully ingrained with a fuller, more accurate picture of what it means to be Latinx today.
So when she raps that she “went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets / Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored” and “I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose,” it sounds like a beacon of hope, a reassurances that things will be okay. At a time when xenophobia rears its ugly head without shame, when Latinx communities are being painted as a cultural detriment they are not, Cardi B brings a tenderness that whispers, “We gon' win / Knock me down nine times but I get up ten.”

SEOUL, South Korea—World Cup summers are always the most wonderful, and the most exciting part to watch is the group stage. When it’s first starting out, the tournament exemplifies what soccer is all about: people from entirely different backgrounds uniting over their love of the sport. It might be an overused cliché, but it’s true. Turn on the TV any day for the past week, and be faced with the most beautiful coincidences: Poland-Senegal. South Korea-Mexico. Nations that share nothing except this sport. And then there are the surprises in the early stage: Croatia beats Argentina! Mexico bests Germany! Victories that give an entire country joy to last for weeks.
But make sure the World Cup catches you outside the United States. When elsewhere the streets would be filled with watch parties and fans in jerseys, stateside you can only find indifference and ignorance—even when the U.S. has been a part of the tournament. The same attitude with which this country faces the rest of the world, with which it has decided to tear apart immigrant families and leave the UN Human Rights Council.
I care about these random soccer matches because sometimes I feel a little bit like one of those Japan-Colombia or Serbia-Costa Rica games. I’m half Spanish and half South Korean—two countries that don’t share much except, perhaps, soccer. One of them has given me some of the most exciting moments in my life during the 2010 World Cup, and the other is filling me with surprises in my first visit ever, just this month. Two countries that I’ll always be happy to cheer for.
