Facebook, in keeping with its trend of releasing products that no one asked for but everyone ends up grudgingly using, has just rolled out its very own dating app. Originally piloted in Colombia in September of last year, it promises to provide dating options based on mutual friends and interests. Don’t worry about matching with friends though — the app won’t do that, but if you really have the hots for someone on your friend list but have never had the courage to shoot your shot, you can add them to a list of “Secret Crushes.” If they do the same, sparks could fly.
The graphic design is actually quite good for a dating app — someone at the company made sure of that, likely to mask the fact that Facebook’s latest idea is, indeed, quite bad. (See this Buzzfeed reaction compilation for a laugh.) The top of the website features a typical sunset picture and two people about to hold hands: symbolically uncertain, given that they met on an app and don’t mutually know if the other person is really a serial killer. Superimposed in sans serif font (thank goodness) are the words, “Love is universal, it's invincible, and it brings us together like nothing else in the world,” which is romantic until you remember that Facebook piloted a “study” to manipulate the emotions of its users in 2014. (They basically tweaked people’s timelines to see if certain types of posts would provoke positive or negative reactions.) Now they’re doing it again, but more transparently!
In fairness, the premise is a good one, since going through mutual friends is perhaps a better way to meet people. And the app’s website is clear and informative, with some details about how the process of signing up and using the app actually works. The very bottom of the page even has a link to safety tips for dating. Ladies, don’t get in his car on the first date; everyone, meet in a place that makes you comfortable. A news release says that instead of swiping à la Tinder, you get added to the pool of people who opted in, and then get to like or comment on pictures directly. Presumably, this method will make things work better.
Perhaps the best thing about this app, which will technically work in the main Facebook app — unlike Messenger, which requires a separate download — is the color scheme and fonts used to sell it to the masses. The eggshell blue, baby pink, and lavender are united by pops of fuschia and teal, creating an interface that, like so many companies, is a nod to ‘70s nostalgia updated for this decade. The large lavender and pink heart, with a slight ombré, near the bottom is eye-catching. The whole concept is techy and minimalist, and it works. It’s a dating app from Facebook, after all, and it bears repeating that the smooth interface and friendly tone of the informational copy is merely a front for acquiring still personal information from its users (and using it in new fun and exploitative ways). Happy swiping!

On September 18, award-winning author Petina Gappah made a stop at the Harvard Book Store during her book tour to discuss her latest novel, “Out of Darkness, Shining Light.” Originally from Zimbabwe, Gappah has written several other widely translated works such as “The Book of Memory” and “Rotten Row.” Her audience was comprised of both those who came to hear her speak and curious book store patrons who first stood in the back, but were then compelled to take a seat for the remainder of the event.
Following a brief introduction by the Harvard Book store staff, which mentioned a nod from Oprah Magazine that praised “Out of Darkness, Shining Light” as a 2019 fall must-read, Gappah noted that she hadn’t realized that Oprah Magazine had reviewed it. “I don’t read reviews when I’m touring a book and talking about it,” Gappah said. She then read the book’s prologue, and a sweeping silence fell across the audience.
When she finished, the crowd erupted in applause. “It’s very strange. I try not to read the things I’ve written after they’re published because then [I] want to edit…so this is actually the first time I’ve read the prologue,” Gappah said, then transitioned into an open Q&A.
The discussion centered on the extensive writing process that went into “Out of Darkness, Shining Light,” a novel that tells the story of the men and women who transported Dr. David Livingston’s body and works across continental Africa to his home in England after he died in the 19th century. “It was actually meant to be my first book. I started writing it in 1998, and I saved it on a floppy disk, but before that I had this Livingston story in the back of my mind,” Gappah said.
“The fact that Livingston wasn’t a very successful missionary or explorer didn’t dissuade me from being interested in [him],” Gappah said. “It made me even more interested in him because there was actually [something] very romantic about somebody who dies failing…but the more I read about Livingston, the more I became interested in his companions because I started to think, ‘My goodness what an extraordinary thing to do to carry a dead body for all those miles.’”
An aspiring writer from the audience asked about Gappah’s writing process. “I am always very excited to talk about process and craft,” Gappah said. “The structure I wanted to follow was inspired by folklore...I had three really strong voices…and then the more I thought about including Livingston as a voice, the more I thought, well, he’s been speaking for so long, for so many years. How about if I silence him so that he appears only in the memories of his companions?”
Gappah’s event attracted both those who were long familiar with her works and those who were intrigued by her latest novel. “Out of Darkness, Shining Light” was the first book by Gappah that Milana N. Mensah ’19, a student at the Harvard Extension School, came across.
“I’ve actually been curious about African writers since I am of African heritage,” Mensah said. “I’ve been trying to discover writers…I grew up with Chinua Achebe, but there are obviously more modern writers coming up.”
Tabitha L. Escalante ’23, on the other hand, was familiar with Gappah’s work, expressing her excitement for the new novel. “I find Gappah’s exploration of the intersection of issues with race, class, and gender to be really intriguing. I appreciate that Gappah exposes us to the perspectives of marginalized voices that we don’t always acknowledge,” she said.
Chibuihe L. Obi, a Scholars At Risk fellow at Harvard, was inspired by Gappah’s work. “I engaged with the idea of writing or telling stories about people that are not represented in the media,” he said. “This book is talking about a part of Africa’s history that we don’t get to hear often.”

Purple is the color of the hanbok that Kasie (Tiffany Chu) wears in “Ms. Purple” as she trudges in the early dawn, dispirited and worn-down, right in the middle of the road. Purple strobe lights flash in the karaoke and nightclub where Kasie works. It is also the color of the dream-like, ethereal backdrop with a palm tree silhouette that flickers on-screen without sound or explanation. Put more figuratively, purple may represent a perpetual state of indecision, the grayness between the clear-cut, primary colors red and blue, or as a bold sign of Kasie’s pride and dignity — her attempt to preserve her self-worth despite the litany of self-degrading methods she employs to keep her dad alive. Whatever interpretation the audience may have as to the significance of the color purple in the film, there is more depth to it than just its vibrant aesthetic palette.
Directed by Justin Chon and co-written by Chon and Chris Dinh, indie drama “Ms. Purple” paints an emotionally powerful portrait of a Korean-American family,and their internalized struggles to define their cultural values. This story reunites two estranged siblings, both with deep inner scars, who burden themselves with the filial duty to care for their comatose father in a corner of their home until his very last moments. “Ms. Purple” proves Chon’s well-rounded filmmaking talent and marks his return to the Sundance Film Festival (after winning a 2017 NEXT Audience Award for “Gook”). Saturated in colorful allure yet steeped in a soulful hollowness, this film is a slow-burning character study that will leave you breathless.
Kasie works as a karaoke hostess (doumi) in the dark nooks of Los Angeles’s Koreatown. She caters to the whims and demands of drunken businessmen, drowns her sorrows with soju and MDMA, while also caring for her unconscious father, Young-Il (James Kang), who is the reason why she works so desperately hard to earn money. When his in-home nurse unexpectedly quits, Kasie reaches out to her estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee), who decides to return home after having severed ties with his father years before. In the last few days of their father’s life, the siblings reunite in an effort to mend their frayed relationship and untangle the repressed family troubles that led to their separation. Carey fights traumatic memories about his mom’s early departure and his resentment towards his unconscious father, while Kasie deals with a number of men — she accepts money from patron Tony (Ronnie Kim) in exchange for sexual favors, receives kind-hearted flirtations from club valet Octavio (Octavio Pizano), and tries to keep her unreliable brother from leaving her and her father again.
One of the central concerns of the film is the conflict between the responsibility one has to one’s family, and personal independence. Kasie must decide whether or not to abandon her impoverished family and accept an offer to move in with the affluent Tony, who gifts her a purple Korean traditional dress (hanbok), and whether or not to move her father into professional hospice care. Her dilemma resembles the difficult choices her parents had previously made: to leave her family behind in pursuit of a life of luxury as her mother did, or to remain standing beside her family like a sturdy palm tree, a pillar to rely on during times of hardship, as her immigrant father once promised. Kasie’s retort to her wayward brother, who escapes for hours into a computer gaming center to avoid dealing with the brutal reality of this choice, haunts the rest of the film.  “Where’d you go?... I'm not going to leave him like you did,” Kasie says. Despite everything, Kasie endeavours to hold the family together. Perhaps the solution to her problems is to let loose with a bottle of soju.
The string-laden soundtrack by Roger Suen and the freewheeling cinematography by Ante Cheng, complemented by moments of pure, reflective silence, suffuse the screenplay with a mournfulness and a kind of bruised romanticism, while leaving plenty of room for moments of delight. From Kasie’s reappraisal of long-forfeited piano dreams, to Carey’s adventures to sunlit rooftops on which he maneuvers Young-Il’s bed as if it were a trolley, and Octavio’s twirling ballet riff to shatter the seriousness of it all — this poignant drama is about rekindling hope and staying true to your roots, wherever you are.

Pop artist Yayoi Kusama was born in 1929, grew up in a family of Japanese merchants, and began hallucinating polka dots when she was 10 years old.
Kusama later wrote that the dots — which became central to her art — acted as “a way to infinity.”
“When we obliterate nature and our bodies with polka dots,” she added, “we become part of the unity of our environment.”
As a young adult, Kusama moved from Japan to New York City, where she contributed to the 1960s art scene until health problems sent her home in 1973. She has resided in a psychiatric hospital in Tokyo ever since. In 2017, she told the Wall Street Journal that there is not a single day when she does not think of suicide.
According to Institute for Contemporary Art, Boston director Jill Medvedow, Kusama’s artwork was overshadowed by her male contemporaries throughout the 20th century. Her room-sized work was too big for museums. Her colleagues got credit for innovations she had come up with.
“Her pioneering art was often first, though she did not receive the recognition, the value, or the credit that went to the men at work at the same period of time,” Medvedow said.
But today, Kusama — a pioneer of pop art and minimalism — has emerged as one of the preeminent artists of her generation. For the first time this month, one of her works is coming permanently to a New England museum — and “LOVE IS CALLING,” which opened at the ICA on Sept. 19, is launching to enormous fanfare. According to Medvedow, the first round of tickets sold out in an hour.
“I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Yayoi Kusama is the most important artist working today,” ICA curator Eva Respini said.
The exhibit at the ICA consists of one of Kusama’s “infinity rooms,” a house-like structure of mirrors built inside a larger gallery. The structure is filled with glowing, color-changing stalagmites jutting out from all sides. The walls and ceiling are lined with glass, replicating the polka-dotted peaks to — as the name asserts — infinity.
In the background, Kusama’s voice reads a poem that she wrote herself in Japanese. The piece’s title translates to “Residing in a Castle of Shed Tears.”
“When you enter the work, you're going to immediately be in the experience — immersed in this infinite field of vividly, psychedelically colored, tentacle-like inflatable sculptures,” Medvedow said.
In a press event introducing the exhibit, both Medvedow and Respini lauded Kusama for her decades of cultural relevance. “LOVE IS CALLING,” the two observed, is a natural fit for the Instagram era: While Kusama has made infinity rooms throughout her career, the rest of the world is only just catching up. The Boston Globe’s first article about the exhibit is titled “Here Come the Selfies.” Large-scale art like Kusama’s is having a long, Internet-driven moment.
According to Respini, however, Kusama’s work represents something deeper than critically panned efforts like the Museum of Ice Cream or the Happy Place. Kusama isn’t discussing hedonism. Instead, her work is about “obliteration.”
“What's interesting to me is that the repeated sharing of photos online echoes the deeper themes of Kusama's work, things ... about repetition, human connectivity, life, love, death,” Respini said. “And these ideas seem to have a hold on our contemporary zeitgeist.”
Medvedow added that the museum’s mission is to ensure that Kusama — who “was important for 50 years before there was Instagram” — is treated with the respect the artist deserves.
Accordingly, Respini said that the infinity room is paired with contemporary works to accentuate Kusama’s themes. And the background poem is printed along the wall, putting the topics Respini mentioned — obliteration, illusion, love — into Kusama’s own words.
“When the time comes around for people to encounter the end of their life / having put on years, death seems to be quietly approaching,” the poem begins. “It was not supposed to be my style to be frightened of that, but I am.”
According to Medvedow, both the poem and the infinite room express “universal themes of life, time passing, loss, and love.”
“It's poignant,” Medvedow said. “And it speaks to her desire to express and convey a universal message of love through her art.”
Kusama’s voice, reading the poem in measured Japanese, plays in a loop whenever there are people in the infinity room. Kusama is now 90 years old. She is still creating art.
“It's truly an amazing feat for an artist to create, from ordinary materials, a work that utterly transports the viewer to somewhere else,” Respini said. “[It takes the viewer] to another world, another reality — perhaps even another consciousness.”

“Women Take the Floor,” a new exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, surveys the past century of American art created by women, featuring contemporary artists alongside icons like Frida Kahlo and Georgia O’Keeffe through the lens of modern-day feminism. The museum has reinstalled the entire third floor of its Art of the Americas Wing in an effort to challenge the dominant — masculine — narrative of art history from 1920 to today.
At first glance, an undertaking of such scope seems far too big and broad to sequester in any one wing of a museum. Over the course of 100 years and some 200 works of art, it at first appears that once again, women artists were to be cloistered off, unified only by their gender. But “Women Take the Floor” is a delightfully different mode of women-only display: It manages to celebrate each artist’s individuality while at the same time forging rewarding connections between them. While the exhibit is certainly broad in scope, it also pays passionate attention to the ties that bind together women of radically different backgrounds, from disparate moments in history. The result is a curatorial feat well worth the visit.
On view through May 2021, the time is ripe for “Women Take the Floor.” 2020 marks both the MFA’s 150th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. This singular temporal junction alone dictates that the exhibit will do both cultural and political work, placing women artists at the center of the museum’s birth year celebration of the arts, as well as tracking their development from the year of suffrage until today.
Drawn primarily from the MFA’s collection, the art featured in the takeover ranges from painting and sculpture to textiles and video. The works are organized into several galleries, each one devoted to a particular medium or theme. “No Man’s Land” catalogues six women artists’ reimaginings of landscapes, highlighting how their works communicated with male-dominated movements such as surrealism. Georgia O’Keeffe’s 1936 painting “Deer’s Skull with Pedernal” combines a skeletal object and a vast landscape with a relish of the uncanny. Just a wall away, Doris Lindo Lewis’s erotic exploration of the female body as landscape in her 1934 “Mamscape” responds to the male surrealists’ penchant for incorporating the sexualized female form in their works.
There are also galleries that spotlight alternative media, like the fiber art collection “Beyond the Loom,” which co-opts a medium traditionally associated with women’s domestic work. Certainly not to be found in the home, these large-scale weavings are sculptural testaments to the pioneering women artists who, in the ’60s and ’70s, redefined textiles as modern art.
A highlight of the exhibit is the stunning “Women Publish Women” gallery devoted to three women whose innovative techniques in lithography and silkscreen lifted American printmaking out of the commercial realm and into the world of fine art. Without the aid of male artworks, the collection tells a unique story of a particular time and medium in American art. Of course, it is well worth noting the contributions that male printmakers made to the field during this time in order to get the full picture. Zeroing in on an oft-overlooked subset of printmakers, however, makes that picture suddenly much more vibrant: Sometimes the full story of an artistic movement can only be described after one remarkable thread of that plot is allowed to stand on its own.
This endeavor to let women-made art be by itself informs the entire takeover, and achieves a kind of apotheosis in the central gallery, “Women Depicting Women.” The space features images of women created by women, liberated from the male gaze. Each portrait is a product of the female gaze, and the varying perspectives interact to provide a rich intersectionality. Wendy Red Star’s 2016 photograph of her and her daughter wearing the traditional elk-tooth dress of the Apsáalooke (Crow) nation defies the sepia-toned representations of Native American women in historical photography. A few feet away hangs another portrait, from almost 100 years earlier: The first painting Frida Kahlo ever sold, “Dos mujeres (Salvadora y Herminia).” It depicts two working-class women with all the staid dignity usually afforded only to elite subjects of portraiture.
Seen together in a single gallery, Wendy Red Star’s and Frida Kahlo’s portraits are shown in new light. The respective artists have separate voices, to be sure, but it ought not be ignored that their confluence is arguably even more interesting. Putting one woman’s work in communication with the other’s does not mean that their individual lights shine any less brightly. Indeed, the academy grants male artists this privilege constantly, comparing their works in order to form a composite view of such nebulous terms as “artistic expression” or the art of depicting the so-called human experience. Terms like these are so saturated with maleness that it’s difficult to place women artists inside this frame which was not originally meant for them. It is dedicated projects like ”Women Take the Floor” that carve out the space for women artists to, at the very least, play, and, at the very best, tell stories of artistic development hitherto unknown. In a room of their own, there just might be space enough for their voices to echo.

“Don’t Call Me Angel” combines the vocal talents of three of the music industry’s top female players: pop princess Ariana Grande, indie darling Lana Del Rey, and musician Miley Cyrus. Even though these singers aren’t from the same genre and have wildly different vocal ranges and styles, the song surprisingly works. This is due in part to the slick production by legendary producers, Max Martin and Ilya, who crafted Britney Spears’s “…Baby One More Time” and Ariana Grande’s “Problems,” respectively. The title single for the rebooted “Charlie’s Angels” movie, “Don’t Call Me Angel” is a fun, if formulaic, bop that excels in its promotion of shallow girl power.
The first two-thirds of the song, sung by Grande and Cyrus, embody pop and grab the listener after Grande’s first utterance of the word “boy.” Where Grande owns the beat, Cyrus’s voice is not as compelling. The chime of bells on top of a booming bass line that brought Grande success in the past on “7 rings” and “The Light is Coming,” delivers once again. Miley, fresh off of a lukewarm attempt at a pop/hip-hop crossover in her recent EP “She is Coming,” is not as successful at embodying the single’s high-energy and almost erratic rhythm. In contrast, the tempo slows down for Lana Del Rey, allowing her to croon in her signature whisper over production that is more in line with her style. Her part is less “Summertime Sadness” and more “Summer Bummer,” and it fits well with the rest of the song.
Where the single disappoints is its uninspired, shallow lyrics. Grande kicks the song off with the chorus, singing “Boy, don’t call me angel / You ain’t got me right / Don’t call me angel / You can’t pay my price.” Although these lyrics are characteristic of Grande’s songs (think “God is a Woman” and “Knew Better/Forever Boy”), they do nothing to evoke the sexy, kick-ass power of Charlie’s Angels.  For “Don’t Call Me Angel,” lyrics such as “You better stop the sweet talk / And keep your pretty mouth shut” and “So don’t you try to come around me / Might work with her, but not me, oh yeah” reframes this power of the female singers — and by proxy of the Angels — on their ability to be unavailable, unattainable, and even unpurchasable by men (or boys, as they are called in this song). This is a tired and disappointing take considering the iconic girl power anthem by Destiny’s Child that heralded “Charlie’s Angels” in 2000.
“Independent Women, Part 1,” casts a large shadow over “Don’t Call Me Angel.” Whereas the lyrics of “Don’t Call Me Angel” are addressed to a faceless, interchangeable male character, the lyrics in “Independent Women, Part 1” are directed towards the female audience. Lyrics such as “All the women, who are independent / Throw your hands up at me / All the honeys, who making money / Throw your hands up at me” celebrate the Charlie’s Angels of the audience: women who are strong, not because they can kick-ass, but because they work hard, make money, and own their own life. One might criticize the materialism in the song, but in a world where cash is king and material goods equate to power, women who want to be independent seem to have to strive for both. The “Don’t Call Me Angel” of today should take note.

‘90s nostalgia is in full swing. From grunge-inspired fashion on runways to the vague sense of apprehension in global affairs, reminders of the decade are hard to miss. Recalling this period marked by conflict and rebellion — against authority, materialism, and the status quo — one fact remains of little dispute: Few, if any, bands embody the era as definitively as California-based rock group Blink-182. The band’s uptempo, guitar-heavy anthems and electric live performances paved the way for many of the pop-punk bands that rose to fame in the 21stt century. Fans of the band’s infectious energy will find more than enough in their latest studio release, “Nine,” albeit tempered with a veneer of maturity and self-reflection. The album provides a largely successful, if a bit formulaic, retrospective of Blink-182’s decades-long musical career while also looking to the future.
The 15-song tracklist, packed with autobiographical references to mental health and the challenges of artistic life, serves as a rough chronological journey through Blink-182’s history.  At first listen, the album’s opening track, “The First Time,” evokes the thrill and uncertainty of a new relationship. “First love, first high, there ain’t nothing like the first time,” co-lead vocalists Mark Hoppus and Mike Skiba sing.  However, the song could also easily represent the beginning of the band members’ lifelong romance with making music — a relationship that, like many, has had its ups and downs.
Expressions of disillusionment and uncertainty figure prominently in “Nine”’s lyrics, sung by Hoppus and Skiba over layers of humming synthesizers, rapid-fire drums and, of course, plenty of electric guitar. Following “The First Time” is “Happy Days,” a deceptively upbeat meditation on “waking up and feeling lost in the world,” according to a statement from Hoppus. Despite the song’s somber themes, its major key and relentlessly propulsive drumbeat ultimately suggest hope prevailing over fear.
Longtime experts at reminiscing about the past, Blink-182 prove themselves to be deeply aware of current events. The 2018 mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, only miles from drummer Travis Barker’s home, compelled him to memorialize the victims in song. The result is “Heaven,” a solemn, resolute condemnation of gun violence and the heightened danger of everyday life in America. The singles “Generational Divide” and “Blame It On My Youth” also highlight changes in society while casting doubt on the extent of humanity’s progress. “We swore we’d be better than the last time,” Skiba and Hoppus shout over rhythmic, percussive guitar chords on “Generational Divide.” before posing a question to listeners: “Are we better, are we better now?”
In many ways, Blink-182’s music is better now: By incorporating modern electronic elements into their songs while preserving their distinctive, punk-grounded sound, “Nine” is sure to appeal to veteran fans and new listeners alike. However, the juxtaposition of new and old is not always seamless. The album’s two songs about romantic relationships, “I Really Wish I Hated You” and “Darkside,” are also arguably its two most egregious examples of gratuitous synth effects. In both songs, already heavily populated by guitar and drums, the extensive use of voice distortion and electronic beats distracts from Hoppus’ and Skiba’s emotionally charged vocals.
The album’s synthesized sounds are most effective in tandem with sparse instrumentation, such as in its final track, “Remember to Forget Me.” For much of the song, which takes the form of a phone call from Hoppus to his mother as he describes life on tour, only acoustic guitar accompanies Hoppus’s heartfelt message. The occasional electronic flourishes punctuate the music instead of interrupting it. Contemplative and conversational in tone, the track offers a satisfying end to an album that will once again cement Blink-182’s status as an influential force in contemporary rock. Don’t “blink” and miss it.

Over the course of 90 minutes at the Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion in Boston, the Icelandic indie band Of Monsters and Men delivered a life-affirming set with an impressive commitment to its lyrical roots in the face of sonic experimentation and heavy subject matter.
The set included 8 songs off of the group’s new album, “FEVER DREAM.” While lead single “Alligator” showcases a heavy, almost angry vocal display from co-lead singer Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, the rest of the album alternates between anthemic, high-production tracks and slow, dark meanderings. “FEVER DREAM” presents a distinct sound from Of Monsters and Men, one that is a seismic change from their 2012 debut “My Head Is an Animal.” Indeed, the arena-like qualities of “FEVER DREAM”’s crescendos could not feel further from the debut, which exploded in popularity after a viral performance in co-lead singer Ragnar Þórhallsson’s basement.
When seen live, the nature of their music remains largely consistent across albums. Hilmarsdóttir and Þórhallsson alternated between acoustic and electric guitars as they reached for songs both old and new, but aside from a few synths heard during the “FEVER DREAM” tracks, the only real variation in their discography was audience reaction. Given that their newer tracks are less well-known and fairly moody, the cheers were never going to be as loud as for their early hits “Little Talks” and “Dirty Paws.” The group also indulged themselves by returning to the new album, even when it made for some jarring transitions. The shift from “My Head Is an Animal”’s “Mountain Sound” to the new track “Wars” played well since both songs are upbeat, but the set’s momentum slowed to a crawl during ballads like “Under A Dome.” Starting the encore with “Waiting For The Snow” — a meditation on fame that Hilmarsdóttir delivered on her knees at the edge of the stage — was a strikingly bold move that almost failed. But lyrics like “I used to make mountains / But then they grew bigger than me” made an indelible impact that showcased the band’s emotive power.
Unlike other bands with two singers of the opposite sex, Of Monsters and Men do not usually employ Hilmarsdóttir and Þórhallsson as romantic foils. Instead, their songs often focus on a much more intimate relationship between one and one’s self, often centering on depression. Sometimes this dynamic is told literally. In “Slow and Steady,” Hilmarsdóttir sings that “I’m letting go, but I’ve never felt better / Passing by all the monsters in my head.” Other times it is explained through metaphor. “Six Weeks” tells the story of Hugh Glass — the inspiration for “The Revenant” — but lyrics such as “Alone / I fight these animals” demonstrate the story’s deeper meaning as a struggle against mental illness. Set closer “Yellow Light” pits Þórhallsson as a will-o’-the-wisp leading Hilmarsdóttir off her path and into danger, urging her to “Just follow my yellow light / And ignore all those big warning signs.” And their debut owes its title to a line in “Dirty Paws”: “Jumping up and down the floor / My head is an animal.”
These songs deal with heavy topics despite their upbeat melodies, none more so than the band’s breakout hit “Little Talks,” which is either about a widow missing her husband (“I’ll see you when I fall asleep”) or a wife dealing with mental illness (“The screams all sound the same”), depending on the interpretation. It is not as if these themes went unnoticed: the audience sang along almost every word. Rather, Of Monsters and Men took the subject matter of many a dreary folk album and tackled it by crafting anthemic crowd-pleasers. This just might be the key to the band’s seven-year staying power. As pop music continues to get moodier (see: Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Drake, and counting), some people just want to have a good time.
In Boston, Of Monsters and Men provided just that. The Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion — the venue’s sixth name since 1994 — made a near-perfect venue for the occasion. Although there were seats, the audience stood immediately after the band entered. The amphitheater roof contained the sound and provided some interesting shadows of drummer Arnar Rósenkranz Hilmarsson. At the end of the set, the venue’s compact nature allowed Hilmarsdóttir to run through the entire crowd during the instrumental crescendo of “Yellow Light.” After making stops to thank her tech crew and avoid a rabid fan, she returned to the stage to chant and drum during the song’s climax. Diverted from her path both in lyrics and in practice, her triumphant return to the stage evoked a feeling that the group’s upbeat melodies in the face of danger are more than just a facade. They represent real hope — hope of victory against the darkness.

Brittany Howard, the explosive blues-rock lead singer of Alabama Shakes, released her debut solo album “Jaime” on Friday. Previously, Howard blessed us with the hauntingly beautiful chords of “Sound & Color,” the electrifying “Gimme All Your Love,” and went on to win four Grammy awards. This album, a tribute to her late sister, covers topics from racism to addiction, with mixed success. Falling prey to disjointed composition, “Jaime” pushes the envelope so far that its own innovation turns to chaos, overwriting Howard’s message.
Though the points Howard attempts to make are complex and important, her delivery is less so. The Alabama Shakes singer takes on racism and life in a multi-racial family in the South in “Goat Head,” which begins with an intro that belongs on a lofi-music-to-study-to playlist that takes an unnecessary minute and a half before deciding to grace us with lyrics. There is a storied history of artists using metaphors and imagery to better express their experience, but the first lyrics of this song being “see, tomatoes are green” undermine the emotion of the song. Howard then moves into describing her multiracial family. The lyrics “'Cause mama is white / and daddy is black / when I first got made / guess I made these folks mad are predictable. As a biracial woman myself, I thought that the issue should have been approached with more time and respect. As this is one of the first songs I’ve listened to that specifically addresses the mixed experience, I craved more depth than the messy repetition of “Goat head in the back” and the statement “I knows my colors.” The background did the song no favors, as Howard proceeded to end the song with the line “Goat head in the back” repeated no fewer than nine times.
This extreme repetition continues throughout the album. Notably, the lead single of the album “History Repeats” is a literal take on its name. The end of the song trails off repeating “history repeats and we defeat ourselves come on everybody, one more time again.” The grating chords that open the song confuse the senses and undermine the charm that Howard displays when performing with Alabama Shakes. “History Repeats” is full of funk-inspired beats and lyrics that overwhelm the listener, building up to a drop that never occurs.
While Howard struggled to balance her sonic and lyric choices, she hit the perfect balance on several tracks. Her rich voice soars in “Short and Sweet,” where the use of simple acoustic guitar allows Howard’s ode to love to shine. Her voice floats on the melody in a way reminiscent of Nina Simone. “Baby,” ignoring the awkward sound check intro, is a standout track. It does what Howard does best, resulting in a song that, while still fresh, already feels like a classic.
This review would be incomplete without a consideration of Howard’s foray into spoken word poetry on “13th Century Metal.” She took the risk of letting the lyrics and music do all the talking instead of her powerhouse pipes. The overlaid synth and drums feel like a cortisol spike. The meaning was there, but the emotion never came close to her voice. Instead, she covered it with pandemonium.
In the past, Howard’s experimental forays into funk and birthed Grammy winners like “Don’t Wanna Fight,” but in “Jaime” this talent is lost in a barrage of noise. Howard takes bold risks that, unfortunately, do not pay off. The musical framework of the album fails to complement the power of its author’s voice. Flipping back-and-forth from a fresh take on funk to complete disarray, “Jaime” fails to center Howard’s vocal ability amid its high-risk musical choices.

Move over, Little Mix — the infamous ex-wives of King Henry VIII have formed a girl band called “Six,” and the lyrical shade of “Shout Out to my Ex” pales in comparison to diss tracks that literally spill tea about the head of state of England. At the American Repertory Theater until Sept. 29, “Six” is a daring, unapologetically feminist musical created by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss and styled like a pop concert. Former Tudor queens are transformed into different iconic singers, and, tired of being just another notch in Henry’s bedpost, together seek to reclaim history as noteworthy women in their own right. Queens Catherine of Aragon (Adrianna Hicks), Anne Boleyn (Andrea Macasaet), Jane Seymour (Abby Mueller), Anne of Cleves (Brittney Mack), Katherine Howard (Courtney Mack), and Catherine Parr (Anna Uzele) take turns performing sassy solo numbers that detail their individual woes concerning their marriages to King Henry. They seek to elect one among themselves to be leader of the band based only upon this criterion: Who has the worst sob story? Packed with as many radio-worthy melodies as accurate historical facts, “Six” is phenomenally fun, even if its messaging on female empowerment is at times too heavy-handed.
First and foremost, “Six” is visually captivating and makes the most of its crazy girl-band premise. The musical begins like a real concert, with a dark stage on which only silhouettes of six figures can be seen. Spotlights illuminate the women one by one as their voices join the rhythmic, spoken refrain of “Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived” that seems intentionally reminiscent of the intro to “Cell Block Tango” from “Chicago.” The costumes are ingeniously fashion-forward in mixing antiquated royal trends and modern music festival garb — for every corset and set of puffy sleeves, there’s also a pair of studded boots and a glittering miniskirt to go with it.
Beyond its aesthetic appeal, “Six” is also wildly successful in its attempt to put a modern spin on telling history. It revels in pop-culture campiness and cheeky slang, spinning narratives about Henry VIII and his ill treatment of his wives that are memorable and instantly relatable. For example, Anne Boleyn’s solo “Don’t Lose Ur Head” features a sassy comment about the king “messaging [her] like, every day,” alluding to how Henry constantly sent love letters to Anne that were met with no reply. Similarly, Anne of Cleves delivers the waspish line, “You said that I tricked you / ‘Cause I, I didn’t look like my profile picture” in the song “Get Down,” referring to the fact that Henry originally fell in love with Anne’s portrait and supposedly divorced her out of disappointment that she wasn’t as beautiful in person. Too often, productions attempting to “modernize” history run the risk of trying too hard to actively appeal to a younger audience. It’s all the more impressive, then, that “Six” not only pulls off the cool, “in-the-know” tone, but also makes it look effortless.
With its creative lyrics, “Six” cleverly delivers nuanced mood and character development with nearly every song in spite of the limitations of the repetitive pop formula. In particular, Katherine Howard’s solo “All You Wanna Do” maximizes the artistic advantages of musical theater. Acting and singing are simultaneous events that gradually subvert audience expectations of what seems like just another pop song studded with sexual innuendos. At the end of the first chorus, Katherine sings, “The only thing you wanna do is…” and trails off into an air kiss, followed by a mildly suggestive sigh. At this point in the song, Katherine is fully enjoying the abundance of sexual attention she attracts; however, by the last repeat of the chorus, Katherine is no longer posing and primping along to the choreography, and instead stands hunched into herself. She delivers her final line — “The only thing you wanna do is…”  — and follows her air kiss with a choked off, gasping sob instead, and the same words take on a new tone of helplessness and diminished self-worth.
Alas, “Six” does have some weaknesses that bring down its many strengths. One issue is that this musical doesn’t seem to have a real crescendo or climax. The energy and audience engagement is at an admittedly high level from the get-go, owing to the show’s concert-like nature, and overall stays constant without much fluctuation in tone or mood. Part of the problem could be attributed to the fact that there isn’t a strong central plotline holding the story together. Each of the queens’ solos stands alone both sonically and content-wise, so the musical appears more like six autobiographies in a row rather than a narrative integrating the backstories of six characters. Creators Marlow and Moss were likely aware of this when they crafted a hurried monologue for Catherine Parr to give at the end about how women should support one another rather than viciously compete amongst themselves, in a seeming attempt to tie “Six” together with an overarching feminist moral. The retcon is unsuccessful mostly because of how removed the serious tone of the monologue is from the tongue-in-cheek attitude used to address the same ideas of female empowerment in the rest of the show. It’s a shame that a well-crafted musical with such an interesting premise and sharp, witty characters has to come to an abrupt end on an undercooked, didactic note.
If you’re into the famous YouTube series “Epic Rap Battles of History,” you’ll certainly like “Six.” The lyrics to all the musical numbers are as simultaneously eloquent and cutting as Taylor Swift’s about her exes, with the added bonus that you’ll get to watch Tudor queens dancing in perfect sync in flashy modern garb as they diss King Henry VIII. It’s a concert and history lesson in one. Although the feminist messages that “Six” attempts to deliver often lack complexity and are a bit too on-the-nose, you’re still guaranteed to have a good time if you’re just looking for upbeat music and vibrant visual performances. However, if you’re looking for ruminations on the subtleties of feminism, “Six” still has a ways to go.

Founded in 1831, Mount Auburn Cemetery has remained a striking environment that both commemorates its dead and provides beautiful greenery to the Cambridge community at large.  From Sept. 12 to 22, the cemetery forged new ground as it hosted a site-specific play created by playwright Patrick Gabridge, the cemetery’s artist-in-residence, who brought to life several of the buried to reveal their stories. Though a rather tough sell for most (as it does involve walking amidst the graves at night), “The America Plays” is a fascinating dive into American history, providing thoughtful commentary on each person’s rich life and connecting their stories to what it means to be an American.
The work focused on Mount Auburn founder Jacob Bigelow (Ken Baltin), medical practitioner Harriot Kezia Hunt (Karen MacDonald), associate judge Joseph Story (Robert Najarian), sculptors Edmonia Lewis (Cheryl D. Singleton), Harriet Hosmer (Amanda Collins), and Martin Milmore (Mathew C. Ryan), as well as actress Charlotte Cushman (Sarah Newhouse). “The America Plays” moves across time and dimensions — all the while bringing its audience across the sprawling grounds of the cemetery. In one “scene,” viewers were brought to the day Martin Milmore completed his monolithic Civil War “Sphinx” commemorating the dead. In the next, they were in an alternate reality where the ghosts of Lewis, Cushman, and Hosmer are summoned to air past grievances and finally forgive each other for past hurt. The play also expounded on the journeys of several of Mount Auburn’s Armenian residents, such as Armenian-born architectural engineer Thomas Amirian (1910-1993).
Since many of these characters were contemporaries, Gabridge’s play often focused on their relationships with one another. For example, one focal scene featured a showdown between the Hunt’s ghost and Bigelow, in which Hunt confronts Bigelow about forcing her to withdraw her Harvard Medical School application due to her sex in 1847. The scene functioned both as a recounting of events and an opportunity for its erring character Bigelow to be forgiven and redeemed. In this case, Bigelow is finally given the chance to apologize to Hunt. While it might provide a sense of justice or comfort, it doesn’t seem particularly right to confront history by reimagining it in this way, as it attempts to whitewash the views and actions of its dead.
The apology worked much better when it was not the heart of the scene. For example, the ghosts of the play’s creative female subjects were brought together for a reconciliation. This scene was much more compelling than the one between Hunt and Bigelow because Hosmier, Cushman, and Lewis devote just as much time discussing their close friendship and lives. The women not only speak about their difficult experiences and eventual triumphs within their chosen fields, but also on their queer experiences and relationships. These discussions move the play beyond an imaginary world, and anchor it in history — a decision that is much more compelling and less fanciful than these confrontations.
While the apologies did not always feel authentic, the painful recounting of experience did. When Edmonia Lewis, the only African-American character within the play, spoke to the added difficulty she faced in her career due to her race, her charged words evoked both anger and hope. This was made all the better by Singleton’s powerful delivery.
The witty repartee and sparring of this scene between women was all the more delightful as it took place at the top of the cemetery, close to where each of the women (save Lewis) was buried. Part of what made the play such an enjoyable experience was its seamless incorporation of the surroundings into the narrative. The hill naturally forged a stage that makes each character’s reflections feel all the more grand, giving them rightful gravitas. And at its essence, that was what the play is really about: Reporting the extraordinary and plentiful lives of people we might not otherwise notice.
Of course, some of the chosen stories were less interesting, such as that of Bigelow and Milmore, which was supposed to provide commentary on the American Civil War and the uncertain political climate of the time. This scene — due to awkward, contrived dialogue largely meant to provide context and background — felt forced and wooden. Ultimately the men’s discussion did not provide any new insight into this moment in history. In spite of Baltin’s and Ryan’s fine acting, the men’s dialogue simply skimmed over major issues, providing vague statements about recovery and rebirth that were not as effective or engaging as the later conversations held by the group of women.
Perhaps the most compelling story of all was a retelling by Amirian (Ryan) of how his family escaped from Armenia during the Turkish genocide of the Armenian people. The whole cast came together to deliver a haunting vision, with the adult Amirian at once reflecting on the events as its first-person narrator and also providing the voice of the young Thomas in the narrative. Because this portion of the play had a concrete narrative and gripping narration, it resonated the most. It successfully transported its audience to a time of anguish and addressed past pain with sensitivity.
Conceptually complex and wonderfully executed, “The America Plays” brought a truly fresh perspective on local and national history. Though it did struggle between commemorating its characters and unnecessarily excusing them, it nonetheless did a creative job rejuvenating these human spirits.

“What if I told you it was going to be alright? What if I told you not yet?” The first line of “Black Light” falls on the silent audience in the dark theater of the Oberon. As his original character “Jomama Jones,” Daniel Alexander Jones walks down the center aisle of the audience holding a lit candle as he asks the audience a series of questions beginning with “What if I told you?” Jones’s opening monologue transitions seamlessly into the funky first song of the show, as the stage is cast in bright lights unveiling the waiting band and backup vocalists to the audience. It is with this transition, from dark and curious to fun and bright, that Daniel Alexander Jones sets the tone for the rest of “Black Light.”
Running from Sept. 19 to 29 at the Oberon, Jones’s “Black Light” is a cabaret that explores the unique intersection of race and sexuality — specifically blackness and queerness — through dramatic storytelling and '80s inspired music. Jones embodies his character Jomama Jones, a wise, fashionable, and relatable woman who tells stories from her childhood and adolescence that transformed her into the person she is today. Jones is accompanied by a full band comprised of a guitarist, drummer, bassist, keyboardist, and two backup vocalists whom she lovingly refers to as her “vibrations.” With the help of her band and “vibrations,” Jones invites the audience to the “crossroads” where she tells tales of her childhood summers with her disabled and very religious Aunt Cleotha, getting in trouble for fighting over a poster of Prince in an eleventh grade science class, and the politically charged world we are all living in today. It is through these stories that Jones intentionally tips the scales between deeply philosophical, real-world, political messages and much needed comedic escapism for the audience.
Written by Jones with additional help from his collaborator Josh Quan and other musicians, the music is described in the show’s programming as influenced by Diana Ross, Prince, Sade, and Tina Turner. These influences were made obvious by the eighties style bass lines, funky drum beats, power chord heavy guitar and ethereal, synth-style keyboard. The individual songs from “Black Light” can best be described as a series of puzzle pieces. Alone, the songs are not very memorable — but in the context of the entire show, once all the pieces are put together, they create a beautiful, holistic story. The songs all carried politically charged messages, with themes of resilience, choice, progress, identity, love, and hope (or lack thereof). Each song punctuated Jones’s stories and helped transition between her reenactment of childhood memories and present-day life.
One of the most striking elements of “Black Light” was the heavy use of audience participation. While many performers may ask their audience a cursory question about how everyone is doing and go on with the show, Jones involved the crowd regularly in her storytelling. From asking the general audience members questions like “what is the definition of a supernova?” to standing next to and speaking directly to members of the audience as she told her stories, Jones treated the audience not like a group of onlookers but as supporting characters in her show.
What made the audience participation so easy for Jones was the setup of the theater. Unlike a typical theater with rows of seats and aisles, the Oberon was set up almost like a jazz club. The center of the floor was covered with carefully arranged and numbered tables with an aisle separating them down the middle and the sides were lined with booths and counters. Servers took drink orders from the patrons and brought them to the tables before the show started and audience members can get drinks from the bar in the back of the theater throughout the performance. Rather than staying on the stage for the entirety of the performance, Jones danced up and down the aisle between the tables, walked to the booths on the left side of the theatre, and leaned on the counters on the right. Her “vibrations” followed her lead and also traversed the theatre to get up close and personal with the audience members. It was the use of this unique setup and the engagement with the audience that created a fully immersive experience in which the crowd members could escape their own lives for the duration of the show.
At the end of the beautiful escapist reality that she thrust the crowd into, Jones forced everyone to see not only their own humanity, but the humanity within everyone else in the crowd. During an exercise in which audience members had to hold the hand of the person next to them — preferably a stranger, but a friend would do — and look into their eyes, Jones made sure that it was known that there are galaxies and universes within everyone surrounding us, not just within ourselves. She reminded the audience that everyone has their own story to tell, and it is imperative to seek out and listen to the stories of others, not just get caught up in our own. This moment was, without a doubt, the most memorable and impactful. It was at this point in the show when it was most apparent that the space created by Jones was a safe one. With a final lesson on the importance of sacrifice, making choices, and staying vigilant, Jones ended the show the way it started — with a funky tune and a series of “What if I told you”s uttered in the dark.
Through the sharing of her most personal childhood tales and the inclusion of the audience in every aspect of the show, especially the finale, Jones both broadcasted her own vulnerability and allowed her audience members to relish in their own. While most shows create spaces in which the performers are the most exposed and the audience is guarded, in “Black Light,” performers and onlookers alike are forced to feel and share those feelings. Jones gives the audience members express permission to feel their feelings and share them with her and everyone around them — for they are safe in this theater with her. “Black Light” intertwines politics and humanity in ways that possibly have never been done before and may never be done again.

Twitter, Instagram, and possibly Tiktok imploded last week when Nicki Minaj announced her retirement, presumably with the intention to start a family. (I say “presumably” because some fans don’t think this is real — some have speculated that this is a fake-out designed to pump up sales for an inevitable upcoming album that no one can confirm exists.)
Fans were emotional and took to Twitter to vent their thoughts, opinions, and pleas for her to return. And while their pleas may not be sufficient to bring Minaj back to the music industry, they revealed the low to which fan culture has fallen. Let’s face it, people: Uber-fans are the absolute worst, and everyone needs to calm down.
To be clear, there’s a difference between being “a fan” of someone’s artistry and being a “Fan.” The former is an individual who appreciates, follows, or perhaps even loves the music or acting of a talented artist. The latter is an individual so obsessed with the image of a famous person that they fail to grasp that said famous person is, in fact, a person first. What do I mean by that?
Take this incident: Shawn Mendes recently found himself running late, trapped at an airport by fans who insisted on taking a photo with him at the expense of his own immediate needs. Or people who came for Justin Bieber after he married Hailey Baldwin — apparently they really thought he needed to get back together with Selena Gomez, as though he isn’t the best person to make a decision for his own life. Or the fans who physically tore the clothes off One Direction band members.
Sensing a pattern? Fan culture has gotten to such an extreme that someone can now make a living and rack up 500,000 YouTube views “decoding” the Easter eggs in a Taylor Swift music video — at best a waste of time, at worst incredibly creepy.
It’s not difficult to comprehend why fans see no problem with seizing every opportunity they have to violate what would have once been considered to be a normal, healthy boundary. In the Instagram era when everyone is online, sharing life updates, pictures, and soul-bearing tweets, the line between what is private and what is public has become blurred. Granted, I myself used to think that when actors, singers, or any other brand of famous people become famous, their life becomes up for grabs. After all, they chose this life. Right?
Wrong. Yes, there is a certain amount of interaction with fans that is a requisite part of the job, but when those kinds of interactions cross lines into hatred over one’s marriage, impeding one from boarding a plane, or invading personal space, there’s a bigger problem at hand. Other people’s fame is not an invitation for a “Fan” to intrude by whatever means necessary. Having memorized song lyrics or being dazzled by a singer’s beauty is no justification; we’re not entitled to the lives and private space of any other individual.
The impact of obsession is also damaging for the fans themselves: Extreme behavior leads to a loss of identity. Nicknames for the group of fans? Swifties? The Beyhive? This needs to stop. You’re a person, not a member of a cult. US Magazine published an article titled “12 Times the Beyhive Attacked to Defend Beyonce.” Does Beyoncé need to be defended? Articles and arguments regularly discuss her fearlessness and confidence — why does she need an army of shrillness defending her? From whom? (Other individuals entitled to their own opinions?)
Over-the-top fan behavior leads to the kind of rabbit hole down which it is now too easy to fall. It’s easy to get lost scrolling through social media, looking at pictures of a celebrity and wishing you could be that person — or that you could meet them and express your undying love. Though it is absolutely plausible and justified for an artist’s songwriting to have carried one through a period of sadness, anxiety, or rage, does this source of support need to become all-consuming, to the point of intense preoccupation and boundary-erasure? Let an artist’s music or movies be one’s (non-obsessive) focal point — not the person. Access to that content does not entitle an individual to unfettered access to their personal lives. Y’all need to calm down.

This past week, the Dean of Students’ Office rolled out a new policy mandating that all extracurricular organizations welcome DSO “neutral moderators” to engagements with “controversial” speakers. In addition, organizations will have to register speakers with the DSO a month in advance. Moderators will have the power to exercise a “two-strike policy” on disruptive audience members, and the DSO may also cancel events they see as potentially ending in violence.
In brief, we find these new guidelines paternalistic, ineffective, and contrary to the College’s stated goals of free speech.
When inviting speakers to campus, student organizations no doubt must be held responsible for the consequences of their invitation and event, but the College should also assume these organizations and their leaders to be mature enough to execute effective due diligence in researching speakers and managing audiences.
It’s concerning that the policy draws a line between undergraduate events and those of the broader campus. This infantilizing division not only breaks down the potential for collaboration between undergraduates and their graduate peers, but also sends a message about the University’s lack of trust in undergraduates’ maturity.
The extra guidance is not only unnecessary but insulting. While we understand the College’s wariness about heated protests, we do not think this policy is an effective way to prevent dangerous escalations. An individual moderator does not have the ability to control an agitated crowd, especially the sort of the crowds the College is likely most worried about. We might recall when student protestors interrupted a Kennedy School forum at which University President Lawrence S. Bacow was speaking to demand divestment from fossil fuels. What more could a moderator really have done to stop them or even deescalate the situation?
Beyond issues of efficacy, this policy precludes the spirit of inviting speakers to openly and honestly discuss controversial issues. If student groups have to jump through a litany of hoops from the administration merely to get their approval — or rejection — their ability to promote intellectually rigorous conversation will be drastically limited. These stringent rules may very well discourage speakers and students alike, while also logistically inconveniencing leaders of extracurricular organizations. It is a great privilege to attend a University where so many significant thinkers and leaders come to share their ideas; making that exchange of ideas more difficult detracts from the institution as a whole as well as the individual experiences of its students.
We are also concerned that this policy will unequally affect conservative speakers, who are more likely to be protested against on campus. Since the College has a well-established liberal bent, conservative speakers are more likely to be deemed controversial. It would be easy, for example, to categorize conservative speakers as sparking threatening situations, based merely on the larger number of perturbed students. Just because these speakers represent a campus minority, however, does not dismiss their right to share ideas.
But more importantly, we feel it necessary to ask what “controversial” even entails and why the DSO should be given the authority to answer that question on a case-by-case basis. The policy is troublingly vague and, in so being, threatens the autonomy of student groups on campus we have often defended. What will these moderators do, and what qualifies them as neutral? How will they determine a potential for violence? What is the formal registration process? How are “disruption,” “controversial,” “VIP”, and “violent” going to be defined? It does not appear to be good practice to institute a policy without fully defining all pertinent terms.
Without trafficking in slippery slopes, we worry that this ambiguity and the unstructured power it affords the DSO and its moderators are not so far off from a system of outright censorship. It’s not the University’s job to control speech, protest, and passionate debate. The paternalistic control of student forums is not only unwelcome on this campus, but corrosive to the statues of truth and free discourse that undergird Harvard’s purported mission.

Since the founding of Harvard University 383 years ago, the school has come to represent the pinnacle of American higher education. Though founded before the founding of the United States, it has always been perceived — and perceived itself — as distinctly American and has even been referred to as “America’s university.” From the scope of its research to its outsized influence on the American political process to the makeup of its students, Harvard is thoroughly American.
Yet in the wake of prominent conversations about diversity taking place from the classroom to the courthouse, increasingly transnational issues such as climate change, and the detestable deportation of Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, Harvard ought to reconsider its Americentrist position and firmly establish itself as an international university.
It is widely considered objectionable when Harvard and other universities have placed quotas or discriminated against certain minority or underprivileged groups in the admissions process, as as they have against Catholics, Jews, gay students, African-Americans, women, and is being accused of doing against Asian-Americans. Why do we not apply the same sort of outrage over the implicit cap of international students? International students have made up a consistent portion of College admits, and, according to some estimates, have an acceptance rate of 1.6 percent, nearly three times lower than the overall acceptance rate. Just as other sorts of quotas and double standards in admissions are rightly viewed as discriminatory and bigoted, why is the apparent quota of international students not deemed to be similarly xenophobic?
As others have noted, international applicants often face more hurdles in the application process, particularly for those who are less wealthy: a potential language barrier, lack of knowledge of the American university system, improper or insufficient counseling, a difficult visa application process, and tremendous hostility from the American government and president toward immigrants. Harvard should actively work to make it easier for international students to apply and to increase the proportion of international students in the College, in the name of both diversity and equality. Additionally, international students have to overcome social and academic barriers once at school. More should be done to help integrate them and ease their transition to living in the United States.
But doing so requires more than just changing admissions demographics. Harvard is in a distinctly privileged position and should use its role as a global leader in education and research in order to exert a global impact. Harvard has taken a key role in American politics in Washington and has admirably used its national standing to advocate on issues such as immigration, higher education, and climate change. It should take an equally active role across the world. From the refugee crisis to climate change to the role of NGOs and transnational corporations, contemporary politics are not confined to national borders and neither should Harvard’s activist role.
In understanding the extent of Harvard’s, and virtually all American schools’, Americentrism, consider how schools abroad handle these issues. The London School of Economics and Political Science, for example, is composed of nearly 70 percent of international students and Oxford is made up of 43 percent international students, whereas Harvard is only 21.1 percent international students. Of course, some of this is due to LSE’s and Oxford’s proximity to other European nations, but having a more geographically diverse student body, as well as a diverse faculty, allows for a wider range of experiences to be heard and allows for those universities to be more representative of the global population which it should serve. It also allows for its research to reach different parts of the world and be conducted by people from those places.
However, these changes ought to be seen as more than isolated steps to be more internationally-focused; they should be part of a broader reorientation of how Harvard views itself, whom it should serve, and the scope of its activism. Harvard College’s stated mission is to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders of our society.” In order to fully do so, it should commit to a more global outlook and one less Americentric.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time I visited Harvard was a few months before I ever imagined I’d be a student here. Harvard is beautiful in the autumn: My mother and I spent several hours wandering campus under mosaic-like bursts of burgundy and ochre foliage; by the end of the day, we were exhausted. One of my favorite memories from that weekend is resting in the warmth of Crema Café, an inviting hug after a long day of physical and mental strain.
When I returned to campus as a first-year, Crema became a hallmark of my first few semesters. Sure, the café didn’t have Wi-Fi, and the second floor was usually crowded, but I loved the atmosphere, it was a local business, and I’d cultivated an emotional attachment to the place that was hard to shake. Among other things, Crema had a vibrant “community board” situated to the right of its entrance; it captured the various events that were being held in the Cambridge community and always made me feel like a part of something larger than Harvard. So when Crema closed seemingly because of rent practices perpetrated by their new property owner, Asana Partners, I was reasonably devastated.
However, the recent trend of local businesses fleeing Harvard Square due to the greed of new real estate investment firms Asana Partners and Regency Centers, is troubling for more than emotional reasons — it is an extreme continuation of real estate investment practices that have sculpted Harvard’s decades-long housing crisis into what it has become today.
The transformation of Harvard Square is not new. Just as generations of students cycle in and out of Harvard every four years or so, so too does the composition of Harvard Square continually change, albeit on a longer life-cycle. The past few decades in particular have seen Harvard Square shift from a local marketplace for residents of Cambridge to “a shopping district” for visitors and the relatively wealthy.
Harvard Square’s history of this sort of re-gentrification (a gentrification that cycles through different, but culturally-reliant, phases) began with projects in the 1980s like the openings of the Charles Hotel and the Eliot Street Garage in 1985. These events began to create a different aura about Harvard Square, one that didn’t reflect previous understandings of class and stature in Cambridge. The community response was two-fold: Community members founded the Harvard Square Defense Fund to restrict and fight aggressive real estate practices; students responded to the rising housing insecurity from rent hikes by founding groups like the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, established in 1983.
Real estate firms found ways to cope with backlash, however, and in 1994, voters in Massachusetts passed a state-wide referendum banning rent control across the state. Though it was not singularly responsible for the commercial transformation of Harvard Square, the absence of such basic regulations opened the floodgates for rent hikes and eviction practices that would alter the socioeconomic composition of both Harvard Square and of housing in Cambridge at large.
All of this brings us to the present day. The recent sales of the Curious George building to Regency Centers and of Brattle Court to Asana Partners in 2017 have allowed for these firms to once again dramatically reconstruct Harvard Square’s identity. Whereas the definition of gentrification in the early 2010s was hipster coffee/dessert and old-guard chain restaurants (i.e. Crema, Tealuxe, Sweet, Chipotle), the Harvard Square that Asana and Regency want to create is one inhabited by &pizzas and Milk Bars, trendy national retailers featured in viral Instagram videos, offering prices that are even more exorbitant and questionable.
With an immensely complicated problem such as this one, there is no single solution. But what I do know is that without strong civic action, without pressure on Asana and Regency from the Cambridge community or the local government, the Harvard Square of five years from now will be even less inhabitable and less economically accessible to many members of the Cambridge community. We need to hold these firms accountable through policies that afford renters in Harvard Square more rights and protections. While not all landlords are large investment firms, the lack of any form of rent control or regulation clearly injures small businesses; installing protections for renters and perhaps even revisiting rent control are routes that could redistribute the disproportionate power that currently lies in the hands of landowners.
And finally, for Harvard students: We occupy this strange liminal space in our relationship to Harvard Square and Cambridge at large. We certainly have a stake in the cultural and economic geography of Cambridge, but it doesn’t make sense for our voices to carry equal weight to those of permanent residents of Cambridge, since our stake is relatively short-term — we’re each only here for around four years or so. Therefore, the civically sensible option for students is to rally around organizations that represent the interests of Cambridge residents, rather than superseding their interests with policies that might benefit students at Harvard most.
There are so many issues tied into this problem of property ownership and manipulation, especially that of homelessness in Harvard Square. But in order for us to think seriously about solving Cambridge’s “housing crisis,” we first need to stop these cycles of re-gentrification.

Harvard University Health Services will provide vaccination coping strategies to students and collaborate directly with the Harvard Athletics Department in an effort to increase the undergraduate flu vaccination rate by at least 20 percent, according to HUHS Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi.
The new initiatives will be part of this year’s iteration of the HUHS flu vaccine campaign, which begins Sept. 30. Francesconi said in an interview that roughly half of College students are vaccinated against the flu each year.
“[We’ve] held steady for about the last five years where we're getting about half the undergraduates,” Francesconi said. “The Harvard community itself had a slightly higher rate of influenza-like illness last year than what we saw in the rest of the country.”
HUHS has vaccinated around 3,000 undergraduates each year through their walk-in and dining hall clinics, according to HUHS Infection Control Surveillance Officer Donna Campbell. Though the walk-in clinics are open to all Harvard affiliates — students, faculty, employees, and retirees — the dining hall clinics are geared toward undergraduates.
In addition to encouraging the general student population to get vaccinated, HUHS is also targeting the Harvard Athletics Department for the first time by reaching out to coaches and holding vaccination clinics for athletes.
“We’re doing some work with Athletics to really target the athletes — athletes, in and of themselves — because they spend so much time in tight quarters,” Francesconi said. “If they do get it it can run very quickly through teams.”
To encourage more students to participate, HUHS will launch a social media campaign showcasing administrators participating in the flu vaccine clinics. They will also publicize the times of the flu clinics on Omni — an app that provides information to Harvard students — and give students distraction strategies to cope with the pain of getting vaccinations.
“The HealthPALs at the dining halls are also going to bring some stuffed animals, and they're going to have laptops with cat and dog videos to try to distract people, because we've heard that part of people not getting the vaccine is that they're worried about the needles,” Francesconi said. “We're trying to have some techniques to distract people and encouraging people to bring a buddy.”
HUHS is also delaying the start of its clinics this year after CDC research revealed that vaccines given later in the year cover people for longer, according to Campbell. She said HUHS used to provide immunization clinics as soon as they received shipments of the vaccine from manufacturers, which could be as early as August.
“Certainly for some of the older folks — some of the employees — it certainly could make a difference if you give them a flu shot in August,” Campbell said. “It’s pretty well worn off by April.”

Last year’s Harvard Law School application increase may not be a one-off — the high application numbers have stuck around for another cycle.
The Law School received 7,419 applications for the juris doctor Class of 2022, compared to 7,578 applications from the Class of 2021, and the 5,755 applications it received from the Class of 2020. Of the 7,419 applicants, 12 percent were accepted.
Though application numbers are down 2.1 percent from last year, the number of applicants to Harvard Law remains significantly higher than in years past — last year saw a 32 percent increase over the previous year. During the application cycle following the 2016 election, there was a nationwide 8.3 percent spike in law school applications that led some experts to dub the trend a “Trump Bump” in response to President Donald Trump’s election.
In 2018, Harvard Law School Assistant Dean for Admissions and Chief Admissions Officer Kristi L. Jobson said she thought that Harvard Law admission’s spike had less to do with the national increase and more to do with Harvard-specific initiatives.
“We don’t attribute the 32 percent increase that we saw to a parallel to the national increase because it was much higher,” Jobson said at the time. “We think that our office has engaged in a systematic strategy in knocking down barriers to legal education.”
Starting in 2018, Law School applicants were able to apply with the GRE test instead of the traditional LSAT if they chose. The Law School also added video interviews as part of their application. Seat deposits were eliminated the previous year.
This year, half of the matriculating class will be women. Roughly 45 percent of the Class of 2022 are students of color, and 14 percent of the Class of 2022 are international students.
The Law School also attracted applicants from a variety of academic and career backgrounds. Of the matriculating students, 24 students are current or former members of the United States Armed Forces, and 27 earned a graduate fellowship — including the Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, and Truman Scholarship — and 1 competed on the television show “Survivor.”
Consistent with Harvard Law’s recent emphasis on “work experience,” more than 75 percent of the class spent at least one year out of college before matriculating to Harvard Law.
The Law School had 561 first-year students begin classes on September 3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders from the National Domestic Workers Alliance discussed the importance of domestic workers’ contributions to the future of the labor movement at an Institute of Politics event Monday evening.
Ai-jen Poo, co-founder and executive director of NDWA, and Palak Shah, the group’s social innovations director, spoke at the event, titled “The Future of the American Labor Movement.” Brittany Butler, executive director of the Kennedy School’s Social Innovation and Change Initiative, moderated the conversation, which covered topics ranging from workers’ rights to intersectionality.
The Poo and Shah started by connecting issues facing domestic workers to the labor force as a whole. Legally, domestic workers cannot unionize or bargain, but Poo helped found NDWA in 2007 to advocate for their labor protections.
Domestic workers — who are largely women and people of color — hold up society “behind the scenes” as nannies, house cleaners and caretakers, Poo said.
“It’s so important, and yet it is some of the most vulnerable and undervalued work in our entire economy,” she said. “The overwhelming number of workers are working in poverty or on the brink of poverty, without access to a safety net, without benefits, without job security, without a path to career advancement.”
Shah said that domestic workers are particularly equipped to be leaders in the labor movement going forward because more laborers are facing conditions domestic workers have experienced for decades.
“In many ways, people are looking to domestic workers as the original gig workers for guidance and leadership around, ‘Well, you all have been living in these kind of precarious conditions for generations, what's the way forward?’” Shah said.
Poo highlighted how NDWA’s position at the convergence of various movements — including ones concerning worker’s rights, immigration, and gender equality — makes it essential to evaluate their work through an intersectional lens and offers an opportunity for innovation in organizing.
“You get to see all the different ways that hierarchies of power are shaping our reality, along lines of race, along lines of gender, and many other lines,” Poo said.
Estela Lacombe Franca ’23, who attended the talk, said she was particularly passionate about the type of work Poo and Shah were undertaking.
“I am especially interested in the intersection between immigration and different aspects of people's identities and their role in the domestic labor movement,” Franca said. “Their approach towards reconciling that with their advances in both policy and reception of domestic workers was absolutely fascinating and extremely necessary.”
Sarah J. Leadem-Castro, a Kennedy School student, said she left the talk feeling “really inspired.”
“As political leaders, we can have great policy ideas in a vacuum, but they have to stand the test of popular support and political will,” she said. “Thinking about a strategy of policy change combined with cultural change could open the space for new policies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council passed legislation Monday night that lights the way for recreational marijuana businesses to open in Cambridge.
The council voted 7-0 in favor of the “Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance,” with Councilors E. Denise Simmons and Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. abstaining. Due to the approval of an amendment by Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Quinton Zonervan last week, the legislation will prioritize granting permits to those from historically marginalized groups, including women, minorities, and those who have been impacted by the war on drugs.
Before the vote, Siddiqui praised the measure as an effective way to fight inequity.
“The country's racist war on drugs has heavily impacted and criminalized black and brown folks,” she said. “It's our collective responsibility to do the best we can to fight [for] policies that provide equitable access to the wealth and opportunity inherent in this emerging billion dollar cannabis industry.”
Councilor Craig A. Kelley said he appreciates the “good faith efforts” made by all parties in the debate, and that the law, though flawed, is a positive step.
“I think the state gave us a law that was imperfect, and history gave us a series of horrible things that are worse and imperfect, and we all are trying to do our best to bring us to a better place,” he said. “This isn't where I would have gone, but certainly, I think it's better than it would have been.”
Though Massachusetts legalized the use of marijuana in 2016, Cambridge did not consider legislation on whether businesses can sell the drug for recreational use until earlier this year.
In recent months, the debate has focused on two proposed amendments — one by Siddiqui and Zondervan and the other by Simmons — to the permitting ordinance.
Siddiqui and Zondervan's amendment advocates for imposing a two-year moratorium on the opening of recreational marijuana shops whose owners do not come from historically marginalized groups. In a June interview, Siddiqui called the amendment a “head start” for local businesses over larger corporations.
Simmons’s amendment called on the city to allow current registered medical marijuana dispensaries to begin selling recreational marijuana if they contribute annually to a fund that assists “economic empowerment” businesses — those that are run by people who have been disproportionately harmed by past marijuana laws.
In a meeting last week, the Ordinance Committee ultimately decided to advance a version of the bill with Siddiqui and Zondervan’s amendment — but not Simmons’s — to the council for consideration.
Simmons said before the Monday vote that though she agrees with the intent of the proposal, she is disappointed with its final form.
“I think we are ultimately going to look back at this moment and regret how we have chosen to go about this,” she said. “We will be embracing a moratorium that leads to uncertainty as well as further unnecessary and expensive delays.”
The inclusion of Siddiqui and Zondervan’s amendment also means that current medical marijuana dispensaries not falling under the “historically marginalized groups” conditions will not be able to sell recreationally until the two-year period has lapsed. Zondervan said in an interview Monday that he believes dispensaries will not be significantly affected financially by the new law.
“We'll hopefully address some of the inequity by providing opportunities for black and brown entrepreneurs to benefit from cannabis legalization,” he said. “I think that the medical dispensaries will continue to serve their patients, and I also hope that they make good on their promises to help the Economic Empowerment applicants.”
Before the vote, several Cambridge residents spoke about the legislation during the portion of the meeting open to public comments. Nichole Snow, executive director of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance, said she believes medical marijuana dispensaries and patients will be negatively impacted. Previously, she has argued that medical marijuana dispensaries unable to sell recreational marijuana will not be able to compete with new businesses and may leave Cambridge.
“Patients aren't asking for a handout. We're only asking for our civil rights to be respected, and it'd be delayed for another two years,” she said.
Cambridge resident Richard Harding said he supports the measure, and that he is “grateful” for the discussion on the issue.
“You know, sometimes these processes aren’t easy to get through,” he said. “And I know that when emotions are high, different things happen.”

Allston residents and Harvard administrators met Monday night to discuss the state of current University projects on the Boston side of the Charles River — including the construction of the Enterprise Research Campus, which prompted heated discussion from audience members.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force, a neighborhood advisory body for issues related to Harvard’s institutional projects in Allston, convened the meeting to discuss the University’s annual report on its cooperation agreements with the City of Boston and how those partnerships have affected the city.
The majority of the report centered around the Harvard Ed Portal — now five years old — which provides programming and resources to Allston residents and gained 530 new members this year. Programming areas include arts and culture, workforce development, health and wellness programs, and public school partnerships.
Harvard representatives also updated attendees on ongoing construction projects, including the Enterprise Research Campus. Several attendees said they are frustrated by the lack of opportunities for Allston residents to give input on the project since the research campus does not fall under the Harvard-Allston Task Force’s purview. The task force oversees institutional projects, but the new campus is a commercial development.
Audience members argued that the City of Boston should create a general governing body to oversee all Harvard developments, regardless of whether or not they are institutional projects. Creating such a group would lead to better neighborhood planning because of the wider perspective, according to Allston resident Jane McHale.
“I think those that have been watching the development over a number of years have a broader view on what actually is all happening,” McHale said in an interview after the meeting.
In response, Boston Planning and Development Agency official Gerald Autler said at the meeting that all members of the task force may be invited to join a group focused on reviewing the impact of the research campus and other related developments, but that the exact structure of this body has not been finalized yet.
The Enterprise Research Campus, approved in March 2018 and overseen by the newly formed Harvard Allston Land Company, has sparked debates in the past. Most notably, in 2017 the Impact Advisory Group raised concerns about housing, infrastructure, transportation, and open space during a BPDA-mandated comment period. In response, the University has said that it plans on creating affordable construction projects and reserving “upwards of 1,000” units of housing for local residents.
Harvard officials also updated attendees on the progress of a number of larger construction projects. Those updates include the completion of the first two phases of the Soldiers Field Park renovation; the Harvard Business School Pavilion renovation; and the Harvard Art Lab, which had its opening celebration Saturday.
A number of projects remain unfinished, including the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex — set to open in September 2020 — and the District Energy facility.
Harvard-Allston Task Force Chair John A. Bruno also announced at the meeting that he is stepping down from his position.
“Your guidance and your direction...led this group to work with Harvard University and work with the city of Boston to not so much transform, but to make the necessary adjustments in our neighborhood,” Bruno said at the meeting.
McHale said she found the meeting and hearing about the updates to Harvard’s initiatives “rewarding.”
“[It’s] very rewarding because I've been involved in these meetings for 13 years, and to be in the original meetings where we're kind of fighting to get benefits, and then to actually see that come to fruition is really exciting,” McHale said.

A productive second half powered No. 14 Harvard to a 4-1 victory over the University of Maine on Sunday for its final match before beginning Ivy League play next weekend in New Haven, Conn., against Yale.
Well into the third quarter, the game remained tied. The Crimson (3-2) had dominated on offense and defense since Maine’s (1-6) game-tying penalty stroke with four minutes to play in the first, but, aside from the 11-4 shot count — the Harvard defense held the Black Bears to zero opportunities in the second and third quarters — the Crimson had little to show for its efforts.
Entering Sunday’s game, Harvard had yet to lead a game at the half. The Crimson kept that dubious streak alive against Maine, the score knotted at one apiece when the horn sounded.
“Our structure worked really well,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “We got a lot of turnovers forced on our pressing and their outletting.… The outcome of those turnovers was a little on the low end until the fourth quarter.”
A dominant third quarter looked to meet the same end as the second: Crimson command on both ends of the field, but no change in score for either side. Then, with barely a minute remaining in the third, sophomore midfielder Rachel Greenwood fired from beyond the shooting circle for the twelfth shot of the game — and the ninth shot since the Crimson’s sole goal of the match. The ball rebounded off the pads of Black Bears goalie Mia Borley and onto the waiting stick of junior forward Natalie Sicher.
Sicher collected, aimed, and scored for the go-ahead goal. A penalty corner seconds later offered an opportunity to further build the advantage, but Harvard was unable to cash in. The Crimson would need to hold onto its single-point lead for a quarter more to emerge with the win.
“We talked at halftime, and I think we did a really good job of making the field feel large and saying, ‘Guys, it’s really warm [86 degrees], don’t hold onto the ball. Pass it right when you get it,’” Harvard co-captain Bente van Vlijmen said. “I think we did a really good job of that.”
Aside from a defensive hiccup that allowed Maine to put up a shot in the second minute of action, Harvard had started off strong. Relentless pressure from the Crimson paid off, as Sicher broke away down the left side and passed off to senior forward Casey Allen, who quickly settled before arching the ball into the back of the net to put Harvard on the board.
The Black Bears responded with speed and strength. Two minutes after Allen’s score, Maine earned a penalty corner. Although the Crimson managed to fend off the Black Bears’ attempt, Harvard only delayed its fate. A foul was called during the stop, and Maine was awarded a penalty stroke. Sophomore goalie Ellie Shahbo dove toward the ball, but it snuck just under her right arm. The game was tied.
“In the first half we were a little bit frustrated,” van Vlijmen said. “We couldn’t really come out of our outlet, so we couldn’t really attack the way we wanted to.”
The fourth quarter proceeded much like the third: one-sided possession from the Crimson, with an occasional Black Bears breakaway corralled by the solid back line, but no change in score. Looking to force overtime, Maine boldly pulled its goalie with just under five minutes remaining. Harvard’s defense held strong and the offense took advantage of the empty net.
With four minutes to play, a rapid succession of passes directed the ball to van Vlijmen, who scored for her first goal of the season. The Black Bears restored their goalie, but the Crimson’s continued pressure was not done paying off. Two minutes later, a Harvard penalty corner brought the ball to van Vlijmen’s stick again. Aimed with devastating precision, the ball found its mark to give the Crimson the 4-1 victory.
“We started a process, and I think we need to hold onto that process and trust what we’re doing — clearly it works,” van Herwaarden said. “I think what went really well today was our press. And I think that against this team it was still very difficult to capitalize on … turnovers, but once we have that going on for us … it gives us energy.”
Harvard looks to extend its two-game win streak as it heads to New Haven on September 28 to open Ivy League play at 12 p.m. against Yale.

With conference play just around the corner, the women’s soccer team seems to be hitting its stride perfectly, and it could not come at a better time. With a dominant 5-0 shutout win over Long Island University (1-7-1) on Saturday, the Crimson moved into third place among Ivy League schools–falling just behind Dartmouth (7-1) and Brown (6-1-1).
Even more impressive, though, has been Harvard’s performance in the past three games to conclude non-conference play. In the last week, the team has defeated the University of Connecticut (4-3-1), UMass Lowell (1-6-1), and Long Island University–outscoring the three with a combined score of 12-2 (21-10 on the year).
“As a team, we feel like we are in a really good place right now,” said sophomore midfielder/forward Sophie Hirst. “We’ve hardly had time to practice the last few weeks since we have had so many games, so we’ve had to fix most of our problems on the fly. Now that we have an understanding of what we do well and what we need work on, we have a whole week of practice before we kick off Ivy season with Penn next Saturday.”
The victory against LIU marked the third shut out of the year for the Crimson. The combination of continual solid play from both the offense and defense, as well as the goalkeepers, is going to make Harvard a very difficult opponent to most teams, especially if it continues to improve and play at the recent pace it has been. It is clear that these past three games have set a precedent for how good this squad can actually be.
“I think the three-game win streaks speaks to the fact that the pieces are starting to really come together,” said first-year forward Angela Caloia. “We all knew that we had great potential, but now the chemistry is starting to really materialize and being on the field is more fun every time. We’ve been at it for a full month now, and every game we’ve been focused on fixing all the details that could’ve been better the game before. I think that above and beyond the results, the past three games have shown that we’re been able to dictate our style of play against different opposition.”
The LIU game opened with a lightning-quick pace, as Caloia netted a goal just over nine minutes into the game. Caloia has continued her impressive start to the season, as she now leads the team in total points (16), assists (8), and is tied with Hirst for the most goals (4). Less than five minutes later, first-year midfielder/forward Gabby DelPico added another goal, giving the Crimson an early 2-0 advantage.
Shortly into the second half, Hirst tapped in her fourth goal of the season on a nice center from first-year midfielder Hollyn Torres. Despite building a relatively comfortable lead, Harvard had no intention of slowing down or taking any chances by leaving the game in doubt. In the 61st minute, Caloia drove by the LIU defense and, with a beautiful cross, fed junior forward Murphy Agnew to set up another goal. Finally, the Crimson capped off its scoring barrage (all five of which came from different players) with one last goal from sophomore forward Trinity Thomas.
Despite the abundant success this year, the team knows it still has a long way to go. “Heading into conference play, obviously our goal is to win the Ivy League and advance to the NCAA tournament, but that can’t happen without the whole team committing to do the thing they do best for us,” said Hirst. “If we stick to our roles and be the best at what we do best, we know our team can be great. For me and our forwards, that’s continuing to work together on and off the ball, taking people on and being creative, creating lots of scoring opportunities.”
Harvard is well aware that many large challenges still lay ahead, but rather than dwell on potential difficulties, the team is getting more and more excited to prove itself this season and continue its success into Ivy League play. “Everyone is buzzing and it feels like all of the work we’ve put in is about to be tested,” said Caloia. “Honestly, I’m looking forward to all of our games, but right now the full focus is on Penn this Saturday. It’s a massive opportunity to start conference play on the right foot and make a statement about who the team is and what our goals are for the season.”
The play as of late has had fans buzzing about the potential this team has for an exceptional year, and it seems like with every player being on the same page and improving every game, the sky is the limit for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a gorgeous day at the Edgewood Yacht Club, the wind hovered at a mild 5-8 knots — not too strong a breeze, but just strong enough to propel Harvard to a third-place finish at the Sherman Hoyt Trophy last weekend. Junior skipper Eli Burnes, junior crew member Emily Wang and sophomore crew member Eric Hansen scored an impressive 123 points in the A-Division, while sophomore Emma Kaneti and junior Emma Jakobson managed a stellar 100 points en route to Harvard’s second consecutive top-three performance at the Hoyt Trophy. Harvard placed first at the regatta, which is annually hosted by Brown University, last year.
Although the team finished strong, it was not smooth sailing for Harvard during the entire regatta. In its first two races of the Hoyt Trophy, Harvard Sailing’s A team stumbled to 14th- and 12th- finishes to put the team in a deep hole. These early struggles threatened to derail Harvard’s performance at the event; however, both the A and B squads put up a string of strong performances to bring Harvard up to third place. Tying Harvard’s best result of the young season, the third-place finish highlighted a weekend of four regattas against tough competition.
According to Burns, staying tough mentally was key in order for him, Wang and Hansen to rebound from the tough start.
“We had a bad day [Saturday]. I was not at my best.” said Burns. “At the end of Saturday — I sailed with [Wang] — she and I were eleventh in the A-division. But Monday we came back and I was super focused and we put together a lot of great races. [The next] day, me and [Hansen], who I sailed with on Sunday, we moved up to fifth and then we got third overall, which is definitely good.”
Harvard also performed well at the annual Harvard Invitational, securing a fifth-place finish against 16 other teams. In the A-Division, junior skipper Owen Schafer and first-year crew member Chris Wang scored an impressive 25 points, while sophomore skipper Paul Kuechler and crew members Katie Barkin and Bridget Sands put up a solid 40 points in the B-Division.
Harvard Sailing had an additional pair of regattas to close out the weekend, placing 10th in the Hood Trophy and 12th in the all-women’s Mrs. Hurst bowl. Although these lackluster results were slightly disheartening following the strong performances at the Hoyt Trophy and Harvard Invitational, the team is very happy with their season thus far. According to first-year walk-on crew member Alex Lee, the group has been working hard in practice to prepare for its races.
“We’re really making the most of our practice time.” said Lee. “We get there, we do our warm ups, then we go right to the drills. A big thing we wanted to work on this year was boat handling, [which is] how the skipper and crew work together. I think we’ve been doing well so far.”
In addition to continuing with their training regimen and work ethic, Harvard Sailing will also focus on training younger, up-and-coming sailors on the squad, such as walk-ons like Lee.
“We have a lot of new freshmen, and we’re trying to train a bunch of new walk-ons right now and that’s really exciting.” said Burns. “A lot of the freshmen are really talented, so as the season goes on, we’ll see how they do.”
The team looks to build on its strong performances in the Hoyt Trophy and Harvard Invitational when it competes in four regattas hosted by Connecticut College, United States Coast Guard Academy, MIT, and Tufts next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down in Franklin Park, some 30 minutes from the Harvard campus, both Crimson teams placed fourth in the Battle for Beantown, their best finishes since the tournament’s inception in 2013.
In front of a crowd facing 24 other schools, including for the men No. 3 ranked Washington, No. 13 ranked Syracuse,, and No. 21 ranked Arkansas and for the women No. 25 ranked Dartmouth, No. 27 ranked Syracuse, and No. 29 ranked Georgia Tech, Harvard had a chance to prove themselves. Prove themselves they did.
For the men, senior standout Kieran Tuntivate had the best race of his Harvard career, beating out the pack by 12 seconds. The Delaware native finished in a blistering 23:58, good for a per mile pace of 4:50. This time for the 2018 HEPs champion, was his personal best in the 8k by over 20 seconds, proving that Kieran is well ahead of where he was last season.
“It’s true I won HEPs last year but our team was second and also missed out on qualifying for nationals,” commented Tuntivate on his motivation this year, “I’m motivated because I want our team to win HEPs and get to nationals. I want to do my part in helping that happen.”
In second for the men’s team was junior Matthew Pereria, who placed 18th, up from 56th a year ago, with a time of 24:47. Pereria was behind many of those who finished behind and in front of him at the 3k and 5k mark, but Pereria had a strong finish near the end of the race to gain crucial positions for the Crimson. His time was also a personal best in the 8k, and the junior will look to build on this performance as the season progresses.
The pair of junior Blake Evertsen and first year Ben Hartvigsen finished 40 and 41 for the Harvard squad, as Evertsen continued his breakout season and freshman Hartvigsen had a huge race, unafraid of the moment in his first collegiate race. To round out the scoring for the Crimson was sophomore David Melville, who finished in 52nd. Freshman Acer Iverson who had a strong opener last week against Yale, followed up with a quality 59th place finished in his second race in the crimson uniform, good for sixth on the team.
“Yesterday’s performance was about making sure our team would practice good habits and get those good habits in motion for the rest of the season,” said Tuntivate about the team’s performance, “[it was about] getting back into the routine of racing and waking up the legs after so long.”
Tuntivate and the rest of the Men’s Cross Country team have their eyes set high on nationals this year. The men’s team finished in fourth with 151 points, just edging a talented ranked Washington team who put up 156 points and a ranked Arkansas team.
The women ran together much like they have so far this season. The standout performer for the Crimson was first-year Isabell Sagar who finished with a time 17:35 in the 5k with an average pace of 5:40. Sagar led the women for the first time in her young career and her 11th place finish was the best in the Battle for Beantown since 2015 for the Harvard women.
Just behind Sagar, a pack of three Crimson women, junior Brooke Starn, sophomore Maya Rayle, and senior co-captain Gillian Meeks, placed 28th, 30th, and 31st. The pack finished within three seconds of each other and the cohesion helped Havard jump many teams in the rankings. Junior Tessa Madrano was Harvard’s final scorer, placing 38th. While many other teams had more top-heavy lineups, the Crimson women were able to finish together, picking up points as the 3rd, 4th, and 5th scorers of many competitors dropped off.
“We didn’t explicitly plan to stick as a pack,” stated Meeks on the race strategy, “it just sort of happened that we finished close together. We all ran different races, some of us going out hard and others going out more conservatively, but we all ended up in similar spots.”
The strong effort allowed the Havard women to place 4th and take down two ranked opponents, fellow Ivy-league opponent Dartmouth, who finished 6th in team scoring, and Georgia Tech, who finished 7th.
In the first big race of the year both teams ran their hearts out on the way to a pair of 4th place finishes, the best for both teams since the race was first started in 2013. This contest proved how far the program has come in recent years and hinted at future program-wide success this year.
After the battle this weekend, the Crimson have two weeks off before they’re back in Franklin Park for the New England Championships on October 12th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No.12 Harvard Men’s Water Polo (9-0) continued its blistering run with four more wins at the Bucknell Invite in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. This marks the best start to the season in program history.
Harvard trounced Johns Hopkins (2-7, 0-1 MAWPC) Saturday morning by a score of 16-5. It then took the afternoon game against No. 14 George Washington (9-3), 13-8. On Sunday, the Crimson continued to roll, dispatching Mercyhurst (2-8), 18-5, and Salem, (5-7) 23-4.
Harvard carried its momentum from last week’s Princeton Invite into this weekend’s slate of dominance. The squad’s current win streak of nine games is one shy of the longest streak in college history.
An infusion of young talent has helped the team out to its perfect opening act.  Freshman Alex Bucur, who was instrumental on offense with nine assists on the weekend, credited the group’s success to upperclassman leadership.
“It’s been a pretty phenomenal way to start the year and I was lucky enough to join a team already loaded with talent,” he said. “All of the upperclassmen have been super welcoming and have helped me adjust to the collegiate level.”
Junior Jackson Enright kicked off the scoring against Johns Hopkins in the first quarter with a quick goal less than thirty seconds in, and Captain Charlie Owens continued to set the tone with another score less than a minute later.
The Crimson took a 6-0 lead before Johns Hopkins finally got on the scoreboard, and the team never looked back, cruising to an easy victory.
Owens had a hat trick in the match, as did fellow captain Austin Sechrest. Freshman Colin Le posted four steals, and sophomore Noah Hodge had another strong outing with seven saves.  He was relieved in the fourth quarter by junior Oliver Oz, who recorded a save in a strong showing.
In the second game, Harvard faced its toughest opponent of the tournament, No. 14 George Washington.
Again, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead, taking a four-goal advantage out of the first quarter, but the Colonials stormed back to cut the deficit to 7-6 in the second quarter.  Then Harvard pulled away and never looked back.
Freshman Gabe Putnam notched a hat trick, and senior Bennie Seybold tallied a hat trick of his own to go along with an assist and a steal.
As in last weekend’s tournament, the Crimson had an 8:00 a.m. start time on Sunday, but again the breakfast timing was no problem for Harvard’s early-bird attack, which ripped off fourteen consecutive goals before Mercyhurst broke through with a few seconds left in the first half.
Junior Dennis Blyashov racked up five assists to tie his career high in the game, and Owens and freshman Kaleb Archer both had hat tricks.
To cap off the weekend, the Crimson beat Salem easily, scoring nine straight goals to start the game. The defense held strong, surrendering just four goals, an output that Seybold matched all by himself.  Owens poured in yet another hat trick.
Oz saw plenty of action in the fourth match of the weekend and turned in a stellar performance behind Hodge with a career-high five saves.
On the weekend overall, Owens was the team’s scoring leader, with ten goals.
“We made some big steps forward this weekend on both ends of the pool,” said the captain. “Defensively, we did a tremendous job of staying disciplined and creating counter attack opportunities. Offensively, we were very patient and worked to create high quality opportunities.”
Bucur is looking forward to the team’s next showdown.
“Our next challenge comes in two weeks when conference play begins,” he said,  “so we’re going to keep grinding until then and throughout the rest of the season.”
Harvard will head to New Jersey to take on Princeton in its first conference match on October 14.
