After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the mystery that is Alice Munro’s writing, there is no straight road to a person’s fate. Reading a story from her latest collection “Dear Life” involves being rapturously subjected to a rapid-fire succession of often unplanned encounters between unfailingly recognizable small-town figures. For any two people, a certain climax may arrive on the horizon, but then the story slyly shifts to a new arrangement of characters. Minor figures re-emerge to assert unexpectedly significant roles, and relationships bloom overnight where others have run their course. Yet there is nothing cheesy about her moves. The surprises always retain the uncanny quality of our own experiences. In Munro’s clear, unvarnished words, “Dear Life” catalogues life’s bizarre, unanticipated results and sets them brimming with a poignant human appeal that for the most part makes up for the overly orchestrated direction of the stories.
The characters of “Dear Life” are continuously confronted with the unexpected. In “Haven,” a man who has kept tight-fisted control over his marriage finds himself losing control of his wife for the first time at a public funeral he has arranged himself. The young girl of “Night,” afraid of falling asleep and having evil dreams, begins sneaking out of the house to take long walks and one night runs into her father, who tells her unpleasant truths that, bizarrely enough, cure her of her bad feelings. And in “Amundsen,” a young teacher in a school for children dying of tuberculosis is surprised to find herself eloping with a man at least 10 years her senior, an old-fashioned doctor who in his stiffness is anything but a fairy-tale prince. But at the last minute, his overriding doubts and reservations prevent the couple from deciding to share happiness together.
“Amundsen” in particular, with all its heart-raking twists, may prompt the reader to wonder how people’s life plans are so easily discomposed. It is vain, Munro suggests, to expect someone to follow through on all their pledged allegiances. But on the other hand, life can be filled with the thrill and horror of unexpected change. Munro is equally skilled at surprising her characters—and her audience—with the ability of things to survive or retain part of their earlier identities. In “Dolly,” which makes a good bid for being the best story in the book, a 71-year-old woman breaks down in jealousy when her longtime 83-year-old lover pretends to be interested in another woman. He then embraces her and explains, “We can’t afford rows,” reminding her that their frail age prevents either of them from hurting the other any more than will the difficulties of life.
While Munro has marked off the last four stories in particular as part of a “Finale” section that is especially “autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact,” the truth is that in their common treatment of life’s capriciousness, all of her stories appear equally personal. They are uniformly imbued with Munro’s consummate control of plot development and her refusal to simplify relationships. In the introduction to this section, she calls the “Finale” stories “the first and the last—and the closest—things I have to say about my own life,” which seems tantamount to a literary deathbed statement. Her decision to label some stories as more autobiographical than others, though, threatens to interfere with the reader’s relationship with the fundamental unity of this collection.
Munro has her uncommonly dull spots, unfortunately most often in those works she has proposed to be “the closest” to autobiographical reality. Near the end of “Night,” a bit of weak writing shows up in the supposedly epiphanic discoveries of the precocious narrator: “People have thoughts they’d sooner not have. It happens in life…, ” says the narrator matter-of-factly, disappointed to learn that she is not the only one who thinks dirty thoughts at night. Munro tries here as usual to fashion a phrase containing great ironic profundity, but the fact that she leans on a trite expression like “it happens in life” undermines the originality of her claim. She ends up just creating an uninspired piece of writing.
Considering how many of these occurences there are in the final stories, it is regrettable that Munro has made the unnecessary gesture of setting aside some stories to be considered more relevant and possibly more important than others; none of the “Finale” pieces even rank as the best in the book. Perhaps it would have been best for her to recognize that all her stories equally express her own experiences and not let herself be weighed down with the pressure to declare their relevance to her personal past.
Despite this small shortcoming, the collection absolutely succeeds through Munro’s signature simplicity and surety. Munro has never been what one could call profuse or even overwrought in her alternately sidesplitting and heart-raking writing, and time has not dulled the intensity of her quiet observations. She writes salty prose with a hard grace. It isn’t sweet, but the irony is well controlled; it flows with a welcome generosity in dignified bumps, disfigurations, and homely awkwardness. In “Voices,” she describes with a refreshingly appreciative defamiliarization the town prostitute who shows off her arms so people can see that “the flesh on them was heavy and smooth and white, like lard.... I would not have thought it possible that somebody could look both old and polished, both heavy and graceful, bold as brass and yet mightily dignified.” Munro identifies and praises with ease the beauty of even the coarsest human subjects. No fireworks, no fancy language or neologisms—and yet she manages to articulate a voice that is unforgettably resonant and uniquely human.

About 150 years ago, the United States of America seemed irreversibly divided, led by a president accused of not only abusing executive power but also of being a capitulating bag of hot air. So goes “Lincoln,” Steven Spielberg’s masterful character study and thoughtful nod to the current bipartisan stand-off present in today’s Congress. With a predictably superb performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and despite the emergence of a few predictable tropes of the biopic genre, “Lincoln” is an evocative, nuanced examination of the man—not the symbol—who steered the country through the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment.
During the filming of “Lincoln,” Spielberg never addressed Day-Lewis as anything but “Mr. President,” and crew members were required to dress in 19th-century attire whenever on set. The result is a film that is truly immersing. From the opening scene showcasing the pure absurdity of close combat to the secretive meetings between members of Congress, there is a sense that “Lincoln” is not beholden to a fabricated agenda. It is an authentic cross-section of the public and private lives of the men who abolished slavery.
Of course, the dazzling all-star cast doesn’t hurt either. Day-Lewis—practically incapable of playing a character rather than becoming that character—shambles, rumbles, and gesticulates his way into the role of President Lincoln so effectively that his portrayal seems like it must be the only accurate one even though there’s no audio/video evidence to support any one depiction. Perhaps most importantly, Day-Lewis constructs Lincoln as a man with doubts, failings, and moral crises who was fighting a battle in his own home as well as in Congress. His most violent outbursts result from familial tension, as do his most heartbreaking moments, such as his soft mumble to his wife that “We must try to be happy.”
Even though Day-Lewis is allowed more complexity in the role of Lincoln, the supporting characters have their moments of depth as well. Sally Field effortlessly inhabits the fragile, unstable Mary Todd Lincoln and the clever, outspoken First Lady who greets members of Congress at a White House function and leaves them sheepish, chagrined little boys. Tommy Lee Jones, playing representative Thaddeus Stevens, is as endearingly disgruntled as usual, though a rare beam makes an appearance on his face towards the end of the film.
It is inevitable, however, that embedded throughout “Lincoln” are a few trite details that come with period pieces directed by Spielberg. As notes from a single delicate oboe begin to waft through the air, cuing a slow zoom into some character’s face, it is to be expected that a man with a powdered wig is on the verge of passionate oration. An overly simplified partisan dynamic is evident in the depiction of the historical House of Representatives, where the good, progressive Republicans are pitted against the bad, racist Democrats who inexplicably all look like Dave Grohl at various ages and with various beard lengths.
These pitfalls are easily overlooked in the grand scheme of a film that is expertly staged and paced. Though “Lincoln” leaps between locations and focal characters quite fanatically, the storyline and tone are never lost, and transitions remain smoothly executed. Spielberg artfully intersperses moments of droll humor into sequences that could otherwise be bogged down in political technicalities or lose themselves in melodramatic preaching.
As the film closes, slavery officially abolished and the Confederate States soon to rejoin their northern counterparts, it is hard not to draw parallels between Lincoln’s time and ours. “Lincoln” feels relevant in spite of its tattered Confederate flags and horse-drawn carriages; as ecstatic state representatives succeed in passing the 13th Amendment and cheering hordes pour out into the streets, a wearied leader is shown to be relieved but too exhausted to celebrate. The film is heavy on historical lessons, but it is also a hopeful reminder that couldn’t come at a better time: our country, when the moment comes, can achieve the historic if we are willing to work for it and willing to look just a bit farther than our own noses.

It often seems that modern music is strictly divided into two categories. There is music for surface enjoyment, like dancing and partying; then, there is music rife with meaning, meant to elicit an emotional response. And, the general rule continues, music nowadays is divided along genre lines: there is pop music, dance music, electronic music; then, there is indie music, folk, avant-garde. Electronic music especially is too often defined by its vapidity; it serves its purpose through its mindlessness.
That is, of course, a consummately untrue statement, and none proves that so definitely as Crystal Castles. In their third album, “Crystal Castles,” singer Alice Glass and producer Ethan Kath use tools that frequently power shallow dance songs to instead craft powerful emotional landscapes. Unfortunately, however, Crystal Castles do ultimately fall into the trap of their genre: while a few tracks are extraordinarily moving, others lack emotional power and seemingly blend together in their instrumentation and structure. Though these tracks are still danceable, for a duo as nuanced as Crystal Castles they are failures.
The opening track, “Plague,” seems at first quite strong. Its powerful, driven choruses, bolstered by the repeated declaration “I am the plague,” provide the album with its initial momentum; the more subdued bass-drum beat on the verses allow Glass’ shrieking vocals and lyrics to come through distinctly and lend a haunting quality promised by an album with track titles like “Wrath of God,” “Pale Flesh,” and “Child I Will Hurt You.” Whatever meaning “Plague” is able to convey, however, is rendered far less potent when its eerie qualities continue rather unbroken into the next track, “Kerosene.” The synthesizers and drums attack in the same stuttering, aggressive pattern, and the breathy vocals dominate the verses in both tracks.
The similar qualities of these two tracks would not necessarily be fatal if the pattern ended there. Yet “Wrath of God” continues to uphold the status quo of “Kerosene” and “Plague.” The track alternates between the same driven choruses and subdued interludes, and it seems to reuse the distorted, high-pitched vocal squiggles of “Kerosene.” The ultimate result is an emotional plateau.
Fortunately, the album is not without distinct successes. The most particular of these is “Sad Eyes,” paradoxically one of the most upbeat songs on the album. What is particularly impressive about “Sad Eyes” is that despite its upbeat nature it still manages to convey a distinct sense of melancholy. The rapid, consistent beat forms the backdrop to a clear, minor key synth motif and Glass’s emotive voice. “Sad Eyes” succeeds in conveying a deep sadness and single-handedly redeems the failure of the album’s beginning.
“Crystal Castles” also shines as a whole in some respects, particularly through the way the duo welds beautiful lyrics and vocal distortion together in order to increase the songs’ emotional impact. The lyrics to “Transgender” are often difficult to discern, but Glass’s sensual delivery, combined with Kath’s production tricks, make them potent and enjoyable. In lines like, “Will you ever preserve / Will you ever exhume / Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom,” Glass plays skillfully with the sound of the words themselves. This technique is arguably one of the greatest strengths of the album.
Crystal Castles is a group in an inherently difficult position: they are stylistically very much electronic, yet their music consistently transcends the stereotypical notion of genre. Thus, when they produce stereotypical electronic music, they have failed. Unfortunately, for a significant portion of their new album, Crystal Castles do just that: while the first few tracks on the album are catchy, they lack the extra emotional dimension that is so crucial to their success. The album, however, is by no means an unmitigated failure: the successes are truly successes and demonstrate what electronic music may accomplish.

Justin Bieber may get more headlines, but in the past year an even more talented Canadian singer has left his own trail of broken hearts. Abel Tesfaye, under the name The Weeknd, released three mixtapes in 2011 and made a significant impression on the R&B world. First came the well-received “House of Balloons,” whose amalgamation of jarring, synthesized melodies and echo-like vocals revealed The Weeknd’s daring genre-mixing style. “Thursday” and “Echoes of Silence” followed to similarly positive reception, with “Echoes of Silence” especially praised for the vocal emotion felt in songs such as “D.D”, a charged rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Dirty Diana”, and “Outside,” a sultry reminder of the discordance between wants and needs. Today, The Weeknd will be releasing his debut album “Trilogy.” The album will include remastered versions of all three mixtapes as well as three new songs that further expose the ugly side of love.
The Weeknd knows how to set a mood—whether it is through the steady pulse of an electronic bass drum or the high, lofty tones of his voice, he creates an atmosphere of heartbreak and longing. Factor in lyrics of sex, betrayal, and lost romance, and the darker facets of love are poignantly exposed. In “Montreal,” originally from “Echoes of Silence,” The Weeknd combines French and English lyrics with oscillating synthesizers to detail the hurt of past love and the lonely fleetingness of present affairs. He sings, “Oui j’ai pleuré mais ce jour-là / Non, je ne pleurerai pas” (“Yes, I cried, but this day / No, I will not cry”). It is a concerted, depressed effort to protect a once-battered heart.
The Weeknd continues to dismantle love’s archetype in “Valerie,” one of his new songs. Lies and deceit are the points of focus, as he sings, “Cause I love you and I need you / I only want you / And nobody’s going to know if it’s true.” Grating, electronic snare rumbles intermittently interrupt the gentle hi-hat groove and feather-light keyboard, creating an instrumental representation of the conflicting lies he tells and the “truth” Valerie chooses to believe. The relationship is exposed as a fraud, as he details his adultery and Valerie’s willful ignorance, all because “You’d rather this than be alone.”
The “Trilogy” is a welcome re-exposure to The Weeknd’s take on relationships. While he presents a seemingly depressing and unhopeful portrayal of love, his lyrics and unique instrumentals provide a refreshing, unrepentant critique on the classically extolled emotion.

As cyberterrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) boasts of his criminal exploits to James Bond (Daniel Craig), the MI6 agent—who is made subject to this sort of villainous braggadocio on a fairly regular basis—responds that everybody needs a hobby. “What’s yours?” Silva asks in response. “Resurrection.”
True enough, Mr. Bond. On several occasions in its 50-year history, the 007 film franchise has threatened to come to a close, only to make a sudden crowd-pleasing return. In recent years, financial troubles at MGM put the franchise in jeopardy again, but this film allows the serial to make yet another comeback. The narrativehas a few issues with unfulfilled story lines and navel-gazing, but thanks to a strong turn of performances from its principal actors as well as impressive visuals, “Skyfall” is a successful relaunch of the James Bond series.
“Skyfall” begins with Bond and a fellow MI6 operative by the name of Eve (Naomie Harris) in Turkey in pursuit of a stolen data drive that contains the identities of numerous undercover MI6 agents. When they fail to intercept the drive, it falls into the hands of Raoul Silva, an enigmatic figure who plans to use the information to enact a revenge on M (Dame Judi Dench), the head of MI6, against whom he holds an old grudge. At the same time, M and Bond have to contend with Gareth Malloy (Ralph Fiennes), a bureaucrat who arrives at MI6 in the wake of the failed mission and forces the two to evaluate the competency of the organization’s leadership.
With series veterans Craig and Dench alongside Bardem and Fiennes, there is no shortage of marquee actors in “Skyfall,” and they put their talents to good use. Although his Bond in this film is still the melancholic man he established over the last two films, Craig displayed a greater emotional range: he allows himself a wry smile as he engages in repartee with Eve or a look of exasperation when he realizes that he has to make a run from an exploding building. Bardem gives a memorable performance as Silva, the tortured villain of “Skyfall.” The role demands him to be at turns cold, manic, furious, and anguished, and Bardem embodies each of these moods effortlessly. Silva is a baddie who delights in rankling his foes, so his conflict with the characteristically calm, cool, and collected 007 is well-realized.
Dench’s M is another highlight of this film. She is still as cantankerous as she has been in her previous appearances, but she also shares some banter and moments of connection with Bond. Dench delivers her lines with a frankness that suggests something of M’s earnest conviction about her job and her principles. “To hell with dignity,” she says when Mallory suggests that she resign without seeing the Silva mission through. “I’ll leave when the job is done.” While Fiennes is unfortunately rather underused in the film, his role adds an extra layer of conflict between MI6 and Silva.
Apart from the high-quality acting, the movie looks and sounds beautiful. “Skyfall” takes place in a variety of locations, from sprawling open markets in Turkey to the misty hills of Scotland. Cinematographer Roger Deakins’ aerial shots of the locales help to orient the audience to each new environment that Bond must navigate. The action scenes in Skyfall are also pleasing to the eye. Early in the film, Bond gets into a motorcycle chase that escalates to him pursuing a villain down by riding across the roofs of Turkish houses. In another cleverly shot fight, Bond and an assassin tussle while lit only from behind by a giant LED display on a neighboring building so that the combatants can be seen only in silhouette.  The orchestrations of Thomas Newman also serve to add suspense to the narrative, and Adele lends her voice to the movie’s main theme, a defiant anthem that sets the tone for a film that is a determined resurrection against the odds. All of these aesthetic elements of the film make it a satisfying spectacle.
Unfortunately, the film is so stuffed with action that it has difficulty devoting enough time to certain plot details. When at the beginning of the film Bond appears to be shot by a sniper’s bullet and is announced dead by MI6, it should surprise no one that he comes back. Still, it is anti-climactic when after a few MI6 expository scenes, the film abruptly cuts to a random scene of Bond and a woman on a beach—a disappointingly mundane reveal. Another issue comes up when towards the end of the movie, a bit of Bond’s family history and childhood experience is discussed. But only a bit. Bond’s backstory could potentially make for an interesting topic of exploration for a Bond film, but because it has little bearing on the overall plot of “Skyfall,” its presence here is confusing and somewhat distracting. If Skyfall had managed its 145 minutes of running time more efficiently, it could have accommodated these narrative details without them seeming abrupt or out-of-place.
One thing that could have been deleted to make room for these storylines is the heavy-handed emphasis on conveying the film’s relevance. The new Q (Ben Whishaw) reminds Bond that the sorts of gadgets that used to constitute his arsenal are no longer needed. Mallory asks M whether or not she is holding on to Bond because of sentimentality rather than evaluating his objective merit. Even Silva gets in on this act when he mocks, “Is there any of the old 007 left?” And on more than one occasion, the characters in the movie suggest an answer: yes, Bond may be old fashioned, but, as more than one character in the film reminds us, “sometimes the old ways are the best ways.” In this manner, the writers engage in a sort of meta-dialogue with the audience by making some unsubtle nods to the ways that new entries in the Bond series might be received.  If this were something that happened only a few times, it might be a clever or endearing way to engage with the question of whether the franchise has maintained its relevancy. However, this dialogue rather quickly becomes so repetitive as to make the film appear desperate to justify its own existence. “Skyfall” is a good film, but if it did not waste so much time pleading its audience to believe that it can be a good film, it could be better.
Seeing Bond sporting a clean shave and preparing to go out to a casino, Eve remarks that he looks the very picture of an old dog with new tricks. The film could do without this clumsy posturing, but Eve is right to the extent that the film's relatively insubstantial flaws do not prevent the film from demonstrating that with some more modern trappings, a stellar cast, James Bond still has quite a bit to offer. If I am in as good shape at the age of 50 as 007’s franchise is, I should be very happy indeed.

Film and TV buffs might know Tim M. Hunter ’68 as a prolific director: among his credits are episodes of “Breaking Bad,” “Mad Men,” and “Glee” as well as films including “River’s Edge.” Devotees of Crimson Arts, on the other hand, are more likely to recognize Hunter as a recurring star of our What Were We Thinking? feature, in which we attacked his scathing reviews of “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Graduate.” Hunter recently took the time to respond:
"So I was an idiot – so sue me! I also said that Otto Preminger’s 'Skidoo' was the Best Picture of its Year! My best known Crimson pan, however, was my bad review of 'The Graduate,' which was picked up by Walter Winchell’s column when he wrote, roughly: 'Go figure! 500 Critics called this a Masterpiece and only One critic in the country hated it – Hunter at the Harvard Crimson!' Such is life – I still can’t watch 'The Graduate.' Now on the other hand, my '2001' rave was anthologized and we heard Kubrick carried it around with him for a while. I championed a lot of obscure films in those days that have held up well and hope I inspired folks to see more than 'Casablanca' and 'King of Hearts,' the reigning Harvard Sq. B.O. champs of the day."
Alongside Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” and Jean-Luc Godard’s “Weekend,” Hunter did indeed name Preminger’s “Skidoo” as one of the best films of 1968. Preminger, the director of movies including “Laura” and “Anatomy of a Murder,” doesn’t stick out in this lineup, but “Skidoo” couldn’t be more out of place. Today, it’s regarded as one of Preminger’s weakest efforts and little more than a bizarre artifact of the 1960s. And with good reason—this is a film that concludes with eccentric pop star Harry Nilsson singing the entire credit sequence, copyright information and all.
All that psychedelic excess didn’t sway Hunter. “The brilliant opening confirms beyond a doubt that Preminger’s art is visionary,” the critic raves. Not even Godard earned such glowing adjectives. Hunter does warn that “Skidoo” will polarize audiences, but we suspect this admission might just be a way to flaunt his proto-hipster contrarianism. “Most people hate [Preminger’s] films—I think he’s the only major American director working steadily today,” Hunter writes. Go figure.
Of course, Hunter’s praise seems also to have been influenced by the decade’s social climate. “The director comes out for sex, Hippies, drugs, all that’s good,” he writes. Those were different times indeed.

“Do you all want to hear an evangelical song or an Occupy song?” asked J. Michael Friedman ’97, the composer and lyricist for the Broadway musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” during a performance and discussion on November 5 in Farkas Hall. While the audience struggled to choose between the equally tantalizing options, Friedman just decided to play both. He began with the “Occupy song,” titled “Consensus is Fucking Hard,” which takes its lyrics entirely from an interview with an Occupy Wall Street protestor. The song addresses the movement’s notorious lack of vision in its opening lines—“What is the message, um, you know, um / I wish I could I could answer that question / I really do / I would like for there to be a message / I think a lot of people are working on that.”
“Consensus is Fucking Hard” exemplifies “investigative theater,” the style in which Friedman works with the New York theater collective the Civilians. The group, which Friedman co-founded, has written and produced musicals about topics including the 1871 Paris Commune, the sex scandal that surrounded evangelical pastor Ted Haggard, and the Atlantic Yards construction project in Brooklyn. Friedman’s work often builds off primary source material—interviews, personal experiences, and, in the case of the aforementioned “evangelical song,” actual emails from Ted Haggard to his Colorado Springs congregation before and after the scandal went public.
Friedman’s songs carry much of the burden of plot exposition in the Civilians’ plays, and as a result his lyrics have to convey a lot of information. “I tend to fit way too many words into a small space,” he said. However, when composing music to accompany such verbose, content-heavy lyrics, Friedman works to create compelling contrasts; for example, “Consensus” is built on a bouncy, vaudeville piano riff that brings out the sheer absurdity of the song’s lyrics.
“I think that songs are better when there’s a little bit of tension,” he said. “Sometimes, the music and the words want to be in total opposition to each other—if the music is happy and the words are sad, or vice versa, for example. In good musicals, there are always two things happening at once.”
Friedman came to musical theater relatively late—he claimed to have not even composed a song until he was 25. A classically trained pianist and cellist, Friedman concentrated in history and literature at Harvard and was a member of the Signet Society, but he did not get heavily involved with theater until he studied under Elizabeth Swados when she was a guest artist on campus. Swados, a well-known lyricist and composer, encouraged Friedman to work on student productions and, later, to get involved with New York’s theater scene.  Friedman’s studies at Harvard have since served as a major influence—he drew inspiration for “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” from a course he took on Jacksonian America.
“Bloody Bloody,” Friedman’s best-known show, shares the Civilians’ flair for appropriating and tweaking history: the musical recasts America’s seventh president as an emo rocker but still manages to hit all of his life’s major events, from his upbringing through his controversial presidency. Despite its historical scope, the show retains a zoomed-in focus on Jackson’s personal emotions, which Friedman claimed were eerily compatible with the modern emo movement. “Andrew Jackson is an emo guy because he’s really, really angry about everything for no reason,” Friedman said. “He’s got that constant teenage boy problem.”
“Also, he and his wife were cutters. They would actually ritually cut themselves,” Friedman added.
While largely historically accurate, the show’s songs frequently display an irreverent attitude towards history (see lines such as “James Monroe was a douchebag” and “I’m gonna fill you with populi-jism”). Friedman’s lyrics also reflect present-day America’s complex relationship with Jacksonian ideals—Friedman sees aspects of Jackson in George W. Bush, Barack Obama (“with all the hope-y, change-y stuff,” Friedman said), Sarah Palin, and the Tea Party movement. “At any moment, Jackson is like anything with electoral politics we live with today.... He’s everything about everything you’ve been reading for the past six months,” Friedman said.
Because of the show’s close relationship with the current political landscape and the recent election, Friedman said, he is not surprised at its success. “If you write a show about election cycles during a massive, terrifying election cycle, it turns out everyone will [stage] it,” he said.
In its resonance with contemporary politics as well as its punk rock aesthetic, Friedman said, the show reflects his tendency to take his theatrical subject matter in unconventional directions. “We tried to take a historical legacy and make it contemporary without worrying about it too much,” he said. “You immerse yourself in a world and try to figure out what that world wants the music to be.”

“This is the first recital we’re hosting that isn’t all classical,” says George C. Ko ’15, co-president of the Harvard College Piano Society. The group will hold its fall recital Thursday in the Kirkland Junior Common Room. “It’s kind of breaking this convention of, ‘Oh, it has to be Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart.’”
The HCPS, which remained largely inactive for several years but has recently enjoyed a revitalization, will instead present a program that celebrates the diverse uses of piano across genres. The recital will include jazz, a student composition, and Brazilian music performed by Co-President Allen L. Yuan ’15, among other pieces. “Piano is used in all different types of genres, and we want to bring that kind of color to our recitals,” Ko says.
When Ko and Yuan joined the club, which was founded in 2000, it had organized few events and had little campus presence for several years, Ko says. He and Yuan say they now lead a group with a mailing list of over 100 subscribers and an expected recital attendance of at least 50. George X. Fu ’13, who has been a member since last year, says there had already been demand for a revival of the organization when he joined. “I had a lot of friends who wanted the same thing, and this obviously had the support of a lot of faculty members,” Fu says. “But for some reason or other, the plan just didn’t align the right way, and it never really happened.”
With the initiative of Fu and former Crimson design chair Danielle Kim ’12, co-presidents last year, the HCPS began introducing new programs and reviving old ones: this year’s programming ranges from Berryline mixers to master classes with world-famous pianists. Members include students from the College as well as graduate students and even professors, and not all are piano players. “If you just want to come to our events, you’re all welcome; it doesn’t matter if you play piano or not,” Yuan says.
Maintaining its openness to newcomers, HCPS focuses less on performance than on appreciation, Ko says. The group fosters collaborative playing and improvisation in regular get-togethers, with a flexible attitude toward music that is reflected in the recital program. “We don’t want to be a source for competition, but a source for making music,” Ko says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m sitting across from playwright Christopher F. Durang ’71 in a vinyl booth at New York City’s Utopia Diner on Amsterdam Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Street. It is a familiar venue for both of us. The diner is a few blocks away from my apartment building, which was once the residence of one of Durang’s oldest friends and most frequent collaborators, Sigourney Weaver. It’s almost as close to Lincoln Center Theater, where Durang’s latest play, “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,” is receiving its Broadway debut.
This 63-year-old playwright—known for his blending of cruelty and comedy, reality and satire—is surprisingly serene. “On the outside [Durang] is such a sweet, smiley man, and you would have no idea that his mind is filled with donuts and dead babies,” says Genevieve Angelson, who plays Nina in “Vanya.” Torture, stillbirth, and crises of faith are all landmarks of Durang’s dark terrain.  But a shift has occurred at the heart of this American absurdist’s work. Durang’s recent work exhibits a new optimism. “Vanya” ends with the three Chekhovian siblings—Vanya, Sonia, and Masha—swaying their heads in unison along to The Beatles’s “Here Comes the Sun.” The happy ending is a tenuous one given the dynamic between the siblings, and it is a self-consciously stark contrast to Chekhov’s typical treatment of his characters. But the positive tone is much more than a comment on Chekhov: it represents a new direction for Durang’s style.
I have always admired Durang’s ability to depict characters who respond to feelings of sadness verging on horror with a bark-like laugh rather than simple tears. His new work still lies at this nexus of pain and laughter, but the darker tenor that I was initially drawn to as a playwright and an audience member is lightening. Durang is far from the only dark comedian in contemporary theater. What’s made him special for me is his ability to blend the poignant, preposterous, and tragic in a single style while also investing his characters with his own vulnerability. How can his optimistic turn preserve this delicate balance? In order to understand the shift in Durang’s approach, I decided to meet the man himself to ask him what’s changed.
CATASTROPHIC THINKING
Durang eyes the book on which my recorder rests in order to muffle the clatter of silverware against the linoleum tabletop. “Lamont Library, Harvard University” is stamped across the pages of the book—a collection of his works. Durang, who struggled with depression that crippled his ability to write during his time at Harvard, now has a place on the shelves of his alma mater’s library.
Durang has come to terms with the depression that threatened his undergraduate career at Harvard. At the time he was struggling with the loss of his Catholic faith and the discovery of his homosexuality. His rocky childhood was another psychological battlefield. Durang was born to an alcoholic architect and a homemaker—both Catholic—in 1949 in New Jersey. Due to a blood incompatibility, his mother suffered through three stillbirths. “I didn’t know back then why I was depressed, but you know sometime in later therapy I realized that it was…from my parents not being able to stop arguing, not being able to figure out how to live together and similar things happening with my mother’s extended family,” Durang says. “I had this thing as a child—I’m not sure if mantra is the right word—but this unconscious thing that nothing ever works out.’”
It took until junior year at Harvard for him to begin conquering his demons. After a promising start, however, he relapsed into depression and began skipping classes again. He often filled his time with watching films. “At Harvard I became so fascinated with movies. This actually sounds made up as I say it, but I think I saw a movie every day I was at Harvard,” he says. This love of films has informed a number of Durang’s plays and characters, including the manic housewife Luella, who uses movies and theater as a form of escapism.
In the summer of his junior year, Durang challenged his self-defeating behavior again. He got a job as a tutor and stayed in Cambridge in order to make up a poetry class he had failed the previous semester. “I fixed something,” Durang says. He cites this newfound confidence and his therapy at Harvard as instrumental to his upturn. Overcoming the writer’s block that plagued his earlier undergraduate years, Durang finally had his work performed at Harvard. “The Greatest Musical Ever Sung,” a spin on the greatest story ever told—the life and death of Jesus—was performed at his upperclassman house, Dunster. It received a positive review in The Harvard Crimson, though some students did not approve of the poster, which featured a pregnant Virgin Mary and a winking dove. Letters were signed against the play due to its irreverent tone. A Jesuit priest even wrote a letter to The Harvard Crimson calling Durang “a pig trampling in a sanctuary.”
The moral outrage provoked by “Greatest Musical” was only the beginning. Durang’s next play, “The Nature and Purpose of the Universe,” would gain him admission to a seminar with his favorite Harvard professor, playwright and scholar William Alfred, and Yale Drama School. But it also earned Durang biting criticism from those who felt his writing was senselessly cruel. “Some of my earlier plays really scared people,” he says.
BLACK AND BLUE COMEDY
“Nature and Purpose” was inspired by an actual acquaintance of Durang’s mother: a Catholic housewife in her twenties with five children whose husband forced her to have sex with him while he was drunk. “She went to a parish priest and said, ‘May I have birth control in case he rapes me?’ The priest was very nice, thought about it, and said no,” Durang says. “That was my idea of hell: her life.”
The world of the play’s protagonist, the constantly battered and belittled Eleanor, does resemble hell. “It was my version of the Book of Job but obviously very non-realistic and very gleeful, which is really strange. But I felt this enormous relief because there is such a distance from what I was writing,” Durang says. “You feel like, ‘I’ve made something sense out of something that was chaos.’” Though Eleanor’s suffering disturbed some, the absurdist tone makes this personal destruction palatable, if not entertaining.
Nicholas Martin, the director of “Vanya” who has worked with Durang on two of his other play premieres, believes that this tonality makes Durang a theatrical pioneer. “I feel like what Chris did along with John Guare and to some degree Albert Innaurato was to begin the American tradition of theater of the absurd, which began in France with Beckett and Ionesco,” Martin says. “I’m not sure they get yet the kind of recognition for starting the style of theater and kind of play that rivaled those European writers in terms of the balance of savagery and hilarity and the balance of reality and satire.”
This style is not for the faint of heart; though the plays can pivot from pitch-black to zany heights in an instant, they are still grounded in reality. “In Chris’ plays, you know, you can’t just have wacky sets and cartoon characters as I’ve often seen done. They won’t work that way,” Martin says. According to the director, embracing the—at times gleeful—violence is necessary. “You still have to have the savagery of Chris available to you,” he says. “It’s a tightrope in any of his plays.”
FLOORED HEART
When the tightrope is walked, Durang’s tone can achieve an accurate description of reality’s chaos. “Insanity is away of coping in this very harsh world. And I think it’s Chris’ way of getting truths out, by being very insane and funny,” says actress Kristine Nielsen, who has acted in three of Durang’s plays and currently stars in “Vanya” as Sonia. “The pain of the character is funny because it’s a recognizable pain we all have in trying to cope.”
I can still recall the first time I recognized this pain, to put it in Nielsen’s terms. In 2008, I saw Durang’s most famous play, “The Marriage of Bette and Boo.” Its genre-breaking marriage of hilarity and heartbreak will always remind me of moments in my life when I have wanted to laugh at how the answer to the question “Can this get worse?” is yes.
When he wrote “Bette and Boo,” Durang was a graduate student at Yale staying at Edward Albee’s residence for young writers. The play started as a writing exercise. Fellow student Innaurato recommended Durang write about his family. He did, but he intended it only to be an exercise and didn’t even change the names. Durang showed the play, at the time a one-act, to his professor Howard Stein, who in turn showed it to a director at the Yale School of Drama, who wanted to stage it. Durang consented and changed some of the names. He thought his family, based in New Jersey, would never hear about the New Haven production.
But Durang’s mother heard about a subsequent production in Princeton, New Jersey. His parents were always supportive of his writing, but Durang had his reservations about her seeing it. It’s not hard to understand why—the play is the most autobiographical of his works, telling the story of his parents’ relationship, his own upbringing, and his mother’s stillbirths. “When I was thinking about writing about the deaths of these children, I thought, if one wrote a serious dead-on version, it would seem like a TV movie. So I just found myself with no real thought to it, the doctor came in and dropped it. Then he gets to say, ‘Oh no, it’s not dead,’ which allows the audience to get over that shock the first time. The second time, when the baby now actually is dead, the audience laughs. But then they have a discussion about why it is dead,” Durang says.
The third and the fourth are not intended to be humorous. The sound of each “baby”—the Roundabout production employed sandbags to amplify the thud—hitting the stage registered more in my chest than my ears. Innocent Bette’s grief transforms her from zany to delirious. Her gravy-vacuuming, alcoholic husband Boo—the actual nickname of Durang’s father—fares no better. The only living child, Matt, attempts to a live a normal life between the thuds of each stillborn and watches the marriage disintegrate.
Durang’s mother wanted to see the play even after he showed her the script. She told Durang after the show that she enjoyed it. “She said, ‘I think you’re a little easy on your father. But on the other hand, he was sweet.’… And then she said, ‘But I think you got the rest of your family exactly right,’ which made me really happy because her family in particular always lived in terror of ‘Marriage of Bette and Boo,’” Durang says. His mother died of cancer before the full-length version was produced, making Durang especially grateful for her blessing.
In 1985, Durang had a personal and artistic breakthrough. He had acted in his own plays before, but given the autobiographical content Durang made a noteworthy decision to act in the play’s debut, directed by Jerry Zaks. He chose the role of Matt, his obvious stand-in. The play is fictionalized, but some scenes are lifted directly from his life. “The first preview while I was speaking, my voice choked up,” says Durang. “I was so startled. It had not happened in rehearsal at all.… I did ask Jerry Zaks if that was okay. He said, ‘That’s okay as long as you don’t stop. You have to keep going.’ It didn’t happen all the time. But that was powerful.”
I wasn’t alive to see that incarnation of “Bette and Boo,” to watch Durang essentially reenact crucial moments of his life under professional lights, uttering perfect, preassembled words. To write the contents of one’s life, let alone speak them in front of others under a thin veil of fiction, is terrifying to an emerging playwright such as myself. But this goes beyond therapy or catharsis for Durang’s sake. There was something larger at work when Durang spoke to the audience directly as Matt and said, “Bette passed into death, and is with God. She is in heaven where she has been reunited with the four dead babies, and where she waits for Boo, and for Bonnie Wilson, and Emily, and Pooh Bear and Eeyore, and Kanga and Roo; and for me.”
“I found his performance in that so affecting that I didn’t really talk about it much with him,” Martin says. “The end of that play affected me more than almost anything I had seen in that period of my life.”
HOW TO END IT ALL
Durang tries to recall which character from “The Canterbury Tales” he chose for an assignment he had to make up during his rough patches at Harvard.
“Knowing you, it had to be the Wife of Bath,” I say.
He replies with a grin, “You’re right.  You’re absolutely right.” (I silently rejoice at my nerdy feat.)
At some plot point between his academic struggles and this moment in Utopia Diner, the Broadway playwright and co-director of the Juilliard playwriting program—to which I may someday apply—fleshed out his dark, brutal streak and tempered it. “I do think in my early plays I had a very nihilistic view of life, and it really came out an awful lot in my plays,” Durang says. “So the people who either felt the same or just went along for the ride liked it, but other people felt disturbed while the play didn’t actually say, ‘Yes I know this is serious.’ So that part of me seems gone now.”
After our interview, Durang—a self-described “agnostic question-mark” even after all he has been through and all the Catholic jokes—will go home to his house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and his partner of over 20 years, John Augustine. But before he does, I have to ask him about the optimistic ending of a recent work that gives me the most trouble.
“Why Torture is Wrong and the People Who Love Them” follows Felicity, a young woman deeply fearful of the dangerous stranger, Zamir, whom she married while possibly drugged the night before. Felicity’s crackpot conservative father maims Zamir, who is suspected of terrorism, but Durang has the characters erase prior events in order to get a chance at a happy ending. “I thought there is no way I can keep going in this direction without this play being a downer,” he says. “So Felicity says, ‘I don’t want to be here anymore,’ and he says, ‘In the play or in life?’ and she says both. And then I decided I wanted to go back and say, ‘What could we do so this doesn’t happen?’”
When I saw The Public Theater’s production of the play, I felt cheated by how Durang had the characters undo prior events in order to get a chance at a happy ending. But in context of the arc of the Durang’s career, if not his life, it all makes sense. There is a type of courage in this newfound optimism. Durang, who still possesses his Catholic schoolboy manners even if he writes characters who stuff hedgehogs up their vaginas, does not cite a single personal event as responsible for this transition. And while Durang’s life does not follow the solid plot structure plays do, a lifetime of self-exploration—performing in “Bette and Boo,” overcoming the trauma of his childhood, and decades of therapy—all contribute to the newly bright light being cast on Durang’s dark matter.
He asks me whether mental health services are still free at Harvard. I reply that I believe they are.  “I can’t tell you how helpful I found talk therapy,” Durang says. “I still get depressed sometimes but that isn’t my life at all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Life is a cabaret, old chum—come to the cabaret!” sings Sally Bowles (Maya M. Park ’16), but her invitation to the Kit Kat Klub in gritty 1930s Berlin turns out to be only partially tempting. In this HRDC production of the Broadway musical “Cabaret,” the song and dance numbers in between scenes serve as a welcome reprieve to the occasionally heavy-handed delivery of the narrative by the cast. Although the Emcee (Alexander M. Willis ’14) and the back-up dancers are only meant to guide the story along, they end up stealing the show with witty line delivery and well-choreographed routines. Sadly, their performances leave the sections regarding the relatively flat narrative standing in the shadow of the excellent dancing.
“Cabaret” revolves around the relationship between British dancer Sally Bowles and young American writer Clifford Bradshaw (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15), who fall into unlikely companionship as both struggle to find their way in a rapidly changing Berlin on the eve of Hitler’s rise to power. However, the real vivacity in the play is provided by a cast of erotic dancers in lingerie—or, for the men, pants, suspenders, and a healthy dose of lipstick—all expertly choreographed by Hazel A. Lever ’13.
Crucial to this musical is the interaction between the dancers and the audience. To achieve the atmosphere of a genuine nightclub, stage manager Sally M. Castillo ’14 banished the barriers between stage and audience by arranging the seats around tables, complete with red velvet tablecloths and flickering electric candles. This part-grimy dance club, part-late night comedy club feel sets the viewers up for a night of slapstick laughs, and in this respect the show certainly delivers. In one scene Cliff quips, “I was in a fight last night. You should have seen the other three guys… not a mark on ’em!”
In the fashion of a true 1930s nightclub, the music in the show is provided by a live band that shares the stage with the actors. While the music is a fun way to bring life to the Kit Kat Klub, Park’s solos in songs such as “Mein Herr” are mostly incomprehensible, as her words are drowned out by the saxophone even though she hits every high note flawlessly. Although Park takes center-stage in this particular song, she fails to attract the viewer’s attention—all the spectacle occurred against railings along the ceiling, where the other dancers twisted and contorted in an intriguing fusion of modern dance and more traditional jazz moves reminiscent of the “Cell Block Tango” in “Chicago.”
The musical truly captivates only during the interludes with these dancers. The Emcee’s segments bring a bit of lighthearted fun to the show’s tense anti-semetic themes without diminishing their effect. One memorable sequence acts as a plea for equality in all forms of love: homosexual, interracial, or otherwise. The Emcee sings to a gorilla in a tutu, “If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn’t look Jewish at all!” Another song, “Money,” involves a troupe of homoerotic dancers and women in lingerie grasping the Emcee’s body in an orgy of near-cannibalistic lust, and Willis’s playful winks and sensual swagger dominate the stage. His Emcee is perfect—we’re never quite sure of his orientation, but we’re always left gasping for more.
One of the Emcee’s strengths is his ability to exaggerate without caricaturing the German accent. This is not true of some of the other cast members. In one scene as Herr Schultz (Ari D. Brenner ’14) proposes to Frau Schneider (Taylor K. Phillips ’15), the over-the-top accents detract from an otherwise serious scene, which poses the question: Are the bad accents intentional or just the result of poor acting? Willis is the only actor in the play who truly manages to pull off the faux-German accent without it being just irritating.
Fortunately, this fault does not define the show. By the last scene, Venook manages to bring life to an otherwise uninteresting performance. His character’s unfailing moral compass leads Cliff naturally away from Nazi ideology, and his love for Sally blinds him to her faults—nothing special here. However, Venook’s shining moment occurs in the final song, which acts as a trilingual close parenthesis on Cliff’s time in Berlin. Through his body language and his subtle intonation of voice, he manages to communicate his sudden and shattering rift with Germany and Sally, both of which he once loved. Harkening back to the first song of the musical, Cliff sings, “Wilkommen, bienvenue, welcome,” leading, finally, to the Emcee concluding, “Auf wiedersehen, à bientot, goodnight,” a simple, sad tilt of the head to an “all good things” mantra.
“Cabaret” is an adventure and a mostly enjoyable one, even if its finest parts had little to do with the storyline at all. There  are certainly some great one-liners in the narrative script, but unfortunately their delivery is lost amidst the force of the spectacle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As college students, and as small-“d” democrats, we are thrilled that young voters turned out last week to cast their ballots at the same high rate as in 2008. After a sharp decline in the 2010 midterms, about half of all voters between the ages of 18-29 participated in the election. What’s more, young people made up a higher percentage of the electorate in 2012 than in 2008, coming in at about 19 percent. The high level of youth turnout in 2008 could have been a one-time fluke—and many thought it was. Yet, to see it repeated suggests that we are perhaps entering an era when the youth vote makes up a significantly higher portion of the electorate than in the past—closer to 20 percent than the traditional 15.
This is all good news to us, as it should be good news to anybody who wants a participatory democracy. Yet sadly, this and other trends in high voter turnout are bad news for Republicans, and that’s just their problem. No party can establish for itself a viable future if that future hinges on low turnout among young people and minorities. It is not only morally wrong, but also futile. Perhaps due to social media, or some other lurking variable, it looks like higher youth turnout is here to stay. Also, the African-American share of the electorate has so far remained at its high post-2008 level, and the Hispanic share is growing. For the sake of two-party democracy, Republicans must reform to broaden their appeal.
One of the great puzzles of this election season was why Republican pundits and pollsters were so wrong. Some predicted a Romney landslide, while others conceded a narrow electoral victory for Obama. In fact, it was an Obama electoral landslide, which more than a few nonpartisans saw coming. The reason for the mistake, as identified by right-leaning pollster Rasmussen Reports, was that “we expected [the minority share of the electorate] to remain relatively constant. However [it increased].” In short, Republicans not only wanted a return to the pre-2008 electorate, but they also deluded themselves into seeing it on the horizon.
But by now it is clear that such a return will not come. With Democrats now taking over 90 percent of the black vote, over 70 percent of the Hispanic vote, and over 60 percent of the youth vote—and with each group’s share of the electorate growing—Republicans have no choice but to broaden their appeal. We hope this appeal comes through the kind of thoughtful internal deliberation and triangulation that led to Bill Clinton’s moderate 1992 candidacy as opposed to the sort of insulting pandering that brought us vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin (as a ploy to win female voters) and former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele (as a ploy to dent Democrats’ hold over the black vote). This may mean that Republican decision makers need to forsake the more hard-line elements of their party to stay relevant to the American center. It can be done, and Democrats have had to do it in the past. Now it is time for the Grand Old Party to take a crack at it.

Over the past five years, voter turnout in the Undergraduate Council Presidential election has ranged from 30-54 percent. This is comparable to our peer institutions, but we can do better.
It’s so easy to vote. There are no age restrictions, no four-hour lines, no absentee overnight shipping costs, and no voter registration forms. Voting takes less than two minutes from the moment that you receive the link in your inbox to the moment that you cast your ballot.  When you think about it, you spend more than two minutes waiting in line to get your food at Flyby, to leave Lamont Library, or to get through the Science Center Plaza construction. Even as time-pressed Harvard students, we can all find the time to vote in this UC election.
This UC election is unlike many in recent campus history. In addition to voting between four tickets for UC President and Vice President, you also have the opportunity to vote on three referenda that address large campus issues. Do you support Harvard divesting its endowment from the fossil fuel industry in order to avert further environmental and human rights crises due to climate change? Do you agree that Harvard College should re-examine its sexual assault policies and practices? Do you support creating a social choice fund within Harvard's endowment, thereby providing an opportunity for donors to choose whether their contributions to Harvard are invested for positive social impact? The four tickets and three referenda provide an unprecedented opportunity to directly engage with the UC election and to express your voice to the Harvard community and administration.
As students of Harvard College, we have an obligation to be active members of our Harvard community. Whether we can usually be found in the classroom, our houses and dorms, or out in the larger Cambridge community, Harvard’s academic and social policies directly influence our college experience. There are many campus issues at stake in this UC election: academic integrity policies, library hours, shuttle times, dining issues, sexual assault and disciplinary policies, House renewal, final exam hours, student organization funding policies, career resources, investment practices, and administration accessibility. If you care about any of these issues, please vote in the UC election starting Tuesday at noon!
You may be asking yourself: Why would I vote in the UC elections if I don’t understand how it impacts my daily life? For starters, the next President and Vice President will be leading all 49 elected House and Yard representatives, as they seek to improve all of our student experiences. They won’t change everything in a year. As we know, change at Harvard moves through a slow, deliberative process, but it is important which initiatives are prioritized. The UC leaders define the issues that the UC works on for the next year. You should vote for the ticket that prioritizes the campus concerns relevant to you.
Perhaps you are worried about committing to one candidate’s platform. A vote is not a be-all and end-all endorsement, but rather an expression of who you’d prefer to lead the UC next year, and a commitment to the Harvard community. At the end of the day, remember that the leaders of your representative student government are committed to representing you and your peers.
Every vote makes a difference. Every vote represents the stance of one student stakeholder. With four tickets and three ballot initiatives, your vote will have an immediate, visible impact. Demonstrate to your peers and the administration where you stand on these issues.
Students do have power here on campus. We can be as powerful as we want to be. You may choose to spend your personal energy as part of the UC or not. It is by no means the only outlet for student power. However, if you don’t vote, then our collective strength loses power. If you don’t vote, then the student voice diminishes. If you don’t vote, then you aren’t deciding who will help lead the fight in the UC for your issues and concerns.
Voting is only one of the many ways of affecting change here at Harvard. Just look at the three student coalitions leading referenda this semester. They have been able to engage over 700 students each around these important campus issues. All students have the potential to help voice our concerns.
Your concerns are important. Your voice is important. Your community is important. Your vote is important. Please take two minutes and vote in this election.
Vote for UC President/Vice President and the three referenda at uc.fas.harvard.edu from noon on Tuesday, November 13 to noon on Friday, November 16.
Carolyn W. Chou ’13, a sociology concentrator in Pforzheimer House, is President of the Phillips Brooks House Association. Danny P. Bicknell ’13, an environmental science and public policy concentrator in Mather House, is President of the Undergraduate Council. Jenny Ye ’13, a computer science concentrator in Kirkland House, is President of the Institute of Politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of my time at Harvard, the word "administration" represented an amorphous body of nameless people who make decisions that affect me without consulting me. I had no idea where they worked, let alone to whom I could go to with my concerns.  After three years on the Undergraduate Council, the dust had settled a little: I knew where University Hall was, had a few uneventful conversations at the Office of Student Life, and could attach some names and faces to titles.
One year ago, I ran for UC Vice-President as part of a ticket to "build community at Harvard by advocating for student voices and financing the undergraduate experience." What UC President Danny  P. Bicknell ’13 and I wanted to do was bridge the communication gap between students and the administration, hoping to  leave UC office with a Harvard administration more transparent and accessible than it was when we were elected. In conversations around campus, one perpetual question remained unanswered; how can students effect change and be engaged with campus issues if they simply don't understand or have access to the governance structures at the College and University level?
As we traded in life as students to living in University Hall (there were days when I literally camped out in the lobby area between meetings) to make our vision a reality, Danny and I realized that the struggle for effective student advocacy was two-fold: It required understanding the complexities of Harvard's decentralized governance structure as well as establishing opportunities for direct dialogue between students of all levels of engagement and the administration. So that's what we did.
To increase the administration’s accessibility and transparency, Danny and I have spent the past year working with the Associate Dean of the College Joan Rouse to create a public organization chart of Harvard's governance structure. A significant part of the student advocacy struggle is simply finding the relevant administrator. Navigate Harvard  is an online organization chart of Harvard College Administration and relevant bodies available to students so they can directly contact the relevant administrators to address issues of concern and create avenues for student advocacy.
To provide opportunities for student voices to be heard and to foster direct dialogue between students and administrators, we've developed an online petition tool WetheCrimson. Undergraduate students can create petitions on issues relevant to the campus and other students can "like" or sign the petition with the understanding that the three petitions with the highest number of likes each month will receive a direct response from the Dean of Harvard College, Evelyn Hammonds, and an opportunity to meet to discuss the initiative in person.
In order to facilitate multiple avenues of structured dialogue between students of all levels of engagement and administrators, we have also developed opportunities for in person dialogue with various administrators. We recently held a joint Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate Council meeting with President Drew Faust to discuss university-wide student advocacy. We also held a Governance Panel, the first open college-wide discussion with panelists representing all of the major College decision-makers to elucidate governance at Harvard for UC representatives and other students. If you simply want to know that the deans are people too, you can have lunch with them through the UC Meet the Dean Luncheon Series, upcoming faculty-administration book talks, or fireside chats with Dean Hammonds.
When I first joined the UC, only the President and Vice-President interacted with administrators. Danny and I did not want that to be our legacy. Relevant administrators now come into UC General Meetings on Sunday to discuss issues such as mental health, safety, and sexual assault policy so that the entire Council understands how to go about representing constituents and effective advocacy. UC committees now directly meet with the relevant Deans—the Education Committee just had a two-hour meeting with the Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris—so that representatives can directly brainstorm opportunities for improving student life and affect realistic change.
As you are inundated with UC President/VP campaigning this week, please consider what you are looking for in campus leadership. Elections are always surrounded by the tension between pragmatic solutions and revolutionary ideas, but effective advocacy works within the system while simultaneously critiquing it. The UC President and Vice-President’s success is directly tied to the UC’s ability to understand the issues of undergraduates and thereby influence the College's decision making-process.
A year of numerous daily meetings, task forces, working groups, 50-plus page reports, and lengthy discussions have developed a greater degree of transparency and accessibility of Harvard governance for students, opened multiple avenues of direct communication, and strengthened bonds between UC representatives, leadership, and the administration. It is the responsibility of the next UC President and Vice-President to allow students to capitalize on these resources and inspire confidence in the UC for undergraduates.
University Hall has opened its doors. It's your turn to enter.
Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, a human evolutionary biology concentrator in Dunster House, is Vice-President of the Undergraduate Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here at Harvard, an education isn’t just about what we learn in class, but also about the incredible classmates and faculty we have the opportunity to learn from and get to know during our short four years here.
It is easy to get caught up in the former half: successfully completing papers, problem sets, and projects, yet failing to take the time to get to know the faculty who are not only experts in their fields, but are also mentors here to encourage us and offer advice as we embark on our academic and life journeys.
Why, then, don’t more people take advantage of the opportunity to get to know professors outside the classroom? Some say they are too busy, or think they have nothing to talk about with their professors, or haven’t done their class readings, or are too intimidated.
Throughout my time here, I have challenged myself to get to know one professor each semester, and this has led me to unexpected places and unexpected opportunities: from reporting in Rio de Janeiro, to visiting Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, to the set of Good Morning America.
While I have mainly gotten to know professors through classes I have taken, my friends Kristiana C. Laugen  ’13 and Sarah E. Farrell ’13 have established relationships with professors through research assistantships.
Laugen got her research assistant position for Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Michael Luca through the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations, a 10-week program that allows undergraduates to work closely with HBS professors. “I think the reason our relationship has been so good is that I have been fearless about reaching out to him,” Laugen reflected. “In turn, he has been very receptive to meeting with me.”
Even if you don’t get offered a research position, there are other, more unconventional ways to connect with professors. “I had happened to stumble across an article examining potential business models for sustainable cities by Robert G. Eccles a few weeks after my summer internship,” Farrell explained.  “It was a shot in the dark, but I looked up the email address for Professor Eccles in the HBS directory and wrote to him, explaining my interest in sustainability and desire to help out in his research.” Professor Eccles and Assistant Professor George Serafeim took Farrell on as a research assistant, where she helped write, research, and interview for a case study on Intel Corporation's decision to introduce a new platform in India that allows for monitoring and demand management along water distribution networks. She has worked on two more case studies since and is now helping with his latest book.
For Jirka Jelinek ’14, establishing a lasting connection happened by chance, thanks to his academic advisor. “He noticed that I put down 'Haiti' as one of my areas of interest and researched Haiti-related opportunities on campus before our first meeting,” Jelinek recalled. It was from him that I found out that Michele Pierre-Louis, the former Prime Minister of Haiti and director of an NGO called FOKAL, was coming to Harvard as an IOP fellow for the fall semester.” After being a student liaison for a semester for Pierre-Louis, Jelinek worked for FOKAL last summer in Haiti, and he still keeps in touch with Pierre-Louis. “This has been one of my best experiences at Harvard…I feel very honored to call Ms. Pierre-Louis my mentor.”
Something as simple as inviting a professor to a faculty dinner is enough to start a friendship. “I've had the opportunity to get to know Professor Ahmed Ragab of the history of science department and the Divinity School,” Jordan T. Haviland ’13 said. “I'm taking my second class with him and invited him to faculty dinner along with a few other students. It was a great opportunity to get to know him better—like discovering he is a big baseball fan and how he chose his academic path.” Since their initial conversation, Ragab has given Haviland constructive advice and feedback on his thesis.
If you haven’t yet, think about taking advantage of the other half of your Harvard education by reaching out to one of your professors this semester—and follow up with them afterward. Whether it be a faculty dinner, going to office hours, applying or asking to be a research assistant, or just lingering to ask a question after class, it’s easy. In the worst-case scenario, you and your professor don’t hit it off, but at least you tried. In the best-case scenario, you may just form a lasting connection and enriching relationship with someone that has the ability to take your academic journey to a place you never imagined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With support from groups ranging from the Harvard Republicans to the Harvard Vegetarian Society, Undergraduate Council candidates Michael C. George ’14 and Nicole E. Granath ’15 have lined up the early endorsements of several campus organizations, which they hope will give them a crucial leg up when students begin voting Tuesday.
Fifteen student groups­—many of which have personal ties to one or both candidates—have already thrown their support behind the ticket, far more groups than are backing any of their rivals.
But opponents warned against reading too much into the endorsements, saying many campus organizations had yet to choose a candidate, and that they were hoping they would soon receive backing as well.
“We’re going to continue to solicit endorsements,” said candidate Spenser Goodman ’14, who has yet to receive any student group backing. “We’re not going to change our platform. Hopefully people are receptive. We’re just being who we are.”
Yesterday George and Granath secured the endorsements of Latinas Unidas de Harvard College, the Harvard Parliamentary Debate Society, the Chess Club, and Harvard National Model United Nations.
George is the undersecrtary general of the group’s general assembly. The ticket also picked up the backing of International Relations on Campus, the Harvard Program in International Education, and the LowKeys, an a capella group.
But it remains to be seen whether such endorsements will actually swing any votes.
George said he was picking up student-group support because of his platform, which calls for structural changes to the UC and improved communications.
“The reason an organization endorses is because they believe in our platform,” George said.
“It most directly impacts life for student groups, which is why we want to try to represent a broad range of student groups.”
One early-endorsing group that didn’t go George’s way is the Harvard College Law Society, a group for pre-laws whose more than 100 members make it one of the largest student organizations on campus.
After an extensive process of five meetings and a club-wide vote, the team of Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 won the unanimous backing of the society’s board.
“We sent in votes by email. It worked out for me because Jen is my little penguin in Quincy House. But no one in the Law Society knew that,” said Marygabrielle Prezioso ’13, the co-president of the group.
As Raghuveer continues to meet with clubs and organizations, she said she finds the process of working with clubs to be a helpful step in preparing to hold a UC office.
“The best part is meeting face to face with the leaders of student groups in the context of their board and what concerns them the most,” Raghuveer said.
“It is a constructive exercise for us in thinking about how our coverage will address student needs.”
The duo of “Tara and Jen” said they see club endorsements as especially useful to freshmen, who can learn about the candidates through organizations in which they are involved.
The team of Akshay Sharma ’14 and Akanksha Sharma ’14 have been meeting with several organizations, but they expect to hear the clubs’ final verdict later in the week.
The endorsement systems vary depending on club size and membership, Akanksha Sharma said.
“A lot of student groups choose not to endorse; it’s divisive because members of the board often support different candidates,” Akanksha Sharma said.
Groups that have yet to choose a candidate include the Harvard Democrats, which will hold a debate Tuesday at 8 p.m., and the Black Students Association, Black Men’s Forum, and Black Women at Harvard, which are co-hosting a debate at 9 p.m.
Adan Acevedo ’13, president of the Harvard Democrats, said the debate would play an important role in their choice.
“As the Harvard College Democrats, we like to hear from our elected leaders, from Professor Faust down to who’s running for UC,” Acevedo said.
“We want all members to be able to ask questions about what each candidate will actually bring to the table.”
“Also, the Dems have picked the winner every time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though University President Drew G. Faust has named a campus-wide student center as a priority in the University’s upcoming capital campaign, a recently launched $10,000 Undergraduate Council initiative hopes to offer students a shorter term solution for social space on campus.
This Saturday, the UC began soliciting submissions for student design proposals to revamp existing, underutilized spaces on campus.
“It’s a very short term, high impact project,” UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 said. “This is $10,000. The money’s there.”
The project, first announced in April, is a collaboration between the UC, the Harvard College Dean’s Office, and the Happiness Project—a student group that has previously organized the transformation of the third floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles into a wellness center called the “HappyNest.”
The Council has contributed $7,500 to the competition’s funding, while the Dean’s Office will provide $2,500, according to UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13.
Students can submit their ideas online until Nov. 21, after which a committee comprised of members of the UC and the Happiness Project will judge the submissions.
The top two ideas will be put to a student-wide vote on Dec. 3. The prize of $10,000 will go to making the winning design—or designs, depending on cost—a reality, Bicknell said.
UC Student Life Committee Chair Michael C. George ’14, the project’s leader, said he hopes the competition will help improve the on-campus social scene at Harvard.
“I think Harvard has a very fractured social scene, and I think social spaces are something Harvard students care about a lot,” George, who is also a Crimson news editor, said. “My hope is that this competition and renovating a new space will open up more on-campus opportunities to students who don’t have access to off-campus spaces.”
Plans for the Social Space Competition began last spring when Happiness Project founder Leslie R. Rith-Najarian ’12 first approached members of the Council about creating an interactive space on campus dedicated to stress relief.
Together, the groups recognized that, instead of creating a new social space from scratch, they could use already existing spaces that had been previously underutilized.
Bicknell said the Social Space Competition in a sense seeks to “inspire the next Cabot Cafe”—a student-operated coffeehouse in Cabot’s E entryway that opened in 2011.
Happiness Project member Jordan L. C. Ashwood ’13 said the group sees the competition as a way to encourage students to improve their mental and physical health as well as create social spaces on campus.
“This competition is really focused on the need for social spaces that incorporate this element of well-being,” Ashwood said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 14, 2012, at 3:48 p.m.
While Harvard’s new concentration options in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and architecture studies seemingly lend themselves to distinct career paths for undergraduates, professors insist that they are not purely pre-professional and do align with the College’s liberal arts philosophy.
“Not everyone wants to have a pre-professional degree,” said History of Art and Architecture professor Alina A. Payne. “What people don’t realize is that [architecture] is not something only architects care about. We are all involved in architecture.”
Previously, HAA lacked certain technical aspects of traditional architecture programs, such as studio classes. Students would trek to MIT to fill this gap in their education, whereas now they can attend studio courses at the Harvard Graduate School of Design just around the corner.
According to Payne, the architecture studies curriculum prepares students for careers in architecture, as well as many other disciplines, including biology, environmental sciences, and government.
Similarly, HAA Director of Undergraduate Studies David J. Roxburgh noted that architecture studies is not as pre-professional or “instrumentalist” as other architecture programs.
Nonetheless, many students are choosing architecture studies to follow professional interests.
HAA concentrator Jack A. Pretto ’14 said that he believes the architecture studies track leans pre-professional, despite the fact that students will need to pursue further graduate education “to do real practice in architecture.”
“Harvard seems to be so anti-pre-professional, and yet this architecture track seems to be attracting pre-professionals,” he said.
Likewise, Benjamin Lopez ’15 just declared as an architecture studies concentrator. He voiced a strong desire to become an architect, adding that he was drawn to the “pre-professional aspect” of the concentration.
Yet, like Payne, he also remarked that architecture studies primes students for careers in fields outside of architecture.
“It prepares you, but it doesn’t limit your options,” Lopez said.
HAA concentrator Camille Z. Coppola ’14 said that the track is not inherently career-oriented.
“I don’t think that having a creative approach to academics is necessarily pre-professional,” she said, adding that theory and classroom work will still play a role in architecture studies.
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has also introduced new concentrations in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.
“There was a pent-up demand for this,” said Professor Joost J. Vlassak, who serves as the director of undergraduate studies for the new mechanical engineering concentration.
Vlassak said that the new concentrations maintain Harvard’s emphasis on a liberal arts education by providing students with flexibility in course selection.
Christopher J. Lombardo, assistant director for undergraduate studies in engineering sciences, also said that the new concentrations are not pre-professional, pointing out that many engineering concentrators head to careers in finance, policy, and other fields.
“Engineering is a way to teach analysis and quantitative skills,” he said. “We teach the same skills and higher reasoning that [other departments do] but in a quantitative way.”
Many engineering concentrators say that these new concentrations do not mark a movement in a more pre-professional direction.
“Engineering at Harvard I would not call pre-professional,” said electrical engineering concentrator Scott E. Crouch ’13. According to Crouch, “just like any discipline here,” engineering incorporates liberal arts thinking and employs an “appropriate mix of theory and practice.”

To offset an operating budget deficit, Harvard University Dining Services has implemented a dining restriction at Harvard Hillel that will curb the number of non-Jewish students eating at the kosher dining hall.
A sign went up on Friday at the entrance of the dining hall, limiting admittance to only those who are “a member or an invited guest of Harvard’s diverse Jewish community.”
“The most important part of Hillel’s mission is hospitality,” said Harvard Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg. “[The restriction] creates conflict with our inclusive and welcoming environment, but I understand HUDS’s concern about its budget.”
Preparing kosher meals at Hillel costs twice as much as preparing other meals in House dining halls, according to Steinberg, who has been in communication with HUDS.
HUDS Spokesperson Crista Martin declined to comment.
The sudden change to the dining restriction has created confusion and even some uproar among students.
“Nobody is happy about it,” said Arun A. Viswanath ’13, former president of Hillel’s steering committee. “This is not a question of who is Jewish and who isn’t, but more about how HUDS is going to pay for the meals.”
Viswanath added that some students are actively protesting the restriction, while others are waiting for the news to settle and planning discussions around the issue.
“It’s very unfortunate that HUDS has to deal with the deficit,” he said. “But I can’t say I support the restriction because it conflicts with our mission.”
Likewise, Sara Kantor ’14, the current president of Hillel, said the decision was an “unfortunate one.”
Kantor, a Crimson arts editor, also added that she worries about some students interpreting Hillel as an exclusive institution.
“This is hard to understand without context, but we want to emphasize that Hillel is an inclusive, open community,” she said.
On any given night, Hillel attracts anywhere between 90 to 145 students, Steinberg said. Because Hillel is “not a community that has a membership card,” Steinberg said that he does not know the exact breakdown between Jewish and non-Jewish students.
Despite some concerns, other students said that they see the restriction as being reasonable.
Hideko Tachibana ’13, a non-Jewish student who frequents Hillel about once a week, said that even though she is disappointed about the restriction, she admits that the dining hall gets very crowded during dinner.
“Hillel is for people who keep kosher, so it’s unfair that those who need it for religious reason can’t get food,” she said.
Tachibana said that she probably will not be dining at Hillel anymore.
Likewise, Jennifer K. Cloutier ’13, who is not a member of the Jewish community, said that those who keep kosher should have a priority in getting food at Hillel. But she said that Harvard should put in extra money to make all dining halls inclusive.
“I want the Harvard community to be an inclusive environment,” she said. “That is the type of culture where I want to be.”
Alex J. Lopatin, a second year graduate student who keeps kosher, said that the restriction would “ensure that [kosher food] is not raided by people who have no interest in being a part of or learning about the Jewish community.”
“We would like a community that is centered around Jewish students,” he said. “We are not just a branch of Annenberg with a Jewish star.”
The restriction, however, raises questions about Muslim students who keep halal.
Ana R. Nast ’12-’13, the president of Harvard Islamic Society, said that a lot of people in the Muslim community go to Hillel for its food. Though she said she cannot gauge the impact of the restriction on the Muslim community because she has yet to talk to people at HUDS or Hillel, she anticipates that she will be able to work on the issue.
“HUDS has been receptive in the past working with us to make sure we have resources in the dining hall, and we have a  close relationship with Hillel,” Nast said.
Steinberg added that “Hillel dining hall is a safe and welcoming place for Muslim students.”
Though the sign limits dining hall access to members of Harvard’s Jewish community, both Viswanath and Steinberg said it is unclear how HUDS will enforce the restriction.
“I don’t know how you could visually single out individuals as belonging or not belonging in a community,” Steinberg said. “I just hope we will work out a way with HUDS to make Hillel both a cost-efficient and a welcoming institution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the general electorate, classifying members of Congress often means naming a party—Democrat, Republican, or Independent.
But elected representatives also ally themselves with a number of smaller, less formal groups. The Congressional Black Caucus has 43 members. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is comprised of 21 Hispanic Democrats. The Blue Dog Coalition has 24 fiscally conservative Democrats.
For Harvard’s Washington lobbying apparatus, the most significant grouping may be the Harvard delegation—the group of congressmen with degrees from the University. With the addition of 14 Harvard alumni elected last Tuesday, the ranks of the crimson congressional contingent grew to 43, a marked increase over the 34 alumni who were members of the original 112th Congress.
Harvard relies on its lobbying efforts for everything from securing federal funding for research to promoting immigration reform. Harvard’s D.C.-based Office of Federal Relations, which coordinates the University’s lobbying efforts, makes an effort to keep members of Congress apprised of University happenings as well as Harvard’s stances on policy issues.
“It’s always useful to get some additional input on issues that matter to the University,” says Congressman John P. S. Sarbanes, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988. “I think the fact that I attended school and have some understanding of what the priorities are and what the efforts are... it’s helpful to hear from people who have that.”
The existence of a Harvard delegation gives the University a special inroad into Capitol Hill, allowing its lobbyists to appeal to a small group of legislators not just as politicians, but as Harvard alumni.
HARVARD TIES
Members of Congress with Harvard degrees say they feel deep ties to their alma mater—something reflected in their interaction with Harvard officials and the University as a whole.
“Our alumni who are in Congress are in many ways like our alumni in other professions in that their time at Harvard was formative to them and their degree from Harvard is a big part of their identity,” says Christine M. Heenan, Harvard vice president of public affairs and communications.
Four congressmen interviewed for this article say they maintain a sentimentality for their time at Harvard and keep in touch with other members of their graduating class.
“For me, being in Boston and being at Harvard was a good experience that I’ve carried a positive feeling about,” says Sarbanes, who returned to Cambridge last week to lecture at the Law School.
Members of Congress who return to campus often receive special attention from Harvard’s Office of Public Affairs and Communications, the department that also oversees Harvard’s lobbying efforts.
“We’ve had everything from members of Congress who are visiting campus with their children say, ‘Can you connect us with the folks from admissions for a tour’ to ‘We’re going to be speaking at the IOP, can our press office interact with yours?’” says Heenan.
Sometimes members of Congress are reluctant to publicize their Harvard connections. “I think most people in elected office hide their affiliation with Harvard because it doesn’t make [them] popular,” says Congressman Jim H. S. Cooper, who graduated from the Law School in 1980. “There’s a certain arrogance associated with Harvard people.”
“Never mention it because it can only hurt you,” he says of how politicians often manage their ties to Harvard.
Despite ambivalence that some politicians feel about their Harvard affiliation, the Office of Federal Relations has not faced difficulties in making connections with legislators.
“I think it’s up to members how they portray their backgrounds and their affiliations with various organizations and educational institutions,” said Casey.
“We’ve never had any difficulty scheduling meetings because of an affiliation issue.”
LOBBYING
For Harvard, lobbying is a serious task that goes beyond fostering connections with alumni.
The University spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on lobbying in an effort to encourage members of Congress to vote favorably on issues such as federal funding for research and student aid.
The University spent $350,000 on lobbying in the first two quarters of FY2012 alone, according to public filings made with the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Harvard Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey says Harvard uses an “educational” approach to discuss policy issues with members of Congress.
“We want to inform members about how important policies would impact students and faculty and research and the kind of things that are important to our mission that the federal government is partner on,” says Casey.
According to Congressman Brian M. Higgins, a graduate of the Kennedy School, the time he spent at Harvard underscored the importance of research funding.
“It informs what your priorities are as a member of Congress,” says Higgins.
When contacting its alumni, Harvard often tries to find creative ways to connect graduates with their alma mater.
Last March when the Harvard men’s basketball team made it to the first round of the NCAA tournament, Harvard tapped into the enthusiasm surrounding March Madness and sent Harvard NCAA apparel to the offices of Harvard alumni in Congress.
When Faust was invited to give a lecture in Washington D.C., the University hosted a reception with some members of the Harvard delegation on the guest list.
During her trips to Washington, Faust makes an effort to reach out to Harvard alumni whenever possible.
When making her pitch for higher education, she says alumni connections to the University allow her concerns to take on a “vividness” and “circumstantiality” that might not exist for congressmen who did not attend Harvard. Harvard is also a good starting point for conversations.
“Usually Harvard alums have something they remember and want to talk about,” Faust says.
But, while talk can be pleasant and entertaining, Faust remains mindful of the goal of Harvard’s interactions with legislators and the conversation quickly switches to business.
“They often will ask questions about things going on on campus, and that does create a bond,” Faust says. “But also, it’s fun for me to be able to tell them something about higher education by focusing on the Harvard context.”
Still, these efforts do not dictate legislation directly.
Kennedy School graduate and Maryland Congressman Christopher Van Hollen says that though his time studying at Harvard has influenced how he approaches policy, Harvard’s positions on issues do not necessarily affect his own political stances.
“I think my experience at the Kennedy School was very helpful in shaping how I think about certain public policy issues,” he says.
“But look, if you’re asking me about whether the position Harvard takes on issues influences [me], I’d have to say no.”
Both Faust and Heenan say that while alumni connections make it easier for them to bring up issues facing higher education during conversations with Harvard graduates, alumni in Congress are only a small piece of the puzzle.
“We would never begin and end our advocacy in Washington with the Harvard delegation,” says Heenan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the smell of biryani wafting out the door, members of five different faith groups gathered for a common purpose Monday, breaking a day-long fast to raise money to fight childhood hunger.
Thirty students and recent graduates participated in the fast, which ended in a potluck dinner in Ticknor Lounge featuring falafel, Indian food, tacos, salad, and cookies.
“What does unite all of us is the theme of fasting: In the Jewish religion, the Islamic religion, the Mormon faith, fasting is a part of the religion,” said Muneeb Ahmed ’14, the Harvard Islamic Society’s director of external relations, who initiated the event with the goal of encouraging interfaith dialogue.
Students from the Latter-Day Saints Student Association, Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, Harvard College Interfaith Council, and Harvard Hillel also participated in the fast.
By the end of the night, participants had pulled chairs into impromptu discussion circles, eating platefuls of food and asking each other questions about the role of fasting in their faiths.
Brad R. Talk ’13, a former Mormon missionary to India who took part in the fast, said going without food played an important spiritual role in his religion.
“We believe that it’s a time of introspection, a time of prayer, and a time to set aside the carnal desires and to focus on our spirit and our spiritual progression,” he said. “All the meals that we missed, we take the money we would’ve spent on the meals that we missed, and we give it to a fast offering, and that offering goes to help the poor.”
Yamna Anwar ’16, a member of Islamic society, said her religion viewed fasting as a way to improve one’s character.
“It’s really a spiritual cleansing,” said, Anwar, who fasts for much of the day every Monday through Thursday.
“You make yourself a better person through fasting. You remind yourself of these principles, such as not to lie or to give to the poor.”
Organizers put a box by the door for donations to Save the Children, a nonprofit group for children in the developing world.
As he helped introduce students to one another and keep the conversation flowing during the dinner, Ahmed said he wanted to host similar interfaith events in the future.
“It’s a good way for students to come together from all across Harvard’s campus,” he said. “When they talk to one another it makes the entire environment of the campus better and it provides each of us with something to ponder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard, like many governmental and private institutions, observed Veteran’s Day on Monday this year, professors and students were still expected to follow their normal schedules.
Still, some members of the Harvard community found time to honor America’s servicemen and women.
On Monday morning, a small group of Harvard affiliates gathered on the steps of Memorial Church for a brief ceremony.
After the Harvard LowKeys sang the national anthem, Harvard Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter gave a short speech praising the dedication of America’s armed forces.
“We pause to honor those who have served proudly and with great courage and sacrifice,” Porter said. “Their willingness to serve, the bonds that bind them to their fellow soldiers and sailors are strong and precious.”
The crowd then observed a moment of silence before dispersing.
Elizabeth L. Malkin ’13, vice president of the Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative, said that her group organized the brief ceremony to give Harvard community members an easy way to honor the nation’s military men and women.
“We wanted to do something easy and accessible so even those people who may not have a lot of time would be able to show their appreciation,” Malkin said.
Elsewhere on campus, Harvard affiliates found other ways to honor America’s veterans.
Bethany A. Kibler, a tutor in Cabot House who is also a U.S. Army veteran, organized a screening on Monday of “The Invisible War,” a 2012 documentary that examines rape and sexual assault in the United States military.
After the screening, Kibler spoke candidly about her own experiences in the U.S. Army in a short question-and-answer session.
“I firmly believe that honoring our armed forces and submitting them to healthy critique are not mutually exclusive,” Kibler said in an interview after the event.
While some administrators and staff had the day off, Malkin said she was disappointed that the University did not extend the holiday to all Harvard affiliates.
“Serving in the military is one of the biggest sacrifices a person can make,” Malkin said.
This year the Nov. 11 holiday fell on a Sunday, but was observed on Monday.
Classes will again be held on Veteran’s Day next year, but will be canceled on the holiday in 2014 and 2015, according to the academic calendar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some political alliances are born out of necessity.
But Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Spenser R. Goodman ’14 and UC vice-presidential candidate Darren C. McLeod ’14 have been friends since before freshman year.
Before they even formally matriculated to the College, they were scrubbing bathrooms for Dorm Crew. Later that year, they would be working side-by-side as freshman UC representatives.
Now, the pair is teaming up again, this time in a bid to run the student government organization that they joined together two years ago.
“It was never about the title,” Goodman says, describing his ambition to fill the top role. “Since day one of freshman year, this is what we’ve been working towards and what we’ve been working on. This is a chance for us to take what we’ve done and what we want to do and make real, lasting changes for the school and for the UC.”
Their platform is concise and, in some ways, strikingly bold.
Goodman and McLeod focus on three goals to bolster a higher objective of expanding social life on campus: reforming the UC’s social programs committee, restructuring the UC’s committee system, and encouraging administrators to change social life policy.
But Goodman emphasizes that these changes to campus life would expand beyond “dancing and parties,” adding that he and McLeod would work to promote sporting events, concerts, talks, and plays.
“We have a different vision for the direction that the Undergraduate Council should be going,” he says.
“The other three tickets are all very similar. If you took their names off of their platforms, they would be the exact same, and no one would be able to identify any differences. They are all on one side, and we are on the other.”
THE PLATFORM
For Goodman, it’s all about the specifics. Goodman says that social life at Harvard is not—but should be—the highest priority for the UC.
In drawing up their platform, Goodman and McLeod say that he deliberately tried to choose achievable reforms to the governing body.
“We are really committed to seeing a change in social life here at Harvard,” Goodman says.
Goodman and McLeod see the Social Programs Committee as the primary vehicle for this change.
The committee, which they would reinstate, would consolidate the functions of many other extant UC committees, overseeing a budget that the organization could deploy to host events on campus.
“Many don’t agree with this, thinking that the UC is responsible for student advocacy, not social life,” Goodman says. “We do not believe this is the case. Darren and I believe social life is the key factor in the happiness of students.”
Goodman argues that for this initiative of improving the social atmosphere on campus, the UC will need to engage students in the process of determining what these events should be.
“Darren and I would encourage other students to bring in ideas themselves. We will point them in the direction of the right resources and people to make their plans come to fruition,” he says.
To support these social events, Goodman and McLeod discuss revamping the UC Finance Committee, which provides more than $400,000 each year to student groups. In the ticket’s platform, this committee would be center-stage of the UC’s functions.
“Right now, this Finance Committee is only 20 percent of the UC—we want to center the UC around the finance and social program committee,” Goodman says. “It’s going to be easier for student groups to come in, to get their money faster, to have their questions answered about the process.”
THE PEOPLE
They may have only just started campaigning on a platform to revitalize campus life, but Goodman and McLeod have been training for this objective throughout their time at the College.
Goodman says he has been involved in almost every mid- to large-size student-run social event on campus since his freshman spring, including chairing Yard Fest last year and organizing an all-school dance two years back.
Goodman is currently planning an all-freshmen dance for the weekend of the Harvard-Yale game. He says he hopes it will be a “safe and fun and inclusive” event for freshmen to attend in light of Harvard policy restricting large-scale House parties.
It is difficult to see where Goodman even finds the time for himself to wind down­—a varsity swimmer, Goodman manages a difficult schedule. But friends say they do not doubt his ability to manage his time, if he were elected UC president.
“He’s definitely busy, but he’s someone who really knows how to prioritize. [The UC presidency] would really mean so much to him, and I think he would put that first,” Christy L. DiSilvestro ’14 says.
McLeod, a peer advising fellow and a tutor in Allston, is similarly connected to the student population. McLeod’s roommate Gashaw Clark ’14 says that “it’s impossible” to walk with him. “He stops and talks to every single person—whenever I would go on a walk with him, I just felt like he knew everyone.”
But for Goodman, it’s all about the impact. “We want to make sure that every student feels happy at Harvard and part of a bigger community,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing in Tercentenary Theatre on a bright autumn day, Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Tara Raghuveer ’14 gazes straight into the camera as she declares, “It’s the UC’s imperative to start asking students what they want.”
Were it not for Widener Library in the background, it might be easy to mistake Raghuveer’s polished campaign video—which features originally composed music and carefully scripted appeals—for one of the political ads that flooded the airwaves this election season.
Raghuveer’s spot is indicative of the tightly executed campaign that she and her vice presidential running mate Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 have led since they began preparing for the race in early September.
As of Friday, the two UC insiders had recruited a core team of 20 members, an official staff list of about 70 people, and an unofficial list of about 220 campaign volunteers. And, they say, their campaign team continues to grow every day.
As they face off against three other tickets, Raghuveer and Zhu are hoping that their organized campaign, diverse experience, and promise to make the UC more relevant will be enough to win them the election. If they succeed, the UC will be run by two women for the first time in four years.
FROM PREFROSH TO THE PODIUM
Sitting side-by-side in Cafe Gato Rojo, Raghuveer and Zhu have an easy chemistry that they say dates back to their first meeting during pre-frosh weekend in 2010.
Raghuveer, who sports thick-framed glasses that take up half her face, speaks with confidence, sometimes deferring to Zhu as they discuss their platform.
In turn, Zhu, who maintains a constant smile even while talking, credits Raghuveer for frequently making her laugh.
Raghuveer and Zhu say that their friendship has been solidified by serving together on the UC, working into the late hours of the night studying statistics, and participating in the Institute of Politics’s Women’s Initiative in Leadership program.
But the two women also emphasize the diverse personal backgrounds and achievements they bring to the ticket.
Raghuveer, a social studies concentrator living in Currier, says she is most proud of her student advocacy work.
After joining the UC in her sophomore year, Raghuveer lobbied representatives of the Harvard Management Company to speak directly to students at a town hall event last spring.
For her part, Zhu—a Quincy resident, pre-med student, and joint concentrator in government and sociology—emphasizes her achievements in data collection.
A UC representative since her freshman year, Zhu created a mid-year survey that was sent out to students to solicit suggestions and to increase awareness of UC initiatives.
DEMANDING RELEVANCE
Raghuveer says that she and Zhu spent a full five weeks debating ideas before they settled on their final campaign platform: making the UC more relevant to students’ lives.
The duo points to last year’s UC presidential election—which saw a voter turnout of just over 40 percent—as indicative of student apathy toward the UC.
Raghuveer and Zhu say that their slogan, “Demand Relevance,” reflects their desire to find ways to make the UC matter in the Harvard community.
“We use the word ‘relevance’ instead of ‘action’ because we can’t act as a body without being relevant here,” Raghuveer says.
As part of their proposed reforms, they plan to combat what they describe as a culture of speculation on the UC, in which representatives have little actual knowledge of student concerns.
To this extent, they have proposed a new initiative called “Harvard Thinks, Harvard Changes,” which would add referendum questions to the start-of-semester registration tool and the end-of-semester Q Guide to give students a forum to voice their suggestions.
Campaign supporters say that the ticket’s emphasis on relevance is a winning platform.
Kemie U. Iko ’14, Raghuveer’s blockmate, says that she had little interest in the UC before Raghuveer and Zhu began their campaign.
“Not only do they have big picture ideals, but they also give concrete examples of how the UC can make a change, which is important for me as someone not very invested in the UC,” Iko says.
LADIES WHO RULE
In recent years, the UC has sought to rectify a gender imbalance that in 2010 saw women make up less than a quarter of all UC members.
Following this fall’s election, 42 percent of UC representatives are female.
Despite this progress, Raghuveer and Zhu represent the first all-female presidential ticket in four years—a distinction that Raghuveer recently noted by publishing a Spotify playlist titled “ladies who rule” in honor of the campaign.
The duo says they have the experience to continue making the UC a more welcoming place for women.
Zhu, who was the only female UC representative from her freshman class, led information sessions and campaign workshops for aspiring UC representatives this fall to encourage greater gender equality on the Council.
“There is still so much work to do in that department and we want to be leading that change,” Zhu says.
But though Raghuveer is proud of her all-female ticket, she says she does not want students to vote for her and Zhu simply because they are women.
“We want people to vote for us because we have the best ideas, we are the best ticket, and we happen to be females,” Raghuveer says. “That is the vision we have for female leadership at Harvard and beyond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 16, 2012, at 5:42 p.m.
At the Undergraduate Council presidential and vice presidential debate last week, running mates Akshay M. Sharma ’14 and Akanksha Sharma ’14 clarified to a smattering of chuckles: “We’re not related. We’re not dating. We’re not married.”
The two Sharmas are simply close friends who, they say, share a vision for the future of the Harvard community as well as a surname.
Akshay and Akanksha’s friendship began even before they came to Harvard, when they met at a college interview during their senior year of high school.
Since then, the two have come to share Cabot House as a home, performing arts as a passion, and mutual friends as supporters for their student government presidential campaign.
Michael J. Chilazi ’14, who has known Akshay and Akanksha since their freshman year, describes them as “those people that you come to Harvard to meet: students with unrelenting passion, genuine empathy, and big hopes.”
Those aspirations stand behind their campaign slogan, “Ignite”—a message meant to kindle excitement about an Undergraduate Council that “can and should do more.”
SPARKING SOCIAL LIFE
As the epicenter of student life at Harvard, student groups should interact more to foster a greater sense of community on campus, the Sharmas say.
To help, they propose creating an email list for group leaders and a forum for working together in person.
As a representative of the Phillips Brooks House Association said at the UC debate, the most pressing issue for these groups is often the acquisition of funds from the UC.
Akanksha attributes the funding difficulties that newly formed student organizations face to the complicated process of applying for grants online.
Maura D. Church ’14, a member of Speak Out Loud, a spoken word poetry organization that was officially established a year ago, agrees.
“It has been very difficult to put on events, get rooms reserved, and get support...because we have so little money,” she says in a Facebook message, adding that she supports the Sharmas’ campaign because she believes they will alleviate the problem—not to mention the fact that Akanksha is her roommate and she is in a long-term relationship with Akshay. “I believe Akshay and Akanksha have the experience and the fire in their bellies to get it done.”
To demystify the funding process, the Sharmas say they will hold office hours to teach student organizations how to use the grant portal.
Student organizations are also taxed by a lack of social space, says Akanksha, who played a large role in the creation of Cabot Café.
She says the key to turning new and underutilized spaces into valuable environments for socializing is to “get students to care about the space.” In the case of the café, that meant student involvement in the selection of food, music, and art.
To further ease social life on campus, Akshay and Akanksha say they will demand a more standardized and lenient party policy that allows for spontaneity.
“You shouldn’t have to register a party three days in advance. We are college students, and our party policy should reflect our lifestyle,” Akshay says.
PUTTING OUT FIRES
Beyond student groups, Akshay and Akanksha say they will take on a host of topical issues.
“Focusing on mental health, sexual health, safety—these are the things that the UC needs to be doing on a large leadership level, because these are the issues that really affect students,” Akshay says.
But their platform includes few concrete proposals for making the Council involved in these areas.
“There are a large number of issues that are messy and intangible, that don’t have a defined set of steps that you can take to fix them,” Akshay says.
“Those are the issues that we really want to tackle, because those are the issues that the UC has been avoiding.”
Supporter Rebecca J. Margolies ’13 says that the Sharmas’ dual priorities—supporting student social life and fostering well-being on campus—go hand in hand.
“This school can feel fragmented and lonely, and Akshay and Akanksha are dedicated to changing that, to making Harvard a place where everyone can feel welcome and belong,” says Margolies, a fellow Cabot resident who is also an inactive Crimson photographer.
That desire to make people feel at ease spreads to the Sharmas’ vision for the Council’s inner workings and its relationship with administrators.
Akshay says that as a UC representative since freshman year, he has noticed uncomfortable competition between UC representatives, something he hopes to tamp down.
He also says the relationship between the UC and the administration has historically been tense and adversarial.
During the debate, he commended current UC President and Vice President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 for taking steps to correct this approach.
Akshay said he would continue to build ties between the UC and the administration “so that they can work with us instead of working against us.”
While the Sharmas’ goals may be in some cases far from inflammatory, supporters believe that the ticket can accomplish its mission of cooling the flames of competition while heating up social life.
“When it comes to elections, and especially those of a collegiate nature, my major concern is that all tickets talk a lot of talk,” says Chilazi.
“My confidence in Akshay and Akanksha rests firmly in their commitment to the promises they make and the hopes they share. For them, winning the race is only day one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Michael C. George ’14 is not shy about comparing himself to another successful presidential hopeful.
According to the biography section of his campaign website, “As a biracial Hawaiian who has lived in a Muslim country, and whose father works in Kenya, Michael will provide a copy of his birth certificate upon request.”
Like his U.S. presidential counterpart in the weeks leading up to Election Day, George and running mate Nicole E. Granath ’15 say they have come to eat, sleep, and breathe this election.
Both say they have devoted their lives to this campaign in the last few weeks, although George concedes that he sleeps about 4 hours per night, and “sometimes you still have to eat and write essays.”
Despite the grind, George says he has enjoyed the process of campaigning in the last week.
“Living it has been a thrilling experience,” he says.
George and Granath, who are campaigning under the name G&G for UC, are running on a platform of bringing students together around campus-wide issues.
The duo says their diverse backgrounds lend their campaign both the know-how and the vision to effectively lead the council. While George has served as UC secretary and the chair of the Student Life Committee, Granath—a sophomore and the co-coordinator of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition—is not a UC member.
“This ticket is out of the ordinary,” George says. “Usually it’s two UC insiders on the Executive Board and two juniors.”
THE COUNCIL VETERAN
George, a government concentrator in Quincy House and a Crimson news writer, was elected to the Undergraduate Council Executive Board as a freshman.
He says his long-term experience—he is the only current committee chairperson running—has allowed him to “see the inner workings of the Council” and taught him what does and does not work.
As a freshman, George worked on then-president Senan Ebrahim’s proposal for a Forum for Change, an initiative to bring together students, faculty, and administrators to discuss campus issues that never got off the ground.
“As the only chairperson running, I’ve had to deal with these issues on the ground level,” he says.
Since then, George has successfully pushed several initiatives through the council.
“He’s been in charge of pretty much every UC initiative that the student body has heard about,” said Raul P. Quintana ’14, the campaign’s deputy campaign manager and a Crimson editorial writer. “The shuttle survey, extended hours for Lamont—everything that’s actually affecting us as students, he’s worked on.”
Though George currently serves as the chair of the Student Life Committee, his roommate Kyle E. Rawding ’14 says George believes that the work of the UC should not stop at student life issues.
“Compared to other candidates, he has visions for the UC that are much bigger,” Rawding said. “He has a lot of plans to try to expand the ambition of the UC.”
According to Quintana, “That’s where Nicole comes in.”
THE NEWCOMER
Both members of the G&G ticket say that Granath, an engineering concentrator in Currier House and a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority, would bring a new perspective to the UC.
Granath serves as the co-coordinator of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, an advocacy group that pushes Harvard to take environmental, labor, and other social concerns into account in the management of its endowment.
So far, over 35 Harvard student organizations have endorsed the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.
“Before they started, no one cared about how Harvard managed its $32 billion endowment,” George says.
Through her work with the Coalition, Granath has met with University President Drew G. Faust twice—more times than George in his three years on the council.
“She has more advocacy experience than anyone else,” Quintana says. “She has experience engaging the broad community as a whole.”
This ability to mobilize and engage students as well as administrators makes Granath an invaluable running mate, according to George.
“The heart of our campaign is about uniting students behind big issues,” Granath says.
G&G FOR UC
The George and Granath team plan to use their diverse backgrounds and experiences to focus on university governance, student life, and finance.
George and Granath’s platform focuses on their hopes to “rebuild the UC from the ground up” through initiatives including overhauling Harvard’s social spaces, standardizing the alcohol policy, reforming campus-wide events, and amending the UC constitution to improve the procedure for funding student groups.
“I think our mindset is that obviously a lot of these issues are going to be tackled on a long-term basis, but its our responsibility to start those conversations and start that ball rolling so our successors will have that base off of which to build,” Granath says.
Friends and campaign staff say that George and Granath’s enthusiasm and energy would help make these larger goals a reality.
“When he’s passionate about something, he doesn’t stop until he sees what he wants, and I think that’s something that the UC needs,” says George’s friend Kefhira F. Pintos ’14.
George and Granath say they are excited to put that passion into practice.
“This is our University, and it’s our experience,” Granath says.  “So it’s what we make of it and the legacy that we want to leave here on campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fencer Jerry Chang’s impressive showing in the Garret Penn State Open may have earned him The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week honors this week, but a medley of other athletes turned in excellent performances as well, earning them acknowledgment on the runners-up list.
Jimmy Vesey, Men’s Hockey
The freshman forward is quickly becoming a vital part of Harvard’s offense and is on pace to become the Crimson’s top scorer; six games into the season, he leads the team with seven goals—three more than the next-highest scorer. The rookie netted three of those scores this weekend, giving Harvard one of its two goals in the 6-2 loss to Union and tallying his other two in the 4-0 shutout of Rensselaer. Vesey scored the final two goals against the Engineers, one off of his own rebound, to help the Crimson pull away from its opponent and break a two-game losing streak.
Kendall Crawford, Women’s Swimming
The women’s team had a record-breaking day at Cornell’s Teagle Hall Pool as it took down its first Ivy opponents, the Big Red and Big Green. The freshman contributed one of the eight records of the day, posting a blistering time of 55.04 in the 100-yard backstroke, a time that surpassed both the pool record and the Harvard record, previously held by Megan Leddy. Crawford also swam the backstroke leg of the 200-yard medley relay, contributing to the first-place team finish of 1:45.25.
Novice Eight, Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew
The newest rowers of Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew have had a dominating start to their careers, finishing the fall season without a loss.  The novice eight wrapped up its competition in the fall with a victory at the Foot of the Charles, racing the 2.5-mile home course in 13:41.5—over 20 seconds ahead of the second-place Boston College crew. With this final regatta under its belt, the novice division has cruised through its first collegiate races, outpacing its competitors by an average of 17 seconds.
Maksim Korolev, Men’s Cross Country
Korolev will be joining the women’s cross country team at the NCAA Championships after his stellar performance at the Northeast NCAA Regionals earned him an individual bid to the championships. The junior flew through the 10k course in 30:16.2, averaging less than five minutes per mile, good enough to snag second place out of a field of 239 runners. Korolev’s performance, along with that of teammate junior James Leakos, catapulted the men’s team into a sixth-place finish out of 39 schools.

When the Harvard men’s basketball team takes on Holy Cross at Lavietes Pavilion on Dec. 22, the Crimson will attempt to earn a fifth consecutive victory over the Crusaders. Harvard came out on top, 73-64, when the two teams met last year on Nov. 15, 2011.
But despite the Crimson’s recent dominance of the Crusaders, last season’s contest was closer than the score indicated. The game was tied, 34-34, at the half, and Harvard found itself up only four points with seven minutes remaining before a late run put the game out of reach.
The main contributors in the matchup will be very different than last year’s, as key players from both schools are no longer with their teams.
In last year’s campaign, most of the Holy Cross production came from guard Devin Brown and forward R.J. Evans, who led the team in season scoring and netted 17 and 13 points against the Crimson, respectively.
But although they lose Brown and Evans, the Crusaders return most of its core team this season. Both junior forward Dave Dudzinski and sophomore guard Justin Burrell, who started every game last year and were third and fourth on the team in scoring, will likely account for a good portion of the team’s offense.
Dudzinski, who led Holy Cross with 6.0 rebounds per game last year, will team up with senior center Phil Beans to anchor the Crusaders down low.
Holy Cross will also rely on freshman guard Cullen Hamilton, who scored 15 points in his first collegiate game and subsequently named Patriot League Rookie of the Week.
The Crusaders finished with a 15-14 record last year and lost to Lafayette in the quarterfinals of the Patriot League tournament. Holy Cross was picked to finish fourth this year in the conference preseason poll.
The Dec. 22 matchup represents the final game for both Harvard and Holy Cross before a weeklong break, and whoever can pull out the victory in Cambridge will be rewarded with an early Christmas gift.

After tipping off its season with a 69-54 victory over MIT, the Crimson men’s basketball team faces a much stiffer challenge Tuesday against UMass. The game—which is part of ESPN’s College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon—is Harvard’s (1-0) first major nonconference test.
Although the Crimson knocked off the preseason No. 1 Division III team to start the season without departed starters Oliver McNally ’12, Keith Wright ’12, Brandyn Curry, and Kyle Casey, Harvard faces a larger challenge against UMass. The Minutemen won 25 games last year and made a run to the semifinals of the National Invitational Tournament, where they fell to Stanford.
The game will start at 10 a.m. as part of the unusual scheduling involved in the Tip-Off Marathon, which has games all day and every two hours as a part of a 24-hour long segment of broadcasted basketball. The game is three hours earlier than any other contest the Crimson will be playing the rest of the year, and it is one of 14 televised games Harvard will be participating in this season.
“We’re ready to play,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We’ve been practicing at 10 for the last couple days, so we’re ready [for the early start time].”
UMass, meanwhile, will be playing its first game of the year. The Minutemen feature six returning players who played at least 36 minutes a game in 2011-12. Three projected starters—Chaz Williams, Raphiael Putney, and Jesse Morgan—shot 36 percent or better from three last year as part of an up-tempo attack that averaged 77 points a game and 35 percent shooting as a team from beyond the arc.
Williams shot 42 percent from three and averaged a team-high 17 points and six assists a year ago and will provide a tough task defensively for Crimson freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. But Williams turned the ball over almost twice as much as any other player on the team—a rate of 3.4 give aways per game. Webster said Harvard is focused on stopping the entire team, not just keying in on Williams, who was named to the Atlantic 10 preseason first team.
“We know they are a really active team,” Webster said. “We know UMass loves to get out in transition and score a lot of points, but we’re going to contain them and then play our offense.”
Against the Engineers, Harvard made 40 percent of its three-point attempts and held MIT to 36.4 percent shooting from the floor and just 28.6 percent from behind the arc.
The Crimson shared the ball well and had 17 assists, with six different players contributing two or more. On defense, the team was able to pressure the Engineers into 18 turnovers, including nine steals that jump-started Crimson fast breaks.
“We want to play a fast pace and be aggressive with our defense so that we can produce offense from our defense,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We want to be creating turnovers ourselves and then taking care of the ball on the other end.”
Harvard broke in four new starters against the Engineers, including sophomore center Kenyatta Smith, who had eight points, eight rebounds, and five blocks in just 21 minutes of action. Smith split time at the center position with sophomore Jonah Travis, who came in off the bench to post 14 points, eight rebounds, and three blocks. The duo combined for four of the Crimson’s 11 total offensive rebounds, something that will be crucial against UMass, who lost leading rebounder Sean Carter to graduation.
Although Harvard only led by five after the first 20 minutes of play, the Crimson pulled away in the second half against MIT by outscoring the Crimson by 10 after the break.
Amaker said that he was pleased with how his team played at the end of the game, creating turnovers at one end of the floor and generating quality shots at the other.
“We got the stops and didn’t bail them out by putting them on the foul line,” Amaker said. “I think that we did a good job of, when we got stops, getting out in transition and being able to make a couple plays. We ran our offense well late and made good decisions with the ball.”
Doing just that will be especially important against the Minutemen, who were picked fifth in the Atlantic 10 preseason poll.

The future of the Harvard men’s fencing team is in good gloves. Freshman Jerry Chang slashed his way to gold this weekend, topping a field of 162 fencers in the men’s junior foil event at the November North American Cup in Virginia Beach, Va., on Saturday. Chang also placed third in the senior division of the North American Cup on Monday.
In the junior event final, Chang mounted a lead early in the bout and held on to defeat Penn State freshman Nobuo Bravo, 15-12. On Monday, Chang made his way to the senior semifinal before falling to 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympian Gerek Meinhardt of Notre Dame, 15-6.
“What’s impressed me the most about [Chang] is his hard work and love for the sport of fencing,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “You can obviously see that from his current results, which are probably the best results he’s had since he started fencing.”
It is not the first time that Chang has earned a top-podium finish at the North American Cup, a series organized by USA Fencing. Chang’s victory this weekend backed up his individual and team U-19 foil titles at the July North American Cup in Anaheim, Calif., this summer. It is also the second time in a row in which Chang has finished in the top-three at a senior North American Cup event. Chang is ranked fourth among U.S. junior foil fencers and eighth among all U.S. foil fencers.
Chang won seven bouts on Saturday by a combined score of 105-63 to capture the gold medal. In his first three rounds, Chang conceded only 17 touches to advance to the table of 16. There, he met Harvard teammate Brian Kaneshige, who challenged Chang in a closely contested match. Chang emerged with a 15-12 win and a berth in the quarterfinal. For Chang, this matchup against a fellow teammate was a particular challenge given their high level of familiarity.
“It was really close,” Chang said. “We know each other pretty well so there were not a lot of things I could do to surprise him.”
Chang followed the Crimson-on-Crimson bout with a 15-10 win over Columbia freshman and 2011 cadet North American Cup champion Harry Bergman. Chang then edged Air Force sophomore Alex Chiang, 15-12, to secure a spot in the final.
On Monday, Chang competed in the senior division of the North American Cup, placing third. Chang defeated fellow Harvard classmate Michael Woo, 15-13, in another closely contested intrasquad bout in the table of 16 before losing to Meinhardt in the semifinal.
Brand feels that Chang has made a good case to be considered for the U.S. senior national team, which comprises America’s top four foil fencers.
“[Chang] has been very consistent about his results,” Brand said. “He continues to progress and has done extremely well.”
Chang arrived at Harvard Yard this August with a long list of fencing credentials. The California native helped Team USA to a junior team world championship at the 2012 World Cadet and Junior Fencing Championships in Moscow last April.
“It was a great experience,” Chang said of his experience competing with the junior world team. “Some of the other guys on the team…went to the Olympic Games, so it was a lot of fun to be able to compete on a team with them.”
Chang comes from a fencing family. With the encouragement of his father Johnathan, who fenced as a member of the Taiwanese national team during the 1980s, Jerry started fencing taking fencing classes at the age of nine alongside his older brother Jason, who is now a sophomore foil specialist for Penn.
“Obviously, there’s a family tradition here,” Brand said. “Sometimes kids who have fenced as long as he has tend to lose interest once they get to college, but with this kid, you can see the drive and the interest that [Chang] has for the sport, which is not that common.”
Looking ahead, Chang said he hopes to help bring an Ivy League championship back to Harvard. Last year, Princeton unseated the defending champion Crimson to claim the Ancient Eight crown. Individually, Chang will try to qualify again for the junior world team this year. Beyond that, Chang is hesitant to talk about long-term goals.
“I’m eying Rio, but we’ll see what happens,” Chang laughed.
“[Chang] is obviously very intent on trying to make the U.S. Olympic team,” Brand said. “And I think that if he sticks with it, he’s got a very good chance to do so."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard co-ed sailing team fell short in its final weekend of competition in the fall, finishing in last place in a scrimmage among teams from the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association.
On Saturday, the Crimson sailed just a little further down the Charles River for the eight-team regatta. MIT hosted the event for conference teams that qualified for the Co-ed Atlantic Coast Championship.
Harvard earned its qualification for the championship regatta by way of a seventh-place finish in the Schell Trophy Regatta on Oct. 27.
“It was a close regatta, but we were playing in home waters and would have liked to beat a couple of teams,” Harvard coach Mike O’Connor said. “We were up against some tough competition but weren’t very pleased with the results.”
If not for Hurricane Sandy, the Crimson would have traveled to King’s Point, N.Y. for ACCs. The Merchant Marine Academy was supposed to host the championship regatta, but the Academy cancelled because of storm-related damaged.
Event organizers tried to relocate the regatta to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., but the Academy also suffered damage from the hurricane. Eventually, the regatta was completely cancelled.
Despite the sudden cancellation, the NEISA decided to hold a small, informal championship for the schools that qualified.
Harvard scored 124 total points on the weekend. Although the Crimson tied with Brown for seventh place, the team lost the tiebreaker and finished in the eighth position. Boston College scored 85 points, just two points better than Dartmouth, to take the regatta title.
Sophomore Graham Slattery and junior Alma Lafler competed in the A division, totaling 56 points. The A division sailors from Boston College recorded the lowest point score with 36.
Meanwhile, freshmen Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky represented Harvard in the B division. The pair tallied 68 points, far off the standard of 38 set by Dartmouth’s B Division racers.
Since the regatta featured only eight teams, all of the boats competed in a combined, 16-boat race. Usually, A and B divisions boats compete separately.
The regatta marked the close of a difficult fall season for the Crimson. Harvard’s co-ed team finished no higher than sixth place this season.  It finished sixth twice—at the Hood Trophy regatta on Sept. 22 and at Dartmouth’s Captain Hurst Bowl on Oct. 14.
The Crimson’s women squad did not fare much better, though, as its second-place finish at the Women’s Toni Deuthsch ’58 Regatta on Sept. 8 marked the team’s only top-five finish of the fall.
Over the next couple of months, Harvard will look to build on its weaknesses.  The winter marks a period of focus on weight room workouts and general conditioning.
According to O’Connor, the team will use this time to correct mistakes that plagued the team throughout the fall season.
“We need to ramp up our strength training because we need to be stronger and quicker in our boats,” O’Connor said. “We need to execute more consistently in the starting line so that we are racing in the early part of the fleet more often as opposed to coming back against good competition. We really need to learn how to start more consistently across the board.”
Junior captain Ben Lamont believes that his team will not spend any time dwelling on this weekend’s disappointing performance.
“The result we will look at is really the qualifier for ACCs because that’s the best regatta that we sailed this fall,” Lamont said. “This weekend was a bit of a letdown with ACCs not happening.”
Although the team did not record many high finishes, Lamont emphasized the many positive changes that have taken place this fall.
“We are a young team, focused on improving and getting better, so we have been pretty happy and proud of the work everybody has been doing,” Lamont said. “From the freshmen to the seniors, from folks who were committed junior sailors to folks [who] walked on to the team in college having never sailed before, everyone improved over the course of the fall through their hard work.”
“We are not yet where we want to be,” he continued. “But I think we are in a good position going forward into the spring to where we want to be. Our goal is to qualify for nationals in Florida and have a strong showing there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AMHERST, Mass.—Sampson Carter knocked down a game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds remaining to give the University of Massachusetts a 67-64 victory over the Harvard men’s basketball team on Tuesday morning.
The Crimson led by five with 81 seconds remaining but two turnovers down the stretch proved costly, as UMass closed the contest on an 8-0 run to take the win at the Mullins Center.
“I thought the difference certainly was the turnovers,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad coughed it up 19 times—leading to 29 Minuteman points—against relentless UMass pressure.
But the Crimson’s final two turnovers were the most devastating. After scoring with 1:12 remaining to pull within two, the Minutemen forced a five-second violation on Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders with 45 ticks left on the clock.
UMass guard Jesse Morgan proceeded to knock down a deep three with 39 seconds remaining to even the score, 64-64.
After successfully inbounding against the Minuteman press, the Crimson put the ball in the hands of co-captain Christian Webster, who attempted to dribble up the sideline. But UMass point guard Chaz Williams met Webster near midcourt and came up with a steal, knocking the ball off Webster and out of bounds.
“The last timeout, we told ourselves…we needed to get something going defensively,” Williams said. “I hit it off [Webster’s] foot. It went the right way.”
With the shot clock off, UMass put the ball in the hands of Williams, the team’s leading scorer and top playmaker. The 5’9” Williams drove to the hoop, drawing in the Crimson’s defenders. Williams kicked it out to Sampson in the corner, and the forward drained the triple—his first basket of the contest.
“That’s basketball,” Amaker said. “I was kind of excited to be honest with you that [Williams] threw it out because he’s a great finisher at the rim, and he’s also crafty enough to get fouled. I just thought it played into our hands, but as it turned out obviously the kid made a big shot.”
Harvard freshman Siyani Chambers’ last-second heave from half court fell short, and UMass emerged victorious in its season opener.
“Sometimes the ball bounces your way,” Minutemen coach Derek Kellogg said.
While the ball ended up bouncing the wrong way for the Crimson, Amaker was pleased with his team's performance on the road against a squad that returns four starters from last year’s team that reached the NIT final four.
“I thought our kids were magnificent in so many ways,” Amaker said. “We see what we’re capable of. We see that we’re capable of going into an opponents’ arena [against] a very good basketball team…and being very competitive with an opportunity to win.”
After trailing by as many as 10 late in the first half, the Crimson battled back, closing the frame on a 9-1 run to pull within one, 38-37, at the break. Webster played a critical role during the stretch, scoring seven points in the final 94 seconds of the period, including a three-pointer at the buzzer.
Harvard took its first lead of the game 41 seconds into the second half off a Smith bucket, and the teams went back-and-forth the rest of the way, with neither squad puling ahead by more than six.
Saunders carried the Crimson offensively for much of the period, scoring 11 of his team-high 18 points in the final frame. The wing was most effective getting to the free-throw line, where he knocked down 10-of-11 attempts.
“I thought Wesley did a terrific job overall,” Amaker said. “I thought his body of work this morning was outstanding.”
With 6:38 to go, Saunders gave Harvard its first lead in more than 10 minutes, finishing a transition layup in traffic to put the Crimson up, 56-54.
The Minutemen responded, taking back the lead with 5:19 remaining off a Raphiael Putney triple. But Webster answered on the other end with his lone basket of the period, a three-pointer from the corner to put Harvard up one, 60-59.
Saunders and sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi each knocked down a pair of free throws to extend Harvard’s lead to five with 1:21 to go, but the Crimson couldn’t hang on.
Making his first collegiate appearance against a Division I opponent, Chambers finished with 14 points, seven assists, and one turnover in 40 minutes.
Chambers was also tasked with defending Williams, a preseason pick for the Atlantic 10 first team. Williams was limited to 12 points on 6-of-15 shooting, but the junior dished out a game-high 10 assists.
Morgan paced the Minutemen with a game-high 19 points, while Putney added 13.

In this mini-series, Flyby profiles one of the seven fall 2012 IOP Fellows each week. This week: Brett M. O'Donnell.
"I'm a frustrated drummer," IOP fellow Brett M. O’Donnell said. Caught between his desires to become a musician or work in communications, O'Donnell ultimately chose communications. To this day, he remains a jack of many trades.
From starting his own company, O'Donnell and Associates, to co-founding the charity Healing Hands of Joy in Ethiopia, O'Donnell works in a variety of different areas. However, he is best known for his work as a political debate coach, working with candidates from George W. Bush to John McCain to Michele Bachmann to Mitt Romney.
Before entering the political world, O'Donnell worked as a college debate coach at Liberty University, where his team won several national championships. When Karl Rove, political consultant to the Bush campaign, came to speak at Liberty in 2004, O'Donnell had the chance to meet him.
"I said to Karl Rove, 'You know John Kerry has a debate coach, and you need one for president Bush.' He kind of laughed and I laughed, and I didn't think anything would happen. Then a couple days later, he called and said, 'Were you serious?' and I said 'Sure.'"
Next thing that O’Donnell knew, he was working 100 hours a week for the Bush campaign. It was there that O'Donnell met Mark D. McKinnon, Bush's communications strategist.
"Then Mark McKinnon, who I had become friends with during the campaign, went to work for McCain, and he pulled me into McCain world. That's how I got with John, and I've been doing this ever since."
According to O'Donnell, McCain taught him more than he taught McCain and his time on the McCain campaign left him with his most memorable debate experience.
McCain iterated his dislike for earmark spending in each debate during the 2008 presidential election. After the campaign team discovered that democratic contender Hillary Clinton had requested an earmark for a Woodstock memorial in New York, they worked on a line for McCain to say in the debates.
"We were back at the hotel after a town hall debate and [McCain] said, 'You know I was in prison during the time of Woodstock.' We all said, 'You've got to say that.'"
From this moment, O'Donnell created McCain's famous line "Oh I would have loved to be there, but I was all tied up at the time."
"He went out in the debate and delivered the line, and he got a standing ovation. I have never seen, in a presidential debate, someone get a standing ovation. It just kind of encapsulated everything that was John."
In the past election, O’Donnell helped prep Mitt Romney for the Florida debates in the primary.
"I still believe that even though Governor Romney didn't win, the first debate put him in the game. That debate will go down as the most consequential debates in presidential history. It got people to look at Romney through a different lens. Up to that point, a majority of voters thought that Romney was an unacceptable alternative to the president, and after the first debate, he became acceptable."
O’Donnell's love for teaching and working with students brought him to the IOP.
"There's nothing more rewarding than working with students. Coaching political candidates is like coaching novice debaters, but novice debaters don’t have the ego that political candidates do."
Now O'Donnell is using his expertise in debates to teach the study group "The Debate about Debates." The study group looks at debates through more than the lens of who won or lost, but from the standpoint of what the debates reveal about the candidates.
His tip for great debating?
"Good political debaters treat debates like message opportunities and not like jeopardy."

Forget the "H" sweaters and crimson striped bow ties of yesteryear as you plan your outfit for the Harvard-Yale Game. This year's offerings show us that putting Yale down requires nothing fancier than a t-shirt. Take a look:
 
Harvard State: The makers of last year's "#Occupy Yale" t-shirt are back and with more variety. Harvard State, founded by Regan Bozman '13-'14 and Jacob D. Roberts '13, is selling tank tops ($10-$12.50), sweatshirts ($17.50), sunglasses ($5), and more. Merchandise can be bought online and delivered to undergraduate dorms. Of particular note is the potentially controversial "Yale You a Stupid Hoe" tank featuring Nicki Minaj.
 
Fale: An annual favorite, the Fale shirt hits the market this time as a product of the Harvard Philippine Forum. Proceeds will help fund the organization's J-term community service trip to the Philippines. These shirts ($15) are available for order  here and can either be delivered to your room or picked up in front of the Science Center from 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. every day this week.
 
Handle the Truth: The Crimson Dance Team has partnered with the Harvard Store in the production of  these crimson long-sleeve shirts. The "You Can't Handle the Truth" on the back seems much nicer when delivered by the Crimson Dance Team and not Jack Nicholson. They are available for $12.50 online and $15 in person outside the Science Center every day this week.
 
Carry On: The only freebie on the list is available  Tuesday at the Harvard College Fund Undergraduate Committee's annual Beat Yale Thankathon from 5 - 7 p.m. in Ticknor Lounge.

It seems that even celebs are gearing up for The Game this Saturday. Singer and former reality-TV star Jessica Simpson stepped out on Friday wearing a sweatshirt in support of our friends down in New Haven, and it isn't the first time she's shown her allegiance for the bulldogs. Leaving no doubts as to where her loyalties lie, Simpson is engaged to Yale alum and former football player Eric Johnson, who scored the game-winning touchdown in the 1999 Harvard–Yale Game.
Celebrities who have worn their support for Harvard in the past include Tyra Banks (no surprise there), who has repeatedly appeared on Time Magazine's list of most influential people, and Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman '03. Simpson, who once mistook tuna for chicken and thought that platypus was pronounced "platymapus," is perhaps better suited for Yale after all.
