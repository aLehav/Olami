After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each year, Academy Awards season stirs the film industry with the titillating prospect of taking home an Oscar. As far as the general public is concerned, there are, of course, a few big deal categories—Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director—while projects of less length generally get less pre-game hype. However, this certainly does not mean that they are any less entertaining or interesting—even if they are of the animated variety, even if they’re nearly all about the elderly. The Institute of Contemporary Art will be screening a series of short films nominated for the 82nd Academy Awards, which will be held on March 7. For those who aren’t concerned about making picks and placing bets before the big day, another screening will be held on March 10. Coolidge Corner Theatre will also be bringing the collection of Academy Award-Nominated Animated Shorts to the public. Here’s a rundown on what’s in store.
French Roast by Fabrice O. Joubert (French, 8 min.)
The characters are deceptively goofy. There’s the fly-infested beggar, the hunchbacked waiter, the snobbish French man, and the disproportionately small, white-haired nun nodding off at the next table. The scene is also deceptively simple: one bench in a French cafe and the outside world as reflected by the mirror behind it. But the snob has no money, the beggar is just as much a giver as he is a taker, and the old lady is not as saintly as she at first may seem.
Granny O’Grimm’s Sleeping Beauty by Nicky Phelan and Darragh O’Connell (English, 6 min.)
It’s unclear why this silent little girl’s grandmother insists on projecting her insecurities about aging onto the story of Sleeping Beauty. As the clearly delusional old lady with a Marge-like nest of towering hair recalls the tale, a 2-D rendition of the story unfolds, contrasting the world of fairies with the more 3D environment of the girl and her grandma. The short ends the old lady creepily saying, “I’ll see you in the morning—with the help of God.” It’s left unclear whether the little girl is able to fall asleep after all.
The Lady and the Reaper (La Dama y la Muerte) by Javier Recio Gracia (Non-dialogue, 8 min.)
Who can resist the power of old love? Clearly, modern medicine has an issue with it, as in this struggle between life and death. All this old woman wants is to die and join her sweetie in the light of afterlife. All the Grim Reaper wants is to help her. But as tends to be the case in animation, the square-jawed guy (the doctor) and his band of flirty hangers-on are set on saving her life. A wistful, playful soundtrack accompanies the sweetly surreal chase through the woman’s final hours.
Logorama by Nicolas Schmerkin (English, 17 min.)
In a world of logos, Michelin men swear up a storm, the Pringles guy does his mustache justice by creepily hitting on the Esso girl, and Ronald McDonald hold the Big Boy and the Haribo boy at gun point, before launching a storm of bullets on the Feds. Perhaps it’s a statement on the self-destructive nature of major corporations or maybe it’s a clever ploy to get sponsors. Nevertheless, it’s strangely engaging to watch all your favorite cartoon characters beat each other up.
A Matter of Loaf and Death by Nick Park (English, 30 min.)
The longest of the animated shorts, this Wallace and Gromit creation follows a well-known scheme. Wallace is a baker who saves the life of the Bake-O-Lite and her pretty poodle. They fall in love, Gromit feels lonely, many pastry puns and euphemistic baking scenes ensue. Of course, the Bake-O-Lite girl turns out to be a crazy serial killer out to get her “Baker’s Dozen.” Luckily, Gromit is around to let that fruitcake know her time is up.

With layoffs looming for scores of teachers in the country’s public schools, more parents and government officials are opposing seniority agreements in contracts with teachers unions. The status quo, representing a “last in, first out” pecking order, handles layoffs by first eliminating the newest teachers from classrooms. Joel I. Klein, chancellor of New York City’s school system—which could potentially layoff as many as 8,500 people this year because of a loss in state aid—has criticized the use of seniority as the sole metric by which teachers are laid off. The argument put forth by Klein and others is that the merit-blind seniority clause does not ensure that the teachers who remain in school systems are necessarily the most effective.
Rather than contending the dichotomy between seniority and teacher effectiveness, however, Klein and others should advocate a different approach to education policy that is based on keeping as many teachers as possible in the classroom. Public school teachers are essential to improving American education, meeting the needs of all students, and providing a crucial long-term investment in the continuing competitiveness, creativity, and competence of the country as a whole.
As such, laying off teachers is a short-term remedy that will have detrimental implications for the future. Larger classes will decrease the amount of quality and care afforded to students at present, an option that our already-struggling public school system cannot afford to see come to fruition. A decrease in the quality of education now will amplify over the years to result in an unwelcome decrease in the number of citizens capable of contributing and engaging with an increasingly competitive global economy. Moreover, any lessening in the current pool of teaching jobs will further discourage bright, enthusiastic students from pursuing jobs in education. No amount of penny-pinching is worth these costs. Understanding that the loss of state aid and tightening budgets are serious matters that have been approached with care and deliberation, we still argue that laying off teachers should not be a recourse for states strapped for cash. In this sense, the debate between seniority and merit need not take place, for there should be no across-the-board layoffs of teachers.
With this in mind, it is also important to recognize that seniority clauses have served to protect teachers who have challenged administrators and pedagogical norms with radical and unorthodox teaching methods. Teachers should be protected from arbitrary or politically motivated job loss and, for those reasons, seniority rules are beneficial. That said, we believe that teachers unions are exercising unduly power by insisting that seniority weigh so heavily in assessing who is to be kept and who cast out. Other factors like quality of instruction and student and parent input should be considered in addition to experience as a means of assessment. Ultimately, Klein’s argument brings to light the issue of how best to educate students with a decreasing availability of resources to do so. Rather than debating whom to lay off and how, however, we should be shifting the focus of the debate to how to preserve these jobs through the allocation of more funds for the protection of public education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Jewish calendar features a holiday this week that has garnered the unofficial moniker of the Jewish “get-drunk-off-your-ass” day. To properly commemorate Purim, a day-long celebration of the Jews’ escape from destruction by the hands of a wicked vizier in ancient Persia, the Talmud decrees that one must so wasted that “he cannot distinguish between ‘cursed is Haman [the villain]’ and ‘blessed is Mordechai [the hero].’” Because a literal reading of this passage would essentially mean that Jews must put themselves in danger in order to commemorate escaping from danger, alternative readings abound as to how much alcohol one must actually take in. My favorite opinion, however, is that of Rabbi Moshe Isserles, who asserts that regardless of how much you drink, you should only imbibe “for the sake of Heaven.” That is, there is nothing inherently wrong with getting gratifyingly tipsy (within reason) on Purim, as long you are getting intoxicated not for its own sake but for the sake of something greater than yourself.
This philosophy can ironically help explain the woes of a religious group that is not quite in such a festive mood right now. Last week, to kick off this year’s Lenten speaker series, Professor Lisa Cahill, a professor of theology at Boston College, lectured on the “Generation Gap in Catholic Sexual Teaching.” Cahill argued that many Catholic students tend to embrace a lifestyle of promiscuity because they feel alienated by traditional Catholic views on sexuality. This happens, she asserted, because although the Church’s viewpoint has progressed beyond the myopic notion that sex is for “procreation only,” that is exactly how many Catholic students unfortunately understand it, leading many to deem abstinence as “unrealistic.” Cahill went on to delineate the Church’s current views, but the absence of a key ideological point in her outline that is implicit in both Isserles’s dictum and in Jewish sexual ethics as a whole could point to an even deeper reason as to why some Catholics are drawn to fleeting romances.
As a primary source for modern Catholic sexual ethics, Cahill cited the “Humanae Vitae,” an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI in 1968. Before this, argued Cahill, the Catholic perspective was indeed primarily that sex is solely for procreation. This encyclical, however, written on the issue of artificial birth control, modified this view. While Pope Paul affirmed that “every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life,” he also asserted the equally important function of sex as a tool to entrench a “love” between husband and wife, the epitome of “human fulfillment.”
This, however, became lost on today’s students of Catholicism because the past generation focused on the Humanae Vitae’s stance against birth control more than its reworking of Catholic sexual philosophy. From her own experience, Cahill asserted, many Catholic students seem to care more about the apparent obsolescence of laws than forbid pre-marital sex than they do about issues like birth control. To promote abstinence today, therefore, Cahill argued, Catholic pedagogues ought to associate sex not merely with procreation but also with “commitment” and “integrity.”
She, as well as the Humanae Vitae, however, never mentioned “pleasure.” And that’s where the difficulty in imbuing the value of abstinence might very well lie.
Failing to legitimize the enjoyment one normally gets from sex (or, in the case of Paul and Augustine among numerous others, equating it to sin) has tremendous potential to alienate students of the faith. Although the Catechism cites a statement from Pope Pius XII that “spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit” through intercourse, the role of sexual pleasure in marriage has been hotly contested throughout the history of Catholic thought. The solution could therefore be less to emphasize the gravity of the sexual act than to ensure that students understand that they are meant to redirect their sexual energy towards a productive end rather than repressing it completely.
Indeed, this is a prominent stream of thought in traditional Jewish philosophy. As Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits argues in his essay “A Jewish Sexual Ethics,” while many Christian denominations advocate a repression of sensual desire, Judaism humanizes sexuality by framing its pleasure as a mitzvah if it is experienced in the proper context. Although procreation is paramount and pre-marital sex is strictly forbidden in Orthodox Judaism, physical gratification itself is viewed as anything but corrosive. On the contrary, the Talmud records that it was common practice for Torah scholars to have sex their wives on the eve of the Sabbath since, as one prominent commentator notes, the Sabbath is meant for “delights” and “bodily pleasures.”
Sexual desire, in other words, can become a vehicle for consecration if it is acted upon in the proper place and context, and Catholic ethicists ought to emphasize this aspect of their thought if they seek to promote abstinence in a relevant fashion. When one directs his energy towards something meaningful, whether he utilizes intercourse or, in the case of Purim, beer and wine, the spiritual heights he experiences can only be exalted. As long as, to cite Rabbi Isserles, he is doing it for the sake of Heaven.

Women have certainly bridged much of the gender gap in the past sixty years; ask a girl today if she knows who June Cleaver is and she will most likely give you a blank stare. Despite the fact that girls no longer aim solely for Leave-it-to-Beaver-style domestic happiness, it seems that we have now reached an impasse in terms of gender equality. Even though around 58 percent of all people earning bachelor’s degrees are females, women seem to be unable to translate this educational advantage into concrete gains in other fields. This dilemma has significant roots in the unwillingness of girls to seek out and take risks, starting as early as preschool.
For example, a study of Carnegie Mellon graduates with master’s degrees in business-related fields found that the starting salaries of the men were on average four thousand dollars higher than those of the females. Further examination of the applicants revealed that only seven percent of females had asked for a higher salary during the interview process compared to 57 percent of men. Those who had asked for more money had starting salaries that were 4053 dollars higher than the salaries of those who did not, meaning this gender gap in pay could be attributed almost entirely to the fact that women did not ask for more money. Similarly, many of today’s other gender inequalities are rooted in the failure of females to seek out and take necessary risks; men are far more likely to be chief executive officers of major companies and start their own businesses than their female counterparts.
How can we change this harmful mindset? The answer goes back to childhood. The expectation for girls in early youth is to behave in a way that minimizes risk; girls are not often praised for successfully navigating a bike down a mountain or jumping off a swing and landing on her feet. We must change the tacit expectations girls encounter in childhood, or our daughters will irrevocably internalize the risk-averse mentality that so many of us subconsciously face even today.
A study of fourth and fifth grade teacher evaluations sheds light on the unique circumstances girls face during childhood. Fifty-four percent of negative criticism directed at boys centered on their intellectual capacity, while inadequate intelligence was cited as the problem in nearly ninety percent of girls’ negative criticism. Under these skewed perceptions and low expectations, girls are not poised to develop the same confidence in their abilities as boys, playing into their risk-averse nature.
Girls eventually believe that they are simply not talented in certain “risky” areas, or that there are more likely to make mistakes in boyish activities. For example, when students are asked to rate their future  success in mathematics, girls consistently rate theirs lower than boys. Similarly, if you ask children whether a boy or a girl is more likely to get hurt riding a bicycle or climbing a tree, most agree that the girl is much more likely to injure herself. In reality, the opposite is true.
Additionally, females routinely underestimate their own abilities (which may have its roots as early on as mothers of girls underestimating their infant’s crawling ability) feeding into this avoidance of risk. If a girl believes she is at risk of injury riding a bicycle regardless of her actual skill set, she is likely to grow into a woman who lets her fear of seeming pushy or ungrateful stop her from asking for a raise.
We need to intervene early on in girls’ lives to stop this pattern from developing. By encouraging girls to start taking small risks that may seem trivial, like jumping over a log or sliding backwards down a slide, they will eventually become accustomed to the success that follows, removing the fear that usually accompanies such risks and building confidence that will accompany them into adulthood.

I rarely notice the obituary section of The New York Times, but this past January, I could not ignore the headlines: J.D. Salinger, Howard Zinn, Abraham Sutzkever, and Louis Auchincloss all died within the span of a week. All of these men were writers who, in recently leaving the world, have left behind on culture a mark that we, unfortunately, cannot fully identify.
I hadn’t even heard of Sutzkever, a famous Yiddish poet, until I had shopped a Jewish Studies class, and it was my Google Reader that led me to Auchincloss, a lawyer and social observer. As a government concentrator at Harvard, I was never exposed to these cultural contributors. As I read about these men, a part of me regretted my failure to recognize their accomplishments while they lived, and a part of me admired and, at the same time, felt sorry for the obituary writer who had to select the most important and interesting moments of each person’s death to memorialize.
These dead men’s great names present somewhat of a burden to the journalist, just as the name “Harvard” might pressure a freshman to study hard and join 17 extracurricular activities (and 23 more email lists). Certainly, each writer’s most famous accomplishments are worth writing about, but what about the fascinating, lesser known ones? What about Zinn’s plays, Salinger’s book that was made into a movie—"Foolish Heart"—and the novel that Auchincloss wrote while still at Yale?
These smaller pieces didn’t left enough of a mark on our culture to become the centerpieces of these men’s obituaries, and it would be strange if figures such as these were commemorated for works no one has heard of. On the other hand, why do so many lines need to be devoted to their great works when they are already so well known? A paragraph would be sufficient to inform the uninitiated, instead of half a page. It might even be an greater honor for these men if our society’s memorializers were to emphasize the lesser-known aspects of their works and lives in their obituaries. Readers might be tempted to learn more about these pieces, and we could reevaluate, as a society, their place in our society. This wouldn’t be revising history; it would be adding to it and, at the same time, enriching our culture. It would be the work of future historians to evaluate what we have done.
We should dig deeper into writers’ books after shoveling the dirt onto their graves, because there’s always more to know. We should search for meaning, turning little details of the tabloid variety into sources for discussions about our society, our values, and ourselves. Furthermore, such bits of journalistic writing should be details written not for the sake of drawing the reader into the story but for the sake of expanding our knowledge.
While I don’t believe that every opinion article ought to attack our thoughts and actions—it’s equally interesting to be prompted to think differently—I do believe that journalists have more work to do when it comes to balancing their role in evaluating society and their role in connecting to it. The problem is that we are part of the problem. We love to comment on newspaper articles with letters to the editor and comments online. Journalists, therefore, have to face the challenge of, on the one hand, responding to our need to connect to their work, and on the other, standing apart from society and criticizing it.
One way to rebalance the journalist’s role as societal critic is to simplify our forms of communication. For example, does an online newspaper really have to have blogs on it? While, on one hand, blogs are a feature that differentiate online newspapers from their print form, the medium of the internet is already significantly different: thanks to links, I can read through much more content online than I could in print. I don’t need tools that merely summarize the paper or serve as as an outlet for user-generated content; for the latter, I can just read blogs, watch YouTube videos, and sometimes even comment on Facebook.
While this solution is only partial, it’s a way to start. We need a figurative Dead Writer’s Society, a place where obituaries and obituary readers do more to identify what we value in our culture. I, for one, am going to read more obituaries. Maybe doing so will help me understand the contribution of other great figures to our culture and society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diana Sorensen, the divisional dean for the arts and humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will leave Harvard at the end of the academic year to take a year-long sabbatical.
Sorensen plans to use the time to work on a book, before returning to her teaching duties in the fall of 2011.
Sorensen, who unexpectedly found herself at the frontlines of FAS as it navigated through an unprecedented financial crisis, has served as the divisional dean since 2006, when she first assumed the position as a temporary replacement for departing dean and current Chair of the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology Maria Tatar.
At the conclusion of her year-long acting deanship, Sorensen was appointed the dean of arts and humanities in July 2007. Following that two-year appointment, she agreed to serve for an additional year in the role, though she had planned on returning to full-time teaching and research in 2009, Sorensen wrote in an e-mailed statement.
In a January e-mail to the Faculty announcing Sorensen’s imminent departure, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith praised her leadership and asked for help in searching for a replacement—which he plans to announce in June.
“She has been a tireless advocate for the Division and has exhibited extraordinary leadership,” Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement to the Crimson. Smith declined to comment on the specifics of the search process.
During her tenure as divisional dean, Sorensen—also the Rothenberg professor of Romance Languages and Literature and of Comparative Literature—has weathered the worst financial crisis in decades, while simultaneously commanding the respect of her colleagues and maintaining the strength of the arts and humanities. Earlier this spring, the division garnered two new English professors from Columbia despite steep reductions in the number of searches authorized by the central administration at Harvard.
“She has been a committed and powerful advocate for arts and humanities faculty, students, departments, and programs even—and perhaps especially—as the reality of the financial situation took root,” wrote Heather Lantz, the assistant dean for arts and humanities, in an e-mailed statement.
Marjorie Garber, chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, described Sorensen as a “very excellent dean” and praised her ability to oversee the diverse set of departments and committees within the humanities division.
Colleagues commented on Sorensen’s stable and efficient work ethic.
“It’s tempered and appropriate,” FAS Divisional Dean of the Social Sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn said. “She makes decisions and follows through.”
Sorensen, a scholar of Latin American literature and culture, has been at Harvard since 2001. She previously taught at Columbia and served as the dean of the arts and humanities at Wesleyan University.
The author of four books related to Latin American literature, Sorensen has demonstrated a strong commitment to the humanities. She served on the Committee for General Education as it sought to formulate plans for the set of Gen Ed requirements and has also been associated with the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies, and the Task Force on the Arts.

Office hours are rarely associated with strong emotions, as academic exchanges generally tend to be more cerebral than heartfelt.
But when Cesar Alvarez ’13 met with University President Drew G. Faust yesterday, emotions were at the fore.
Alvarez said that as he watched tourists visiting Harvard last fall, he realized that students in his home community would never have the opportunity to come to Harvard—or any other elite university, for that matter.
Inspired by the realization, Alvarez returned to his reservation in his native state of North Dakota to speak to students about the possibility of attaining opportunities in higher education. When Alvarez told Faust during her office hours that she had served as a major source of inspiration after he overcame the challenges of growing up on a reservation—areas that have been plagued by poverty and alcoholism—the president barely held back tears.
About twice a semester, Faust devotes an allotted period of time to meeting with students in her office. The chance to meet with the University’s chief administrator attracted an eclectic group to Mass. Hall yesterday, ranging from anti-slavery activists to a group concerned with investments in Iran.
But the afternoon’s most poignant moment came when Alvarez presented Faust with gifts from his tribe—a traditional blanket, a book, and a pin—and praised the University’s efforts to encourage minorities to attend Harvard.
“There can be more done,” Alvarez said, “but Harvard is way ahead of the game.”
In another ten-minute encounter, Faust met with students from Harvard College Free the Slaves, which has designed a course on modern-day slavery. The group hopes to get the course approved for the General Education curriculum and wants to promote broader awareness of slavery.
Group members said that they were encouraged by Faust’s interest and advice, but still face significant obstacles in the creation of the course, including the search for a professor with expertise in the field.
“Slavery isn’t something you hear about a lot these days,” said Eric Goodwin, a project coordinator with the Harvard Initiative for Global Health, who joined the students in their meeting with Faust yesterday.
Several students from Harvard Law School united with a College freshman to advocate divestment from foreign companies with ties to Iran’s energy sector.
Though comprehensive information about Harvard’s investments are not made public—and, consequently, students do not know what holdings the University might have in Iran—Harvard’s prestige could help make the University a leader in the protest against Iran’s nuclear program, the students said.
They said Faust advised them to write a letter about the issue, which she said she would present to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. The students said they believed that Faust’s acknowledgement that Harvard did not move quickly to divest from South Africa during Apartheid boded well for their cause.
“As the most preeminent university in America, Harvard could take a stand,” said Alexander Chester, a third-year law student. “It would be a good moral stance and financial one as well.”
From her end, Faust said that hosting office hours offer her the opportunity to be more accessible, to hear from students, and to entertain unique points of view.
“Every time I do this, it’s just filled with amazing surprises of things that students have done or are thinking about,” Faust said.

A visiting scholar at Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs has recently come under fire for making comments earlier this month advocating cuts in certain subsistence aid to Palestinians in order to curb extremism.
Martin S. Kramer—who is currently a visiting fellow with the Weatherhead Center’s National Security Studies Program—said at the Herzliya Conference in Israel on Feb. 3 that Western countries should cease providing “pro-natal subsidies”—such as food and funding for refugee children’s education—to Palestinian refugees.
In a six-minute speech at the conference—which is partially sponsored by the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv, according to the Herzliya Conference’s Web site—Kramer called for decreasing population growth among Palestinians in order to “crack the culture of martyrdom [among some Palestinians], which demands a constant supply of superfluous young men.”
“I called on [Western countries] to desist from deliberately encouraging births through pro-natal subsidies for Palestinian ‘refugees,’ which guarantee that Gazans will remain both radicalized and dependent,” Kramer wrote on his blog, entitled “Sandbox.”
While several critics have equated Kramer’s proposal with genocide, some students on campus took issue with the comments’ implications for refugee children.
“What Kramer is essentially calling for is population control by starvation,” said Felix de Rosen ’13, a member of the Palestinian Solidarity Committee (PSC). “If you really want to control population growth, you do it through development, not by starving the children of refugees.”
Kramer told the audience that in countries in which the median population age is less than 20—among Palestinians, the median age is 17, he said—“Islamist radicalization is taking place on a massive scale.”
Citing Osama bin Laden, who is the 17th of 55 children, Kramer stated that “radical Islam is a way for the superfluous sons to enter history.”
Kramer said that decreasing fertility rates will eventually lead aging populations to “reject radical agendas.” He commended Israel’s economic sanctions on Gaza for having had the effect of breaking “Gaza’s runaway population growth” and undermining the Hamas regime. “Had Kramer’s statements been waged against any other group, they would have immediately been classified as extremist hate speech,” said Abdelnasser Rashid ’11-12, who serves as the president of the Harvard Islamic Society and as a PSC board member.
In a statement e-mailed to The Crimson, Weatherhead Center officials stated that Kramer’s comments fell within the realm of academic speech, which embraces controversy.
“It would be inappropriate for the Weatherhead Center to pass judgment on the personal political views of any of its affiliates, or to make affiliation contingent upon some political criterion,” wrote Beth Simmons, Jeffry Frieden, and James Robinson—director and acting directors of the Weatherhead Center, respectively—in the statement.

Yale University administrators ruled on Monday to approve gender-neutral suites for seniors, making it the last Ivy League school to implement some form of mixed-gender housing.
“Having a gender-blind housing option for the senior class is not just an LGBT issue, but is much broader, and I certainly applaud the university’s decision to follow the lead of every other Ivy League school in having some kind of gender-blind option,” said Yale junior Benjamin S. Bernard, a board member of Yale’s LGBT Cooperative.
The new policy stipulates that only people of the same gender may share a bedroom within a mixed-gender suite and ensures that no one will be forced to live in a mixed-gender suite. Additionally, couples are “discouraged” from choosing to live in the same suite.
“One of the major concerns against [the policy] was that opposite-sex couples would cohabitate on campus, but if there isn’t such a policy, it means the administration is presupposing that there aren’t same-sex relationships,” Bernard said.
Yale junior Abigail H. Cheung, vice president of the Yale College Council, said that students felt that the former housing guidelines did not accommodate all students’ needs.
“Yale’s housing policies were discriminatory and often resulted in pushing members of the LGBTQ community off campus,” she said.
Student activism initiated by several Yale undergraduate groups—including the Yale College Council and the LGBT Cooperative—played a significant role in pushing for the changes. Their work included holding a sleep-in in the middle of campus last year, meeting with the administration, and conducting a survey to gauge student support of the changes.
“The student movement had a lot to do with the adoption of the policy,” said John R. Meeske, Yale’s associate dean for physical resources and planning. “The university wanted to be responsive to student concerns and interests.”
Meeske said that input from other universities—including Harvard—factored into the policy decision.
Harvard College’s housing policy currently permits mixed-gender suites, but with the condition that each bedroom has a door with a lock.
“We’re still working on [gender-neutral housing], and fairness throughout the process is the most important thing,” said Daniel V. Kroop ’10, a former Undergraduate Council member who has been involved with lobbying for gender-neutral housing privileges.
Students and several Yale administrators said they hope the option for mixed-gender housing will be extended to students other than seniors.
“I think anything is possible,” said Meeske, who attended Yale as an undergrad. “I’ve seen a lot of changes over the years, and I’m pleased to see how the university has moved forward. It’s an even better place now than it was when I was a student.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four hundred students—some in crimson, some with bulldogs emblazoned on their shirts, others in Big Red or Big Green—swarmed the University of Pennsylvania campus last weekend for the first annual IvyQ conference.
The student-organized conference brought together LGBT students from the eight Ivy League schools to discuss their different approaches to nurturing an LGBT community.
The conference included speakers from the Human Rights Campaign, the Associated Press, and the Walt Disney Company, as well as workshops and social events to create a united pan-Ivy LGBT community.
Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of the Harvard Queer Students and Allies, worked with LGBT leaders from other Ivy League schools to plan the conference.
“We never imagined that in a year and a half it would happen for the first time, and on such a big scale,” he said.
Benjamin S. Bernard, a Yale junior and board member of Yale’s LGBT Cooperative, also said he thought that the outcome was impressive.
“The number of people who formed what I think will be lasting connections was very exciting, and I felt like I got to watch the articulation of a community,” he said.
Student representatives said that the chance to collaborate with other members of the Ivy League LGBT community was a valuable opportunity.
“What was surprising to me was that, despite having such different resources and institutional structures, how much we all had in common in terms of the challenges we face and the goals that we have,” Bernard said.
“This is the beginning of a much longer-term process of a connection between these schools that I don’t think existed there before,” he added.
Harvard QSA secretary David L. Orama ’12 said that the conference allowed the attendees to learn about the LGBT resources available on other campuses.
“Most of the other schools have a dedicated building and we have a nice little room in a basement,” he said.
Chan said that Harvard QSA members were glad to learn from other colleges’ experiences about how to start a staffed LGBT space on campus.
“We’re invigorated to continue activism and social events on our own campus and excited to see IvyQ again next year,” said Columbia Queer Alliance treasurer Sean Manning Udell, who helped organize the conference.
Manning Udell, Bernard, and Chan all expressed interest in hosting the conference at their respective universities next year. They also said they hope to include other schools in the future.
“I think it was a good starting point,” Orama said. “I’m hoping it’ll be something big that continues every year and I can go back and think about how I was part of the first one.”

Stroke victims who can no longer speak may now be able to regain their ability to communicate through singing, according to a recent Harvard Medical School study.
HMS professor Gottfried Schlaug and his research team have seen promising signs in the preliminary results of their first clinical trial of melodic intonation therapy, which can circumvent the effects of aphasia, the loss of verbal communication.
Schlaug’s research team hopes the study will encourage broader acceptance of melodic intonation therapy as a form of treatment for stroke victims, according to Andrea C. Norton, a research associate for Schlaug at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.
For patients with damage in the brain’s language center in the left hemisphere, the treatment activates a mirror image of the language center in the singing center of the brain located in the right hemisphere, Norton said.
“Our hypothesis that melodic intonation therapy would shift a patient’s language center from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere is exactly what we’ve seen, which is very exciting,” said Sarah Marchina, a research fellow at Beth Israel who also works with Schlaug.
Norton said that the study’s most promising results lie in the therapy’s accessibility. Any caretaker­­­­­, regardless of their musical background or level of expertise, can be trained to administer melodic intonation therapy, she said.
The ongoing study is the first to closely examine the effectiveness of this form of therapy, according to Norton.
“The treatment itself was based on nearly a century of clinical observation that many stroke survivors are able to sing words they are unable to speak,” said Norton, who noted that melodic intonation therapy was first developed in Boston in the 1970s.
Schlaug, who studies the effects of music on the human brain, could not be reached for comment because he is out of town for a conference.
Melodic intonation therapy teaches patients to communicate by singing while rhythmically tapping each syllable with their left hand, according to a chapter written by the research team.
“Therapists are often reluctant to sing, but the truth is neither therapists nor patients need to be a musician or singer to benefit from this therapy,” Norton said. “Improvement is possible even when those involved have difficulty carrying a tune.”
Melodic intonation therapy can be helpful for a patient for more than ten years after the person experiences a stroke. In the past, it was believed that the treatment would not work for aphasia patients who did not receive therapy within 12 months after their strokes, according to Norton.
With the U.S. population rapidly aging and the number of stroke patients multiplying, melodic intonation therapy may present huge opportunities, Norton said.
“The road to recovery for aphasia patients is a long one,” Norton said. “But there is certainly hope.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hockey has always been in Conor Morrison’s blood.
His father, Dave, played in the National Hockey League for the Los Angeles Kings and the Vancouver Canucks in the early ’80s. His grandfather, Dave’s father Jim, was a three-time All Star who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers over his 12 season career.
Conor even went to high school in Lake Placid, N.Y., where the most venerated hockey game in United States history–the 1980 “Miracle on Ice”–took place.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the Harvard freshman forward is something of a hockey fanatic himself.
“He just lives and breathes hockey, that’s literally all he does,” his roommate Gavin Pascarella says. “Most kids get distracted by Facebook, he comes back and watches hockey...It’s all he really knows.”
It was an innate passion, one that began almost as soon as Conor could walk.
“The moment we brought a little mini stick home and he could walk he was carrying that mini stick everywhere,” Dave Morrison says. “And every game he had he would transform into a hockey game. He’d play hockey with a backgammon board, using the dice as a puck.”
But as he grew older, Conor’s childhood wasn’t all fun and games. With his father playing professionally in Europe, Conor was constantly moving from country to country as per the demand’s of his father’s career. Born in Switzerland, Conor also lived in Germany and England as a child–something that wasn’t easy on a young boy just trying to find somewhere he fit in.
“Growing up, I didn’t spend a lot of time in one place,” Conor says. “I had to adjust, going to different schools, having to learn a different language in Germany. We’d be back to Ontario, and I’d have my friends there, but I’d have been away for six [or] seven months when my dad was in season...It was tough adjusting to the different social settings.”
Despite this hardship, the traveling also represented an opportunity for Conor, one his father always encouraged him to take full advantage of.
“I’ve always been around hockey, so he’s always been around it,” Dave says. “He’d be able to come to the rink with me, to watch good hockey players play...I think Conor got a lot of his ability from watching other players.”
As Conor continued to watch, his love for his dad’s and his grandfather’s game continued to soar.
“I always loved the game, and I loved being around it,” Conor says. “Before my dad would practice in Europe I’d go out on the ice before the teams skated and skate by myself.”
And as his passion continued to grow, Conor’s talent began to blossom, thanks largely to his family’s tutelage.
“Obviously having both my father and my grandfather helped a lot in terms of my development,” Conor says. “Since they played at the highest level, I’d always have advice coming from both of them. Whenever we watched games they’d give me little pointers on how to make myself better.”
Conor took these pointers to heart, and his game began to show it. In high school, he played two seasons for the Salmon Arm SilverBacks of the British Columbia Hockey League, where he tied for the league-lead in points per game, finishing with 84 points and 39 goals.
In 2008-2009, Conor helped the SilverBacks reach the Conference Finals, where he scored four goals and six points in one game—both team records–and was honored with the conference’s Most Sportsmanlike Player award.
In 2009, Conor was selected to play for the German under-20 team at the International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championships, which were being held in Ottawa, Ontario–his home province.
“That was for me my most special moment in hockey,” Conor says. “I got to play Canada in front of a sold out crowd, and my whole family was in the stands. It was a pinnacle of my hockey career so far.”
His success gained him notice in both Canada and the United States, leaving Conor with a choice. He could take the Major Junior route that his dad and grandfather took on their way to the NHL and begin playing professionally in Canada, or he could go to college.
He chose the latter and came to Harvard, and today believes he made the right decision.
“When I was younger I definitely planned on playing Major Junior,” Conor says. “I know a lot of my friends have taken that route, and it’s worked out great for them, but for me to further my development I think the college route was definitely the better choice.”
As usual, Dave and Jim Morrison were there with helpful advice about the college game, despite never having played in college themselves.
“They definitely told me that the game was going to be played at a higher level, that the guys are going to be bigger and stronger, that the level of play would be a lot faster, [and that] I’d have to make decisions quicker,” Conor explains.
Despite being only a freshman, Morrison has thrived. He is tied for the team lead in goals with 10 even though he ranks eighth on the team in shots attempted.
“The one thing I really admire about Conor is that he’s got a tremendous amount of focus,” his father says. “He’s very dedicated to being the best he can be...He’s never satisfied.”
If Conor can maintain his drive and work ethic, there will be nothing stopping him from following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps to the NHL.
“It’s always been a dream of mine,” he says. “I honestly couldn’t picture myself not playing hockey.”
Despite his rich family history, Conor doesn’t feel any extra weight on his shoulders to keep the Morrison legacy going in the NHL. He knows that no matter what Dave and Jim will always be there for support.
“They never put any sort of pressure on me,” he says. “They just want the best for me, they want me to be happy. Obviously my life-long goal has been to make it to the NHL, and if it happens great, but if not they’ll still be proud of me either way.”
Conor adds that if he had to choose, his dream would be to play for one of his grandfather’s team, the Maple Leafs.
“I just think the hockey market in Toronto is awesome,” he says.
If Morrison is to realize that dream, he will need to impress his dad, who’s currently the Maple Leafs’ director of amateur scouting.
“When I’m scouting, it’s not just the players and how they play on the ice, but it’s also their character, their commitment to becoming the best they can be, and the passion and the drive they have as individuals,” Dave says.
That shouldn’t be much of an issue for Conor, who garners effusive praise from his peers for his disposition.
“He’s a great guy off the ice,” freshman forward Alex Fallstrom says. “A really open guy, very easy to talk to.”
“Personality wise, he’s pretty down to earth,” Pascarella adds. “He’s a really funny, really nice guy.”
Whether or not his playing career works out, Conor can easily foresee himself as part of the game he loves for the rest of his life.
“I think hockey is in my blood,” he says. “I just love being around the game, love being around the rink. After my career is over I hope I’ll be able to step into some sort of management job, maybe in the NHL or in Europe somewhere, but I’d definitely like to stay with the game.”
For now, though, his dad isn’t worried about the long term. He sees his son’s talent and his work ethic and knows with that combination, Conor will be able to do whatever he wants in life.
“He’s got a passion for the game, and I think he’s got a lot to prove, and he wants to continue trying to prove it,” Dave says. “He keeps getting better, and we’ll see how far it takes him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the big day. The crowd begins to cheer as they await the match. Cameras flash as he walks through the tunnel. He bounces around to prepare himself.
“Wrestling at 125 pounds from Harvard,” the announcer proclaims, “is Steeevvveennn Keith!”
Maybe it wasn’t that dramatic the first time freshman Steven Keith stepped onto the mat as a Crimson wrestler, but for him, it was the confirmation of all of the hard work he had put into the sport up to that point.
“It was a thrill stepping onto the mat for the first time,” Keith said. “It was enjoyable, and I just couldn’t believe I was wearing a Harvard singlet. It was my life goal.”
And Keith has taken full advantage of this opportunity. The Shoreham, N.Y. native currently has a 14-9 record on the season. Even though he only tips the scales at 125 pounds, there’s a lot more fight in him than you might expect at first glance.
Keith got his start in wrestling when he was just five years old, weighing in at much less than 125. Don Jantzen, a family friend and the high school coach in his district, suggested to Keith and his parents that he wrestle and invited him to try it out in kindergarten. This was the start of a relationship that would help him to improve on his wrestling skills and to accomplish his mission of wrestling for Harvard.
“I noticed that he was very aggressive and not afraid to work hard and keep coming at people,” Jantzen commented. “He likes to keep going after his opponent in a match, and the more you attack, the more you score.”
Jantzen is no stranger to the wrestling scene. His sons, Jesse and Corey, have donned the Crimson singlet. The older of the two, Jesse, graduated in ’04 and Corey will be returning to Harvard as a junior next year.
“He was influenced by my two older boys,” acknowledged Jantzen, whose eldest son captured a national title as a member of the Crimson. “He saw the progress and the success the two boys had and looked at that as something he wanted. He would come along to the tournaments with us and developed the same work ethic they had.”
His high school coach also noted Keith’s “understanding at an early age that he needed to be around top-level people and ask them questions to excel.” Keith soaked up the talent around him, improving tremendously over the years.
“Steven has been fortunate enough throughout high school to have a lot of great coaches make him better and mentor him,” his dad, Glenn Keith remarked. “They’ve embraced Steven, and if it wasn’t for those people, he wouldn’t be the wrestler he is today.”
With the training of his coach, Keith dominated in high school, winning the state title as a sophomore and a senior, going 185-15 over his career, including 46-0 his senior season. But the transition from high school wrestling to college wrestling is a big one, and Keith admitted that it was a challenge for him in the beginning.
“Transitioning from high school to college was a little difficult, but it was a pretty smooth transition with the help of the Harvard coaches,” Keith revealed. “I’ve been changing some technique and focusing on my mindset when I step onto the mat.”
His new teammates and coach have been helping him to improve and realize the potential he has. They’ve worked with him to adjust his skills, style, and mental stamina to succeed as a Crimson wrestler. Particularly, his coach, Jay Weiss, and co-captain, JP O’Connor, have watched him progress.
“We knew of his talents and his accomplishments in high school and that he had a strong work ethic,” Weiss said. “The big challenge is how quickly someone can adapt to the college style, but he trains hard and has the intangibles to do well. When we went down to Dallas in January, we played Oklahoma and he beat No. 13 [Jarrod Patterson]. That gave him the confidence and it was a big step.”
“It’s been great having Steven on the team,” O’Connor agreed. “He reminds me a lot of myself when I was a freshman with the passion and attitude he shows for the sport. I’m inspired by what Steven and the other freshman do.”
But Keith isn’t ready to rest on his laurels. He still has three seasons left on the team to improve and has big plans for after college.
“After college, I hope to still be training for wrestling,” Keith said. “I want to go to the Olympic trials and have a shot at making the Olympic team.”
“He’s got a bright future ahead of him,” O’Connor added. “He can do anything he wants to do. He can get the national title before he gets out of here and get All-American a couple of times.”
The Harvard wrestling team will be seeking new leaders on the mat with seniors O’Connor and Louis Caputo leaving, and it looks like Keith is just the man to do it. With this new find, the Crimson men’s wrestling team may have just struck gold.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“But on one weekend, as America and the world watched, a group of remarkable young men gave the nation what it needed most—a chance, for one night, not only to dream, but a chance, once again, to believe.”
Miracle is my favorite sports movie for a myriad of reasons. It has hockey, Olympic glory, and a cute actor playing the goaltender. What more could a girl want?
In all seriousness, the story of Miracle—a team of scrappy college players taking down the Russian powerhouse team in the midst of the Cold War—is one of the most compelling sports stories in recent history. And though historical context has elevated the 1980 US men’s hockey team to legendary status, every Olympics is filled with similarly-compelling stories. The Vancouver Games are no exception.
The Olympics have fascinated me ever since the 1996 Atlanta torch relay took a spin through my hometown. I remember excitedly standing on the side of the street with my family, waiting for the torch to be carried past. When I realized that the long wait had all been to see some random person in a tracksuit carry a tiny flame past, my seven-year-old self was understandably peeved.
Then the Games started. The US women’s gymnastics team won the gold medal. Kerri Strug became my new idol, and Olympic gymnast became my new dream profession—never mind the fact that I was about eight months removed from a broken arm sustained when I couldn’t get onto a balance beam properly.
1998. Nagano. Tara Lipinski won gold, I wanted to be an ice skater. To this day, I still can’t skate backwards.
2000. Sydney. I finally fixated on a sport I was actually capable of competing in—swimming. It took a few more seasons to convince me that if I wasn’t the best on my rec team, I wasn’t going to make the Olympics anytime soon.
Since then, I’ve given up the dream of making an Olympic squad myself. But the Games still capture my attention just as much as they ever did.
Over halfway through competition in Vancouver, I’ve done my best to keep up with the storylines: Apolo Anton Ohno’s record seventh medal, for example, or the surprise emergence of the American men’s hockey team.
But the sport that has drawn me in this time is one that’s a little less mainstream—women’s hockey. With all but the medal games left to play, the tournament has lacked the drama of the men’s competition, and there isn’t really a feel-good underdog story to draw viewers in.
Instead, the bracket has played out just as predicted—the Americans and the Canadians bulldozed all of their opponents to earn their spots in tomorrow’s gold-medal game.
So why the interest? Well, it has a lot to do with the five Harvard alumnae skating for the two squads. Having seen American Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 and Canadian Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 play for the Crimson, I find it that much cooler to watch them skate on national television. Interviewing the other three alums—US assistant captains Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04 and Julie Chu ’06-’07 and Canadian Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03—has also made me appreciate both the drive and the perspective the athletes bring to the competition.
And, of course, being able to watch my high-school cross-country teammate, US goalie Molly Schaus, live out her dream has been pretty amazing as well.
Because when it comes down to it, that’s what the Olympics are all about—watching dreams come true.
In professional sports these days, it seems that all too often athletes get wrapped up in the value of their next contract or endorsement deal and forget why they started playing in the first place. Stories of clubhouse antics, steroid use, and lockouts grab more headlines than the feel-good tales of perseverance, selflessness, and the love of the game.
When the Olympics roll around, it’s not about the money—or, for many competitors, about the medals. It’s about the chance to represent your country, to compete against the world’s best no matter the result, and to tell the story of how you got there.
That’s not to say that the Games are a perfect competition. Just last week, Russian figure skater Evgeni Plushenko publicly declared that he should have won the gold medal over eventual victor Evan Lysacek—a statement that doesn’t exactly scream “good sport.”
But in the Olympics, the touching stories far outweigh the rest. And to see one of those stories—like that of Chinese figure skaters Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao, who came out of retirement for one last shot at a gold medal—end in the fulfillment of a lifelong dream? Well, that’s why I love sports—and the chance to tell those stories, albeit on a smaller scale, is why I’ve stuck around The Crimson as long as I have.
So when I watch tomorrow’s women’s hockey gold-medal game, I’ll do my best to keep that sense of wonder in mind. For either squad, anything less than a top finish will be a disappointment—a dream unfulfilled. To work that hard for so long for one game? That sort of drama is as much a part of the fabric of the story of these Olympics as the tales of adversity and triumph.
But getting the chance to wear your country’s uniform in a celebration of the best sports has to offer? In that sense, the dream has already come true for every athlete in these Games.
“Any time you get a chance to be a part of the Olympic Games, [it’s] humbling in every way,” said Chu, a three-time Olympic veteran, in October. “It makes us realize that we’re just a small part of something that is much bigger than a win or a loss.”
Tomorrow night’s game probably won’t be remembered by the public as vividly as 1980’s Miracle on Ice. But for the women skating in it, it represents the same idea—a celebration of the belief that dreams really do come true.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the annual Heptagonal Championship only four days away, Sunday’s USATF New England Championships at Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track provided a perfect opportunity for members of the Crimson’s track and field teams to get one more race under their belt.
The meet was the last of seven local races setup through the winter to encourage participation in track and field for masters, open, and post-collegiate athletes alike.
While none of the races counted towards Harvard’s main schedule, there were still plenty of Crimson successes for both the men’s and women’s squad.
Sophomore Magdalena Robak ran the third fastest time, 1:00.53, in the 400-meter dash and finished eighth in the 200-meter. Junior Jamie Olson also earned a top finish, placing second in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:16.65.
Classmate Claire Richardson, who missed a chunk of the season with injuries and illness, placed second in the 1,500-meter run, a tune-up for next weekend.
Junior Kara Hollis, who also competed for the women, came in sixth in the long jump with a mark of 5.19 meters and ninth in the triple jump with a leap of 10.83 meters.
Junior Dan Chenoweth similarly used this past weekend to get back into running after suffering injuries. In the mile, Chenoweth led from start to end, posting a time of 4:13.73. Freshman Joe Brancale grabbed a personal record in the 5,000-meter race to finish the day on a high note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All five of Harvard’s 2010 Olympians will be playing for gold on Thursday.
Only two teams remain in contention for Vancouver’s top prize, and as predicted, the two-time defending world champion American squad will take on the favored Canadians in the gold-medal game.
As has become the norm in this Olympic tournament, Crimson alumnae featured prominently in both of yesterday’s semifinal wins.
In the early game, the US squad took on Sweden with revenge on its mind. The Swedes shocked the Americans in the 2006 Olympic semifinals, charging back from a 2-0 deficit to win the game in a shootout. It was the first time a US or Canadian squad had ever fallen to a non-North American opponent in international competition.
In 2010, the American women guaranteed that they would improve on their bronze-medal finish in Torino, routing Sweden, 9-1. With Swedish netminder Kim Martin, who plays for Minnesota-Duluth, not on her game, the door was open for the US offense—and the Americans capitalized.
Monique Lamoureux, who will suit up for the University of North Dakota next year, tallied a hat trick while all three Harvard players got in on the fun.
Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 led the way with a goal—a long shot from the point that banked off the top right corner of the cage and fell in—and an assist. Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04 tallied the team’s third goal, while Julie Chu ’06-’07 assisted on Kelli Stack’s third-period score.
In the nightcap, the vaunted Canadian offense hit a bit of a roadblock: Finnish goaltender Noora Raty, who excelled in the crease for the University of Minnesota this season before joining her national team.
Raty held the Canadians to five goals on 50 shots, but Finland’s offense offered the standout no support, and the hometown favorites advanced to the final with a 5-0 win.
Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 assisted on Haley Irwin’s goal, with the other assist credited to star Cornell forward Rebecca Johnston. Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03 was again quiet—the veteran has just one assist in these Olympics—but she will have the chance to earn her third-consecutive gold medal later this week.
The US and Canada will face off for Vancouver’s top prize at 6:30 pm EST on Thursday. The game will be broadcast live on MSNBC and nbcolympics.com.

Bored with Busch? Think Natural Ice is nasty? Reeling over Rubinoff?
Every day, we try to bring you news worth reading, but now we're going to try to give you news that you can drink. Every week, a local mixologist from a local bar or pub will put together a drink that they think represents a recent campus news item.
So sit back, grab a drink (that’s a virgin drink if you’re under 21) and enjoy this week’s Crimson Cocktail.
The Story:
The Crimson reported that party-hard Harvard students are going to University Health Services in droves, with freshmen comprising nearly half of the 102 hospitalizations from last semester.
The Drink:
Of-age drinkers would do well to avoid drinking straight rubinoff and set a good example for the dangerously inebriated freshmen class. The good men and women at Grafton Street Pub & Grill have the answer with their brand new Nuala Mule, a rhum and ginger alternative to beer. Grafton Street bartender Kyle Fletcher mixed the drink, which was designed by Kelly Sprouse, especially for FlyBy. Here’s how to make your own Nuala Mule:
Ingredients:
1. Measure out two ounces of Rhum Agricole and place in a rocks glass.
2. Pour in a half-ounce of pineapple juice.
3. Add three-quarters of an ounce of lime juice.
4. Top it all off AJ Stephans Ginger Beer.
5. Add a slice of lime for style.
Under 21-year-olds should replace the ginger beer with ginger flavoring and the Rhum Agricole with a similarly sweet drink for a virgin version of this cocktail.
Enjoy!
