After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In "A Hero of Our Time," Mikhail Lermontov follows the travels of Pechorin, an enigma passing through the Caucasus and leaving behind a trail of murder and heart-break. Lermontov meant the title–and the book–as trenchant social commentary: his character represents all the self-obsession, affectedness, and detachment of minor elites in early nineteenth century Russia.
As the presidential season begins in earnest, Pechorin has been on my mind. There’s one candidate who seems to fit his mold, who promises to update Lermontov’s creation, make it relevant to our day: Hillary Clinton. From the lack of principle to the internal contradictions, she has the outlines of such a protagonist. And perhaps her persona reveals some hard truths about American society.
Hillary has changed a lot during her time on the national scene. She was for trade deals. Now she’s against them. She used to fight gender-neutral language at the State Department. Now she tells the Human Rights Campaign, "[T]ransgender people are valued, they are loved, they are us." She once assailed Barack Obama for his derisive attitude toward gun culture. Now she attacks Bernie Sanders from the other side of the issue.
Questioned on her evolution, Hillary dissembles expediency as thoughtfulness. "I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what's happening in the world around me," she rapped to Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd. Usually, though, this latter-day Emerson prefers to forget about her past stances.
When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency, he stirred crowds with Fleetwood Mac's rock-anthem, "Don't Stop Thinkin' About Tomorrow." It's a fast-beat tune, with a booming chorus, "Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone." Hillary's managed to turn that refrain into an imperative. If her husband rigged the economy for the rich and ramped up mass incarceration, Hillary presents herself as the solution to those woes. That's when she's not invoking her work in the first Clinton administration as experience that qualifies her to helm a second one. But don't hold her accountable for those policies, defenders insist: That would be sexist.
Hillary has embraced that charge with alacrity. When Sanders said that “shouting” will do nothing to solve America’s gun problems, she reacted with a bad-faith, nonsense-on-stilts retort that connects well in this era of identity politics: "I haven’t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it’s shouting." Coded language can cover for sexism. But one statement hardly proves Hillary’s point and says more about the accuser than the accused.
Worse still, it distracts from her checkered record on women’s issues. During Bill’s administration, she backed a welfare reform that pitched millions of the fairer sex into deep poverty. Old friends from her tenure as an advocate for mothers and children turned on her. One of them quit a high-profile post in the Department of Health and Human Services. No matter: Aesthetics will substitute for progressive commitments.
And that’s helpful. Between the forgetting and evolving, not much remains on the résumé. In a list of seven of Hillary’s biggest accomplishments published on her Web site, five items focus on things she’s said (e.g., "women’s rights are human rights") or things that anyone else could have done (e.g., getting relief money for World Trade Center first responders). It reads like a promotional for a bust-town. There’s no merit to the place, so the ad stresses the soft and vague: the friendliness of the residents, the uniqueness of the cityscape, and general promises of betterment.
That’s left to some liberal pundits a task usually reserved to Russian literature mavens: The search for the authentic self. Hillary’s, that is. In "The Nation," Michelle Goldberg tried to put the candidate on the couch. Hillary has always been a progressive. Right-wing operatives scarred her, and forced her to over-correct in moving to the center. She can finally emerge in the twilight of the Obama period. According to New York Magazine’s Rebecca Traister, Hillary’s e-mails reveal how ordinary she is. She struggles with the fax machine, hankers for gefilte fish, and over-uses exclamation points. No one that banal could be so calculating.
Hillary is the face that launched a thousand think-pieces. But she’s greater than that. She has married the excesses of the activist left—a fixation on identity markers and terminology—with that shibboleth of corporate Democrats—value-free self-promotion. And in this synthesis, she’s become an aspirational figure to many. Whatever her fate in this election, Hillary is a hero of our time.

Last week, the Northeastern University Police Department announced that it would equip some officers with semiautomatic rifles in order to react effectively in the event of active shooter situations on campus. Northeastern is not the first Boston area university to expand its arsenal: The police forces of Boston University, Tufts University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Massachusetts, Boston, already carry semiautomatic rifles. But Northeastern’s decision is particularly notable because it comes in the wake of several high profile mass shootings, and without any coordination with the Boston Police Department or the community, both of which oppose the measure. Though we do not envy the job of university police departments in this age of political myopia around gun violence, Northeastern’s choice is a poor one that underscores just how unmoored from reality our response to mass shootings has become.
The most basic issue with Northeastern’s decision is that it is unnecessary. As Boston Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Michael McCarthy, quoted in the Boston Globe, put it, “I’m not sure I see the need to arm inner-city college campuses with these long guns when their officers already have firearms.” In other words, Northeastern’s officers already have guns, and equipping them with paramilitary weapons for which they will need additional training has no obvious connection to the force’s ability to protect students. Two BPD stations are located within two miles of Northeastern’s campus, and Boston police headquarters is only a half-mile away, making the school within easy reach of heavily armed SWAT teams should a situation develop.
Moreover, Northeastern showed enormous temerity in reaching this decision without consulting local police or community members, the two groups most likely to deal with any unintended negative consequences from the addition of more assault weapons to the area. Incidents like this summer’s killing of an unarmed, off-campus motorist by a University of Cincinnati police officer have a destructive effect on police-community relations and highlight the sometimes-tragic results of poorly trained officers and overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. This is not meant to suggest that the Northeastern police force is unprofessional in any way, but rather to acknowledge that the training of officers in urban neighborhoods demands far more attention, as do the Boston Police Department’s worries about increasing the number of heavily-armed officers in the city.
The Northeastern decision comes in a climate of increased fear on campuses nationwide after shootings like the October tragedy at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Colleges and their police forces are grasping for ways to protect students and receiving no support from lawmakers, who continue to fail in passing even the most basic gun control measures to stem the violence. While simply arming urban campus police with higher-powered rifles is a poor response to the problem, the search for solutions is understandable and reflects the total paucity of political movement on the issue.
Nonetheless, colleges and universities should have no part in furthering the destructive logic that posits more guns as the only sensible response to gun violence. If anything, more resources for mental health and student support may have a greater preventive effect given the backgrounds of school shooters like the one in Oregon. Ultimately, however, the solution to the problem of mass shootings lies in a real effort at gun control, not in the unnecessary arming of campus law enforcement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first singer I ever loved was Lauryn Hill, and by love, I mean want. Deeply. Fully. And forever. She broke up the word “reciprocity,” and it stained itself on the soft parts of my cognition. In her “Everything Is Everything” music video, her eyelids are this sweet shade of pink, and for months, I couldn’t stop thinking of the streets like a record, me spinning along some backbeat, the world whistling with me. In “Ready Or Not”, she has the most poetically mysterious verse ever, where she references Manifest Destiny and voo-doo, Gershwin and Nina Simone, in a single breath, effortlessly. And she was beautiful, the kind of beautiful that didn’t need to be mentioned, just felt, like the pinch of a smile.
But Lauryn Hill wasn’t just beautiful. Just slick, or deep, intellectual. Lauryn Hill made my heart ache, and that’s why I loved her, not just the cute parts but the bad parts too. When MTV Unplugged flopped. When she was jailed for tax evasion. When Rohan Marley said “I feel sad that I loved her so much and I faltered in expressing it to her somehow.” I wonder if what she’s expressing in “Neurotic Society” and “Consumerism” is less preachy than it sounds because I know how easy it is to think macrocosmically if you feel broken and disjointed inside. Sometimes talking about the world is easier than talking about yourself. Sometimes you say what you mean, but mostly, you don’t.
I may be learning that it’s easy to get numb. I’m at the end of my first semester in college, and I’m trying to be reflective. For the first time ever, if I’m bored, I have no one to blame but myself. No curfew. No permission needed to go places. No person’s feelings I have to protect. It’s easy in a place that wants you to be perfect, that grooms you so you may be, to become a robot. It’s sexy not to feel, to have zero tolerance for existential bullshit, to act on and on without the afterthought, but I think it’s also easier than it sounds. Humans have this ability to deny themselves what is natural and love things like dissonance, chaos, spicy food, and abstraction. They could probably tell themselves that feeling is unnecessary, boring, and mainstream too.
I grew up writing fiction. Older kids with subtle smooth senses of humor. Colors so brilliant they dazzled. Palm trees planted in the middle of the highway. People at the brink, the edge. I still believe that writing is asking, pleading, to be loved. To work to be loved. To have the right to be loved.
But regardless of those characters and words and scenes and plots and structures, I still don’t think I’ve pleaded enough. Like every writer who has ever existed, I don’t know what to feel about writing, because, yes, I do admit it’s selfish to believe your thoughts are important enough to merit a record, and yes, I don’t really think people care, and yes, most days, I have to convince myself that I actually do. I love it, but I wish I didn’t have to do it. I dread it, but I’ve convinced myself I can’t not do it. I haven’t tried to quit because I’m too selfish for that. I’m split on whether it would or would not work.
I once surprised myself by saying with too much conviction that most of writing is about being honest with yourself. I sounded like I’d thought about that statement for a really long time and decided it was finally worth living by, but the truth is, it came out like a laugh. So I asked myself later, quietly and after the nods, if it is ever enough to just be honest.
I used to believe, and maybe I still do, that only special types of people got to be honest, had the luxury to be. They were beautiful or rich, white or sensual. They were the people everyone else wanted to hold and get inside and coddle and cry over. They had the power to abandon and the nerve to get abandoned. They were privileged enough to believe there was no one else in the world that could replace them. They were naïve enough to think they could change lives. They were Tracey Emin with beautiful tits stuffing coins and bills up her pussy and E. E. Cummings sitting down to write “i like your body. i like what it does / i like its hows,” convinced it was innovation and not melodrama. Their rawness is breathless. Their rawness is captivating. I used to think it left no room for the rest of us.
I used to think you had to be perfect to be loved. To be opinionated. To have a column. To be impressive. To be important. Smart. Funny. Pretty. Useful.
But oh. Maybe I always knew I was wrong, even if I didn’t believe it. Because nothing I’ve ever loved has been perfect. Nothing I’ve ever wanted has been simple. My mother sneaking into my room at four o’clock the morning after a fight, whispering prayers that sounded too vague to be apologies, while I pretended to be asleep. Long, blonde, wavy hair. Lauryn Hill rapping about nepotism, despotism, racism, sexism, and all the isms, on a by-no-means-pretty-or-listenable track. Dorcas with acne scars like hoofmarks on her cheek. My best friend in high school who sent me emails, back when we were both in love with E. E. Cummings, with titles like “i m n rtist”, “more sad railroads”, “inner peace, or i want to get rich”, and “marion, salem, or.” My sister blasting more K-pop in every car ride because she claimed my music gave her a headache.
When I first saw Tracey Emin’s neon print of Just Love Me, I almost laughed because I thought she was the epitome of a dumb artist. She was pretty, angsty, and blissfully unaware that placing the words “just” and “love” together is like putting calculus in front of a kindergartner and threatening the poor kid with a stick. But then I immediately laughed at myself because, God, that was the point.
Just love me. Just be honest. It’s all expected, even necessary, isn’t it? It’s all the most natural things to do. But to let yourself go like that. To make yourself raw. Is there anything more difficult?
Maybe that is how writing has saved me. Me being honest by saying just love me. It’s a Sunday morning and my roommate’s gotten back from a night she describes as strictly chilling in Greenough and ordering Kong. I’ve got "Miseducation" playing, an album we both agree is the perfect weekend sound. I feel like I’m being hugged. 90s music is great because it’s rough around the edges. Youtube sound quality is awful, but it will do. I’m splayed cold on the carpet we need to vacuum, and Lauryn Hill is singing phrases that will stick to me for the rest of the day, if not the rest of the week, if not the rest of my life. Let me love you. Thank God I’m alive. You’re just too good to be true.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Annenberg Hall and at least some House dining halls, students are being treated to a healthy helping of social justice reeducation, courtesy of Harvard College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
College administrators distributed a “Holiday Placemat for Social Justice” instructing students on how to answer questions they might face from family and friends. The handout presents poorly written, straw man questions followed by seemingly official and definitive “responses” on topics as varied as the Syrian refugee question, the Black Lives Matter movement, the misguided decision to change the House master title, and the ongoing, overheated activism at Yale University. 
Before addressing the poorly contextualized framing of the questions, the impropriety of forcing College-endorsed political positions on students, and the groupthink this creates, let us examine the source.
More than half of the College’s poster is taken word-for-word from a similar, credited poster created by the group Showing Up for Racial Justice, a rather fitting reflection of the thoughtlessness it seeks to impose on students. That organization’s professed aim is to move “white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability.” To gain some perspective on their viewpoint, examine a recent article on their site that claimed, “we know that racist vigilantes and the police force have a long, collaborative history with one another.”
There was one area where the handout did not lazily lift from its predecessor: on the recent renaming of House masters to something supposedly less offensive—at least for now. There, the questioner correctly points out “Why did they change the name? What does a housemaster have to do with slavery? It’s not related to that at all.”
That doesn’t matter, the handout replies. Even though the word is “no longer actively associated with its historical antecedents”—and notice here the incorrect suggestion that the two were related, which is presented as fact—it is still offensive “for some.” Therefore, “it doesn’t seem onerous to change it.”
One can take that line of logic and run wild. Any professed claim of oppressive etymology should become actionable by the College on the grounds that it isn’t “too onerous.” Damn the facts, full steam ahead! That’s more than just revising history—that’s making a mockery of it.
Worse than the the quality of the arguments is the desired appearance that they are settled, and here is where the College's imprimatur is most disturbing. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not justify the sudden renaming of the House master title in any discernible way—and how could he when even its advocates must admit that the underlying word association is entirely false?
Some may say that this is exactly the job that the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion should be doing. Even if we concede that the office should be in the business of promulgating its views on diversity issues relevant on Harvard, it should be doing so in a less shallow and simplistic manner. And even then, what need is there for the office to have a view on Syrian refugees?
The discussion on student activism at Yale, which “adapts” almost exactly the language originally written about protests at Mizzou, poses the question as “Why are Black students complaining?” Of course, people who have real concern with demands to fire Nicholas and Erika Christakis or to rename Calhoun College do not speak that way. But no matter.
The handout shamefully parallels a similar tendency among activists to conflate well-meaning people who have the audacity to hold contrary opinions with racists and demagogues. Either you toe the party line, or your justifications don’t matter because you are too white, too male, or too privileged in some other way. Opponents of Yale activism are portrayed as racist, and those with concerns about Syrian refugees are painted as Islamophobic.
Even for those of us who agree with the handout on all its issues, this is an area for concern. There must be debate on these issues, at Harvard’s tables and in our homes. Presenting unglorified talking points not only wrongly attempts to stifle debate, but also stands in stark contradiction to the mission of the College to transform students “with exposure to new ideas, new ways of understanding, and new ways of knowing.”
Admissions officers often spin hagiographies of Harvard’s dining halls and the conversations we have in them as the most formative portion of a Harvard education. Yet that is exactly what is threatened by such recklessness.

UPDATED: December 19, 2015, at 11:14 p.m.
Samuel Cummings, a freshman at Yale, entered college knowing he wanted to learn more about computer science. One course, highly advertised on Yale’s campus at the beginning of the year, caught his attention, and he enrolled right away.
Cummings did not realize, however, how much time that course would take out of his schedule this fall, he said. “Its workload was definitely a lot and took a lot out of your week,” Cummings said. “I felt very accomplished at the end of the week.”
The course, CPSC 100a: “Introduction to Computing and Programming,” is an extension of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the flagship introductory computer science course at Harvard that has become as much a campus cultural phenomenon as a class, inspiring parodies and mock protests. This semester marked the first time that Yalies could count themselves among the hundreds of students who enroll each fall. 
And last week, as the course finished its inaugural semester at Yale, it seemed that Cummings was not alone in his sentiment. At Harvard, CS50 is known for its heavy workload of problem sets and quizzes, but at Yale, that may have come as more of a surprise. The Yale Daily News reported that students in the class found the coursework more intense and time-consuming than they expected from an introductory-level class.
“I know a lot of people signed up thinking it was going to be an easy intro class; they weren’t expecting the workload and the difficulty,” Cummings said. “It’s an intro class, but it’s a difficult intro class.”
Still, the course’s staff members said they were pleased with the Yale students’ performance over the semester.
Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14-’15, a former CS50 teaching fellow at Harvard who now works full time on the CPSC 100a staff at Yale, wrote in an email that he thought the course had a “very successful conclusion” with Yale’s CS50 Fair on Monday.
In addition to the site-specific sections, office hours, lunches, project fairs, and lectures—delivered in Sanders Theatre and often live-streamed to New Haven—the course staff on both campuses looked to collaborate this semester.
According to David J. Malan, the course’s instructor and a computer science professor of the practice at Harvard, CS50 fairs and hackathons brought together students from the two campuses. Brian Scassellati, CPSC 100a’s head instructor, did not respond to a request for comment.
For his part, Malan wrote in an email that he hopes the courses set a “wonderful precedent” for cross-university dialogue.
Andi Peng, a Yale student who serves as CPSC 100a’s head teaching assistant, said she was “pleasantly surprised” that she got to know the Harvard teaching staff well. “We saw them at two or three events,” Peng said, adding, “I’ve been going down to Harvard for office hours. I think that was more interaction than I thought going in.”
CPSC 100a was the first Yale course for which undergraduates served as teaching fellows, according to the Yale Daily News.
Maia Eliscovich Sigal, a Yale senior who studies economics, did not have experience with programming prior to enrolling in CPSC 100a this fall, and she said she enjoyed choosing how to learn the course material, whether through watching videos, stopping by office hours, or attending course lectures.
“The resources were out there, and I needed to find out what worked for me,” EliscovichSigal said.

After an unfounded bomb scare prompted the evacuation of several buildings in and around Harvard Yard last month, the Harvard University Police Department’s investigation into the case remains open, according to spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. 
The threat, sent via email, specifically targeted the Science Center and Sever, Emerson, and Thayer Halls. It prompted the cancellation of several classes as police searched the buildings before reopening the Yard and Science Center a few hours later.
For juniors and seniors, the threat was eerily similar to an incident in December 2013, when former College student Eldo Kim sent several Harvard affiliates an emailed bomb threat targeting the same four buildings during fall final exam period.
When last month’s bomb threat first unfolded, Catalano said officers were conducting an “active and ongoing investigation” to identify the origin of the threat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the semester coming to a close, some Harvard Law School students are continuing their push for changes they say will improve the school’s treatment of minority students, about a month after a high-profile racially charged incident shook campus.
In November, Law School students demanded a series of changes to the school, including replacing its controversial seal and creating a critical race theory program. Those demands, presented to the school’s administration at a recent town hall meeting, came as part of an activism effort that intensified after an incident involving pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black professors sparked broader discussion about race at the school.

Several weeks into the effort, the student activism has expanded in its reach and efforts. On Friday, more than a dozen students hosted a “teach-in” in the lobby of the office of Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, on whom students have called to do more to address their concerns.
For roughly an hour, students sat in the office and discussed the possibility of creating a critical race theory program at the school, according to Alexander J. Clayborne, one of the students organizing the protests. Clayborne said they spoke with Minow.
Minow had already met with some students about race relations at the school and made some proposals in response, including creating a committee to reconsider the school’s seal. Still, students are calling for further changes.
Beyond the Friday protest, student organizers have also launched a series of websites and social media pages about their efforts. A Twitter feed dubbed “@ReclaimHLS” features a series of photos of students with white boards stating why they became involved in the activism. The online pages are part of a broader effort to bring outside attention to the student movement, according to Clayborne.
“We’re just trying to raise awareness in any way that we can,” Clayborne said. “The idea is just to make sure that pressure from the outside is applied as well as from the inside.”
In an emailed statement, Minow wrote that she has been meeting with students and faculty members to “ensure inclusive and fair consideration of any ideas for change,” adding that she met with students for several hours last week and again Monday. Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, too, wrote in a statement that she and Minow have been working closely with students to discuss “what processes can work to achieve change at HLS.”
“With talent, hard work, patience, and humility, members of this community are proceeding with serious discussions that will enable all voices to be heard, and that will advance justice in our community and beyond our walls,” Minow wrote.
The final exam period has affected the student activism effort, according to Clayborne, but he said students have continued to meet with faculty members to discuss their list of demands. He said the group will continue to organize over break and that they are building momentum.
“We’ve become more organized over the past couple of weeks and we’re looking for ways to try and become more effective as a movement,” Clayborne said. “We’ll be here over J-term as well.”
The activism at Harvard Law School comes as racial tensions have flared on college campuses across the country. At Princeton, Yale, and Harvard College, students have challenged campus names and images with ties to slavery.
Clayborne pointed to recent developments at the College as a bellwether for change at the Law School. Earlier this month, Harvard’s undergraduate House masters unanimously agreed to change their title, which some students had criticized as being associated with slavery.
One of the primary demands of Law School students is removing the school’s seal, which they criticize for its ties to a slaveholding Harvard benefactor.
“Those kinds of things have been done right next door,” Clayborne said.  “Why can’t they happen here?”
Still, change to the seal will not come immediately, if it does at all. A committee researching the seal will make its recommendations in March, and the decision of whether to change it will ultimately rest with the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, according to Minow.
Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe argued in an email that changing the seal of a school is very different from changing a title.
“Renaming the position of ‘House Master’ to something less problematic like ‘Dean of the House’ is a lot easier than changing the school’s seal, which isn’t within the control of any dean or even the university president,” Tribe wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new study suggests online education may not be the panacea to income-based education gaps that proponents have claimed.
Published in the journal Science, the study found a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and the likelihood of enrollment in and completion of Massive Open Online Courses. The study examined U.S. residents enrolled in 68 online courses offered by Harvard and MIT through edX, the non-profit virtual education platform the schools co-founded in 2012.
Using census data and user-provided addresses, researchers John A. Hansen and Justin Reich found that those who lived in more affluent neighborhoods were more likely to register and complete MOOCs. For each $20,000 rise in a neighborhood’s median income, the odds of participation in a MOOC increased by 27 percent, according to the study. 
While the average MOOC user lives in a neighborhood with a median income $11,998 above the national average, the difference is $23,181 among 13 to 17-year-olds, an age range of critical importance in determining post-secondary focus, the researchers say.
EdX publishes online courses created by dozens of partner schools. HarvardX, also founded in 2012, is Harvard’s MOOC-production arm.
Three years since its founding, HarvardX has drawn some praise from administrators but is still not financially sustainable, and it has faced criticism from some professors for the large—and largely unpaid—time investment required to make courses.
Hansen and Reich’s study, which was conducted using enrollment data provided by Harvard and MIT, raises concerns that MOOCs “can exacerbate rather than reduce disparities in educational outcomes related to socioeconomic status.”
According to edX CEO Anant Agarwal, the study draws attention to a problem of which edX is already aware. Two-thirds of enrollees in edX MOOCs are “highly educated,” he wrote in a statement.
“We know that we have a long way to go to realize the promise of offering quality education to more people around the world without access or means,” Agarwal wrote.
According to Government professor Dustin Tingley, who oversees research on HarvardX pedagogy, part of the disparity in MOOC enrollment could be a result of the advanced nature of Harvard and MIT courses.
“We weren’t going to be offering courses in remedial education and auto mechanics,” Tingley said.
While Robert A. Lue, HarvardX’s faculty director, praised the study for “concretizing” the problem, Lue defended HarvardX’s contributions to access.
“To claim that we have not made a contribution to global access, in my opinion, is inaccurate,” Lue said.“To think that any one institution can solve the access problem, frankly, is naive.”
Technology alone is not enough to improve access, Lue said, citing HarvardX’s efforts with the Allston Ed Portal as a model for community-conducted support for online education.
Despite the concerns outlined by the study, Hansen said online education could still improve education disparities.
“Despite my finding, I think this is still something net beneficial to society, even if my findings aren’t the ones we wish were in the data,” Hansen said.
The researchers drew parallels between MOOCs and earlier attempts to democratize education through technology like radio and television courses.
“A new broadcast technology comes along, and at some point it seems that someone will say, ‘This poses great promise for reducing educational inequities in the country,’” said Hansen, a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Education.
The extent to which the impact of these broadcast technologies can be measured was unclear—until now, the researchers say.
“With MOOCs, it is nice because you actually have more data you can use to address it empirically,” Hansen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the close of a semester that saw a surge in racial tensions on college campuses nationwide, Harvard outfitted a number of dining halls with laminated guides printed with what purports to be advice for students discussing issues related to race and diversity with family members, but that some undergraduates decried as telling them what to think politically.
Adapted from a similar guide published by an activist group called Showing Up for Racial Justice, the placemats address controversial topics including student activism about race at Yale and other colleges, the debate over whether the U.S. should welcome Syrian refugees, and Harvard’s recent decision to change the title of its “House master” position. 
Dubbed “Holiday Placemat for Social Justice” and described as “a placemat guide for holiday discussions on race and justice with loved ones,” the placemats pose hypothetical statements on those topics and offer a “response” to each of those in a question and answer format. For example, under a section entitled “Yale/Student Activism,” the placemat poses the question, “Why are Black students complaining? Shouldn’t they be happy to be in college?” and suggests that students respond by saying, “When I hear students expressing their experiences on campus I don’t hear complaining.”
In the center of the placemat are what it calls “tips for talking to families,” with recommendations such as “Listen mindfully before formulating a thoughtful response” and “Breathe.”
The placemats are endorsed by Harvard administrators. The product of a collaboration between the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the Freshman Dean’s Office, the placemats first appeared in Annenberg last week. Jasmine M. Waddell, the freshman resident dean for Elm Yard, described the placemats’ goal as giving freshmen strategies for discussing those issues with their families over winter break.
“This is a way to say, ‘You’ve been exposed to a lot of different ideas, and particularly in this moment when there’s a lot of discussion about various topics, you’re going to go home and you may or may not be able to speak the same language,’” Waddell said. “It’s not that you have to believe in what’s on the placemat, but it gives you some tools to be able to have productive conversations.”
Waddell added that the Freshman Dean’s Office decided against emailing the placemats directly to students, instead installing them in Annenberg without comment as a piece of “passive programming.”
Some students, such as Ivraj S. Seerha ’19, praised the placemats and their stances; other were not so positive.
Aaron I. Henricks ’16 said he found the publication of the placemats by an official Harvard office “beyond inappropriate and arrogant,” criticizing their one-sided presentation of “highly debateable subjects.” The placemats offer a single response to each proposed question.
“I don’t think that’s the place of any Harvard employee to tell students the right way to think about the Syrian refugee crisis. That’s ridiculous to me,” Henricks said, referencing a statement on the placemat that reads “Racial justice involves welcoming Syrian refugees.”
Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion, said the placemats do not express any official positions of the College. Still, she said their recommendations are in line with recent statements Harvard administrators have made in support of students of color.
“We’ve expressed support for black students on campus very visibly, for Muslim students during a time that’s difficult for them, and the House masters themselves voted to change their title,” dela Peña said. “I think the sentiments in the placemat are in line with the spirit of things that have been expressed to students.”
Dela Peña also maintained that they are not forcing students to hold any one opinion.
“It’s not about stifling opinion, but about giving us a starting point,” dela Peña said. “Some students might not find it helpful, and that’s OK too. But if they’re sparking dialogue across campus or even just in the dining hall, I think we’ve done a good job by helping students to have difficult conversations.”
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 acknowledged that some statements on the placemats, such as the one on Syria, may be controversial, but said others, like the quadrant defending Yale student activists, were more rooted in fairness than politics.
Waddell, too, maintained that the placements are “residential education but not indoctrination.”
Dela Peña said she received positive feedback on the placemats from freshmen like Seerha, prompting her to forward them to the masters of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential Houses. A number of Houses, including Dunster, Currier, and Mather, elected to print the placemats or display them on television screens in their dining halls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than two and a half months after the expiration of their previous contract, members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers remain engaged in “very frustrating” contract renegotiations with the University, HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said Monday.
“The union has repeatedly and energetically put forward different frameworks for compromise,” Jaeger said. “The University is not expressing any willingness to agree to any kind of reasonable compromise.” 
Jaeger added that talks will likely be forced to continue in January after the winter break, meaning that employees will have worked for a year and three months without being eligible for wage increases.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said in an emailed statement that the University and its largest union are “working through challenging issues in constructive discussions.”
“While important issues remain to be resolved, we have made significant progress,” Lapp wrote in a statement. “We are committed to continuing to engage in good faith negotiations for a contract that ensures HUCTW fair and competitive wages, health care and benefits, and also supports the core academic mission of the University.”
Lapp added that while talks continue, the union’s existing contract will continue to remain in place.
Jaeger said that the main hurdle for reaching an agreement continues to be health care, an ongoing theme of the talks which commenced in the spring.
Debate over University health care coverage has not been limited just to union employees in recent months. In the fall of 2014, a University-proposed restructuring of health care benefits for non-union employees inspired backlash from employees and faculty alike. Early this fall, the University announced that it would revise that approach for the coming year, maintaining the options introduced in 2014 but offering other plans as well.
Still, Jaeger said that HUCTW negotiators hope to work out a health care design that does not mirror the one currently in place for non-union employees.
“Our members are very strongly unified in their view that we can and we need to build a better health plan than what the University has designed for the non-union employees, that that’s actually a destructive plan that takes things in the wrong direction,” Jaeger said.
One problem with the proposed plan, said Jaeger and union organizer Carrie E. Barbash, is cost shifting.
“Their proposals still present a total package which doesn’t seem affordable to our members,” Barbash said. “We’re still very worried that the kinds of proposals the University is making create a situation where some members may not go to the doctor because of the price, and that’s a serious concern.”
Barbash added that for some HUCTW members, higher priced health care could lead to a choice between skipping necessary care or taking on debt.
“We don’t feel that people should have to make choices like that, especially at a place like Harvard,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Fox Club shut its doors on JFK Street in mid-November, just weeks after its student leadership had made the historic decision to admit women to the once all-male institution, the off-campus final club’s undergraduates were pitted against their alumni. 
Undergraduate leaders, determined to make the move to go co-ed after more than a year of ongoing discussion and research and some added pressure from Harvard administrators, saw pushback from the club’s graduate leadership, who closed the clubhouse amidst controversy over the decision and assigned new members a provisional status.
Behind the graduate board action to close the club, though, was more division.
Some club alumni had worked alongside undergraduate leaders as Harvard administrators pressured them to admit women, weighing available options and acknowledging that the club might indeed go co-ed despite the opposition of many graduates.
Not all alumni, however, were so receptive, dozens of emails and internal club correspondence recently obtained by The Crimson reveal. Pressure from Harvard administrators, who have increasingly criticized the College’s unrecognized social scene, has rattled the governance structures of the 117-year-old Fox Club.
As Fox undergraduates lobbied to admit women to their membership this fall, graduate board leaders struggled to toe the line with a group of other alumni who organized their own platform in opposition of the change. That group of alumni, who call themselves the “Friends of the Fox Club,” repeatedly pushed for the club to curtail any immediate plans to go co-ed, staunchly opposed to leaving the decision in the hands of undergraduates alone. They called foul when the undergraduates voted to admit women, saying the move blindsided and effectively circumvented the graduate membership, with whom they claim the right to make any major decision about the club’s future rests.
The Friends of the Fox organized an arm of alumni and quickly took action, calling for a special meeting to discuss the pressures facing the club and the ongoing discussions about a membership change. They emailed club graduates en masse, organized their own website, and called on the club graduate board to postpone the upcoming initiations of prospective women members.
Partly couching their disagreement in concerns about liability, the Friends of the Fox called on the club to slow down, arguing that undergraduates could not admit women to their ranks without a two-thirds vote of the graduate membership.
“As graduates, we must act upon our sense of duty to protect the club that we love and not allow it to be hijacked by a small group of undergraduates who were only just invited into our membership and still have yet to scratch the surface of the club’s legacy,” the group wrote in a confidential presentation distributed ahead of the special meeting.
At the heart of their critique is a fundamental disagreement over the role and purpose of the Fox Club. To this faction of club alumni, the institution belongs foremost to its graduates, not the students who frequent it day to day. The current state of affairs at the Fox is precarious, marked by leadership turnover, tensions over the club’s move to go co-ed still raw.
‘SUPPORT THE UNDERGRADUATES’
When some Fox undergraduates advocated to admit women to their membership in 2014, their graduate board was less than enthusiastic about the proposal. Rev. Douglas W. Sears ’69, then the president of the Fox’s graduate board, told one undergraduate leading the push to go co-ed to draft a report detailing the specifics on how the club would ever make that change.
Undergraduates, it seems, did just that, writing an extensive report outlining their answers to potential “logistical concerns” of the transition, ranging from questions about clubhouse bathroom arrangements to necessary changes to its selection and initiation procedures.
This fall, with pressure from Harvard on final clubs to go co-ed mounting, Fox undergraduates renewed their call. This time, some club graduate leaders worked with them to navigate the growing administrative scrutiny. Some graduate board members spoke with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, among the most prominent critics of final clubs, according to email correspondence among club alumni; one alumnus, Rex G. Baker ’05, was tasked with acting as a liaison between undergraduate and graduate club members and offered the students his hand, even driving to the club to offer his help, he told club affiliates in an email message in late November.
Graduate board leaders, they later told other club alumni in a memorandum, believed that the decision to go co-ed ultimately rested with undergraduates, citing a provision in the club’s constitution that gives undergraduate members “complete control of the election of new members” and the fact that it included no explicit prohibition on the election of women to the club.
Still, arguing that a move to go co-ed could be seen as one that “would change the fundamental nature or character of the Club,” graduate board members thought they should seek a vote of club alumni, as their bylaws require in the case of such a dramatic change, the memo says.
After undergraduates told them in mid-September that they “intended to open the Club to female members,” graduate board leaders voted, seven to one, to “support the undergraduates” as long as women were not elected before the broader graduate membership had a chance to vote on the matter and approved it with two-thirds in support, according to the memo.
The graduate board scheduled a meeting for Nov. 22. Although they urged undergraduates to wait until this date to go ahead with their plans to admit women, the students moved forward with their plan. On Oct. 19, they wrote a letter to club alumni, informing them of their decision and pitching the move as stemming from the firm belief that it was the “right thing to do” and expedited by pressure from Harvard.
“The Fox now has an opportunity to gain an impressive class of women Foxes, women you all would be proud to count as fellow members,” the undergraduates wrote.
Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16 and Patrick E. Dowling ’16, then the Fox’s undergraduate president and vice president, did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
‘FRIENDS OF THE FOX CLUB’
At the time, undergraduates hinted at graduate member dissent, citing in their letter alumni who had discussed shuttering the club and making it a graduate group only. Internal emails recently obtained by The Crimson show that the pushback to which they alluded was in fact sizeable, especially among a contingent of alumni members who fundamentally disagreed with the move and rallied for its reversal, or at least for a pause.
In particular, a vocal contingent of club alumni known as the Friends of the Fox, mostly composed of graduates from the late 1970s and early 1980s, was opposed. That group did not readily accept the urgency that the undergraduates described as a reason to expedite the move to go co-ed and rejected the arguments of Harvard administrators who pushed for it.
Even before the graduate board leadership planned to ask alumni to meet on Nov. 22 to vote on whether the club should go co-ed as its undergraduates proposed, the Friends of the Fox were organizing.
In September, one club alumnus had distributed a proposal for how the club could respond to the ongoing pressures from Harvard, titled “The Fox Club: Planning for our Future.” That proposal laid out a timeline for discussion—one much longer than that proposed by undergraduates—involving the work of various sub-committees and focus groups to draft suggestions and present them to the broader membership before reaching any decision in early June.
Alumni affiliated with Friends of the Fox petitioned in early October to call for a special meeting about potential changes to the club. They called on 20 or more Fox members to affirm the request.
A couple of weeks later, on Oct. 22, Fox Club leaders forwarded a notice from a group of alumni, primarily graduates in the late 1970s and early 1980s, calling for a special meeting to outline the future of the club in light of existing pressures and undergraduate plans.
“Over the past few weeks, a number of voices have stated that the time for discussion has passed, that things are moving too quickly, the University is forcing our hand, the undergrads may get kicked out of school, etc. Despite these pressure tactics, due process is both essential—and a requirement,” the group of Fox alumni wrote.
The Fox members referenced the Fox Club graduate board association’s bylaws, which they wrote stipulated “action that would fundamentally alter the nature or character of the corporation of the Fox Club” requires a graduate board vote. They argued that going co-ed would constitute such a change.
The group of alumni attached an updated version of the September “Planning for our Future” proposal to the message. In the email, they argued that accepting an undergraduate move to go co-ed before convening would be premature.
“Precipitous action taken in advance of a false deadline and prior to the November special meeting will seriously divide the Club and put its future at risk. That would be a tragedy,” the group concluded.
‘UTTER DISREGARD’
The Fox undergraduates moved ahead, accepting women as members before that meeting, and the graduate board struggled to recalibrate, prompting even more criticism from other angry alumni, correspondence indicates.
Undergraduates had scheduled to initiate their new female members on Oct. 31, and ahead of that date, graduate board leaders received requests to cancel or stall it, according to a late October email from the board of directors and multiple other internal messages from club affiliates obtained by The Crimson.
The graduate board elected to allow the planned initiation to proceed, but they reached a compromise first: All new members—both male and female—would hold a “provisional” status, contingent on the “full graduate body” voting on whether they should be converted to full members in the spring. Sears, meanwhile, was replaced as graduate board president by Hugh M. Nesbit ’77.
As those negotiations unfolded, the Friends of the Fox crafted their arguments against the change and how it was made. Ten days before the planned special meeting on Nov. 22, the Fox graduate board sent an email to alumni on behalf of the Friends of the Fox. That message contained a 12-page, password-protected document, signed by the Friends of the Fox Club and labeled “PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL.”
The presentation, which decries the process by which the club initially moved to go co-ed, described the Friends of the Fox and their agenda: “We are [a] grass roots group of Fox Club graduates that spontaneously and informally coalesced, united in our purpose of furthering the object of the club we hold dear: to bring together men of high standards and congenial tastes, to promote good fellowship, and to form lasting friendships,” they wrote.
Using strong language and holding back no criticism, the group lambasted Harvard and the Fox’s own undergraduates, who they argued had acted too quickly and against the spirit of the organization’s governance structures—namely, without the approval of its graduates. They also questioned the efficacy of the Fox’s graduate board leadership, calling them complacent in what they characterized as a deeply flawed process behind the membership change.
“It seems clear that Harvard has flexed its muscle with the Final Clubs in unprincipled and pernicious ways, using its institutional machinery and bully pulpit to harass undergraduate Final Club members while seeking to enrich itself by improving its image somehow,” they wrote under the heading “The Perils of Bad Governance.”
“We lament that Harvard has provided the dictatorial impetus for bludgeoning our undergraduate members, causing them to themselves behave like despots,” they added.
According to the Friends of the Fox, club undergraduates had shown “utter disregard” to the directives of the club’s graduate board association and presented a “fait accompli.” The Fox’s graduate board, the presentation also argued, “has been pliant and has failed to provide the stalwart leadership and judicious guidance that our undergraduate members so sorely needed during this difficult time.”
Again referencing the Fox graduate association’s bylaws, the Friends of the Fox argued in the presentation that a serious membership change, such as admitting women, would need graduate approval. They also argued that the bylaws prohibited undergraduates from voting on such changes and that power ultimately rested in the hands of the club’s graduate members since the bylaws exclude undergraduates from the definition of “Club Members.”
“Fundamentally, the Fox is run by graduates for the benefit of undergraduates and graduates alike. The undergraduates’ actions wholly miss that critical point,” they wrote.
Although critical of what it characterized as administrative pressure on final clubs to admit women, the presentation alleged that Fox undergraduates had cited a “false” deadline from the University to go co-ed. The document, referencing legal arguments similar to the defense recently offered by a graduate member of the A.D. Club, argued that the Fox had the right to remain all-male and challenged undergraduates who disagreed to leave.
“Undergraduates who do not like the policies or the membership composition of the Fox Club have numerous other options for socializing both on- and off-campus,” the presentation stated in bold typeface.
“The long arc of the Fox’s storied 118-year history stands to be bent or broken over the coming days and weeks. Whatever the final outcome, it is important decisions are reached through a fair and due process,” they wrote.
On Nov. 14, two days after the Friends of the Fox shared their message and one day after a controversial party, the graduate board shut down the Fox clubhouse on JFK Street until at least the start of 2016.
LEADERSHIP TURNOVER
A group of roughly 80 club alumni eventually gathered on Sunday, Nov. 22, at the Sheraton Commander Hotel in Cambridge to discuss those and other concerns. According to an email a week later from the club’s board of directors, Nesbit chaired the meeting, and the club’s secretary took attendance, for which there was a quorum.
The graduate members who called the meeting, according to the message, presented three “non-binding” resolutions for attendees to discuss. The first resolution endorsed the “Path Forward” report with 99 percent of the 300 members—many voting by proxy—supporting it. Ninety-five percent of voters supported a second resolution that “called for the Graduate Board to take appropriate measures to ensure proper use of the Clubhouse and the safety of all members.”
A third resolution directly addressed the question of the club going co-ed, asking voters whether such a move should require a two-thirds vote of approval from the graduate membership. That resolution passed, according to the message, with 54 percent voting in favor, 45 percent opposed, and 1 percent abstaining.
Beyond the meeting, the divide over the question raised in the third resolution seems to have had an impact on the Fox’s leadership. Over the course of the semester, several leaders at the graduate level have departed. Beyond Sears’s replacement, Baker—the young alumnus who interfaced with undergraduates throughout the debate—also resigned.
Baker did not respond to a request for comment on this story, but in a nearly 5,000-word message to graduate members ahead of the Nov. 22 meeting, he detailed an internal history of the club’s push to go co-ed and his reasons for resigning.
Prior to undergraduates’ decision to circumvent the graduate board, Baker wrote that he had met with undergraduates and told them he supported the move to co-ed and would “advocate for them and communicate their position to the rest of the grad board and the graduate community generally.”
Arguing that controversy over the mid-November party was in fact a proxy for opposition to the undergraduates’ decision to admit women, Baker wrote that he resigned after photographs of the event found their way to Nesbit and some affiliates of the Friends of the Fox called for the club to be shut down.
“I voted in favor because I didn’t want to run the risk of further escalation of graduate aggression and misbehavior. I resigned a couple of hours later,” Baker wrote.
Since the clubhouse shut down last month, unexpectedly cancelling the planned initiation of its most recent male punch class, its future has remained unclear.
On Dec. 8, Fox graduate leaders told club affiliates that they had opened the club temporarily so that undergraduates could elect new officers, and they would likewise move ahead with initiating 24 new men at a dry event on Dec. 12. As of that message, however, the club was still closed.
“We will have more to say shortly about additional conditions for reopening the Club,” the graduate leaders wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicky Maxwell, a College freshman, will become the first NCAA-certified athlete in track and field history to compete with a prosthetic running device when he makes his debut for the Harvard men’s team in January.
The NCAA Rules Committee approved a request from Harvard in June to allow Maxwell to compete with the device, determining that it would not provide the freshman with a competitive advantage over his opponents. Maxwell’s case will be reevaluated each year, but he will be eligible to run for the entirety of this season and will have the ability to qualify for the NCAA Championships.
While the decision was looming, Maxwell spent the summer in the spotlight of the NCAA Rules Committee as a sprinter. Just months later, the freshman was commanding the spotlight on the dance floor of Annenberg Hall as a surfer.
Stop to chat with him at the Halloween dance in a decorated “Haunted Hall,” and he would have gestured to his amputated leg and explained with a cheeky grin and a smooth British accent that he lost it in a gory shark attack.
Yet his prosthetic was not just part of a particularly realistic Halloween costume. Maxwell had his leg amputated when he was 15 months old due to fibular hemimelia, a condition that involves the shortening or complete lack of the fibula, or calf bone.
“I like to have a bit of fun with it, I don’t see much point in taking it too seriously,” the London native says. “I was lucky enough to have a family whereby it wasn’t like they were keen on it not being an issue—they just never treated it as an issue. I never felt at all that there was anything that different about me.”
With the encouragement of his parents, Maxwell began his athletic career at a young age. Growing up, he was an active rugby player until he suffered a series of knee injuries around 2010. After his doctors told him that continuing to play rugby would only cause further injury, he found himself without an outlet for sport for the first time in his life.
“I sat around and tried to figure out what I would do,” Maxwell said. “This was right after 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, which was the first time I saw Para-athletics properly. Running seemed kind of a natural way to follow that up.”
Under the guidance of experienced coaches, Maxwell turned his attention to sprinting. During his high school career, he competed for the Wellington and Bracknell Athletic Club in the 100, 200, 400, and 6x100 meter events.
During that time, Maxwell competed in multiple T44 national championships, races for athletes who either have had a single amputation below the knee or walk with moderately reduced function in one or both legs. In 2013, he won a T44 national championship at the under-17 level in the 100-meter race, also taking second place in the 200.
Around the same time, Maxwell began considering his college plans. Remaining in England was an option, but despite the existing structural support there—Team Great Britain ranks second on the all-time Paralympic Games medal table—Maxwell was drawn to studying in the United States and receiving a more well-rounded education. 
“I was interested in the balance between athletics and academics. The U.S., and particularly somewhere like Harvard, is really unmatched in doing that,” he explained. “My other choice was Oxford, and as much as I wanted to go there, they just don’t support athletics in the same way…. The concept of a student-athlete is very foreign.”
That is how Maxwell found himself at Harvard men’s sprints coach Marc Mangiacotti’s door last summer, in hopes of pursuing both academic excellence and racing.
“I explained who I was, and totally on a hoof he took me around for an hour and showed me around campus and told me about what opportunities we had here at Harvard,” Maxwell recalled. “Coach Mang is a huge part of the reason why I came to Harvard.”
Despite never having worked with a Paralympian before, Mangiacotti has a personal connection to the Paralympics that led him to be particularly open to working with Maxwell.
“My willingness to meet with Nicky comes from a friend of mine, Joe LeMar, who was a Paralympic gold medalist and former world record holder in the 400 and 800,” he explained.
One of Mangiacotti’s best friends from high school, LeMar had his foot amputated during his senior year, not long after winning the state championships in track and field. He then went on to compete in the Paralympics, winning the 400-meter event in the summer of 1992.
“I think that relationship I have with Joe opened up the door for Nicky to have a conversation with me,” Mangiacotti said. “And the main goal of my conversation with Nicky while I was showing him around the facility was to find out if he had a championship mentality.”
While Maxwell’s times indicated that he would be more competitive in Paralympic races than he would at NCAA championship events, Maxwell’s “championship mentality” sealed the deal for Mangiacotti.
“Though he may not be training for the NCAA championships, which would be great, the reality is he’s training for the Para-championships,” Mangiacotti said. “So therefore he brings a championship mentality and a passion for the sport, and we welcome people like that in Harvard Athletics—and Harvard track and field.”
Although Maxwell is the first Paralympic athlete Mangiacotti has worked with, the fourth-year coach says that the freshman’s transition to college athletics has been smooth and that having Maxwell on the roster makes the Crimson a better team.
“We have very good conversations about things he’s tried in the past and what has worked and hasn’t, so we do have to make some modification,” Mangiacotti said. “But I think that people would be surprised that he can do everything that other people can do, just with small modifications.”
“Whether it’s lifting weights, or whether I have a bag of different hand aids or straps that I’d use as I was going through different sports, or becoming a better athlete, I’ve realized that if I need to do this exercise, I just need to adapt it and find a way to make it work,” Maxwell explained. “There’s really very little stuff that you can’t do.”
The NCAA’s ruling to allow Maxwell to compete—considered an interpretation of an existing rule—is far from a solidified precedent for Paralympians and runners with prosthetics. The question of whether athletes with prosthetics can compete against able-bodied athletes remains controversial in the track and field community for fear of some athletes gaining an unfair advantage. The current decision makes clear that future cases will be decided on an individual basis.
Yet Maxwell’s case still represents a step towards increasing the number of Paralympians in the NCAA, and it offers a glimmer of hope for athletes with disabilities who aspire to play at the collegiate level.
“[The ruling] is something I’ve been pretty naïve to, and I’m only starting to realize its significance,” he explains. “I’m hopeful that as a result, it can start having Para-athletics be a significant part of what the NCAA wants to do in competition.”
And for Maxwell, his hope is that some day he will enter the world of professional athletics.
“Honestly, my ambition is that I would like to be a professional athlete,” he says. “I will find out in the next couple of years whether I have a realistic opportunity to do that. If that is the case, I would love to pursue that with everything I have.”
But the sprinter also remains refreshingly realistic.
“One thing that I will emphasize is that I’m not the next big thing in Para-athletics,” he says modestly. “I love my sport, I love competing, but at least right now I’m not running times that suggest I’ll break a world record or anything.”
For now, he is enjoying his time as a student at Harvard, writing for Satire V, training for competitions this winter, and convincing people at parties that he lost his leg in a shark attack.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­In 1916, minutes before taking the field, Yale football coach Thomas Albert Dwight “Tad” Jones told his team, “Gentlemen, you are now going to play football against Harvard. Never again in your whole life will you do anything so important.”
Hyperbole aside, his words still capture the sense of significance that one matchup each year bears for the Crimson and the Bulldogs. The Game brings with it a feeling of importance and tradition that inspires players to on-the-field heroics and elevates the energy and turnout of the students in the stands.
At the heart of the excitement and drama lies a rivalry that stretches back a century and a half. Although football may be the most salient part of this competition, the rivalry is a tradition between the two  Ancient Eight schools that runs deeper than the gridiron.
The rivalry between Harvard and Yale runs all the way back to the inception of intercollegiate sports in the United States.
In 1843, Yale founded its own boat club, the first in the country. A year later, Harvard did the same.
The two teams practiced on their own until 1852, when the Bulldogs issued a challenge to the boat club in Cambridge.
The crews met on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire for a two-mile race, the country’s first intercollegiate sporting competition. The Crimson crew emerged victorious, and the Harvard and Yale rowing teams would continue to race one another for more than 150 years, establishing not only a rivalry between the two colleges, but also college sports in the United States.
Although many universities had sports teams in those days, none of them competed against one another until the Crimson and the Bulldogs raced on Lake Winnipesaukee. Harvard and Yale’s first boat race inspired other institutions of higher learning to face off athletically, and the two schools played leading roles in the development of college sports themselves. Between them, the Crimson and the Bulldogs participated in the country’s first intercollegiate games of hockey, soccer, and five-on-five basketball.
Today, with the tradition of intercollegiate athletics well established, Harvard and Yale meet annually to carry on the rivalry established in 1852, not only on the football field and on the water, but also in almost all of the Crimson’s 42 varsity sports.
For many of Harvard’s teams, the contest against the Bulldogs is the biggest of the year. This was arguably true for the 2014-2015 men’s ice hockey team. The Crimson met Yale on the ice three times in the first half of last season and came away with the same number of losses. However, the teams squared off again in the best-of-three ECAC playoffs, and Harvard took the first game. The Bulldogs clawed back to win the second contest, but a double overtime goal from junior forward Jimmy Vesey lifted the Crimson to a dramatic victory in the third and propelled Harvard towards the ECAC championship.
“It’s definitely [one of] the most memorable games of hockey that I’ve ever played in,” Crimson co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “Those games are something that I’ll talk about for the rest of my life. I think the emotions in that locker room after the [last quarterfinal] game were probably similar to the ones after winning the championship.”
According to Criscuolo, the team’s satisfaction in the win stemmed perhaps more from snapping a 10-game losing streak against Yale than from advancing to the next round of the tournament.
Although the hockey situation of March 2015 was a particularly notable result, games against the Bulldogs bring similar levels of excitement for many of Harvard’s other varsity teams.
Part of the thrill comes from the boost that teams get in numbers of spectators when they take on Yale. Harvard women’s basketball’s win over the Bulldogs at Lavietes Pavilion last year drew nearly twice as many spectators as any of the team’s other games, while the women’s volleyball squad saw 100 more people turn out  to the Malkin Athletic Center for its home matchup against the Ivy League foe this season than for any of its other regular season contests.
“Whenever it’s our Yale game, we get more fans that come out just because of the long history of the rivalry,” women’s volleyball co-captain Caroline Holte said. “That makes the game that much more exciting to play in.”
The unusually large crowds of fans help to make games against Yale notably electrifying, but traditions within Harvard teams may do even more to build excitement for contests against the Bulldogs.
Building on the buzz of playing in front of a full house, veteran Crimson players often fan the flames of the rivalry to ensure that younger players compete especially fiercely against Yale.
“My freshman year, I was immediately brainwashed into hating Yale,” Holte said. “Right at the beginning of the preseason, we were told that Yale is our enemy. It’s sort of just ingrained in you, and you don’t really know why, but they’re always your enemy.”
The practice of portraying Yale as a primary enemy to new players is common among Harvard teams. Casting the Bulldogs as hated opponents is useful as motivation during hard training and can create a common purpose for a squad.
This habit of building up antagonism towards Yale among freshmen players helps to explain the notable fierceness of a rivalry that has endured for more than a century and a half.
Although the Harvard rowers from 1852 would not even recognize many of the sports in which the Crimson and the Bulldogs compete today, they would likely find that they share something with their modern counterparts—an overwhelming desire to defeat Yale.
“When you step on the court against Yale, there’s a feeling that you want to beat them more than anyone else, purely because of the fact that they’re Yale,” Holte said. “This is a long-lasting rivalry, and it’s something that we take really seriously. Any time we can take them down, it’s just immediately sweeter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 16, 2015, at 3:51 p.m.
­As soon as the final whistle sounded in Harvard’s 6-0 win over Penn on Nov. 14, Crimson men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer began thinking ahead to his team’s next game.
But he wasn’t looking ahead to the next week, or even the next month. Rather, he had his sights set on next September.
Lehrer isn’t one to dwell on the past or even recent successes for too long. Despite the fact that his team finished the 2015 season with a flourish, it will be business as usual when he returns to the office. Though Lehrer must bid farewell to his largest senior class since joining the Crimson–and find a way to replace each departing player–it will be just like any other offseason for him.
This forward-looking mindset is the same one that has taken him through a stint as a professional soccer player in Europe, the same one that helped him become an Olympic qualifier in sprint canoeing, and the same one that is now driving his burgeoning coaching career.
It is also the same one that the Harvard men’s soccer program now lives by.
Ross Friedman, a captain during Lehrer’s first year in charge of the team, recognized the potential benefits of the UCLA grad’s methods right away.  Despite spending just one of his four collegiate seasons with Lehrer, Friedman continues to call him every week.
“Everything is an ongoing process for Pieter, not just on the field but off it as well,” Friedman explained. “He always used to ask us, ‘How’s your process?’ about everything – about what we were doing at practice, about how our classwork was going.”
The results of Lehrer’s “process” speak for themselves. The Crimson has secured three top-three finishes in the Ivy League in as many years with him at the helm. The two years before, the team had gone winless in conference play and finished dead last in both seasons.
The biggest change Lehrer implemented upon arriving in Cambridge was not on the field, but, rather, off of it.
“One thing that still sticks out in my mind about Pieter is how he changed the atmosphere around the team,” Friedman recalled. “It was a pretty tough culture to play in before he got here, but he was able to turn that into something positive, not just with how [the players] treated each other on the field, but also in the locker room, dorm rooms, classrooms.”
While his new players might have been surprised with the transition, these quick improvements were exactly what Lehrer had come to expect in all facets of his life.
OLYMPIC MINDSET
Even for those who are familiar with him and his ”process,” it is still astonishing to recount one particular accomplishment, which he made not on
the field, but in the water.
After his soccer career abroad stalled, Lehrer returned to the States with a new goal in mind.
“I knew my time in Europe was over,” Lehrer remembered. “No team wanted to sign me, and I was back home in the spring of ’94. I could’ve went into business, or coaching, but there was one thing I wanted to do more than anything else – make the Olympics.”
It was an idea Lehrer, his brother Jacob, and his sister Heidi had toyed with since their childhoods, and one they decided to take a final shot at.
But it was 1994, halfway through the Olympic training cycle, and the three siblings didn’t want to wait six years.
1996 was the time to do it.
The Lehrers looked through their options for sports to compete in, trying to find one in which they could train to an Olympic level in less than two years. They ultimately chose sprint canoeing, deciding to compete for Antigua and Barbuda. Then, the real work began.
Luckily for the siblings, however, they were coached by the best. It wasn’t easy to find Andy Toro, who they came across after meeting with fifteen other coaches. In Toro, Lehrer also found a man he would look up to for the rest of his life.
“[Toro] was the US national team coach at the time, the best in the business, and we asked him to train us.” Lehrer said. “We’d never been in a boat like that before, but we got in and he worked and worked at us.”
The three athletes, however, never doubted that they would reach their goal.
“He believed in us, but he told us directly that the chances we would make the team were very slim.” Lehrer recalled. “We just said to him, ‘You do your thing, and we’ll do ours.’”
In the end, Toro kept coaching, and the Lehrers kept paddling all the way to qualifying for the 1996 Olympics.
In typical fashion for the three siblings, nothing came easy.
They squandered their best opportunity to qualify when they wrecked their canoe at the 1995 Pan-American Games.
By coming back to post their best-ever performance at the World Championships, however, the Lehrers saw their Olympic dream come to fruition.
Though injuries prevented the siblings from competing in the Olympics the next year, the lessons Lehrer learned from Toro during their time together have proved more valuable than the accolades.
“There’s one thing he always told me – ‘We’ll train every day like it’s the championship, and during the championship, we’ll race like it’s every day.’” Lehrer said. “For me, that’s a way of living. It’s not about the moment, the qualifications, the Olympics; it’s about what you’re doing every day.”
PASSING THE TORCH
These axioms are now the basis of Lehrer’s “process,” and the people who play and coach under him have all bought in.
When Friedman returned to Cambridge for alumni weekend this fall, he stopped by the team’s practice to see how the Crimson is doing now that most of the players have had multiple years of experience under Lehrer’s lead.
What he found was surprising, but at the same time, made complete sense.
“I expected to see Pieter micromanaging, but he was standing off a little, watching. What he used to do, I saw the seniors doing now,” Friedman said. “And that’s remarkable, how the players are able to understand how to run a practice, how to take the lead and make important decisions just as Pieter would.”
For Lehrer, seeing this growth in his players is what his job is all about. His goal is not to be the best soccer coach, but rather the best mentor he can be.
Thus, as he sees his largest-ever class of seniors leave campus this year, Lehrer isn’t disappointed to see them go. Each graduate is another person who will apply his “process” to pursuing new goals and accomplishments after their soccer careers end.
Chances are, just like Friedman, they’ll be back to tell their coach how it goes.
