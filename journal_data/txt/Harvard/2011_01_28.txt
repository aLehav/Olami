After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although we certainly have many differences, perhaps one common goal that unites all members of the Harvard community is the idea that health and physical fitness is important. Therefore, while we may not appear to have a rampant obesity or what might be called a fat problem, “Harvard on the Move,” the University’s new community fitness program, is a worthwhile addition because it strengthens bonds between different groups in the Harvard and Cambridge communities. The program will consist of weekly runs open to all community members as well as University-coordinated lectures and panels on aspects of fitness and wellness.
As reported in the Harvard Gazette, Faust said, “Harvard on the Move offers a unique opportunity for Harvard’s many constituencies to come together outside the classroom and lecture halls.” In the Gazette, program manager and coach Alexios Monopolis said, “Our goal is to capture the sense of eagerness, exhilaration, and adventure we felt as kids during recess, as we take a break from our normal routines and actively spend time outdoors, interacting with members of our vibrant community with whom we may not have other opportunities to engage.”
Thus, even though we're not sure how effective it will actually be in improving the physical condition of the people who participate, this new exercise initiative is a positive addition to our community. While apparently a means of improving community fitness, the initiative is also a positive way of building community through fitness. 
As students, professors, administrators, and staffers can conceivably participate, "Harvard on the Move" can help with breaking the divides among many respective sectors of our community. In the classroom, it can be intimidating and awkward to approach a legendary academic, but when you’re both in jogging apparel, the connection becomes easier and less serious. Similarly, exercise provides welcome conversation fodder for very different people across Harvard to talk to each other and understand that we have more in common than we might think. In this vein, it was good of University President Drew G. Faust to volunteer her time and come out for the first event.
And if nothing else, a sort of venture like this is a nice opportunity to see more of Cambridge and the surrounding area that students might not see every day.
“Harvard on the Move” has received its fair share of ire this past week. To be sure, the idea that hundreds of students, faculty, and staff will all be walking and trying to talk to each other at the same time—probably decked in outdated spandex—is a little funny. However, maybe we should see this “walking mixer” as analogous to the chairs in the Yard. It’s something that may seem silly at first but that ultimately could come to be seen as one of the many little things that strengthen ties across our community.
So start walking.
CORRECTION: Jan. 29, 2011
An  earlier version of the  Jan. 28 staff editorial "Walk it Out" incorrectly named the community  fitness program the University is initiating as "Harvard Moves On." The  correct name of the program is "Harvard On the Move."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Be less of a slut. Lose 20 pounds. Get better grades. Find a job. Volunteer more. Save more money. Every year people across the country are convinced that uttering the phrase “I’ve resolved to…[insert virtuous act here]” to all of their friends in the intervening days between Christmas and New Year’s will magically make the said declaration happen.
Unsurprisingly, according to “recent research” (okay, fine, Wikipedia), only 12 percent of people who make resolutions actually achieve their goals.  For a college student, that’s 20-some years of either consistent disappointment or just being forgetful. Amy Chua would have canceled your Christmas long ago.
Despite the high failure rate, New Year’s resolutions remain a popular hobby — a way to convince ourselves that we are truly good people at heart — and, dagnabbit, we are going to work harder, live better, run faster, be stronger, and make the world a better place this year!
Why the predilection with perpetually setting ourselves up for failure? The answer, like many things related to wallowing in laziness, seems to lie with the Romans. The ever-wise interwebz inform me that the month of January is named after the Roman god Janus, god of beginnings and protector of all doors and gateways. Janus is depicted with two faces, one looking forward (to the future) and another looking back (to the past), thus becoming a symbol for making resolutions while taking the past into account. The Romans used New Year to exchange gifts and ask for forgiveness from their enemies. The Jewish New Year celebration incorporates similar practices of asking for forgiveness and wiping the slate clean.
Asking for forgiveness and trying to start a new year off right are admirable goals. And yes, goal-setting can be a positive force for change when change is needed. Yet it would seem that sometime between the Rome of Augustus and our own era, making a New Year’s resolution turned into a theatrical farce of taking the advice of the Jewish Mother in all of our heads, only to disappoint her a week later (it’s kind of hard to lose 20 lbs. when you keep insisting I eat all my brisket, Mom.)
So, in the spirit of setting you goals are actually likely to achieve, here are five things you can resolve to do that are not quitting smoking, drinking less, losing weight, or getting better grades. Because let’s be honest, who really wants to do any of those things?
1. Eat more.
Chicken fingers, chocolate, Chipotle, it doesn’t matter. Life is uncertain. You don’t want to die regretting not eating that sixth M&M cookie, right?
2. Have more (safe) sex.
Or, if you’re single and feeling adventurous, you can make the goal, “contract a VD.” I probably know a few people who could help you with that one….
No but seriously, be safe.
3. Go to a final club, or a party at a different school.
You’ll actually be honest when you answer “yes” to your friend from home’s question, “Dude, have you ever been to one of those club things I saw in The Social Network?”
And no, coming to the Quad to party does not count as going to a different school. Sheesh. Friggin’ river-dwellers.
4. Slack off more.
You can totally watch another episode of “Bones.” It’s only 2 am. You still have 15 hours to finish that unstarted pset, whatever.
5. Drink. A lot.
Holla atcha senior spring!

The Tea Party is perhaps the most interesting political movement to hit American politics in recent memory. Arising from a series of loosely organized, local protests, the movement quickly became a leading political force calling for smaller government closer to the American people. Congressional “Town Hall” sessions were suddenly transformed from small gatherings of quiet conversation into actual debates where representatives were forced to explain their votes, and soon Democrats (and some Republicans) were slandering and downplaying the movement.
Most recently, liberals and MSNBC hosts blamed the tragic shooting in Tucson on the Tea Party for spreading “hatred” and “extremism” in American politics. The evidence, however, showed that the murderer was a clearly deranged man who, based on documents found in his home, most likely had begun to target Rep. Giffords in 2007, two years before the Tea Party even existed. Still, ignoring the evidence, liberal hosts marched on with their rants against conservatives and the Tea Party. Parts of the Tea Party may be extremist, as is true with any political group, but its message of smaller government represents a substantial portion of the American population. Such false accusations against it are an insult to the American people and take away from the actual debate on government spending that this country desperately needs. The Tea Party deserves to have its record set straight, and liberals, although they are free to disagree with it, should disrespect and slander the movement at their own risk.
The Tea Party began with “the rant heard ‘round the world” (or at least the entire United States). On February 19, 2009, CNBC Business News Network editor Rick Santelli loudly criticized the government’s plan to refinance mortgages and called for the creation of a “Chicago Tea Party” in a live broadcast. Within 24 hours, Tea Party groups and protest “events” had appeared on Facebook, and, on Tax Day 2009, the movement flexed its muscle for the first time with protests in more than 300 locations across the United States. The continental army costumes were cute, but the movement was serious and popular. Unlike most political movements, the Tea Party rallies required no political parties, conspiracy theories, or 501(c) groups like MoveOn.org. It required facebook, texting, e-mail, a little news coverage, and a lot of American taxpayers who saw out-of-control government spending and expansion as obstacles to America’s future success. While the Republican Party and its leaders floundered in their original response to President Obama and his policies, the Tea Party organized itself to make up for what the Republicans were lacking. Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck may be the self-proclaimed leaders of the Tea Party, but they, like many other conservative figures, merely jumped on the bandwagon. Both figures also believe in smaller government, but the Tea Party did not need their lectures and Mamma Grizzlies to become the force it is today.
What makes the Tea Party so incredibly special and hard to define is that the movement requires no formal organization or “litmus test.” Everyone is welcome to take part in their movement to promote smaller, more efficient government, leading to their diverse and bipartisan ranks—15 percent of Tea Partiers identify themselves as Democrats, and many Tea Partiers have not been politically active in the past. Their ranks may include “birthers” or social conservatives, but the Tea Party itself does not work to promote those beliefs. Scott Brown, the liberal Republican Senator from Massachusetts, was just as much a Tea Party candidate as Rand Paul. He focused on his message, believed that the American people have answers to our nations problems, and rode the wave to bring change to Washington.
Perhaps you disagree with the Tea Party, which is completely understandable. The movement certainly has made some mistakes and nominated flawed candidates, but what party or movement hasn’t? However, the nation is undeniably well along its way to a fiscal crisis that both parties have a history of ignoring. The Tea Party exists because neither party could wake up and recognize the reality. To shrug off the movement as extremist or crazy is both disrespectful to the American people and ignorant. If you want the movement to go away, here’s an idea: Fix the problem and make our government efficiently work for its people. Following the original Boston Tea Party, the British sealed their fate by expanding the power of Parliament over the colonies and harshly punishing the colonies instead of resolving the issues the revolutionaries had highlighted. The current administration and its Congressional allies seem to be unwisely following a similar path. Voting against a House proposal to cut government spending to 2008 levels and not even proposing a budget in 2010 while mocking the Tea Party will only lead to another shellacking in 2012. The Tea Party’s message for smaller government is popular and will only continue to spread if it continues to fall on deaf ears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent repeal of the U.S. military’s Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (DADT) policy has paved the way for several universities, including Harvard, to reconsider recognizing the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program on their campuses. This decision is being considered because the military's policy on sexual orientation no longer conflicts with Harvard's non-discrimination policy.  However, supporters of welcoming back the ROTC overlook the fact that Harvard’s non-discrimination policy also covers gender identity and sex.  Transgender and intersex individuals are still barred from military service and face hostile discrimination during and after their service despite the repeal of DADT. We believe that Harvard should not recognize ROTC until the U.S. military extends equal rights to transgender and intersex individuals.
The U.S. military and, by extension, ROTC currently bar transgender people from serving, classifying non-normative gender identity as a mental illness that automatically disqualifies transgender individuals from service. This is in contrast to seven other nations, including Canada, Thailand, and the U.K. that allow transgender individuals to serve in their militaries.
The U.S. military's anti-transgender policy, however, does not stop trans-identified individuals from serving; it only prevents them from serving openly. The President of the Transgender American Veteran’s Association (TAVA), Navy Machinist Mate First Class Monica Helms, describes transgender veterans in the USA as having served in every war since World War II.  A recent survey by TAVA about the treatment of transgender veterans got 827 responses, and it is estimated that there are thousands of other former and current members of the military who identify as transgender.
The discrimination against transgender individuals is evident on many levels of military policy: recruitment policies, dismissal of personnel, and veterans’ access to healthcare. According to TAVA, many veterans who now identify as transgender report facing harassment and discrimination about both the gender identity and sexual orientation. Harassment concerning gender identity is not protected under the military's Anti-Harassment Action Plan. Transgender service members, who are already vulnerable to harassment and discrimination, are left with no possible means of recourse to protect themselves.
Even after their tenure in the military, transgender veterans reported discrimination at Veterans Association hospitals and were denied medical care specific to transgender health. Federal law prohibits Veterans Health Administration (VA) facilities from performing or paying for sex-reassignment surgeries.
Intersex individuals, people born with different genital anatomy, are also excluded from military service. According to a 2007 report from The Michael D. Palm Center, there is a long list of disqualifying genital differences, both male and female, that are used to bar individuals from service. For example, having one undescended testicle, a condition effecting almost percent of men, makes a man ineligible for service. Sexual health is an important part of overall health, and it is good that the military considers this in its health standards. However, the military's preoccupation with genital differences that in no way compromise an individual's health or ability to serve is explicitly discriminatory.
Although ROTC offers an opportunity for students from low-income backgrounds to pursue higher education, this does not mean that recognizing ROTC is a socially equitable choice. Because Harvard has generous financial aid policies, low-income students can attend Harvard without ROTC support. Actually, that ROTC provides tuition payments for participants makes its exclusion of transgender individuals even more problematic. The discrimination in every ROTC program in the nation constitutes a systematic barrier in access to higher educational resources for transgender individuals.
Harvard President Drew Faust commented that the repeal of DADT “affirms American ideals of equal opportunity and underscores the importance of the right to military service as a fundamental dimension of citizenship.” However, the right to military service and many other basic rights and dimensions of citizenship are denied to transgender individuals. Transgender people are not protected from employment discrimination in most states and are routinely denied healthcare that is essential to their well being under both public and private insurance plans. Tragically, the Human Rights Campaign estimates that at least one in every 1,000 homicides is a hate crime against transgender individuals. Transgender inclusion in the military would be a powerful victory for everyone who understands that transgender individuals deserve equal rights and equal citizenship.
President Obama, celebrating the repeal of DADT in his recent State of the Union address, called on “all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.” However, Obama fails to recognize the continued discrimination against transgender people in the military. Harvard, and other colleges reconsidering ROTC, should reaffirm their commitment to non-discrimination despite Obama’s call for “unity” because there is no unity to be found in the endorsement of discrimination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students navigated a sea of blue and orange t-shirts, flyers, and piles of candy as they tried to decide what programs to get involved in at the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Spring Open House yesterday afternoon. Of the 86 programs run year-round by PBHA, about half set up booths and were looking to recruit new members.
Although many organizations on campus do not encourage students to join halfway through the year, several PBHA volunteers said they thought the open house was a great way to draw in those who are looking to change their extracurricular activities or are hoping to take on more than they had originally anticipated.
“People may know they want to volunteer, but they don’t know what’s out there, so [the open house] is a great way for people to see their options on campus,” said Emelyn A. Rude ’12, a PBHA volunteer.
While the open house welcomed participants from all classes, PBHA volunteers said that the event typically attracts a large number of freshmen who did not have the chance or the desire to get involved at the beginning of the year.
“It can be intimidating to get involved in your first semester freshman year,” said Kristiana C. Laugen ’13, PBHA’s public relations officer. “People can get overwhelmed by all the activities or might not have heard of all of our programs.”
Several freshmen attending the event said they felt more comfortable getting involved after a semester on campus than they had at the beginning of the year.
“[Joining now] is good because now you’ve got yourself situated and you can figure out what you want to get involved in,” said James M. Acer ’14.
Although the number of students at the spring event tends to be lower than the number in the fall, yesterday’s turnout was at least as high and perhaps higher than in past springs, according to Laugen and other PBHA program directors.
PBHA volunteer Leah R. Kaplow ’12 said that, despite the smaller crowd than in the fall, she was pleased by the number of sign-ups that her program had received.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine said the Obama administration needs to improve how it communicates its legislative achievements to the American public, during a speech at Kirkland House last night.
“I do think we missed some huge opportunities for that in the first two years,” he said. “The White House has had a reluctance to tell the story and say, ‘look at all the good things we’re doing.’”
But aside from his critique of the Democrats’ communication efforts during the last two years, Kaine struck a largely positive note.
In order to recover from the 2010 midterm elections, the Democratic Party must embrace an innovative economic strategy in addition to refining its messaging tactics, Kaine said during a talk hosted by the Harvard College Democrats, which was part of the ongoing “Conversations with Kirkland” lecture series.
“The most important economic challenge for America going forward will be the shift from an economy whose heat is generated by overconsumption and debt,” Kaine said, echoing President Obama’s emphasis on the need for an “innovative economy” in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech. “We need a sustainable economy based on something that is not going to be so boom and bust.”
Kaine also defended President Obama’s first two years in office, extolling all that the president had done to correct what Kaine said he saw as the mistakes of the 2000s, which he called  “a lost decade in American life.”
While Kaine said the Democratic Party had missed opportunities to communicate its message in the past, he predicted that the Democratic Party would revamp its efforts to publicize its message and goals to the American public.
“I think you’re going to see a much more aggressive telling of the accomplishments and response to what the other guy is saying,” he said. “If you don’t tell your own story, nobody does.”
While much of his speech was spent celebrating the accomplishments of the Obama administration, Kaine extolled public dissension as a means of fostering progress, mentioning the American public’s dissatisfaction with “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
“The impatience of youth, the desire to improve, has to be a perennial and important part of our political process,” he said.
Former President of the Harvard College Democrats Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 said he thought Kaine’s speech emphasized his party’s positive achievements after the disappointing 2010 midterm elections.
“Kaine hammered home the point that we as Democrats have a lot to be proud of,” he said. “There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic as a Democrat, and I felt that Kaine’s speech was really invigorating.”
But not everyone in attendance was convinced that the Democrats would be able to refine their messaging strategy before the 2012 elections.
“I’m not sure how they think doing the same thing twice is going to have a different outcome,” said Samuel L. Coffin ’14.

Earlier this week, the Harvard Office for Sustainability announced its 2011 recipients of the Student Sustainability Grant, which included a grant to expand a bike share program and a $3,000 grant to build a model of a sustainable dorm room in Kirkland House.
The grant program, now in its second year, aims to provide seed funding to enable Harvard undergraduate and graduate students to implement green initiatives and help the University reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by the year 2016.
This year, the Office for Sustainability received 40 applications, an increase of seven from the year before, and gave out 14 grants ranging from $500 to $5,000.
The applications were judged on innovation, creativity, and educational value, among other things.
Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, described the program as a way for the University to demonstrate sustainable leadership.
“The University and Office for Sustainability created this grant program because we saw it as an exciting opportunity to engage students in thinking creatively about how we can further our sustainability initiatives and to create replicable models that might be used in other parts of Harvard and beyond,” she said.
Several undergraduate proposals were awarded grants, including a plan to implement a water capture system to conserve water for the Harvard Community Garden.
The proposal submitted by the Harvard Community Garden—a collaboration between the Center for Health and the Global Environment, other Harvard offices, and student groups—focuses on highlighting innovative watering techniques.
Louisa C. Denison ’11, co-manager of the community garden, described the proposal as a way to get students who might not normally be interested in agriculture involved in trying to find creative ways to make Harvard more sustaniable.
“People take for granted our unlimited access to water, and that is not at all the case,” Denison said. “In parts of the world and many parts of America, water is not a limitless resource. The proposal seems like a way in which people can think more deeply about what it is that keeps the plants going and the water our agricultural system works on.”
Other proposals include funding worm-based compost efforts in Thayer Hall and a campaign that will post water and energy conservation reminders throughout freshmen dorms.
Colin B. Durrant, manager of sustainability communications, said that students can expect to see these proposals put into action over the next few months, as the projects must be completed by April.
As a final requirement, students are asked to write a short report that documents their projects as well as the results of their efforts.
Durrant added that the short reports will be posted on the Office for Sustainability’s website as a way to share the lessons learned.

Almost every academic department within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences saw its concentration satisfaction scores increase from 2002 to 2010.
Scored on a five-point scale, overall concentration satisfaction jumped half a point over the past eight years, which many department administrators attributed to University and FAS initiatives to encourage better teaching and advising in the College.
“I think that General Education courses have been vetted so thoroughly that they too are improved and faculty have been rejuvenated by having to imagine their courses anew,” Professor of Social Ethics and Head Tutor of Psychology Mahzarin R. Banaji wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Senior survey results from the class of 2010, published in early January, revealed these increases.
Every concentration has seen an increase in its satisfaction score since 2002, with anthropology seeing the lowest increase, rising by only .12 points.
The relative scores among concentrations remained largely unaltered during the period, with economics, the largest concentration, starting and ending the eight-year period near the bottom.
“We work really hard to try to respond to these results every year and add more programming and change around what we do,” Economics Undergraduate Program Administrator Emily R. Neill said.
But Neill said that sometimes these initiatives falter.
“We brought back junior seminars this past year, after seniors complained about not having them, and we thought that this was it. This was going to boost our numbers,” Neill said.
“We had 68 slots open; 34 people registered,” she said.
But, Neill said, efforts to build a stronger community of economics concentrators have helped to better connect undergraduates with the department and their advisers.
“I cranked the hell out of that message to get students in Littauer and feeling like they’re part of a larger community, and I think that we’re beginning to see a change as a result of that, with the Class of 2010,” Neill said.
Neill added that she hopes to see further increases in economic concentration satisfaction scores soon, but said it is difficult to determine exactly which elements of the many curricular and academic reforms passed in the last three years are responsible for the increasing scores.
“I can’t tell you how depressing it is for it not to go up,” Neill said. “I’m psyched it went up, and I hope it stays up.”
The English department, which received the highest concentration satisfaction score among concentrations with more than 50 undergraduates, recently implemented a major reform to its curriculum. Administrators largely attributed the rise in English satisfaction numbers from 3.81 to 4.44—a higher than average increase—to this curricular revision.
“The department was ready for a change,” English Undergraduate Program Administrator Jeffrey Berg said. “I think there was a general encouragement across the College to examine what we were doing in each department.”
English Department Chair W. James Simpson said that support from FAS Dean Michael D. Smith provided a framework to continue improving undergraduate education.
“I think it is due to an increasing emphasis [on teaching and learning],” Simpson said. “Certainly Dean Smith has helped.... The University administration worked very collaboratively in restructuring the department.”
Some departments saw minor decreases in their satisfaction scores since the last academic year, including classics, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and History and Literature, but these departments constituted an anomaly in the FAS-wide trend.
Many of the departments that experienced decreases in their satisfaction ratings are smaller, and therefore are more likely to see fluctuations from year to year.

Continuing an experiment that began this fall, the Harvard economics department will offer three versions of intermediate microeconomics in the next academic year. The change comes as part of the department’s ongoing effort to provide more flexible course offerings, particularly for those students who want more emphasis on the quantitative aspects of economics.
The department has traditionally offered Economics 1010a: “Microeconomic Theory” as the basic requirement for concentrators. This past semester, however, Economics 1010a was split into two sections, one of which is more mathematically rigorous than the other.
Though the sections appear under the same course number, their lectures, homework, and exams are all different. Economics 1011a, which requires knowledge of multivariable calculus, is the third intermediate microeconomics course offered by the department.
Economics director of undergraduate studies Jeffrey A. Miron, who was formerly course head of the consolidated 1010a, taught the more analytical of the two sections, while visiting professor Jeff Borland taught the graphically-based section.
Borland will not be teaching 1010a next year, and the department has not yet found a replacement for him, according to Miron.
Significant increases were seen in the Q Guide scores for Ec 1010a since the change.
This fall, the course overall received a 3.28, an increase of almost 30 percent from the previous year. And whereas Miron received an overall instructor evaluation score of 2.85 in 2009, his rating jumped by more than a quarter this year, to 3.68. Borland was rated similarly with a 3.72.
“They were solid scores for what is a required, large, heavy-workload, math-intensive course,” Miron said.
Despite the score increase, students from both sections expressed a wide range of sentiments regarding the class.
Some students said they were attracted to either the math- or graphically-based sections, but Sean M. Bennett ’14, who opted to take Borland’s section, said he left the course unsatisfied.
“It wasn’t an incredibly interesting class. I was considering being an economics major, but the class turned me away from being an ec concentrator,” he said.
According to Miron, the smaller size of this fall’s classes provided an important boost to student-faculty relationships.
“I enjoyed 1010a especially this year because I had much more opportunity to interact with the students, rather than just lecturing to a sea of faces,” he wrote in an e-mailed statement.
However, Miron also cited the continued need for smaller classes.
Whereas 75 students attended his section, Borland’s had an enrollment of about 225.
“We would ideally like to have even more sections, so that none was bigger than 50-75,” Miron wrote in his e-mail.

Julianne Moore received the Pudding Pot yesterday, but only after successfully cheering up Virginia Woolf, seducing Mark Zuckerberg, and “silencing” a lamb.
Moore accepted the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Woman of the Year Award in front of a packed audience at New College Theatre after the annual parade along Mass. Ave was canceled due to snow.
At a press conference following the ceremony, Moore discussed her perception of Harvard kids when she was an undergraduate at Boston University and her disappointment about not being nominated for an Academy Award for her role in last year’s “The Kids Are All Right.”
After being asked if she got snubbed, Moore responded, “Honestly, yes. I’m so happy for everybody...I just feel bad for myself. I’m not over it yet, but I will be.”
After entering the theater and sitting in the center seat of the fifth row, Moore endured a five-minute roast presented by HPT Cast President Michael A. Barron ’11 and Vice President Kyle J. Dancewicz ’11.
Barron and Dancewicz began with a crack about Moore’s undergraduate education at BU, during which she worked full time at a local bar.
“In fact, she is one of the few people who can say they worked hard while attending BU,” Dancewicz quipped.
Continuing the roast, the Hasty Pudding members mocked the “fantasies” Moore has explored in her films, including the “fantasy of lesbians raising a proud and happy family” in “The Kids Are All Right.”
Finally, after mentioning her failure to win an Academy Award, they welcomed Moore to the stage, making fun of the fake Dorchester accent she used during a guest appearance on the show “30 Rock.”
“It’s a privilege to talk like you constantly have a sock in your mouth,” joked Mark Wahlberg, played by Benjamin K. Moss ’13.
Barron and Dancewicz then explained that in order to receive the Pudding Pot, Moore had to complete “three secret, delicious tasks.”
The first was to seduce Zuckerberg, played by Ryan P. Halprin ’12, who said he was having lady troubles and only liked girls from BU.
After successfully making out with Halprin, he told her, “You’re not a bad actress. You’re just trying to be one.”
For her second task, Moore had to cheer up Virginia Woolf, played by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, by chasing her around the stage and tickling her in a tickle fight.
To finally receive her Pudding Pot, Moore had to silence a lamb, played by Anthony T. Oblen ’14, by reading from her children’s book, “Freckleface Strawberry.” Once the lamb had been calmed, Barron and Dancewicz presented Moore with her award.
The audience was then able to see a preview of HPT’s new show, “Kashmir If You Can.”
At the press conference, Moore said that, as a student, “it was hard to determine what people’s identities were vis-a-vis their school.” The problem with Harvard students, she said, was that “they didn’t party.”
Jay Leno will receive the Man of the Year award Feb. 4 before the opening night of “Kashmir If You Can” at the New College Theatre.

After 30 years of serving food to the Harvard Square community, Au Bon Pain has remodeled to offer more meal options and a new marketplace design.
“We’ve packaged it in a way that’s relevant to the target customer in Harvard Square: the busy student, faculty, administrators, and business people,” said Susan A. Morelli, the CEO of Au Bon Pain and a 1984 graduate of Harvard Business School.
Instead of having to wait in line at the counter for every order, customers can now serve themselves at a new soup bar and coffee station, and can also choose from other grab-and-go options.
“I like the design. It’s more modern and seems more efficient,” said Teresa M. Ferguson, a Harvard employee and student at the School of Dental Medicine who frequents Au Bon Pain twice a week.
Au Bon Pain has also expanded its made-to-order menu with hot toasted sandwiches. The restaurant has introduced a ‘Create Your Own’ salad bar, where guests can choose from 30 different ingredients.
The interior has also been brightened with new signs and decorating.
“The new color palette, design, and graphics create a bright, happy, and high-energy environment,” Morelli said. “Food is energy, and we think energy is particularly appropriate for the college environment.”
During lunchtime, workers will now take orders on iPads to expedite service.
Morelli said she believes the new advance matches college students’ busy schedules.
“We like being a part of the vibrant, thoughtful kind of community. Universities definitely have the trend-setting clientele,” Morelli said.
Beginning in 2012, customers will also be able to place ABP orders online.
The Harvard Square location opened in 1984 as one of Au Bon Pain’s first cafes. Louis I. Kane ’53, the company’s late founder, started the business on the premise of providing high quality food with great service in urban areas.
“This isn’t just any cafe to us. This is our flagship. We have a lot of history here,” said Mohammad O. Kaddoura, the area director of the Harvard Square location.
Harvard Square is the third location to be remodeled, and Au Bon Pain invested about $1 million in the project.
“The [previous design] was fine too, but you have to change,” patron Ernie Miller said.
The employees are in the process of informing guests how the new system works by offering tours through the cafe. Remodeling will continue in the spring with new outside seating.
“We want students to stop in and let us know how they like it. The more we can engage in Harvard, the better,” Morelli said.

Harvard men’s tennis volunteer assistant coach Eric Butorac was on a quest to end up on top Down Under. Unfortunately his run at an Australian Open Championship came up short, ending just before the finals.
Butorac and his partner Jean-Julien Rojer of the Netherland Antilles made it to the Grand Slam’s men’s doubles semifinal after winning their matches in the first four rounds along with a quarterfinal victory over the tournament’s fourth-seeded pair.
With their win in this year’s quarterfinals, Butorac and Rojer were set to play American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan early this morning. The Bryans have dominated international men’s doubles play for several years and have captured the Australian Open title in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010.
In this morning’s match the brothers defended their first-seed status, and beat Butorac and Rojer 6-3, 6-2, in just under an hour of play.
Butorac, who played Division III collegiate tennis at Minnesota’s Gustavus Adolphus College and won both NCAA singles and doubles titles, has made several appearances in the Australian Open as well as tennis’ three other Majors, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.
While the Butorac and his partner undoubtedly would have liked to advance, the semifinal finish represents the Crimson coach’s best ever in Grand Slam competition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not much has gone right for the Harvard men’s hockey team this season.
After losing 14 of its previous 15 games, the squad currently sits in the penultimate position of the ECAC standings with a 2-11 conference record.
But tomorrow, the Crimson has the chance to inject a little bit of life into an otherwise disappointing year if it can take down conference rival Cornell in what is the most anticipated game of the season for many of its fans.
The rivalry—which dates back to 1910—is such that it has its own Wikipedia page, purports the throwing of dead fish onto the ice in Ithaca, and plays a key role in the book “Love Story.”
“I guess the rivalry goes back a long way,” sophomore forward Luke Greiner said. “There’s a lot of history...it’s always exciting to play them. The crowds come out and we get a lot of good support. It’s always a good game and it’s a lot of fun.”
This weekend, the 135th installment of the contest takes place at the Bright Hockey Center, where the Big Red arrives in the midst of a disappointing season of its own. While Cornell’s female counterpart has dominated its way up to No. 2 in the country, the men’s squad (8-9-2, 6-5-1 ECAC)—which began the preseason ranked No. 11—has had an up-and-down season that has seen it drop out of the Top 25 altogether.
Cornell’s struggles have been offensive, as the team has had difficulty scoring all season long. The Big Red has only registered 53 goals on the year, second-to-last in the ECAC (which nonetheless still puts them 21 ahead of last-place Harvard). But the lack of scores doesn’t stem from a lack of opportunities, as Cornell’s 25.8 shots-per-game average puts it first in the ECAC.
“They like to maintain pressure in the zone for extended periods of time,” senior defenseman Chris Huxley said. “So at certain points we need to weather the storm and accept that they’re going to be in the zone for a bit and not get too rattled about it.”
Senior Tyler Roeszler leads the Big Red with eight scores, and is coming off a hat-trick in Cornell’s last game, a 5-2 win over Colgate on January 22. Classmate Joe Devin has racked up seven goals, while sophomore Greg Miller is first on the team with 18 points, thanks to his 16 assists.
In net, Cornell has split goaltending duties between junior Mike Garman and freshman Andy Iles, who have started ten and nine games respectively. The duo has performed similarly on the season, with Garman (4-5-1) sporting a .919 save percentage and 2.30 goals-against-average to Iles’ (4-4-1) .910 and 2.50, respectively.
Attacking that defense will be a Harvard line led by senior Michael Biega and junior Alex Killorn, who each have eight goals and 14 points to lead the team. Sophomore Danny Biega is tied for sixth in the country for points among defensemen, with 12.
“[We’ve been working on] making sure we get our forecheck going, keeping our puck in their zone, and creating down low,” Greiner said of the offensive game plan.
In net for Harvard will likely be senior assistant captain Kyle Richter, who features a league-average .909 save percentage and 2.77 GAA.
Defensively, the Crimson will look to contain a Big Red offense that struggles on power-plays, with only 12 man-up goals on the year. But Cornell doesn’t garner many penalties either, ranking 10th in the conference in penalty minutes.
The Big Red has also done a much better job killing other teams’ man-up opportunities, and ranks first in the conference in power-play goals against. That could mean trouble for the Crimson, which ranks last in the league in both power-play scores and chances.
Despite these struggles, Harvard will be fired up to play its biggest rival in front of a likely sold-out crowd at home. Cornell leads the all-time rivalry, 69-58-7. Adding to the stakes is the fact that the Big Red embarrassed the Crimson twice last season, winning, 6-3, in Ithaca and shutting out Harvard, 3-0, in Cambridge.
“We’re going to bear down,” Greiner said. “We’re going to play our systems and use our speed and our skill and we’re going to take the game to them.”
But until then, Harvard simply is focused on tonight's contest at home versus the league bottom-dwelling Raiders.
“It’s exciting,” Huxley said of the rivalry. “But we have a game Friday that we’re going to think about first, so it’s kind of a one-game-at-a-time thing for now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Harvard men and women’s swimming and diving teams will put their perfect season records on the line this weekend against Princeton and Yale, when the Crimson squads travel to New Haven, Conn. to wrap up regular season action with the annual HYP meet.
This season, the Harvard men’s team (7-0, 5-0 Ivy) opened up regular action against Dartmouth in impressive fashion, cruising past the Big Green, 222-78. After that win, the Crimson has shown no signs of slowing down. The closest score line was a 156-106 win over Boston University, and Harvard seemed in control for the entire meet.
“To be undefeated so far has been great, but it’s more so how we’ve been winning the meets, not just the fact that we’ve won them,” co-captain Justin Davidson said. “It’s been great getting to see everyone step up and contribute some points.”
But, like in past seasons, the team’s success could change at the HYP meet. One of the Crimson’s competitors this weekend, Princeton, also holds a perfect record this year. While Harvard has had considerable success over the Bulldogs in the recent past, the squad has not been able to match that success against Princeton. The Crimson has not won against the Tigers in the last two years.
In last year’s meet, Harvard dominated the Bulldogs, posting a crushing 242-106 victory over Yale. But the Crimson couldn’t pull off the win against Princeton, losing a tough 203-150 matchup—the only blemish in a near-perfect conference record. Harvard led the three teams in the freestyle events, while the Tigers cleaned up in the medley events.
“I think in terms of facing Princeton, one of the areas we’ll be looking to improve would be the relays,” Davidson said. “I think that based off of the work we’ve been doing, we have the opportunity to reverse the trend… and come out on top in those events.”
The Crimson has lost a group of its seniors that led the team last year, but Harvard has a strong freshman class this season that has been producing solid results for the squad. In last weekend’s 197-103 victory over Penn, freshman Wes Stearns led the field in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:21.12 and also placed first in the 500-yard freestyle. Another freshman, Chris Satterthwaite, won the 100-yard freestyle in 45.49 seconds.
With these results from the freshman class, and improved results from the upperclassmen, Harvard should be able to narrow the scoring gap and possibly pull out the win against the Tigers.
On the women’s side, two of the three competing teams will surrender their perfect league records thus far, as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton all enter the meet undefeated in Ivy action. The Crimson finds itself much in the same position as it was at this stage last year, gearing up for this weekend’s meet with the regular-season title on the line. But this time around, Harvard looks to close out both of its top rivals, a feat it fell short of accomplishing at the 2010 HYPs.
The meet arrives on the heels of what has already been a busy post-holiday schedule for the Crimson. Shortly after completing a rigorous J-term training session in St. Croix, only three days after returning to Boston, the team began the New Year with a 198-97 victory over Brown. Harvard followed up this performance last weekend when it juggled appearances at the Rutgers Invitational in New Brunswick, N.J., on Friday and a league contest against Penn on Sunday. A sweep of the individual medley races and strong diving results from freshman Schuyler Moore awarded the Crimson second place at Rutgers. The squad then returned home to top the Quakers, 192-105, at Blodgett Pool.
But the short turnaround times between its January meets, coupled with the decision to enter winter training even earlier this year, has raised a few doubts among the Harvard women that they can capitalize on their 2011 momentum when they arrive in New Haven once again.
“Any competition is really exciting for us,” junior Margaret Fish said. “We just keep our eyes on the prize and never let the [number of meets] weigh us down in the process.”
Members of the Crimson contingent to watch include senior Kate Mills, who registered two event wins at Brown in addition to a victory in the 200 free against Penn. But, as with the men’s team, it’s not only the upperclassmen that have been bolstering Harvard’s quest to reclaim the Ivy title. Freshmen Paige Newell and Jenna Gregoire both delivered first-place finishes in individual and relay events, respectively, against the Bears earlier this month.
“We’re taking our entire team down to HYPs since we’re facing our biggest competitors,” Fish said. “Princeton has beat us in the past couple of years. They take a lot of pride in their dual meet record, so we’re really excited to go up against them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During Shopping Week, it takes me roughly the first five minutes of a class to decide whether or not I’ll take the course. The rest of the class time is what Shopping Week is really all about: watching everybody else in the room.
It’s only natural. If I decide not to take the course, then I’d obviously rather scout the crowd for underclassmen talent than listen to the professor lecture on “bore-ophyll.” And if I do choose to take the class, it’s only the first week, so the material is not as important as whether any Kirkland queens might potentially be in my section.
All the important information that Shopping Week ostensibly exists to supply is actually online weeks in advance. By the time the semester begins, I’ve already spent hours crunching numbers in the Q Guide—highest ratings, lowest workloads—to uncover gems like “Tangible Things.” So when that first week rolls around, I need only to make sure the course meets expectations. Beyond that, I spend my time people-watching and imagining how the semester will play out.
Ivy men’s basketball has its first Friday-Saturday matchups of the season this weekend in what amounts to the Ancient Eight’s Shopping Week. Right now, the numbers—the Basketball Qs—say that Harvard is the favorite to win the league, Princeton’s chances are slightly lower, and Yale has an outside shot at the title.
Of course, it’s too early to crown a champ. Last Saturday, a lousy Dartmouth squad built a 12-point second half lead against the Crimson before choking it away. But that game and, perhaps more so, this weekend’s contests, help to gauge these initial expectations and offer a chance to check out the other teams.
A couple questions as I look around the league: Will Princeton, who has yet to play a league game, show up as the conference favorite that many pundits predicted? Will Columbia emerge as a legitimate contender after its 2-0 Ivy start? Will Yale keep rolling and challenge for the crown? Will Penn’s record match its talent?
It’s Shopping Week, which means it’s time to find out.
COLUMBIA (11-5, 2-0 Ivy) at HARVARD (13-3, 2-0 Ivy)
The Lions boast the third-best record in the conference and have won eight of their last nine games, but they still represent a big question mark. Playing mostly weak competition in its non-conference schedule, Columbia’s best win came against a then-.500 Maine team.
The Lions have some nice pieces though, particularly at guard. Junior Noruwa Agho leads the league in scoring, and sophomore Brian Barbour has come on strongly since New Years, averaging 18.8 points per game in that span.
But Harvard shouldn’t lose. The Crimson has the league’s best offense; Columbia has the league’s worst defense. With sophomore guard Christian Webster likely making his return and Lavietes Pavilion rocking, Harvard should prevail. Columbia’s last 11 games have been decided by single digits, and I don’t see why tonight will be any different.
Pick: Harvard 78, Columbia 69
CORNELL (4-12, 0-2 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (4-12, 0-2 Ivy)
We saw Dartmouth’s ceiling in the first 25 minutes of last Saturday’s game. The Big Green was making shots and grabbing rebounds at a ridiculous rate before it went frigid against the Crimson’s zone. Dartmouth is definitely capable of winning some Ivy games, and perhaps its best chance comes tonight against Cornell.
The Big Red of this year is certainly a far cry from the wonder teams of the past three seasons, but Cornell’s record does not do the team justice. Eight of its 12 losses have been by five points of less, and the Big Red has legitimate offensive threats in juniors Chris Wroblewski and Andrew Ferry, and sophomore Errick Peck.
I believe Cornell’s talent trumps the Big Green’s, and the Ithacans will get their first Ivy win of the season.
Pick: Cornell 61, Dartmouth 54
BROWN (7-9, 0-2 Ivy) at PRINCETON (12-4, 0-0 Ivy)
Brown has been up-and-down all season. It’s the type of team that could beat the best team in the league one night and lose to the worst the next. With a bevy of weapons—forwards Peter Sullivan and Tucker Halpern, and guards Garrett Leffelman and Sean McGonagill—the Bears could go into Jadwin and tame the Tigers like they did last season.
It’s unlikely though. This Princeton team has four players averaging more than 13 points per game—forwards Ian Hummer and Kareem Maddox, and guards Dan Mavraides, and Douglas Davis—that can match up with Brown’s best and pull out a win at home.
Pick: Princeton 70, Brown 61
YALE (9-7, 2-0 Ivy) at PENN (6-8, 0-0 Ivy)
The Bulldogs and the Quakers round out Friday’s games in perhaps the weekend’s most even matchup. Yale has a monster down low in junior Greg Mangano, who averages a double-double at 14.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game and leads the league in blocks. But Penn has its own star in guard Zack Rosen, a unanimous All-Ivy first-teamer last year.
The theme of the Ivy League this year is a return to parity after Cornell’s dominant three-year reign. In that spirit, I’m picking the Bulldogs in a slight upset at the Palestra.
Pick: Yale 68, Penn 65
COLUMBIA at DARTMOUTH
Dartmouth could really, really use a win this weekend, if not over the Big Red, then against Columbia on Saturday. Without a victory, the Big Green will head on the road to face the Killer P’s and almost certainly be looking at an 0-6 Ivy record to start the season.
Unfortunately, I don’t see Dartmouth picking up a win against a hot Lions team. Let the spiral begin in Hanover.
Pick: Columbia 65, Dartmouth 50
BROWN at PENN
The Bears are similarly in need of a win this weekend. Already sitting at 0-2, Brown would be relegated from a contender to a spoiler if it were unable to capture a victory here.
The Quakers, like the Bears, have been wildly unpredictable this season, with baffling losses to a 4-17 Marist team and a 3-17 Manhattan squad. But I look at Penn’s roster and see a team that, on the surface, should be able to compete for the Ivy title.
If I had to stake my reputation on one of these teams, I would have to choose the Quakers. So for now I’ll take another quaff of the Penn Kool-Aid.
Pick: Penn 67, Brown 58
YALE at PRINCETON
Without a doubt, this will be the best matchup of the weekend. This game epitomizes why Ivy basketball is so special. Nowhere else in the college basketball universe does a conference game carry title implications this big before February. Princeton and Yale are supposed to be two of the top three contenders. Let’s see who makes a statement tomorrow. I like Princeton.
Pick: Princeton 66, Yale 64
CORNELL at HARVARD
A not-so-small part of me is really looking forward to this game. Cornell was such a headache for the other Ivies over the last three seasons, I have a great sense of schadenfreude watching its demise. I hope the Crimson can embarrass the Big Red as badly as the 86-50 curb-stomping at Newman last year, but I think Harvard would settle for a win.
Pick: Harvard 73, Cornell 61

Harvard has been the home of past innovators like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Now it could be your turn to strike it rich with this year's I3 Challenge.
Applications for the Harvard College Innovation Challenge are due on Jan. 30. To participate in the challenge, teams of undergraduate entrepreneurs submit business plans in the hope of being awarded grant money to support the project.
Just what is considered innovative? Judges are looking for projects, which cater to a demonstrable need and have well defined objectives.
"We're looking for students who have that drive and passion for their idea," said Alex R. Gerson '12, who is organizing the competition.
The top prizes awarded in the competition receive $10,000 grants. The projects will also receive "comprehensive feedback" from the panel of judges, Gerson said. More information on the Harvard I3 challenge can be found here.

Harvard Astronomy Lecturer Howard A. Smith recently declared that life beyond Earth is impossible, after examining some 500 planets and finding that they were all hostile to life, but not all members of the Harvard community are convinced.
President and Founder of the Harvard College Association Group Promoted to Inter-Planetary Expansion Benjamin M. Zagorsky '12 believes that the probability extra-terrestrial life, most likely some form of bacteria, exists in the universe is close to 100 percent. And in our galaxy, he said the probability is around 40 percent.
"The only way that we're going to run into some other sentient life forms, though, is they have the same definition of habitable as we do, and they look to the Earth and are like, 'Ooooh, that's some nice real estate there,'" Zagorsky said.
"Even if there are some sort of arsenic-based life forms that have established a galactic empire not too far away and not too far away being like 30,000 light years away–they might not be interested in the Earth, since we're oxygen-based," he added.
But Zagorsky doesn't really put an emphasis on finding his little square, brown friend with a glowing finger. In our own small solar system, there is water, so there might be bacteria frozen in some ice cap.
"The most pressing step for our generation is getting settlements on other planets. The future of space travel is the private sector. Having a frontier has always been a driving force for history," he said.
There are just a few issues left, Zagorsky added. "Like we have to get better at cryogenics, and I'm not talking about the stuff that we did to Ted Williams."
