After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s English faculty hosts a powerhouse of acclaimed creative writers. As lecturers and professors, they devote countless hours to passing on the skills of their craft to students. The Crimson asked four faculty members who teach fiction-writing classes to share their creative writing wisdom.
“You can make an entire world up in your head and transmit it to other people with scribbles on a page,” said Claire Messud, a Senior Lecturer. “Making up stories is open to all of us.” While not every Harvard student will have the opportunity to take their classes, anyone can try their hand at creative writing.
Start small, and make time to write.
Paul Yoon, Briggs-Copeland Lecturer, in an email: Start small. Oftentimes when we have an “idea” to write something, we’re operating on a level that is somewhat abstract and leans on the bigger picture. How to begin a story you want to tell? I like starting with just one sentence or focusing on an object or a specific detail, like describing setting or one character trait. Just that. Go micro, focus. Start small. And go step by step from there.
Claire Messud, Senior Lecturer: Learning the habit of making time for writing is the challenge for many people. Almost everybody makes time to exercise now. It’s just the same—you can say, I’m going to sit at my desk for an hour, or write until I have 200 words. You just make a plan. If you do something several times a week for weeks and months, you will get better at it.
Imagine the iceberg, not just the tip.
CM: It isn’t just about figuring out a plot and characters. It’s about really imagining the world, circumstances, and particularities of those characters and that situation—not just what’s going to appear on the page, but the entire world. Hemingway speaks about the tip of the iceberg. The tip of the iceberg is what the story is, but there’s an entire iceberg under the water. You have to make the iceberg to make the story.
Revise for clarity.
Laura M. van den Berg, Briggs-Copeland Lecturer, in an email: In my experience, a common struggle for students is the discomfort of sitting with the uncertainty of the first draft—i.e. I’m not sure where this story is going, I don’t know what this character is up to, I don’t know how it will end. Sometimes students worry that this not-knowing is a sign that they’re doing something wrong, when the not-knowing is very often an essential part of the process.
I tend to write my own drafts very quickly and messily and intuitively—and then spend a lot of time re-shaping and re-casting and re-imagining. In the first draft, the most important question I ask myself is “Why not?“ For every draft after the first, the question is, “Why?”
CM: Revision is really at least 50 percent of the work. Some of the things to think about: How much of what’s in my head have I conveyed on the paper? Have I been clear? It’s great to be beautiful or lyrical or inventive, but none of it matters if you haven’t expressed clearly what you wanted to express. The process of revision is about a clarification and a distillation. If you have three scenes, each of which does one thing, can you figure out a way to have one scene that will do all three things?
Read as if living depended on it.
Jamaica Kincaid, Professor of African and African American Studies in Residence, in an email: It is more important that you read than to write because when you are writing you have first read what you are writing before you write it. So the best thing, so it seems to me, for a writer is to read as if living depended on it. Nothing else really matters.
LMV: If you want to write poems or short stories or essays or novels, it is critically important to have read deeply in the genre—from the canon to what the canon has missed to what’s being written right now to everything in-between. And of course writers should also read expansively, roaming outside the genres they themselves work in.
PY: Always be open to inspiration. “Best American Short Stories” is a fantastic anthology. In terms of literary magazines, I think my current favorite, the ones that feel bold and ambitious and the ones I consistently want to pick up are: Tin House, A Public Space, and Ecotone. Books and stories are our best teachers.
Take your time during the publishing process.
LMV: Take your time getting to know the landscape. Read literary magazines and get a feel for who regularly publishes work that you love. Pay attention to where writers you admire have published/are publishing their work. Make sure you have given your work everything you have before you send it out into the world—an editor (almost always) is only going to read the piece once. Mightily resist the urge to rush.
No writing is wasted.
CM: No writing is a waste of time. You can always write better, and any writing you do is going to teach you how to write. You just have to dive in. You have to be unafraid. The language is ours. What a great freedom.

It’s Valentine’s Day. You’re already sick of the heart-shaped chocolates, the tacky red and pink flyers, and the advertisements for movies, concerts, and shows you’d attend—if you had a plus-one. You’re tired of binge-watching: You can only rewatch your favorite rom-coms so many times. You’re even tired of binge-eating: You can’t enjoy your Zinneken’s waffle in peace because the Datamatch dates are taking all the seats.
But how about binge-reading? Here are five reads inspired by this exhausting holiday through which you can experience love vicariously, ranked in order of how likely they’ll be assigned to you by a Harvard professor.
5. r/relationshipsIf you’re a nosy gossip and/or you want some brutally honest views on love, then r/relationships is the right place for you. In this particular subreddit, people rant about their problems and invite the internet to help solve them. Make sure to scroll down, because the comments can be even more interesting than the original post. Life Pro Tip (“LPT,” in Reddit terms): You can organize posts by subject tag (dating, breakups, infidelity) or by relevance (hot, controversial, top).
4. FanfictionForget real people. Who needs a date in real life if you’ve got an OTP (“one true pairing,” for those of you who aren’t true fangirls) on your favorite show? Fantasy worlds are infinitely better because you can imagine your ideal reality. So your favorite show ended, but you still can’t get enough. Fanfiction can solve that. Check out "Archive of Our Own", which organizes fanfiction from its members by fandom. Common ones include “Harry Potter,” “Sherlock,” “Doctor Who,” and “Supernatural,” but there’s a fanfic for literally every love interest ever.
3. “Valentine” by Carol Ann DuffyThis short and sweet poem condemns the cliché and consumerist “cute cards” and “kissograms” associated with your least favorite holiday. Instead, Duffy replaces the universal symbol of love (the heart) with something unexpected (a certain vegetable which I will not reveal—read the poem)!
2. The “Modern Love” columnTired of conventional love stories? The essays featured in this New York Times column range from the comedic and ridiculous (curious about cuddle parties, but too scared to find out for yourself?) to the emotional and poignant (this writer, diagnosed with cancer, sums up her husband’s best qualities in an advertisement searching for a replacement wife). If you’re a lonely and confused college student, you can also check out winning entries written by other lonely and confused college students for their annual essay contest.
1. “Symposium” by PlatoIf you’re confused about love, maybe philosophy can help you. Plato’s collection of speeches presented by seven different philosophers features diverse and insightful opinions on the purpose, nature, and beauty of love. In the work’s most famous oration, the character Aristophanes absurdly but poetically suggests that we all once were spherical beings, until Zeus punished humanity by slicing us into halves. Now we spend our lives searching for our other halves to complete ourselves. Tragically romantic. (And yes, this was assigned reading for ninety freshman last semester. I’m looking at you, Humanities 10a.)

Valentine’s Day, that grandest alloy of sexuality, affection, and materialist orgy that provokes some of the loneliest and saddest feelings of the year in at least 22% of us, might be the most Harvard holiday we celebrate. In order to help us all find some love (or at least some sincere emotion) this holiday, I hereby present the five most appropriate—though not necessarily best—songs on my killer Valentine’s Day Spotify playlist, which the tech wizards over at 14 Plympton Street have embedded in full at the bottom of this article.

5. “Valentine Day” by Paul McCartneyI mean, come on. “Valentine Day,” which shares a name with the damn holiday, is the ideal song to kick off this playlist. Paul McCartney plays every instrument on this multi-tempo jam from his first post-Beatles album. The homemade feel takes you to a place both intimate and far away, as do the lack of words. Let’s face it: Lyrics will probably make you sadder, so why have any at all?


4. “Blue Moon” by Billie HolidayDating back to 1934, “Blue Moon” is one of the first examples of modern pop, inspiring countless covers from iconic artists like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis. But none could match the relaxed bliss of Lady Day’s version. Holiday picks up the tempo and the mood for a “Blue Moon” that truly celebrates the narrator’s transformation from loneliness to exquisite romance. Plus, praying for the lunar spirit to grant you “someone [you] really could care for” sounds a lot less intimidating and more successful than asking your section crush for their number. If that strategy worked for Billie Holiday, The Crimson is proud to endorse it.


3. “A Case of You” by Joni MitchellIf you’re not in tears by the end of this song from Joni Mitchell’s acclaimed album “Blue,” get out of my face. Stop reading this article. Never open The Crimson’s website again. We don’t want you here. Aching melody, literary lyric, and a vocal performance swimming in vulnerability combine with Mitchell’s typically masterful guitar playing for a devastating masterpiece about a love painfully nearing its end. “A Case of You” impeccably captures the longing and disappointment we all know (right?) from stoplight parties in the Quad.


2.  “Hannah Hunt” by Vampire WeekendDespite their reputation for too-clever Ivy League lyrics, Vampire Weekend can speak to the heart with the best of them. “You and me, we got our own sense of time,” Ezra Koenig sings over an instrumental track of bass and piano that sounds like it’s submerged in water. “Hannah Hunt” is a reflection on a cross-country road trip with the titular girl, creating its own world for the narrator to discover love and intimately discuss his fears. A mid-song shift to harder pop transforms the chorus from hushed vulnerability to terror. Oh, sorry, is this tonally out of line? It’s a great song!

1. “Yellow” by ColdplayEarly Coldplay may not be the obvious choice for #1, but I’ll answer these doubts with a question: Doesn’t haughtiness toward Coldplay come from the same fear of earnest emotional exposure that has classically doomed romantic endeavors? Chris Martin’s lilting falsetto professes a love that encompasses the whole universe: “Look at the stars / Look how they shine for you.” But the song’s simplicity and anthemic riff bring it back down to earth. Unfortunately, the stadium-filling capabilities of “Yellow,” the most romantic track on their excellent debut album, would lead Coldplay down a road that has included “Hymn for the Weekend” and a Chainsmokers collaboration. If Valentine’s Day is the holiday to listen to this gorgeous ode to love, on what tragic day can we listen to “Something Just Like This” and mourn their descent?
(Author’s note: This playlist and the accompanying complex outlook on love date back to last year, when I was single. Now that I’ve found the perpetual bliss of going steady, I merely offer this playlist as a way for my lonelier friends to process all their feelings. Happy Valentine’s Day, Lauren!)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the flight from New York to Hong Kong, I watched three films, listened to an album, and drank three Tsingtao beers, a glass of red wine, and a glass of cheap whisky. The sky outside was turning from pitch black to pale white. I had forgotten which direction along the earth we were flying, so I wasn’t sure if it was sunrise or sunset.
The flight attendants started delivering refreshments again. I wanted to throw up, but couldn’t make it happen. So I thought, maybe this was a good time to reflect on my life. I tried to meditate by imagining myself as a compact cassette. The play button popped up with a crisp sound as the stop button was pressed, then the tape went “whoosh” like a roaring train, screeching to a halt when there was only white leader on the left reel.
Play. I was lying in bed, squinting to watch my nanny hanging a quilt by the window. “You need to get up or the sun’s gonna roast you like a duck,” she laughed at me. That sunshine left a deep impression on both my mind and my body. If I tried really hard, I could still feel that warmth on my stomach and see strong contrast between the fierce light and the black rectangle my quilt’s shadow formed.
Another moment, maybe earlier, maybe later. I was looking at myself as a baby on the television, trying to walk on the white tiles of our old apartment, waving my hands for balance. “Who is that?” Mom asked. I watched the timecode of the VHS player updating in sync with the images on the television.
I still wanted to throw up. This meditation business wasn’t helping.
*
I spent my first day in Hong Kong looking outside the window. On the second day I watched television. For food, I took the elevator down from my tiny hostel room to the third floor, where there was a Cafe de Carol, and then took the same elevator up. On the third day I took a walk in Mong Kok. Neon signs abounded, like in those pictures of Hong Kong on the Internet. I had dinner at a hawker centre.
On the fourth day I met a girl. We were both sitting alone by the window at a Vietnamese restaurant. She was very carefully doing her nail polish, her fingers dancing as the brush went from one to the next. When she finished, she looked at me and presented her newly-red nails. I immediately felt my cheeks getting hotter. I hadn’t realized that she knew I was watching.
“It’s pretty.” I said, “I noticed you gave particular care to your right hand’s little finger.”
“Did I?” She said, “I guess it’s my favorite one.”
It was silent for a while. “This is kind of a weird thing to ask a stranger,” I said, “But would you like to paint my nails? It doesn’t seem like our food is coming anytime soon anyway.”
She smiled. “Are you sure? Red nail polish can draw a lot of attention when a guy wears it.”
I shrugged.
She took my hand and started painting. She asked me what I was doing in Hong Kong. I said I was trying to write a script for a short film.
“It is nice and quiet in this town,” she said. “Perfect for writing.”
I looked at the cars rushing through the crossroad below us. At the footbridge, a few people stood holding up real estate advertisements. “I can only meditate on the dance floor,” I said.
“Ha,” she laughed. “What a party animal you are.”
I couldn’t tell if she was being ironic. I thought it was pretty obvious to both of us that I was not a party animal. Her pho came before she finished my nails. As we ate we talked about different things. We talked about Hong Kong, Macau, the upcoming New Year’s Eve, how my family had moved from the mainland to the U.S. when I was a teenager, and what I thought of Hong Kong in comparison to New York. I assumed that she was a few years older than me and that she was working. But she didn’t tell me anything about herself. Before she left, she told me I should go to a club called Social Room on Saturday—to meditate. She might also be there.
I finished up my pho alone and replayed our conversation in my mind. I really hoped I had impressed her. I didn’t know why I cared, but I hoped I had said something witty and nothing stupid. I hoped I had shown an interest in her without being too obvious. I wasn’t sure if I had been trying to hit on her.
When I got back to my room I thought about how I spent more time remembering and imagining experiences than actually living them, and I really didn’t like that about myself. I looked through my window at the old people karaoke-ing in the street and thought that they were superior to me in this regard. I read until I fell asleep.

In 2006, The Killers were mad. They were fresh off touring in support of their debut album, “Hot Fuss,” and everyone still thought they were British. They decided that they needed to show how American they were in their next album. To show off their roots, The Killers wrote an album designed to emulate a certain sound—Bruce Springsteen’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.”
In the 1970s, Springsteen was a star on the rise. While his first two albums weren’t hits, Springsteen’s reputation was stellar. Not only did critics embrace him, but celebrities like David Bowie did as well. More than anything else, Springsteen’s early music could be characterized by a love of New Jersey and an embrace of the downtrodden there. With his third album, the breakout hit “Born to Run,” Springsteen outgrew his hometown of Asbury Park in an instant. “Born to Run” was a masterful album that loved its subjects just as much as it pitied them. It reshaped the face of rock music, creating the heartland rock genre.
But before Springsteen could continue his success, he became embroiled in a lawsuit against Mike Appel, his former manager, who had signed him to an unfair contract. By the time the legal battle had ended, the musical landscape had changed entirely. With punk ascending, songs had shrunk in length and in narrative ambition. And Springsteen wasn’t special anymore either. Other musicians had bought into “Born to Run”’s vision and the radio was flooded with artists like Bob Seger and Tom Petty. But when Springsteen came back, he changed the narrative entirely—again.
The recording process for “Darkness on the Edge of Town” was intense and the process of cutting the 70 songs Springsteen wrote down to a more reasonable amount proved challenging, but the net result was worth the effort. “Darkness on the Edge of Town” is not a happy album. Gone are the big solos and the empowering stories of hope and success against all odds. All that’s left is a building sense of desolation. Failed by their country, the subjects of “Darkness” are in dead-end lives. Their drives to escape their woes at the beginning of each side of the album quickly change to emptiness and abandonment. This is signified not only lyrically, but also by a much tighter structure than Springsteen had ever used. Gone is the jamming on “Born to Run” and “The Wild, the Innocent.” What remains is a concise set of songs reaching in and drawing on these feelings of abandonment.
Springsteen was a master of character creation—maybe even more so than his primary influence, Bob Dylan. While we might see (or wish to see) certain angles of ourselves in the addled, self-hating, or misadventuring lovers or poetic heroes that populated Dylan’s fantastical classics, Springsteen’s protagonists appear in flesh and blood—ordinary people, overflowing with passions, crippled by fear, sometimes driven by desperation to do extraordinary things. Not until “Darkness” did he fully realize this vision, stripping away the romantic optimism and widening his scope to an ambitious, universalist portrait of America. “Darkness” includes snapshots from New Jersey to Nevada to Kentucky, and seems to reflect the whole country, creating an inescapable sense of desperation and desolation.
Repeating a trick from “Born to Run,” Springsteen magnifies the fall from hope with brilliant sequencing. Each side of the record begins with a burst of (relative) optimism: Tom-tom fills kick off the upbeat anthemic classics “Badlands” and “The Promised Land.” But both halves get slower and darker in parallel until their devastating finales, “Racing in the Street” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The title track revisits the characters in “Racing,” seemingly after years of heartbreak and disillusionment. It’s bleak enough that they risked their lives for the adrenaline rush—just to escape relationship trouble or to avoid the fate of the guys who “just give up living / And start dying little by little, piece by piece.” By the finale, they’ve learned that the solution was painfully temporary.
Despite the pessimism, the tightness and the universality of “Darkness” make it an accessible album. Even though the album didn’t have a real hit, its legacy and influence only grew over time. “Darkness” perfected the heartland rock genre—a genre meant to embrace working class American life through its depiction of such a life as joyless and cursed. The “Darkness on the Edge of Town” era was when Springsteen reached his creative and vocal zenith. His writing was succinct and his voice took on a rugged, haunted quality that sounded both impossibly human and otherworldly. His energy at the time was inexhaustible. It was in this period that the mythology of Springsteen came into its own.
Today, Springsteen codes for many things: masculinity, classic rock, and working class American life, all of which are rooted in “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” Nowadays, when artists like The Killers, Counting Crows, Arcade Fire, Japandroids, and even Ed Sheeran want to play up their roots, they borrow heavily from the sweeping, urgent sound Springsteen crafted on “Darkness” to show who they “really are.” It’s ironic to the point of absurdity that the defining sound of authenticity since the ’90s comes from a man who wrote an album about mostly fictional characters.
In many ways, “Darkness on the Edge of Town” is Springsteen’s most powerful album. Beyond the bleakness, “Darkness” signaled a vulnerability that brought people in and made them care. This connection prepared Springsteen for subsequent forays into bigger and brighter pop, but it also helped cement his legacy as the symbol of the American working class. Springsteen appeared to speak for all the disenfranchised and the downtrodden, memorializing their lives in his music.
That’s precisely what The Killers had in mind when they recorded their follow-up album. “Sam’s Town” proved that The Killers were American. Simultaneously, it demonstrated that the best way to tell the world who you are is by ripping off “Darkness on the Edge of Town.”
—Staff writers Edward M. Litwin's and Trevor J. Levin's column, "Sound and Vision," evaluates the cultural legacy of the late 1970s, one album at a time.

Many white individuals do not understand why the use of the n-word, even in the absence of the hard “r,” is still considered very offensive and inappropriate by the majority of the black  community. At almost every party at Harvard, whoever is managing the music will inevitably play a song that contains the n-word, and at almost every party at Harvard, jubilant, tipsy non-black individuals will loudly yell along to each phrase, failing to omit the n-word when it comes up. The issue is not that most of these students are malicious or blatantly racist. The issue is that most of these students are ignorant to the weight that the word holds, even without the hard “r.” While most college students are aware of the basic history of the n-word, many are unaware that this history still continues. Even in spheres as liberal as college campuses, black individuals occasionally remain the target of this racial slur, a remnant of the long-ago era of slavery.
Over time, black people have taken ownership of the slur, dropping the hard “r” to form a related word that refers to black community, in an effort to counteract the original word’s spiteful history. But that word does not hold the same meaning when said by anybody who is not black. When non-black individuals vocalize the n-word, a reminder of the malice associated with its roots remains, and elicits a strong sense of unease from many black persons who witness its expression. The n-word with no hard “r” (hereafter referred to as the “soft n-word”) should still be reserved for only black individuals, especially because racial prejudice still exists in 2018. (There is some debate as to whether or not anybody—even black people—should casually vocalize the soft n-word, but that is beyond the scope of this article).
For black persons, the soft n-word has become an expression of community, an acknowledgement of shared obstacles, and a piece of black culture. Repeating that word from outside that community is both to appropriate a piece of that culture and to adulterate the meaning of the word.  If the soft n-word is used by non-black individuals, it cannot logically signify black brotherhood and sisterhood. Stripped of its new meaning, the term risks regressing into the Antebellum-era definition of centuries ago.
Though intangible, using the soft n-word is not all that different from wearing a cultural garment, such as an African dashiki. Just as it is unacceptable for non-black individuals to casually saunter about wearing African dashikis, it is likewise offensive for non-black persons to say the n-word. Wearing a dashiki is a display of cultural legacy, and it simply can’t hold that same meaning for those who possess a different heritage. When someone who is not of significant African heritage wears a dashiki, it inherently changes the meaning of said display. By casually saying the soft n-word—even by repeating it as a music lyric—a non-black person inherently changes its meaning. These are two textbook cases of cultural appropriation.
It is safe to say that the majority of non-black persons at Harvard who use the soft n-word aren’t blatantly racist. Even if not intended as such, however, the use of this word by non-black individuals is undeniably cultural appropriation. When a famous black rapper includes the soft n-word in his or her music, that does not give non-black listeners a free pass to verbalize it when singing along. Though the word is common in black art, the underlying malicious history of the word has not been washed away. As long as this history remains relevant, the n-word, “hard” or “soft,” should not be used by people who are not black.
—Contributing writer Uzochi P. Nwoko’s column, “Where Rap Meets Race,” explores how predominant motifs in rap impact the black community.

There is a photograph my mother is fond of showing people whenever she explains how far I have fallen. I am insolent now, uncharacteristically so, and she is unused to seeing my anger so unhidden. “See how happy we were?” she laments, phone in hand, zooming in on the expertly cropped image. In it, we are standing soldier-like behind a table overflowing with food. The corners of our mouths are upturned in the same way. “10th grade, Thanksgiving break,” she explains. “She had just gotten back from boarding school.” And then, invariably, she turns to me and asks, “Do you remember that? What a nice girl you were? Do you remember?”
I do, no matter what I try. I do.
* * *
As my parents stared me down for refusing my aunt’s casserole, my sister quietly finished her second helping of Thanksgiving turkey. She was fearless where I faltered.
Hard-boiled eggs, hollowed and rinsed of any remaining yolk, were not dangerous. Neither were watercress leaves in sealed plastic bags. I carried these things in tin lunch boxes, like a child. My mother often scolded me for wasting food. She had watched girls thinner than I was wrestle over cups of flour, knobbed fingers caught in the spaces between ribs. My sister always took the rejected gray yolks into her mouth without complaint. Later, she would remark on their smoothness.
I pushed a plate of sautéed collard greens across the table. I didn’t like the way the oil glinted at me.
Of my own volition I had been hungry for almost three months. There were certain dietary staples I did not stray from, romaine lettuce and steamed broccoli chief among them. I had a fear of growth and a fear of death simultaneously. Faced with fats and starches I felt lust and disgust in equal measure. Sometimes it was hard to differentiate learned from innate revulsion. I never liked bacon before and when I began to comprehend the meaning of the grease it left on the griddle, I grew to hate it. The same went for cream cheese and bagels, whose rich blandness was best complemented by the brininess of stomach acid and the hot relief of mistakes forgiven. My tongue forgot flavor—my mind invented it in plates of naked green things.
Being home scared me but not for the reasons it should have. I had succeeded, and hating decline as much as I did made success a paranoid place. The tomatoes were too sweet to be trusted. The measuring spoons were warped from the heat of the dishwasher. I imagined my body growing withered. I imagined my body growing swollen. No salad bar safety. No dorm room hiding place. There would be lunches —matinées—and dinners and dinners and dinners.
“Audrey,” I found myself whispering, “Aren’t you afraid?” I imagined biting into the turkey’s thick roasted flesh, the gravy coating my lips with a slimy layer of fat.
“Afraid of what? Them?” She glanced toward my mother and father. “No, not right now.”
I opened my lunch box in my lap and extracted one half of an egg white. I couldn’t bear to chew it. My tongue ran involuntarily along the concave surface, picking up forgotten flakes of yolk, whose quasi-creaminess I held in my mouth for several minutes.
“Mommy, can I have some more?” Audrey gestured to the mashed potatoes. My mother gazed past her, unhearing as usual.
I stood, faced the wall, and emptied my cholesterol-contaminated mouthful into a napkin. When I turned back, I felt my mother’s arm curl around my body, watched her face contort into a red carpet smile. Before I could brace myself, I saw the flash of my uncle’s camera from across the table.
—Staff writer Angela F. Hui's column, "My Sister Will Be Hungry," is a serialized work of fiction centered around a college student's relationships with her mother and sister. The story explores the effects of collective cultural trauma on the second generation of an American family.

One of the frequently-asked questions on the Phillips Brooks House Association website is: “How can PBHA be both community-based and located at Harvard?” In response, PBHA cites its “decades-long partnerships” with the communities where it operates and points to the number of people from these communities who staff the programs. This level of community engagement is admirable, but it should be much more commonplace in the way Harvard thinks and talks about public service.
As I sat in my freshman dorm room tabbing through a list of PBHA programs during shopping week last year, one jumped out: the College High-school Alliance: A Nexus For Creative Education. According to the PBHA website, “CHANCE works with students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School to develop the desire, support, and motivation to gain admission to college and to succeed there and beyond.” I thought of my high school classmates and the strong and supportive community that they had found at CHANCE, and I pictured the three Harvard students who had given their time to my fifth-grade class through the CIVICS program, a program run jointly by the Institute of Politics and PBHA, which kindled a lasting interest in politics for me and many of my classmates.
In that moment, I realized that the program descriptions of many projects that support Cambridge kids are targeted toward potential volunteers that see them very differently than we had as their beneficiaries. Students in Cambridge, like those in many school districts, face a range of obstacles to college admission and success, but a lack of desire or a shortage of motivation are not among them. They more closely align with the school district’s description of CHANCE: “Harvard students provide off-campus tutoring in… general studies, SAT and TOEFL prep courses, problem solving, writing workshops, college advising and essay help.”
In short, the program addresses a systemic lack of access to tangibly beneficial and necessary support. It meets a demonstrated community need without presuming to do more. It seeks to rectify an injustice of unequal access, not a gap in intrinsic motivation. It is a deeply productive program with a deeply problematic presentation to Harvard students that reflects a pattern in how students approach interaction with the Cambridge community. Programs must sell themselves to Harvard students based both on their community impact and on their desirability as clubs, and the necessity of the latter can distract from the execution of the former. Even highly effective public service programs at Harvard still reflect a campus culture that treats being a good neighbor as an extracurricular activity rather than an obligation.
Many ways in which Harvard students engage with our host community do meaningful, substantial, and lasting good. Students provide mentorship, after school programming, and classroom instruction in civics, science, international relations and more, to communities from Allston to Cambridge to Quincy. Outside of PBHA, the University supports 20 partnerships with Cambridge Public Schools that sponsor summer schools, science internships and field studies, theater and museum visits, support for teachers and administrators, and more.
But true community membership by Harvard students requires more. To be in true community with our neighbors, Harvard students must come from a place of humility. Harvard people often talk about Cambridge as a set of problems in need of creative solutions, and often in need of Harvard students. A Crimson op-ed last year argued that the Cambridge Common “just needs bright minds to populate it” to be a great public park.
Harvard students have a lot to contribute to Cambridge, but what’s needed isn’t wisdom, motivation, or any other personal quality; it’s a willingness to participate meaningfully as residents of the city and to use the privilege that comes with being a student here to make contributions to existing community projects without any other pretense.
So join PBHA programs like Harvard CHANCE, CIVICS, or one of the many excellent after-school programs, and be willing to modify their services to meet changing community needs. Outside of direct service organizations, use economic power to support local businesses and residents. Buy, and read, each edition of Spare Change News. Use Cambridge's directory of businesses owned by women, people of color, LGBTQ+ -identifying people, and people with disabilities when you shop, to promote equality through your consumption. Push Harvard, the largest employer in Cambridge, to pay all of its workers a living wage. Cambridge needs people who hope to build justice here to commit their actions and resources, not just their ideas.
PBHA states that it has a “dual mission”: “providing vital experiences for generations of students in service and activism, while simultaneously offering programming throughout Greater Boston that meets stated community needs.” But to help meet that second goal, Harvard students should place less emphasis on personal or professional development through service and more on the direct services that we are able to provide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Novels and films typically sell relationships as rewarding romantic journeys. Consequently, we expect our ideal partners to simultaneously intrigue us, protect us, and develop us, all whilst preserving their envious physique (or for the less “superficial” among us, their personality.) On top of serving as our emotional caretakers and partners in crime, our significant others also serve as status symbols, reminding both our friends and ourselves that we’re someone worth loving and—more importantly—someone who’s loved. And yet, at the end of the day, all romances, to include my own, come short of meeting these societal standards.
This isn’t to say that my girlfriend hasn’t developed or protected me; throughout these past four years—five come April 14—she has repeatedly gone above and beyond to help me through my darkest moments. I’m not a cruel cynic seeking to prove that there’s no such thing as serious romantic love. But what concerns me are the fantasies we chase: pretty pictures that deliver nothing but disappointment.
Most people erroneously believe that if they can find the “right” person, a relationship can grant them eternal bliss. Two realities render this dream impossible. Firstly, a relationship isn’t a prerequisite for happiness. Until you learn how to live contently with yourself, you will find yourself repeatedly disappointed by your significant others as they continuously fail to deliver the confidence you so desperately desire, a confidence only you can grant yourself.
Secondly, unless you believe in a higher power or spiritual notions like destiny, there’s simply no such thing as the “perfect person.” You’re not humanity’s sole protagonist; no one was “put in place” or “created” for you to “discover.” However, for those of you who refuse to abandon your notions of romantic destiny, I propose the following exercise: Take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself, “Why on earth would the ‘perfect person’ date me?” By virtue of dating you (an imperfect person) your imagined “perfect” partner undermines their perfection. In other words, by definition, the perfect person will never love you.
Meaningful love more closely resembles embarking on a long, arduous drive with a close friend. Initially, the drive seems exciting. You and your friend exchange stories, crack jokes, and enjoy each other’s company. However, aside from the occasional humorous license plate, the highway’s landscape offers little entertainment. As the drive continues, your friend’s jokes (as well as your own) lose their appeal; if anything, they’re downright unbearable. You eventually run out of stories to share as you each grow increasingly irritable; soon, your only companion is an unimaginative radio host who does nothing but play the latest hits ad nauseum.
Later that evening you stop by an underwhelming burger joint for a quick dinner. As you start speaking to your friend once more, you realize that their jokes weren’t so bad after all; it was your anger and exhaustion, not their humor, that fueled your annoyance. You laugh again, share an old tale you thought you had already told but hadn’t, buy a snack or two, then hit the road once more.
A long-term relationship—like any long drive—will bore you at times. You will quickly realize that your significant other isn’t the funniest or most entertaining person. As their faults start to surface, their attractiveness will progressively diminish, leading you to question whether your relationship is worth your time, money, and gas.
That’s why it’s so important to enter a relationship knowing that your significant other will inevitably annoy you someday. Likewise, you too will fail to meet society’s expectation of how a serious romantic partner should look and behave. You and your partner will sometimes embrace petty behavior as part of immature, meaningless power struggles. You will both come to question your love at different times. You will both argue, and you will both get on each other’s nerves. And you know what? That’s normal, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar or a fool.
Love isn’t a matter of unlocking happiness by finding the “right person.” Love is about finding someone who is compatible—not perfect—and choosing to love them despite their imperfections in the hopes that they may one day come to love you too. It’s a long, tedious process that will stress you out, consume your time, and—despite your best efforts—may fail anyways.
I find that people at Harvard—particularly undergraduates—feel entitled to greatness. Great jobs, great pay, and great legacies: these are the things we believe life owes us. Most of us have foolishly extended this sense of entitlement to romance as well. Unfortunately, this sense of entitlement leaves us unusually vulnerable to our partner’s (and our own) imperfections, perhaps partly explaining why our relationships all too often serve as sources of social angst.
Tara knows how to make me anxious and occasionally uses this power to maximum effect. Likewise, I’m not the perfect boyfriend. During one of our relationship’s more troubling periods, Tara asked me why I even bothered Skyping her. I replied with something along the lines of “Skyping you is like paying my taxes; I simply have no choice.” Let’s just say my answer wasn’t the wisest.
However, I’d like to think I’ve learned a thing or two from my relationship with Tara. I don’t know what will happen once Tara leaves for pharmacy school and I ship out to serve Uncle Sam this summer. But I do know that these past few years have taught us how to look past our faults and love each other. Our relationship may not be an awesome odyssey of endless fulfillment, but at the end of the day, that’s not what love’s about. Once your long drive comes to close, all that matters is the following question: Can you look at the partner with whom you shared the journey and smile? If so, then you’ve got someone worth keeping.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, opposing political groups—like the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club—engage in frequent civil political discourse, from organized debates to joint statements to communal participation in the many programs at the non-partisan Institute of Politics. Further, for all students, lives are not defined by partisan affiliations. We can and do maintain friendships with those who disagree with us, and we see value in relationships with people even if we disagree, often sharpening our own beliefs or finding common ground in conversation with them. 
That spirit of mutual respect and shared commitment to dialogue is not, unfortunately, so common outside of Harvard and other colleges. Certainly, on the national political scene, it has almost disappeared. Congress and the nation are stuck in a path of continuously worsening polarization. There have been two government shutdowns in the last month alone even though there has been only one other in the last 20 years. And though some, like prominent blogger Matthew Yglesias, claim that polarization just represents an increasing understanding of how ideology translates into policy, and therefore might not necessarily be indicative of a problem, the correlation between this polarization and the public’s abysmal perceptions of Congress’ efficacy does not support this more charitable view. Polarization has bred paralysis.
If we are to un-paralyze our system and restore a sense of openness and trust to our society as a whole, we must take the traditions of dialogue learned at Harvard and bring them into the world with us. But others have gone before us, both from Harvard and other colleges, and failed to bring to Washington and the nation the commitment to dialogue that they too learned at school. For all of them, somewhere along the way, the tradition of bipartisan engagement got lost. Years of education, inquiry, and shared exploration have given way to rancor, bickering, and mutual mistrust.
What happened? How can a country where more than 95 percent of the members of Congress have a college degree lack the fundamental characteristics of the academic experience in their leadership? Are our leaders individually culpable for their failure to maintain traditions of dialogue? Have they simply forgotten their educational background? None of this seems possible.
Instead, there must be something structural about the difference between life on a college campus and life in the halls of Washington that makes norms of trust and dialogue difficult to maintain. The zero-sum game of electoral politics means that each side has every incentive to be in the majority, and moderates, often the key to common ground, fear being targeted at every election. Legislators beholden to special interests or a few wealthy donors must take hard lines on some issues, lest compromise cost them in fundraising or organizational support. Gerrymandering means that fewer and fewer districts are genuinely moderate or competitive, making moderates even more vulnerable to primary challenges from the flanks.
It is our responsibility, both as Harvard students and citizens more generally, to try to overcome these structural tendencies towards non-dialogue because we know from our Harvard lives that meaningful exchanges between even diametrically opposed groups bears fruit. We live the benefits of that dialogue every day: Our lives are enriched by the diverse company we keep.
There are two ways to do this. Firstly, we must address the structural problems in politics. Campaign finance reform and nonpartisan redistricting are both important steps in that direction. Media has a role too: If mainstream media organizations were less polarized, viewers would be brought out of information bubbles and politicians who compromised and appealed to moderates would be rewarded.
These are enormously difficult political victories to achieve, as the people who benefit from the current system are the ones who have been elected by it and are the ones with the power to change it. However, victories made in addressing these structural challenges would be self-reinforcing. The passage of comprehensive campaign finance reform, once achieved, would be very difficult to reverse without bearing the political risk of appearing to sell out democracy to the rich and powerful. Likewise, nonpartisan redistricting will increase the number of seats in the House, with moderate electorates more likely to send compromise-oriented representatives to Washington.
There is also a second, more personal way in which we can try to defeat the structural odds against reasoned exchange and compromise. While acknowledging the obstacles, we can make our own individual commitments to seek dialogue with those we oppose at whatever level we one day find ourselves in society. This requires personal commitment to dialogue on both sides, not in an abstract sense, but rather in concrete determination to preserve the open exchange of ideas. This will be no easy feat, but if we are to restore in our government and society a culture of trust, dialogue, and cooperation, we must start with ourselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday afternoon, the presidential search committee announced that Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow will replace University President Drew G. Faust to become Harvard’s 29th president.
We are quite optimistic about their pick. Bacow has spent most of his life in higher education as an academic, administrator, and leader. His experience as president of Tufts University, given the largely positive reviews he received there, affords him an unprecedented level of qualification as compared to any University president in recent memory. In light of this, we find reason to agree with the faculty who have commended the search committee for choosing him.
However, on a more profound level, the committee’s pick of Bacow serves as a window into the priorities of the search committee. He will take office at a time when Harvard faces strong political, cultural, and financial headwinds. His selection reflects the aims of the Corporation, which comprised a majority of the searchers.
The emphasis of the selection—in resume, reputation, and rollout—has been the perception that Bacow is most qualified to face the threat that the current political climate poses to the status of higher education within our society. This, of course, does not mean that we or the searchers aim to discount other challenges the University faces, including Harvard’s financial situation, an area for which Bacow has sufficient experience.
Nevertheless, we are confident in Bacow’s ability to fulfill his role as this advocate for higher education at a time when we need it most, and we approve of the Corporation’s prioritization during this unprecedented time for colleges and universities around the country. Higher education is currently under siege by politicians: As a result of the recent Republican tax overhaul, Harvard’s endowment was set to be taxed, graduate stipends were nearly taxed, and the student loan deduction was nearly eliminated. But there is a reason why these political attacks are resonating with Americans. Many are feeling unprecedented antipathy towards higher education, which is extremely concerning.
That being said, we challenge Bacow to recognize that he is inheriting two jobs. While he is indeed becoming the face of higher education in America and around the world, he is also about to take the helm of our University. Since he is currently more familiar with Harvard’s administration than its students, we wish to see him actively try to engage with the latter.
Specifically, given Bacow's limited visibility to the College to this point—in comparison to his impressive experience with the University’s graduate schools—we encourage him to closely interact with students at the College and to maintain a focus on their experiences, just as he did at Tufts.
And despite calls for a more groundbreaking presidential choice in terms of racial and gender diversity, we do not believe Bacow should be judged individually on his personal identity. Indeed, his upbringing in a region of America that increasingly feels left behind by economic and educational progress will likely give him insight into how to assuage the mistrust of universities.
Finally, while we express here a positive outlook on the Bacow presidency to come, we also feel it incumbent upon us to remind him and our readers that we will scrupulously hold him accountable. We, and Crimson Editorial Boards to come, look forward to commending his successes and constructively critiquing his failures, and will continue to be even-handed yet passionate in our role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2018 at 1:38 a.m.
Harvard College received a record-breaking 42,742 applications for admission to the Class of 2022–setting a record for the fourth consecutive year and exceeding last year’s pool by more than 3,000.
This roughly 8 percent increase represents the first time the applicant pool numbers more than 40,000.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons attributed this increase, in part, to the College’s financial aid program. He said affordability was likely a high priority for many applicants.
“I think affordability and accessibility are critical and they become more critical, I think, for more people every year,” Fitzsimmons said.
The applicant pool is marked by an increase in students requesting aid from the College, with 75.5 percent applying for financial aid and 25.9 percent requesting an application fee waiver. The increase in these early indicators of economic diversity comes 15 years after the launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which aims to make the College affordable for all admitted students, regardless of their income.
Women, making up 50.3 percent of the applicant pool, slightly outnumber men in this year’s group.
Applications from certain minority racial groups increased at a higher rate than that of the overall applicant pool. In particular, the College saw an an 18.7 percent increase in applications from African Americans and a 14.9 percent increase in those from Asian Americans. These demographic changes come as the College continues to face legal scrutiny regarding its race-conscious admissions practices.
Fitzsimmons attributed these demographic changes in the applicant pool to changes in the demographics of the country as whole, as well as to the unique appeal Harvard may hold for minority students in particular.
“If you’re interested in African and African American studies, for example, this is an amazing place to be: Harvard and, for that matter, the greater Boston area,” Fitzsimmons said.
For Asian American applicants, Fitzsimmons said,  “a 14 percent jump in one year is a lot. So, there’s certainly, clearly interest in Harvard among Asian American families.”
Continuing an upward trend in students interested in STEM concentrations over the past several years, this year’s pool saw a 19.7 percent increase in prospective students who reported they were interested in studying computer science on their applications.
“There’s a lot of excitement out there about technology, computer science, engineering, and the applied sciences, generally,” Fitzsimmons said. “Given that, and given the changes that have taken place here it’s no wonder, in a lot of ways, there’s been such an increase.”
Geographic diversity in the applicant pool increased as well. There were greater numbers of applications from each region of the United States, with significant jumps in applications coming from the South. Applications from international students remained at roughly the same level.
With a record number of applications—and after the College’s announcement that it will accept fewer students to its regular decision pool for the Class of 2022—applicants may face a particularly competitive admissions process this year. Nine hundred sixty-four students were already accepted in December during the College’s early action round.
Fitzsimmons emphasized the combined quality and size of the applicant pool, and reiterated his office’s decision to admit fewer students to next year’s freshman class.
“We will be very conservative this year. We will be projecting a yield of somewhere in the mid-80s,” Fitzsimmons said.
Several of the nation’s other top universities saw their applicant pools similarly break records this year. Yale received a record 35,305 applications, an increase of 7.3 percent from last year, according to the Yale Daily News. The Brown Daily Herald reported that Brown received a record 35,368, showing an 8 percent increase. And Dartmouth College received 22,005 applications, a 9.8 percent increase and also a new record, according to the Dartmouth.
Fitzsimmons said these increases may be the result of similar financial aid programs at Harvard’s peer institutions. He said political and economic issues both in the United States and abroad may push families to look at universities with robust financial aid programs.
“In times of anxiety,” Fitzsimmons said, “You want to go to a college that has great financial aid.”
The College will notify applicants of their admissions decisions on March 28. Admitted students will have until the national reply date of May 1 to accept or decline the offer.

Former colleagues and students of Harvard Physics Professor Julian S. Schwinger, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, gathered in the department Monday to celebrate the centennial of the late scientist’s birth.
Regarded as one of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, Schwinger is known for his groundbreaking contributions to the theory of quantum electrodynamics. He was a member of the Physics Department faculty from 1945 until 1974.
The speakers at the colloquium, many of whom are Nobel laureates themselves, included Sheldon L. Glashow, a math and science professor at Boston University, Walter Gilbert, professor emeritus and chair of the Society of Fellows, Physics Professor Roy J. Glauber ’46, and Daniel J. Kleitman, an applied math professor at MIT.
Though each of the panelists had different stories to share about Schwinger, they were in agreement about one thing: his lectures were one of a kind.
“He was a magisterial lecturer,” said Physics Professor and moderator of Monday’s panel Howard M. Georgi. “He just had total control, not just of the material, but of the class.”
Kleitman, too, remembered being enthralled by Schwinger’s lectures.
“Schwinger would arrive at the door and immediately begin his lecture. He spoke without notes and talked in a quiet voice, in a manner so crystal clear and persuasive that it was hypnotic,” Kleitman said. “We all listened and wrote notes with complete concentration. Nobody dared to ask a question.”
For Glauber, one of Schwinger’s lectures on his design of a new particle accelerator even changed the course of his own career path.
“It was extraordinary, because he had worked out every last detail of this device,” Glauber said. “No such lecture ever had the smoothness or continuity or obvious cogency of this particular lecture.”
After that single class, Glauber decided to finish his bachelor’s degree at Harvard—where Schwinger had recently become a professor—rather than returning to work at Los Alamos.
Glashow said his research on the unification of weak and electromagnetic forces, which won him the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics, was largely based on one of Schwinger’s ideas for Glashow’s dissertation. According to Glashow, Schwinger stepped in quickly to support the unorthodox proposal during his doctoral defense.
“At that point my exam was more or less over,” he said, to laughter from the audience.
“It was wonderful working with Julian,” Glashow said. “The one regret we had, which we expressed to one another much later, was that we never got around to writing that paper on the electroweak theory that we should’ve written.”
Schwinger died in 1994 and is buried at Mt. Auburn Cemetery, where his tombstone is engraved with symbols referring to one of his pioneering physics calculations.

Members of the faculty committee tasked with advising Harvard’s presidential search said several of its members had suggested the man who would ultimately land the job: Lawrence S. Bacow.
Bacow, a member of the Harvard Corporation, was not initially an obvious choice for the presidency; until mid-December, he sat on the very committee charged with finding a person to fill that office. But Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee '72, who led the search committee, said he urged Bacow to consider the job after many Harvard affiliates had recommended him.
Members of the faculty advisory committee were among his early supporters, according to committee member Alison J. Simmons, a philosophy professor.
“When we discussed in the abstract characteristics that we'd like to see in our president, a number of us looked at each other and said, ‘Well, Larry Bacow seems to have a lot,’” she said. “But he was on the search committee at the time.”
The 13-member faculty advisory committee formed in August 2017 as one of the three bodies tasked with aiding the official search committee, which included 12 members of the Harvard Corporation—including Bacow—and three members of the Board of Overseers. While the faculty committee did not have control over the ultimate decision, they shared their thoughts with search committee members in the fall.
Advisory Committee Chair Robin E. Kelsey, who also serves as dean of Arts and Humanities, said in an interview Monday there was “tremendous enthusiasm” from the advisory committee for Bacow’s appointment.
“I also know that when Bill Lee asked the members of the faculty advisory committee to let him know if there were any members of the search committee that they thought should be considered, that some members came forward in support of Larry,” Kelsey said.
In the press conference announcing Bacow’s appointment Sunday, Lee said the search committee prioritized feedback from the faculty advisory committee.
“The input of the faculty advisory committee chaired by Robin Kelsey was particularly important as we were viewing the many different possible candidates,” Lee said.
Lee also said Bacow’s name was suggested by faculty at Harvard and other institutions multiple times during the search.
Simmons said she first met Bacow while working on the presidential search. He and other members of the search committee took turns sitting in on the advisory meetings.
“He was quite involved in our early meetings, asked a lot of questions, offered a lot of thoughts,” Simmons said. “It was precisely the conversations with him on that that made me think he actually had a lot of the features that Harvard should be looking for.”
Throughout the search, members of the committee repeatedly denied or did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Kelsey said the proceedings of the search committee were kept confidential, and  the faculty advisory committee held its meetings from August into December. According to Lee, Bacow did not step down from the search committee until December.
“And so last December with no public fanfare, actually no public announcement at all, Larry Bacow stepped off the search committee and became a candidate,” Lee said at Sunday’s press conference.
Kelsey said Bacow recused himself from the search as the faculty committee was wrapping up its meetings.
“With respect to the advisory committee's proceedings, it was very late in the game,” Kelsey said.
Simmons said the early meetings with search committee members helped her better understand Bacow’s personality and style.
“He seems very open. He's a very good listener,” she said. “He'll push back with his own views but in a way that's not threatening, that makes it clear that he's really listening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shortly after Drew G. Faust was named the 28th president of Harvard University on Feb. 11, 2007, she ordered pizza.
After an improvised party celebrating her brand-new presidency, Faust said she remembers heading back to Greenleaf House, the traditional residence of the Radcliffe Dean, her then-job.
“I went back to Greenleaf, I was living in Greenleaf, and a group of my closest friends came back and we ordered pizza and we sat around and ate pizza,” Faust said in an interview last week.
“I don’t know if a new president would like to do the same thing or not,” she added.
It is unclear if Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow ordered pizza after his debut as the University’s 29th president-elect on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2018, exactly 11 years to the date after Faust’s first presidential appearance. And as of now, it is also unclear whether he will follow in Faust’s footsteps on a wide range of other, more important matters confronting the University as he begins the transition to his new role.
But for the next few months before Faust officially steps down on June 30, she and Bacow will face a delicate dance as she seeks to wrap up several signature initiatives from her presidency and he seeks to learn the ropes of the University’s top job. In interviews over the past two weeks, both said they will work to make the transition period as smooth as possible.
Bacow’s extensive knowledge of Harvard’s administration will likely aid the switchover. After serving for seven years on the Corporation, the University's highest governing body, Bacow is well-versed in how the University runs and has likely already considered many of the key issues Harvard must tackle in the next few years.
In the days before Bacow’s announcement, Faust said she did not expect to give her then-undisclosed successor any formal briefings on topics like the College’s penalties on single-gender social organizations.
“I will wait for my successor to indicate what she or he would like to hear from me,” she said. “I don’t think there’s any set of formal briefings that are anticipated at the moment.”
On other issues, like the University’s diversity-focused task force on Inclusion and Belonging—slated to release a final report later this semester—Faust said she still plans to set some new projects in motion before she steps down. She added, though, that she will consciously work to avoid limiting her successor.
“I’ve had conversations with the chairs of the task force about some of the things that I think might be coming forward and there are a number of them that I think I can invest in right away,” Faust said. “I also have some thoughts about how I can set some things in motion that my successor can either continue with or enhance or take a different direction on.”
“I don’t want to tie that person’s hands unduly but I do want to make sure that there’s momentum and immediate action in response to these recommendations,” she said.
More broadly, Faust said she has been extra conscious in her decision-making since she first announced her impending retirement in June 2017—mulling each decision in light of the effect it might have on number 29.
“As I do things I think, ‘Okay, am I going to constrain my successor in some way? How can I make sure that there’s a transition here that makes this policy or this selection make sense? How can I take actions that will support my successor rather than end up posing dilemmas for my successor?’” she said. “I have been thinking in those terms increasingly as the year has gone on.”
In particular, Faust said she has considered how her use of presidential discretionary funds might limit the next president. She said she has worked with the Corporation to ensure she leaves behind sufficient resources when she departs Massachusetts Hall.
Bacow, meanwhile, said in an interview Sunday that he plans to spend the next few months listening, in the hopes learn as much as he can about areas of the University with which he is less familiar.
“Harvard can only have one president, and it has a great one right now,” he said. “Between now and the end of  June, June 30, which is Drew’s last day, Drew will be our point person and leader in addressing those issues.”
“I’m going to be in full sponge mode,” Bacow added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ohio Governor John R. Kasich will deliver the 2018 commencement address at the Kennedy School on May 23, according to a press release.
Kasich has served as governor of Ohio since his election in 2010 and, more recently, unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He was also a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001 and chair of the House Budget Committee.
Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said in an interview Tuesday that administrators decided to invite Kasich out of admiration for his commitment to public service.
“We look for people who have made important contributions to public policy and who can convey to our graduating students and their parents and family members a vision of what people going into public service can do in the world,” Elmendorf said.
In a press release Tuesday, Kennedy School representatives emphasized Kasich’s efforts to improve Ohio’s economy, noting he added “almost 500,000 jobs” during his time as governor.
“Governor Kasich is a truly committed public servant who has gained respect from citizens and colleagues on both sides of the political aisle over a long and distinguished career,” Elmendorf wrote in the press release.
Kasich has a 57 percent approval rating as governor, according to a July 2017 Morning Consult poll. Still, he is facing scrutiny among fellow Ohio Republicans vying to replace him, including his Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor. The Cincinnati Daily Herald reported last month that Taylor was distancing herself from Kasich, reportedly saying she had not seen him for about a year.
Kasich announced in March 2017 that he will not be seeking elected office again after his term as governor ends in early 2019.
Still, some political analysts are naming Kasich, a critic of President Donald Trump both during and after the 2016 election, as a potential challenger to Trump in 2020. Further fueling rumors about his candidacy, Kasich plans to visit New Hampshire, the first state to vote in the presidential primaries, in early April to headline a discussion at New England College.
Elmendorf said he did not know whether Kasich is eyeing the presidency once again. He added he will not see the contents of Kasich’s speech prior to Commencement.
“What he says is up to him. The school gets no credits and there’s no responsibility for the views that are offered,” Elmendorf said.
Previous Kennedy School graduation speakers include former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright.

Angela Y. Davis, a famed political activist and scholar of African American, Marxist, and feminist studies,is donating her papers to the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library.
Davis,  a professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studies race in the criminal justice system and is an advocate for prison abolition.
She is also famously known for her radical activism in the 1960s as a leader of the Communist Party U.S.A., and for her support of the Soledad Brothers, three prison inmates charged with killing a guard in Soledad Prison in 1970.  Her involvement in the case resulted in her being charged with conspiracy. She was later acquitted.
The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America is a research library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, dedicated to housing archives documenting women’s lives and activities in the United States.
In a statement, Davis wrote that she felt honored her writings would join the work of other women who are “advocates of social transformation” at the library.
“My papers reflect 50 years of involvement in activist and scholarly collaborations seeking to expand the reach of justice in the world,” Davis wrote in a statement.
Faculty specializing in African American Studies believe the library housing Davis’s papers will help further academic study of her lifetime work.
“Schlesinger's acquisition of her papers will ensure that generations of students, scholars, and activists have access to her body of work and a better understanding of the histories she has helped to shape,” wrote Farah J. Griffin, a professor of English, Comparative Literature, and African American Studies at Columbia University.
Elizabeth Hinton, an assistant professor of History and African and African American Studies at Harvard, said Davis’s papers will also strengthen the Schlesinger Library’s stature as a center for studying the history of civil oppression.
“The acquisition of Angela Davis’s papers makes the Schlesinger Library even more vital for all those seeking a deeper understanding of the history of oppression and resistance on a global scale.” Hinton wrote in a statement.
The collection of Davis’s work includes letters, photographs, and audio from Davis’s radio show “Angela Speaks,” according to a press release from the library.  The library will also host materials related to Davis’s incarceration and trial from the Soledad Prison case, as well as the movement advocating for her release.
Davis’s papers will be available for research by  2020.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 15, 2018 at 4:37 p.m.
Mather’s House Committee is facing backlash from some Mather residents over a controversial Housing Day t-shirt design that several students criticized for what they called its racist undertones.
On Friday, the Mather House Committee, a social programming board that organizes events for  House residents, sent out a poll requesting students to vote on several options for the design of Mather’s annual Housing Day t-shirt.
One of the options comprised a t-shirt parodying Kendrick Lamar’s 2017 album, “Damn”; the design replaced the artist’s image with a gorilla, the mascot of Mather.
In the wake of the poll, students quickly took to one of Mather’s House-wide email lists to vent their frustration and list objections to the “Damn” design.
After receiving a private email, the House committee quickly removed the design and committee co-chairs Sofia C. Kennedy ’19 and Pablo A. Reimers ’19 issued an apology.
“We recognize that this issue has deeply offended members of our community, and for that we sincerely apologize,” Kennedy and Reimers wrote in an email to House residents. “We realize it is an issue in itself that we did not notice the racial connotations of the design and we hope to learn from this mistake.”
Kennedy and Reimers were not immediately available for comment Tuesday.
Housing Day is an annual College-wide celebration during which rising sophomores learn of their assignment to one of Harvard’s 12 upperclassmen Houses. Current House residents traditionally design and wear special t-shirts meant to reflect the House’s mascot or traditions.
Melonie N. Vaughn ’19, a Mather resident, said she was one of the students who replied to the House Committee’s email to question the proposed t-shirt.
Vaughn, who is black, called the design "racist." She said she was surprised the House committee disseminated the design to all Mather residents on the email list without subjecting the t-shirt to more scrutiny, calling it “one of the most disappointing and frustrating things that’s happened” to her at Harvard.
“Thinking about the process and what it took for them to get to that point, it’s just extremely disappointing and disturbing that the housing committee would look at an image of a black man, with his face turned into an ape, and would just be like, ‘this is okay,’” Vaughn said.
“I can’t even imagine how I would feel on Housing Day if I was a freshman who got assigned Mather and had to walk into the group of people welcoming me and see them wearing this image,” she added.
Kalila G. Jackson-Spieker, a Mather race relations tutor, and Mather’s House Committee organized a House-wide conversation Sunday afternoon to discuss the design. She encouraged students to “share any thoughts or concerns regarding the design” and “how we can do better moving forward.”
Jackson-Spieker did not respond to request for comment.
Amala Mahadevan and L. “Maha” Mahadevan, the Mather House faculty deans, attended this discussion and addressed residents in another House-wide email sent later that evening.
“There was agreement that we should implement some concrete steps to ensure that we are sensitive to our remarkably diverse and creative house even as we celebrate it, and equally the need to be respectful in our conversations on- and off-line,” they wrote. “HoCo and all of us are still digesting the events and discussions, but we are optimistic that we will come out of this a better, closer community.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION: February 15, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Mather House Committee co-chairs Sofia C. Kennedy '19 and Pablo A. Reimers '19 issued an apology for the t-shirt design after students sent emails over one of the House's email list. To clarify, Kennedy and Reimers issued an apology for the design after receiving a private email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board approved an election agreement earlier this month detailing the terms of Harvard’s upcoming unionization election. The election, which will be held on April 18 and 19, will determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants may collectively bargain.
The agreement resolves several long-standing issues that led to contested ballots in the original Nov. 2016 election, including the status of teaching assistants at the Graduate School of Design and the “lookback” period from which the list of eligible voters will be drawn.
The list of eligible voters will be generated from the March 12 payroll and will also include students who were employed as teaching assistants in the calendar year 2017.
Lawyers from the Harvard Graduate Students Union - United Automobile Workers and the University previously argued before the NLRB over whether the votes of students who were not employed as teaching assistants in Nov. 2016 would be counted.
Because graduate student course staff at the Design School are classified as teaching assistants rather than teaching fellows, they were excluded from the original University-generated voter list in 2016.  HGSU-UAW attorneys contested that designation in post-election hearings at the NLRB. The terms set for the upcoming second election resolve this issue, allowing the Design School TAs to participate.
Graduate student Jae Hyeon Lee, who created the group “Against HGSU-UAW,” wrote in an email he is pleased the agreement has better clarified students’ eligibility.
“It is a good thing that it is clearer now who is eligible to vote. However, I think the makeup of the voting population is still problematic,” Lee wrote. “For the upcoming election, a lot of first and second-year students who would be most affected by the outcome of the election will be excluded from the voters' list.”
“How is an election fair if those who have most at stake are not allowed to cast a vote?” he added.
Ph.D. students who have yet to complete their general examinations, often those in their first and second year at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, are not eligible to teach and therefore are not part of the bargaining unit until they begin.
The agreement also resolved the debate between Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University over the timeline for the generation of the voter list.
Harvard is required to provide a preliminary voter list to the NLRB and the union by Feb. 21. Eligible teaching and research assistants must be employed by Feb. 12 in order to be included on that list.
HGSU-UAW organizer and and graduate student Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that the union is happy with the timeline for of the list’s generation.
“We were pleased to see the NLRB took such a reasonable approach with a February list with revisions in March despite Harvard’s attorneys attempt to delay,” he wrote.
In an email sent to students earlier this month, Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran encouraged eligible voters to seek out information in the weeks leading up to the election.
“As we move forward with a second election, it is critically important to consider again the issues at stake and engage in a robust conversation about the potential impact of unionization,” he wrote.
Harvard must provide the final copy of the voter list by March 19. In the intermediate period, involved parties will review the voter list and add any students hired by the University after Feb. 12 but before March 12.

A third comeback in three games led Harvard women’s ice hockey to victory over Northeastern by a score of 4-3 in the Beanpot Consolation match on Tuesday evening. The victory gave the Crimson third place in the fortieth edition of the four team tournament, the third time the team has won the consolation match in the last three seasons.
Fans were treated to an extremely back and forth match at Boston College’s Conte Forum on Tuesday evening, with freshman forward Keely Moy’s early goal for Harvard  (12-13-2, 9-9-2 ECAC) getting cancelled out within 2 minutes by a Northeastern equalizer. The Huskies (14-14-3, 10-10-2 Hockey East) looked the more confident of the two sides early, scoring three unanswered goals to take a 3-1 lead before halfway through the second period.
The Crimson seemed to settle into the game as it progressed, starting to really test the Northeastern defense in the second period. Harvard went on to score three unanswered goals of its own, its comeback starting when a thumping shot from the blue line from sophomore defender Ali Peper found the bottom corner of the net with 10:10 to play in the second. The Crimson was dominant for much of the remainder of the game, pulling ahead in shots on goal before pulling ahead on the scoreboard on two goals from freshman forward Becca Gilmore.
Gilmore stole the show for Harvard, combining with sophomore forward Kat Hughes on her first, and following up on a longshot from Peper to give the Crimson the 4-3 advantage with 12:23 to play in the game. These were goal number eleven and twelve on the season for the ECAC Rookie of the Week, who leads the team in points (30) as well as assists (18), and is averaging more than a point per game this season for the Crimson. Hughes also picked up her share of accolades this week, as she was named the NCAA First Star of the Week as well as ECAC player of the week.
Neither side was able to convert on the man advantage on the night, with both teams going 0-3 on power plays. The Huskies did grab a shorthanded goal, however, finding the net in a four on five situation in the second period when Tori Sullivan broke through the the Crimson’s defense to score on a counter attack.
Freshman goalie Becky Dutton seemed to gain confidence as the night went on, struggling to cover the puck early, but finishing the game convincingly with 20 saves. The most important of these came with just over a minute to play, when she came up big for the Crimson, saving a shot and then the ensuing rebound when Northeastern broke away on a two versus two, preserving Harvard’s lead and ensuring the victory.
“I think it’s something that we can use as a confidence booster,” Dutton said. “We had a bit of a tough stretch there, but now we’re on a three game winning streak. It’s only three games, but it’s definitely a really good start, and it gives us confidence going into this weekend.”
Losing would have obviously been disappointing for the Crimson, as in any game, but the fact that Harvard has finished fourth in the Beanpot just three times in the tournament’s forty-year history would have made it even tougher to swallow.
The Crimson has won the tournament, which pits the team against Boston’s historical hockey powerhouses, Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern, fourteen times in the forty it has been played. This makes Harvard the tournament’s second most successful team ever, only behind its opponents from last night, Northeastern, which has racked up sixteen titles since the tournament’s inception.
Boston College has taken home the trophy eight times, with its first title coming in 2006. Boston University has only won the coveted title once, way back in 1981. There is one champion who is not one of the four classic Beanpot teams: Brown. In 1993, Brown University, stepping in for Boston University, beat Northeastern 3-0 to take home its first and only beanpot title in its lone appearance.
“The Beanpot is a great opportunity because it allows us to play for a championship before playoffs,” junior defenseman Bradley Fusco said. “It’s special for me especially because I grew up going to the Beanpot with my dad since right after I was born, so it means a lot to me and it’s something that I look forward to every year, especially because it was a dream of mine when I was younger to play in one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball is back in the driver’s seat heading into the second half of the Ivy League season.
Coming off a weekend sweep against Princeton and Penn, the Crimson (12-11, 7-1 Ivy League) currently shares the top spot in the Ancient Eight with the previously undefeated Quakers. Harvard’s two weekend opponents, Yale and Brown, sit tied in third with .500 conference records. Despite the Crimson’s sizable cushion from the Bulldogs (11-13, 4-4) and Bears (11-10, 4-4) in the current standings, Harvard was considerably challenged by both teams in their prior matchups this season, sneaking by with single-digit wins.
The game order is also flipped compared to the last weekend series, with Brown the earlier opponent. Having a much-anticipated, nationally televised Yale game the night after, Friday night’s matchup against a young Bears team may be even more dangerous as a textbook trap game.
“Brown’s our next opponent so that’s what we’ll be looking to first,” sophomore forward Chris Lewis said. “Yale is a very difficult, great team as well, but we take our games once at a time, so when we get to Yale we’ll prepare for that as well, accordingly.”
Last weekend, the Crimson faced a unique scheduling anomaly with the Saturday Penn game tipping off at 4 p.m. instead of the usual 7 p.m. start time. The schedule is no less peculiar this time around, as Harvard will participate in a rare late-night affair against Yale at 9:30 p.m. Saturday night. This sacrifice in normality was likely made to accommodate ESPNU, which will be featuring No. 7 Texas Tech at Baylor during primetime hours followed by Harvard-Yale.
For Amaker, this two-plus hour shift back will not affect the team’s regular routine, but some slight modifications will be made to keep the players energized prior to tip-off.
“Normally we don’t have our shoot-around on the second day,” Amaker said. “We feel it is at least better to get them up and doing something during the day so they are not feeling like they are just lounging and laying around all day and being sluggish. We are tinkering with our schedule to see if it can work better for a later tip-off time.”
Before welcoming Yale, the Crimson will need to first contain a upstart Brown program. A significant reason why coach Mike Martin’s Bears have stayed in contention for the top four is their knack for holding onto late-game victories. Last weekend, a 23-point performance from freshman standout guard Desmond Cambridge and double-digit numbers from four other Bears helped the team close out an overtime win against Columbia.
Despite injuring his ankle late in that contest, Cambridge—who leads the Ivies in conference scoring with 21.6 points per game—stated that his ankle issue was non-serious. The freshman guard’s athleticism, which he showcased against the Lions with a fastbreak 360 dunk, bounds to pose defensive challenges for the Harvard backcourt.
“For me, I think it’s taking it one step at a time with him, switching on ball screens or any action away from the ball,” sophomore forward Justin Bassey said. “A lot of times he’ll catch, wait, you’ll put your hand down, and then he’ll shoot. Or understanding that he’s a righty, he wants to go to the right. It’s more of a team effort now that we’re switching.”
In the Jan. 27 contest against Brown, the Crimson took advantage of a turnover-prone Bears team, racking up nine steals and forcing 14 giveaways. This type of aggressiveness earned Harvard 18 points off turnovers, but also contributed to several easy alley-oops and opportunities at the rim as Brown put up 77 game points, the most the Crimson has allowed this season in its 12 wins.
In particular, junior guard Obi Okolie and freshman forward Tamenang Choh will need to be contained as athletic rim finishers.
“They are a dangerous team...very athletic,” Amaker said. “Sometimes going for steals you can gamble or over commit and open the floor up for them. That’s not the team that you want to do that against. Even if we don’t have as many steals, that doesn’t mean we aren’t playing really good defense.”
While the Bears’ attacking abilities will be a point of emphasis for Amaker, the following night’s contest against the Bulldogs will be focused on limiting Yale coach James Jones’ pass-heavy offense.
The Bulldogs lead in Ivy League in total season assists and recently combined for 48 dishes in their weekend sweep of Columbia and Cornell. In comparison, Harvard tallied just 23 total assists in its past two games. This type of ball movement has been critical for a Yale team that has largely struggled in shooting the deep ball and maintaining consistent production from its scorers.
Dead last in conference three-point shooting at .317, the Bulldogs have relied on offensive spurts from players like sophomore guard Miye Oni, who combined for 36 points last weekend after a shooting slump the previous two weeks. Junior guard Trey Phills also had an impressive showing against Columbia, tallying 14 points off six-of-eight shooting.
With Lewis coming off a career-high 25 points against Penn, the Yale frontcourt will need to improve its interior defense compared to its last outing against the Crimson. In the Jan. 26 loss to Harvard, Lewis went 7-for-11 from the field and added four offensive rebounds for a total of 16 points. Freshman forward Paul Atkinson will again likely assume defensive responsibilities on the main focal point for the Crimson offense.
“I thought Chris did a great job of using his body and his angles in the post,” said Amaker about Lewis’ performance against the Quakers. “We did a terrific job in terms of our perimeter guys looking for him and making the right pass. So we are hopeful we can continue to do that not just against Penn but get the ball inside to him and play through him.”
Another important unknown about the weekend is the potential return of Yale senior guard Makai Mason, who had been sidelined with a broken foot for the entire season. Reportedly day-to-day and practicing with the team, Mason will give the Bulldogs a dangerous new weapon if he is able to suit up. However, Amaker emphasized his gameplan will remain the same regardless if Mason makes his season debut.
“I anticipate they will still play the same way,” Amaker said. “They will still use the same types of actions, plays, and philosophies that they have had without him all this season. He is a terrific player, as we know.”
On Harvard’s side, sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken’s status is still unknown. Amaker stated that Aiken was able to practice on Monday, but that he could not go “full throttle.” With sophomore Christian Juzang playing essentially all 40 minutes at the point guard position in his absence, Amaker has clearly centered his trust on Aiken’s former backup.
One interesting note: the Crimson’s 7-1 Ivy record is a repeat start to the 2014-2015 season and the four prior seasons. In those five years, Harvard reached the NCAA Tournament four times.

The clock struck midnight on February 14th, and the V-Day bomb detonated, leaving behind a pink and red cloud of desperation, horniness, and self-loathing. (Actually, that last one lingers in Harvard Square's air all the time.)
With Valentine’s Day comes a whole lot of feelings you’re normally immune to. But it’s been cold for a while, and you can’t help thinking that cuddling with another human in a twin bed might not be so bad. That person who is ‘eh’ all other times of the year? Suddenly their eyes sparkle when they smile. It hits you: You have a Crush.
In case you’re feeling ballsy or just extra needy this Valentine’s Day, we have put together some great ways to ask your crush out. You’re welcome.
Propose. Immediately.
Don’t let The One get away because you were afraid to move too quickly. You’ve gotta lock ‘em down, and quick, before Brad the Ec concentrator gets his fancy job at Goldman Sachs while you’re still “searching for your passion" (aka not financially desirable).
Here’s how you do it: go to CVS. Purchase a Ring Pop. Find your crush in the dhall. Approach them, make them stand in the aisle. Kneel and present them with the Ring Pop while professing your undying love. If they ask you what your name is, that’s a good sign. They obviously know who you are, they're just so lovestruck that they came down with minor amnesia.
A Flash Mob
Gather your closest friends/anyone who thinks they can dance. Find your crush, and approach them blasting FM$ by the New Boyz. In true middle school dance fashion, impress them with how well you can jerk.
Play hard to get
Whenever your crush enters the room, flee quickly and conspicuously. If they try to talk to you, look right through them, or immediately strike up a conversation with someone else. If no one else is around, strike up a conversation with yourself.
Email
Send them a formal email, and be sure to sign off with something elegant, like “Kind regards” or “Peace out girl scout.” Bonus points if you attach your resume.
Send them a LinkedIn request
Your crush won’t be able to interpret this move as anything other than intellectual flirtation.
Do it à la final club
Punch your crush figuratively or literally. Slide a letter with a wax seal under their door. Or just punch them in the face. We all need a release sometimes, especially after thinking too long about single-gender organizations unrecognized by Harvard.
Or you could, I don’t know, just tell them? We hope you successfully shoot your shot and have a Happy Valentine’s Day!

Critics are saying "SO F*CKING CUTE," that watching is "the most productive" thing they've done all day, and that it's a frontrunner for Best Motion Picture at the upcoming Oscars. Flyby presents: "Do Harvard students have love lives?"
