After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a few weeks, the class of 2020 will be entering Harvard, walking through the gates to the greenery and humid air of the almost-autumn. They’ll learn to code, to write, to create more freely and express thoughts more effectively. They’ll snap pictures of red brick buildings or river sunsets or squirrels. They’ll kiss people from cities they’d never heard of; they’ll discuss ideas they’d never dreamed of.
But all the freshmen, some sooner than others, will stop taking pictures of the squirrels. You can live in the most beautiful place on earth, and awe will give way to mundanity 99 percent of the time. You can be surrounded by books and laboratories and observatories, and yet always keep your eyes on your feet. You can live within blocks—within meters—of a profound diversity of ideas, and spend all your time feeling superior to those with whom you don’t agree, seeing humans as faceless parts of easy-to-despise blocs. We complain about the out-of-touchness of the elderly, or the obnoxiousness of children; the laziness of the 47 percent, or the depravity of the 1 percent.
And this—all these reasons—is why we profoundly need wonder: why we ache for it even when we don’t know what we ache for, why we pen columns of mangled eloquence and scrambled ideas. Thinking on wonder, in fact, should make us think of our faults, our elitism and dehumanization, our mistreatment of others, because it brings the platitude “we’re all human” to glorious 3-dimensional motion, because everyone, no matter where they’re from or how intelligent they are or what disagreeable views they hold, felt awe when they first saw the sea. When we wonder, we might have the innocence and joy of a child, but we can also imagine how it might be to have the wisdom of age. Wonder—and the beauty and community which bring it about—might not be what Harvard students want, but it is what we need.
It doesn’t matter if you’re young, old, rich, poor—wonder, like love and death, is one of the great equalizers. Wonder transcends place, along with nearly every other category (inherent or constructed) that tears at our humanity. After a near-missed car accident in a concrete wasteland, strangers feel the wonder of being alive. Wonder is something the newborn child feels as she looks at a blanket for the first time, what the middle-aged person feels as she paints the sunset. Wonder is when you walk into a church in Germany or a mosque in Casablanca or the secular cathedral of Sanders Theatre. People are not the same. Religions are not the same. But we all can—or have—experienced wonder. And we all can—or have—failed to put a finger on what it is. And that’s okay: Can we fully explain anything we consider integral to the human condition?
So how to do that? Like many important things, wonder can’t be forced, but we can make ourselves more open to it, starting with our studies. The possibility of wonder is obvious in disciplines like Physics and English, but also in learning new languages, in piecing together arguments, even in struggling over an Ec10 pset in Lamont with friends and classmates.
Wonder does not have to be divorced from politics or economics or real-world issues; it can and should influence how we think about things from Final Clubs to food ethics to mental health. The world is too terrible for any one thing to remain unconnected from the heaviness of life. But let there be a healthy wall of separation, lest the reasons for living become conflated with the means of production, lest we forget why you work for greater income equality, or education for girls, or to make the world better in any way.
While people often suggest physically getting out of the campus bubble as a stimulus for wonder and cure for Harvard-itis (and I wholeheartedly agree), this can be difficult because of time, money, or anxieties. We live in an incredible place, and there’s so much to do without leaving the gates. Read for fun. Photograph squirrels. Take “useless classes” unrelated to your major (now you can do this for credit)! Become more involved in your faith or service or dorm community, and do that well, do it until the mundane becomes lovely from shared humanity.
Bask in the sunset of the Radcliffe Quad and relax. Stop thinking about politics for a moment, or ten, and start thinking about how your concentration relates to why life matters. Talk about that which makes you happy to be alive, and talk and listen with the sorts of people you haven’t thought to talk to. Because when we wonder at the universe, we are forced not only to see how small we are, but also how large—how our tiny selves can hold so much.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is gearing up for the National Labor Relations Board to announce a ruling that could require the University and other private colleges to recognize graduate student unions.
Two pending cases before the NLRB—a government organization that creates labor legislation and rules on labor disputes—could result in a decision to classify graduate students at private universities as employees. Currently, though organizers of Harvard’s student unionization movement have gathered support from a majority of graduate students employed by the University—meaning they have the numbers to call a union election— Harvard is not legally obligated to recognize a graduate student union.
Per organization policy, the NLRB does not comment on when it will release a decision, according to press secretary Jessica Kahanek. But one board member’s term ends in late August, and past members have said it is common practice to release decisions before a member leaves.
Union organizers at Harvard have said they expect the NLRB to support graduate student collective bargaining.
In late May, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and other state politicians called on Harvard to voluntarily recognize a graduate student union in a letter to University President Drew G. Faust—who last year voiced her opposition to unionization efforts.
“While we understand that Harvard may prefer to await a decision from the NLRB that would force the university to permit students to organize, we urge Harvard to offer this consideration to its teaching and research assistants now, as Harvard is clearly entitled to do,” read the letter signed by Warren, a former Law School professor, Massachusetts Senator Edward J. Markey, U.S. Representative Katherine Clark, and U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano.
In late July, University Provost Alan M. Garber and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng, who oppose unionization, published a letter and frequently asked questions online addressed directly to graduate students. Garber and Meng wrote that their goal is to “ensure, should an election be conducted, that you have the facts you need to make an informed decision.”
"Students have reached out to GSAS looking for more information about the unionization effort, and we worked this summer to develop a series of questions and answers that could aid their fact finding,” GSAS dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise wrote in an email.
The letter includes a link to a list of frequently asked questions about unionization, such as queries regarding paying dues and voting against unionization if a student already signed an authorization card.
Harvard’s list resembles a similar FAQ site published by the University of Chicago, which Aloise wrote “was useful in developing Harvard’s content.” According to Aloise, both the letter and FAQs were posted online by the Provost’s Office because students across Harvard’s graduate schools could be part of a collective bargaining unit.
Members of the union movement, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the letter and FAQs.
Other universities have also taken action ahead of the NLRB decision. In May, for example, Cornell reached an agreement with organizers outlining a path forward if the NLRB requires private universities to allow for collective bargaining; Harvard has not done so. While Cornell did not agree to voluntarily recognize the union, officials established channels for administrators to communicate with students about unionization, and guidelines for a union election in the event that the NLRB decides graduate students are employees under the law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Farmland investor Colin Butterfield will serve as the next head of natural resources for Harvard Management Company, adding a new face to an executive roster thrown into flux after CEO Stephen Blyth’s resignation earlier this summer.
Previously the CEO of Brazilian farmland investment firm Radar S.A., Butterfield will join Harvard’s investment arm—which directs the University’s $37.6 billion endowment—this fall, the University announced Thursday. He will fill the position one year after Alvaro Aguirre-Simunovic’s resignation in October 2015.
While Satu Parikh, then-head of commodities, was initially tapped to lead the portfolio in the interim, he left shortly after Blyth selected him. René  J. Canezin, HMC’s head of public markets, assumed the position instead.
Natural resources, including timber holdings in Brazil, constituted 9 percent of Harvard’s endowment—which is the largest endowment of any institution in higher education—in fiscal year 2015. In FY 2015, the University returned just 3.5 percent on its natural resources portfolio, a figure then-CEO Stephen Blyth called “subdued” in his letter to investors.
These holdings—which range from timber to vineyards—can be, at times, controversial: critics have argued that the University’s use of some land holdings has damaged local ecologies.
Harvard’s overall endowment performance has lagged behind that of many of its peer institutions in the last few years, prompting University President Drew G. Faust to say last fall she was concerned about returns on the endowment.
Butterfield will join an HMC in the midst of transition. Earlier this summer, Blyth, its CEO, resigned after just two years at the helm, leaving the firm in search of its fourth top executive in a decade—a pattern of turnover that some experts warn could further complicate efforts to improve HMC’s performance.
Long a leading performer among large higher education investors, HMC suffered a crippling blow when the housing market crashed and the University’s endowment took a 27.3 percent hit in FY 2009. During his tenure, Blyth launched a series of new programs to try to match peer performance; still, the endowment returned a relatively lackluster 5.8 percent in FY 2015.
Complications within Harvard’s investment arm also arrive as the University seeks to raise billions of dollars as part of its historic capital campaign, which surpassed its $6.5 billion goal earlier this year. Donations to the University are often invested as part of the endowment, funding initiatives ranging from financial aid to scientific research at Harvard.
