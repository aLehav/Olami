After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rumors that Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser was under investigation for scientific misconduct surfaced as early as a year before Hauser took leave from the University, a former collaborator said.
Following news of the investigation first reported by the Boston Globe on Tuesday, scientists have called on Harvard for more information about the probe’s findings.
But the University has kept mum in face of public calls for transparency, and Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has declined to comment on Hauser’s case, stating that “reviews of faculty conduct are considered confidential.”
Hauser is taking a year-long leave of absence after University officials found evidence of scientific misconduct in his laboratory. He recently retracted an article published in 2002 in the journal Cognition that suggested tamarin monkeys learned rules as human infants did after investigators concluded his findings were not supported by the data.
The University’s policy for responding to allegations of misconduct in research lists “the need to protect the rights of the person or persons alleged to have engaged in misconduct” as a consideration in its handling of the case.
The policy also stresses the importance of “protecting the reputations of individuals … to the extent that such protections are appropriate and consistent with other ethical and legal obligations of the Faculty and the University.”
Neal did not respond to a request to clarify the University’s policies Friday night.
But as the University continues to keep the investigation’s findings confidential, academics have begun to question whether Harvard should be withholding information about the nature of the scientific misconduct.
“It’s just kind of terrible for the confidence that the public has in the scientific community,” said a former collaborator who requested anonymity due to the nature of the investigation. “It degrades the credibility of everybody to some extent.”
Per federal requirements, Harvard will report its findings of scientific misconduct to federal agencies that funded the research for a second review, Neal said in an e-mailed statement Thursday. The federal agencies will make its conclusions publicly available upon finding evidence of scientific misconduct, Neal said.
Hauser’s undergraduate research assistants and colleagues have remained tight-lipped about the investigation, expressing loyalty to the scientist who has been a mentor to many.
Of the seven undergraduates  previously listed on Hauser’s website before the information was deleted, three declined to comment, and the rest did not respond to interview requests. Only six of Hauser’s 20 collaborators listed on the site responded to interview requests, and all but one declined.
“Marc is a beloved scientist, teacher, and colleague,” Hauser’s friend and colleague, psychology professor Steven A. Pinker wrote in an e-mail Thursday. Pinker has not collaborated with Hauser on any published studies.  “He is widely admired not just for his astonishing breadth and creativity in devising ways to investigate deep problems with elegant experiments, but for his warmth, humor, and lack of pretension.”
Hauser did not respond to an interview request, but Pinker said his colleague will continue to head his lab next year while on leave.
Pinker added Hauser will spend next year working on his upcoming book,“Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lightweight crew capped off its international tour last Sunday by winning its second race of a two-week trip to China.
The Crimson finished 10.6 seconds ahead of Yale to win in its final competition and take home first place at the International Famous Universities Regatta. Held at the Sichuan Provincial National Team Training Center, Harvard’s eight beat out Yale, Oxford, and Cambridge with a time of 5:57.6.
Harvard won its first competition of the tour on Aug. 1, besting Yale by 16.2 seconds along the Shunyi Olympic Basin, the same course used during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Oxford and Cambridge battled for third in both competitions, with Oxford taking third in the first race and Cambridge taking third in the second race.
The Crimson, coached by Linda Muri, sent nine rowers and one coxswain abroad. The team was comprised mostly of current rowers, although the group was also joined by graduates Dexter Louie ’10 and Martin Eiermann ’10—last season’s captain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s swimming and diving assistant coach Marlene Pineda passed away Monday due to injuries she sustained in a biking accident in Brighton, Mass. Pineda, 24, was reportedly not wearing a helmet when she was struck by a car on Commonwealth Avenue on Monday afternoon.
Pineda, who recently moved to Brighton, was set to serve as an assistant coach for the Crimson this upcoming season after she was hired by women’s swimming and diving head coach Stephanie Morawski. Pineda, a 2008 graduate of Smith College, came to Harvard after a two-year stint as the assistant at her alma mater.
“Marly was a remarkable woman,” Morawski said, according to gocrimson.com. “I hired her not only because I saw her potential as a coach, but, more importantly, because of her integrity and character.  Marly truly cared about others and had a way of bringing out the best in those around her.  Her death is a tragedy, and she will be remembered always as an extraordinary coach, teammate and friend."
While an undergraduate at Smtih, Pineda was a member of the swimming and diving team, earning a spot on the NEWMAC all-conference team as a senior. She made the transition to coaching after graduation, helping Smith finish with an 8-6 dual meet record over the past two seasons.
But Pineda was ready to make the jump to coaching at the Division I level and was preparing to work with the Crimson this fall.
A memorial service took place today at Harvard’s Blodgett Pool.

Taking the T can be such a pain. Sometimes it crashes when the driver texts his girlfriend or you have to deal with creeps who grope your friends. Fear no more. The Cambridge City Council has agreed to look into a compensating solution that will slide those pains away—literally.
Last week, the Council passed a resolution to investigate "the possibility of installing a long flat tube slide (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4o0ZVeixYU) at a Cambridge MBTA station to add a bit of personality to a subway stop." That's right, no more dealing with the exasperating stairs or the quarrelsome elevator on your way down to the platform. It might not quite be a Slip-n-Slide, but we’ll go ahead and call it a Swipe-n-Slide instead.
The idea came to Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis from a constituent who saw a Volkswagen advertisement and proposed the idea to her.
“[Davis] thought it would be different…a fun thing to do,” said Penny C. Peters, aide to Vice Mayor Davis.
Peters said that actually figuring out if the idea is feasible and then implementing it is up to the city administration. A representative in the City Manager’s Office told us that they’ve forwarded the idea on the MBTA.
Both Davis and the MBTA could not be reached for comment.
