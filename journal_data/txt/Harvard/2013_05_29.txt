After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, May 20, a devastating mile-wide tornado hit the town of Moore, Oklahoma. The storm leveled the community, killing 24, causing as much as $2 billion in damage, and leaving many to wonder why this town had almost no means to protect itself. Many in the news media have suggested that this tornado was more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, making it impossible to prepare for. Others have noted that the clay ground of the western plains makes it prohibitively expensive to build underground safety shelters. Some journalists have even suggested that a culture of local temerity is responsible. But clearly, a larger problem exists with our country’s natural disaster preparation system.
In Moore, a number of life-saving measures, including safety rooms which cost around $2,500 per household, were shamefully scarce. It is a fact that those who cannot afford private means of protection are left to deal with the consequences of these events on their own. Rather than a laudable product of American individualism, this is a form of structural violence.
Last week’s tragedy is the latest example of a disturbing trend in which the private sector, and indeed private citizens, are left responsible for shoring up homes, schools, and businesses in the areas of the country hardest hit by natural disasters. When individuals and communities lack the means to do this, they go unprepared. While popular stereotype suggests that this phenomenon is exclusive to the storms of tornado-alley, history indicates that this has been the case for hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires nationwide.
Indeed, a March 2009 report by the Institute for Business and Home Safety indicates that the destruction from U.S. natural disasters is disproportionately borne by lower-income communities. It concludes that vulnerable populations, particularly the poor, elderly, and disabled, are “more likely to die, suffer injuries, and have proportionately higher material losses” in natural disasters. The report cites issues with building readiness as the leading cause of this discrepancy, writing that low-income Americans, “often live in the most vulnerable housing and lack the resources to undertake recommended loss-reduction.” Despite these findings, the federal government has taken little proactive action to bolster storm readiness among lower-income Americans.
This failing demonstrates a pattern of structural violence against those Americans who cannot afford necessary disaster protection, and people are left tragically unassisted by public trustees of their safety. The concept of structural violence, as put forth by University Professor Paul Farmer, is useful here as it applies to a culture of American natural disaster preparation embedded in prevalent “social structures, normalized by stable institutions and regular experience.” Although violence typically evokes immediate physical harm, here it expresses the “avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs” that prevents communities from reaching their full potential. The impact of structural violence becomes evident when we recognize that, year after year, certain towns in America are razed to the ground because they lack the means to prepare for natural disasters.
This does not implicate a single villain, but rather indicates that our whole social structure further disadvantages low-income communities through systemic forces when natural disasters strike. We need to be cognizant of this structural violence and take shared responsibility for whatever the next disasters may be. This means making our building codes tougher and retrofitting our older buildings to meet these new codes. It also means public assistance for those communities and individuals who lack the private resources to protect themselves. Compared with the devastation we have seen in disadvantaged communities across America, the cost of public investment in more equitable disaster preparation seems very low.
Nearly eight years ago, Americans watched in horror as one of our largest cities was drowned by Hurricane Katrina, a storm whose path was inevitable but whose destruction was not. Our leaders pledged that we would never again allow ourselves to be so blindsided by Mother Nature, and that our most disadvantaged communities would be protected from the natural disasters to come. The tragedy in Moore last week was hardly the first test of our post-Katrina resolve, nor was it even the first in the last month. But it has demonstrated that preemptive protection from disasters like these, especially for our most vulnerable citizens, must once again become a national priority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot of things happened this year that I wish had never happened. I wish administrators had consulted students and faculty before deciding to move the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston. I wish Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds had never ordered a second round of email searches and given false statements to the press. I wish the outside world had heard more about Harvard’s innovation and research than they did about cheating scandals and broken trust. Above all, I wish that the students in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” had not cheated on their exam one year ago.
From beginning to end, the Gov 1310 scandal was mismanaged. One year ago, no one would have thought that much of this year would be spent cleaning up the cheating mess. When the cheating was announced in late August, no one would have thought that we would be talking about secret email searches and administrative intrigue in the Spring. In the Fall, students had little confidence in the Dean of the College, if only because they did not really know who she was. Who would have thought then that the Dean of the College would circumvent the rules of the faculty, order secret email searches, and then come down with an incredible case of amnesia when news broke of an initial round of searches? Who would have thought it was possible for the Dean to order a kind of search that is conducted only “very, very rarely” in connection with the largest cheating scandal in living memory and then give a statement saying that the additional searches never occurred? However pure her intentions were, her judgment was inexcusably faulty. Students have lost what confidence they had in Dean Hammonds, and the trust they had in the college administration is severely damaged. Fortunately, her departure is forthcoming.
And yet, despite all of those challenges, there is no place I would rather be than Cambridge, and there is no school I would rather go to than Harvard. Harvard’s failings have been embarrassingly public this year, so public that our successes have not received the attention they deserve. This page spends a great deal of time criticizing—as it should—but it is important to acknowledge what Harvard did well. And there is so, so much that was done very, very well.
Housing renewal, for instance, is an easy thing to get wrong, but Harvard seems to be on the right track. It would have been easier—and cheaper—to treat swing housing like an afterthought and throw displaced students in random open spaces across Cambridge. Instead, the University is trying mightily to keep students in a central location, close together, and connected to the House community. There are some complaints about the floor plans for the new building, but the truth is that no one will really be able to form a complete opinion until students start living in the renovated spaces. Then, hopefully, the University will take their concerns into consideration. That is the point of a “test project,” after all.
Harvard was also at its best in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Our community came together in exactly the way it should. There was an atmosphere of mutual support and a sense that even a terrorist bombing and the largest manhunt in Massachusetts’s history could not dampen Harvard’s spirit.
Meanwhile, the research and teaching that is at the core of our mission has continued even as federal budget sequestration has threatened our funding. Just in the past year, Harvard has built “the smallest robotic insect capable of flight” that might one day be used for any of a number of purposes. At the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, researchers say that the discovery of a specific hormone may help to develop treatments for diabetes. The University-wide push towards entrepreneurship has continued with the second annual President’s Challenge and more programming at the i-lab. To help Harvard meet future challenges in research and teaching, fundraising for a new capital campaign is underway.
So, yes, Harvard has had a difficult year. Yes, we have problems that remain unresolved. But we should not get carried away in criticism. Every once in a while, step back and ask, “Is there any other place you would rather be going to college?” As long as the answer is, “No,” then there is cause for optimism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an ideal world, money would never be an issue. Important things like buying a house or receiving an education would be attainable to all. Unfortunately, our world is not ideal, and money is always an issue. Most people in the United States our age are focused on a major monetary hurdle: paying for a college education. Luckily for us, Harvard boasts one of the country’s best financial aid programs. Students are encouraged not to worry about affording their four years of college as Harvard strives to meet the financial needs of its students. According to the Harvard website, about 60 percent of Harvard college students receive financial aid from Harvard. That is a truly laudable state of affairs. Not every school has Harvard’s resources though; as a result, student debt in our nation has reached an all-time high, and something needs to be done.
Student loan debt in the United States today is greater than $1 trillion. This mammoth debt that is shouldered by the future of our country has a significant effect on our economy, both in the present and for the future. It is preventing graduates from spending money and investing as they struggle to pay off their debt.  We, as a country, need to do something to ameliorate this situation. Currently, the three major types of federal loans that students can take out are subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 percent interest, unsubsidized Stafford loans at 6.8 percent, and PLUS loans at 7.9 percent. The interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans are set to double on July 1 unless new legislation is passed.
A few possible solutions have been proposed, including Representative John P. Kline’s plan to create a more permanent solution by tying student loan interest rates to the 10-year Treasury Note and Senator and former Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s bill which would lower the interest rates to match those that banks pay. Kline’s plan would help prevent the doubling of interest rates on July 1, but would otherwise change every year and may rise to up to 8.5 percent. This would not help solve our existent problem.
Now let’s consider Warren’s bill. It is being promoted with a lot of brouhaha as Warren is getting students and supporters excited by bringing the “bad guys,” big banks, into the picture. According to her campaign, current interest rates on federal loans to banks are 0.75 percent, and Warren wants that to be the rate for student loans as well. The idea sounds fantastic and, if we ignore all the side effects, it would definitely do a lot to help bring down student debt and encourage the youth of our nation to get an education. If the solution were that simple, our country would not be burdened by so much student debt in the first place. Unfortunately, it is not that simple, and we cannot ignore the side effects. Matching student loan interest rates to match those of banks would cost our already broke government billions of dollars.
To help prevent the hit that our government deficit would be dealt, a compromise needs to be made. We can still lower student loan interest rates to match the rates that banks get; however, we would need to raise the interest rates that banks get from the federal government. By raising the rates on the incredibly large amounts that banks borrow, the difference lost by cutting student interest rates could be decreased. Also, student rates would not be lowered all the way to 0.75 percent, so not as much revenue would be lost by the government through subsidized loans.
Yes, banks borrow from the government in emergency situations and raising their interest rates may not just hurt the banks but the rest of the country as well if they consequently increase their retail and commercial lending rates. The issue of student debt is important and affecting our entire nation, and it is important for everyone to work together for a solution. Banks should be able to take a little increase in their rate because it will help them in the long run. If student have less debt to pay off, they will be more willing and more able to take out loans from banks for life necessities like houses and cars.
The entire country and its economy are hurt from the current situation with our student debt. Harvard students are not directly affected by it right now as we are safely protected by Harvard’s generous endowment in the comfort of our dorm rooms. However, we are all going out into the real world and will all be affected by this debt. It is important for Harvard students to be aware and for our nation to take action. Something drastic needs to happen if we want to change the course of our future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How do you follow up the largest donation in Harvard University history? You donate the record amount a second time. At least, that is the approach of Hansjörg Wyss, the Swiss billionaire who received his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1965. This month, he followed up a $125 million contribution to the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering with a second $125 million gift for the Institute. The eponymous donor chose a worthy source. His new, generous influx has the potential to elevate an already formidable array of cutting-edge technologies and research.
Harvard’s Wyss Institute, founded in 2003 in partnership with other Boston-area schools, hospitals, and research institutions, operates on the basic assumption that millennia of evolution have produced powerful biological solutions. Per its mission statement, the Institute’s research “aims to discover the engineering principles that Nature uses to build living things, and harnesses these insights.” A quick survey of the work already in process hints at the value of Wyss’ latest donation. A large portion carries a medical bent, from engineering superior insoles for the elderly to clot-busting nanotherapeutics. The work extends beyond the pure medical field, too. In an example once reserved for science fiction, the Wyss Institute has even constructed insectile robots, with a bevy of possible applications from automated pollination to survivor-finding in crises.
A particularly heartening and illustrative case is the development of synthetic human organs for use in drug testing, including a lung-device capable of breathing and of fighting bacteria. On the one hand, these have the potential to deliver faster, cheaper, and more accurate results. But they also alleviate the need to use animals as test subjects, a need we have lamented—and one which has resulted in particularly tragic outcomes for Harvard Medical School’s Primate Research Center. Innovation of this sort refuses to endorse a dichotomy between efficacy and ethics. That calls for a doubling of both effort and capital. Mr. Wyss is helping to supply the latter; the onus is on Harvard as a research institution to apply the former.
Wyss Institute researcher Kevin K. Parker made an important point when he told The Crimson last summer that “Harvard is in a good position to compete and dominate in this field.” He explained, “A lot of [other researchers] are using similar techniques to ours, which indicates Harvard is kind of the path-setter in this area.” Harvard should continue leveraging its competitive advantage in bold, creative areas like the Wyss Institute’s. Harvard serves as a vital conduit between research funding—public or private—and the solutions to make our world better.
Today, of course, in an epoch of cinctured budgets and federal sequesters, private munificence has a heightened value for universities. But the basic act of donation is no panacea. Cotton Mather, Class of 1678, commented centuries ago on the conundrum of unhelpful giving: “Instead of exhorting you to augment your charity, I will rather utter an exhortation … that you may not abuse your charity by misapplying it.” Hansjörg Wyss did augment his charity. But he did not misapply it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director of the new Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Kris Rondeau was attending a rally for Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis’s presidential campaign in a packed Sanders Theater when she received the good news.
A staff member carried the urgent message to Rondeau: The University’s efforts to block the creation of the union had been overturned by a regional judge. HUCTW was now official.
Rondeau whispered the news to an aide, who then passed along a note to the speaker on the stage: renowned civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. The reverend stopped mid-sentence.
“A ray of hope in Cambridge!” he declared, looking out over the hundreds of screaming people sitting in the rows in front of him.
“We won again,” Rondeau said to the audience. “Their unmistakable goal was to beat the union, and they just failed. Now, finally, I hope they can recognize reality.”
Rondeau’s announcement that day was the culmination of a 17-year movement that had begun with a small group of female organizers at Harvard’s Longwood campus and gradually won the support of the majority of Harvard’s approximately 4000 staff employees.
“When we won, no one was more surprised than we were,” Rondeau said. “It was kind of an impossible task, and I don’t think anybody really thought it could be done.”
Since the very beginning, union organizers had sought to further their cause with a good-natured and community-oriented manner.
“We had this feeling that...maybe a group with a lot of modern ideas about human relations and community building could do the union thing in a partially new way,” said Bill Jaeger, an organizer at the time and the union’s current director.
Despite the novel organizing strategies that union leaders attempted, they still came up against a fierce anti-union campaign led by a University committed to preventing organized labor. While early pushback by Harvard officials threatened the drive to organize, union leaders successfully built up a broad base of support—one that ultimately brought administrators to the bargaining table.
PRO-UNION, NOT ANTI-HARVARD
When Rondeau and several former Harvard staff members formed the independent HUCTW in August of 1985, they faced a singular challenge.
By renouncing any affiliation with the United Auto Workers, or any other nationwide organization, the new union was on its own. HUCTW had to rely completely on Harvard staff and its own sources of funding to sustain the movement.
“Everything had to be made up as we went along, so that was extremely challenging,” Rondeau said. “There was no blueprint for how to do something like this, and we just had to figure it out kind of by putting one foot in front of the other, and that was hugely exciting.”
Forming an official union required that HUCTW organizers gain a majority of the staff ’s support in an election held through the National Labor Relations Board. As a result, one of the first tasks that Rondeau and other union leaders faced was winning their colleagues’ support.
According to Marie Manna, a former employee at the School of Public Health, the majority of the organizing in advance of the votes involved one-on-one conversations with employees.
During lunch hours, Manna and other staff members went out in teams of two, meeting as many people as possible to discuss why they felt representation was so important.
One challenge that the organizers encountered was that most workers were satisfied with Harvard as an employer and did not understand how someone could elect to join a union but still be satisfied with one’s job.
“[It] was hard for people to reconcile that,” Manna said.
To make the new union’s intentions clear, Congressman Barney E. Frank ’61-’62, who came out in support of HUCTW in March of 1988, created a slogan encapsulating these feelings.
“It’s not anti-Harvard to be pro-union,” the motto read.
“[The campaign] was, ‘Let’s go out and talk to people and hear about what their lives have been like and their work experience, and try to help them to understand why there’s a lot of people who want a union,’” Manna said.
SINGING, NOT STRIKING
The idea that HUCTW’s focus was not on particular grievances, but instead on the broader principle of representation, made the union appealing for Jaeger, who was working at the time as a staff assistant in what is now known as the Davis Center for European Studies.
“There wasn’t anything angry about it,” Jaeger said. “Nobody was shouting, nobody was whining.”
Instead, union organizers took to singing to further their cause within the Harvard community. Staff members formed an a capella group called the Pipettes that sang light-hearted jingles to communicate the workers’ message.
“There was a lot of excitement in our organizing drive about the idea that maybe we could build a determined and powerful organization that could make progress in relentlessly peaceful and community-oriented kind of ways,” Jaeger said.
Part of this effort to engage the community included getting students involved in the push to unionize.
Damon A. Silvers ’86, an undergraduate during the beginning of the movement, went on to work in the union’s office after graduation. According to Silvers, there were several hundred students who were actively involved in supporting the workers, many of whom were recent college graduates themselves.
“There was a lot of kind of natural vicinity between the students and the workers in the technical unit,” Silvers said.
THE ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN
Despite the union’s non-confrontational approach, organizers still met significant opposition from Harvard, which had already managed to dodge unionization efforts twice in the past decade.
In addition, organizers often struggled to convince their own colleagues that having a union to represent them and negotiate on their behalf was in their best interest.
“It’s hard to get people to vote yes, because what they’re voting for is to change the way things are,” Rondeau said.
A group of workers in the Medical Area campus had tried in 1977 and in 1981 to elect a union but failed to gain a majority of employee votes on both occasions.
This time around, individuals working to establish the union expected to face not just a reluctant work force, but also significant opposition from the University.
“People had told me...that Harvard had fought pretty hard against the union, and so we tried to prepare people,” said Manna. While former University President Derek C. Bok acknowledged the right of Harvard’s employees to unionize, he made it clear that the University would oppose any such push.
As union activity picked up in the beginning of 1987—when HUCTW gained national backing from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees—Harvard resorted to a number of anti-union strategies commonly used by employers. “To some extent, Harvard’s campaign was a textbook anti-union campaign,” Jaeger said.
In January of 1988, University administrators distributed union briefing books to supervisors—informational packets which contained lists of legal anti-union statements and highlighted positive aspects of employee contracts at Harvard. And that March, administrators began holding informational meetings for staffers to lay out the University’s anti-union stance.
A NARROW VICTORY
The push to unionize came to a head on May 17, 1988, when HUCTW was put to a vote by all of Harvard’s support staff. Volunteers and organizers sat anxiously in Sanders Theatre for four hours, waiting for the final tally.
Although the union was elected that day by a narrow margin, its battles were far from over. One of its first challenges was confronting a University that still refused to recognize its existence.
“We probably would have been interested in starting some conversations with the people we were going to be negotiating with in the future, but there was no platform for that,” Jaeger said. “The beginnings of the building of a relationship didn’t happen for some months after the election.”
In the months following the vote, Harvard appealed to the NLRB to have the election overturned on the grounds that HUCTW coerced its workers into voting for unionization.
But that fall, Harvard’s appeal was overturned and the University declined to take the case to federal court. That same day, hundreds of Harvard staff and union supporters poured in to Sanders Theater to hear Rondeau and Jackson deliver the triumphant news.
“I think there was a turning point in late 1988...when Derek Bok and [chief University negotiator John T. Dunlop] decided together on behalf of the University to stop fighting and trying to undo the election result,” Jaeger said.
As the University finally came to terms with the reality of HUCTW’s existence, Jaeger said that by the time the first round of negotiations came around, representatives from the union and from management had established a healthy rapport.
“A lot of the best ideas and most important things that we do together still came out of that first negotiation,” said Jaeger. “We went from complete estrangement to a really good energetic, productive, negotiating process in the matter of just a few months.”

For drinkers on campus, the times seemed grim.
“Suddenly the future looked all too dry to our freshman friend. No more beers he could call his own,” warned a 1987 Crimson article poking fun at a new University policy requiring printed birth dates on student ID cards.
Additional barriers to alcohol possession included the banning of kegs in freshman dorms in the spring of 1988 and the closing of several Harvard Square bars the year before.
The new College policies, according to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, were the result of a University effort to better enforce Massachusetts laws on campus.
“Harvard needed to do more to ascertain who could drink,” said Dingman, Senior Tutor in Leverett House at the time.
But these changes did not necessarily affect the campus drinking culture. Many students on campus when these policies were enacted do not even recall the new restrictions at all, and the Class of 1988 still managed to quench their thirst.
“It was easy to get fake IDs, and people who wanted to drink could do so,” said Shari Rudavsky ’88.
Even the closing of local bars like the Piccadilly Filly, a student hangout in the basement of 119 Mt. Auburn St., and Jack’s, a small venue near Central Square known for its live music, seemed not to matter.
“Well, the Hong Kong was still open,” Rudavsky said, laughing.
Students who wanted to look for a social scene off-campus could still eschew formally organized College events and dorm parties in favor of final clubs and other schools, according to John E. Brzezenski ’91.
On campus as well, social life seemed to carry on as usual.
“I don’t remember any change in the upper class Houses,” said Evan J. Mandery ’89, then chairman of the Undergraduate Council. And even the ban on kegs in freshman dorms did not inhibit a “fairly active social life in the Yard,” according to Brzezenski, who remembers going to many parties in freshman housing. “Nothing suggested that there was a real crackdown on alcohol.”
Dingman, too, said that he believes that alcohol policies were not as strictly enforced on campus as they are today.
“Some [students] complained that the school was forcing some of the entertainment out of their Houses,” said Dingman. “But I didn’t see that.”
While the undergraduate drinking culture did not change, many aspects of student life within the Houses did not involve alcohol.
Former Adams House Master Robert J. Kiely, for instance, said that drinking was only one part of Adams House life. He cited theater, music, and political expression as other activities that encouraged community interaction in a social setting.
“The Explosives B Café and Molotov Café served nothing stronger than espresso, but students gathered in these places every night to hear one another’s poetry or listen to Seamus Heaney, Adrienne Kennedy, or Jamaica Kincaid, all of whom lived at Adams,” wrote Kiely in an email. “Of course, not every student took advantage of this, but many did.”
Though he wasn’t aware of any large-scale changes to the Harvard social scene, Mark A. Hanzel ’88 does recall one particular instance of students bending these stricter rules.
According to Hanzel, the band room in the basement of the old Freshman Union dispensed Duke beer for 25 cents a can, and in 1985, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III told the band that the beer had to go.
“When we returned to the band room, one of our officers opened the machine and told us to help ourselves to as many cans of Duke beer as we could carry,” Hanzel wrote in an email. “I was a practicing Mormon, but I couldn’t resist free stuff. I carried three or four cans back to Lowell House and gave them to my roommate, who observed that Duke wasn’t any worse than Budweiser.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 29, 2013, at 5:01 p.m.
“There’s a Harvard man on the wrong side of every question,” runs the famous quotation by former University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877.
In the fall of 1987, Dean of the Kennedy School Graham T. Allison ’62 found himself on the wrong side of a scandal resulting in increased oversight of fundraising in Harvard’s schools.
Earlier in the year, the Kennedy School of Government had announced its intention to implement a number of public service initiatives, including a loan forgiveness program for its students, 15 to 20 of whom were eligible. At the time, however, the Kennedy School had not secured any funding to support it.
That November, after The Harvard Crimson reported that Allison had solicited a $500,000 donation for this purpose in exchange for offering the donors official positions within the University, the resulting media frenzy attracted harsh criticism that some Kennedy School affiliates thought was unfair.
But even as the fundraising scandal fades into the past, important questions about the ethics of fundraising within Harvard still linger.
THE COUPLE FROM TEXAS
Harvard Divinity School graduate Charles C. Dickinson III and Joanne W. Eaton Dickinson, Texas natives, were described in Kennedy School memos as a “curious and restless couple.”
They had held positions at schools nearby and abroad; Charles Dickinson had served as a curatorial associate of manuscript collections at the Andover-Harvard Theological Library and was a lecturer of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in 1987, where he enjoyed full access to the school’s library facilities. The couple, however, was better known for their inheritance of a family oil business and their many donations to educational institutions.
According to Bailey F. Mason ’51, who was an administrator in the Dean’s office at the Kennedy School at the time of the scandal, the Dickinsons were “generous donors” who had asked a lawyer to draft an official agreement ensuring that after a first-time dona- tion to the Kennedy School, they would hold access to further research facilities. The Dickinsons hoped to gain access to Widener Library—a right not unlike the privilege Dickinson already held at the Medical School—in addition to membership in the Faculty Club, Mason said.
At the time, only two types of identification cards allowed access to Widener Library: those for students, and those for professors and University officials. The documents noted that the Dickinsons would be issued University official cards to this end.
In early November of 1987, the memo outlining this exchange was leaked to The Crimson, thrusting the Kennedy School into the national spotlight.
A STORY THAT WASN’T
Soon after the original agreement papers were finalized in the Dean’s office, The Crimson published a story alleging that Allison intended to “bestow University Officer status on an oil-rich Texas couple in return for a $500,000 gift,” in the words of a Crimson editorial written soon after the scandal broke.
Before the University had the chance to respond to the allegations, several news sources picked up The Crimson’s story, echoing sentiments that Allison’s actions were improper. “The Kennedy School’s explosive growth has entailed some insensitivity to ethical constraints,” read a New York Times article. A Boston Globe editorial was even more severe: “The gang running Harvard would put a pack of Chicago aldermen to shame. When it comes to extortion, these people are definitely major leaguers,” it contended.
The harsh coverage of the incident surprised many within the school, who did not see the exchange as a basis for such extreme conclusions. Mason said he thought that the initial Crimson coverage had blown the agreement out of proportion.
“There was no research, no confirmation, nothing,” Mason said. “It was bad journalism, plain and simple."
Richard E. Cavanagh, Executive Dean of the Kennedy School at the time, remembered many feeling the same way as Mason. "People thought that it was unfair for the story to be spun in this way. It took on a life of its own," he said.
Those who saw the Kennedy School as having been unfairly maligned remembered the original exchange itself as seemingly innocuous. “It had much more to do with making it possible for someone to access Widener Library, not issuing University positions,” said emeritus professor Marvin Kalb.
But as the story gained steam outside of the University, the faculty of the Kennedy School became increasingly defensive.
DAMAGE CONTROL
Despire their disagreement with the scandal's coverage, those within the Kennedy School felt the pressure exerted by the media scrutiny. "My mom asked why I would work at a place like that," Cavanagh remembered.
University leaders came under fire for the alleged misconduct, prompting Allison and University President Derek C. Bok to issue statements condemning the exchange.
In his only public statement, Allison did not defend the validity of his method of soliciting donations. "It is clear that the handling of this case does not meet my own standards or the standards of the University," Allison said at the time.
Bok took this line of reasoning one step further in his speech. "The issue is clear cut," he said. "No one should receive such a position at this University by virtue of a donation to Harvard, but only because of superior qualifications to perform the responsibilities of the post."
Bok also announced that the University would launch a full-scale review of its schools' fundraising practices and stated that the investigation into the Kennedy School deal would continue.
But some Kennedy School employees felt that these statements only reaffirmed the mistaken perspective that had cast the encounter in a negative light.
“Bok had to take the high road, saying that the University never gave donors privileges,” Mason said. “That wasn’t true at all, but then again, Allison didn’t do anything wrong.”
THE FUNDRAISING GAME
After an extensive investigation of University policy regarding large gifts, the Kennedy School adminis-tration created the Gifts Proposal Advisory Committee, which oversees the process by which restricted financial gifts are received and approved. Today, GPAC assesses these proposals from legal and ethical frameworks, while the school’s Faculty Committee on Projects and Proposals reviews proposals from an academic lens.
Though the scandal surrounding the story quickly died away after the initial media explosion, those under its shadow continue to debate practical and ethical concerns over the place of fundraising on campus.
Some Kennedy School affiliates said that while the means by which the University acquires donations are not always ideal, they are still necessary. “When you try to get money to help a very important part of the University, you negotiate—you’re involved in the exchange of ideas,” Kalb said.
“That’s what people don’t understand. Fundraising is an important part of all institutes of higher learning, state or private,” Kalb added. “There’s always a give and take—that’s the nature of the beast.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 3, 2013, at 7:59 a.m.
“It will be a cold day in Bangladesh before [the opening of the clubs to women] happens voluntarily,” Delphic Club member Michael A. Zubrensky ’88 told The Crimson in an article from February 1988.
Zubrensky was responding to the public debate started by Lisa J. Bucher ’88, then Lisa J. Schkolnick, who was determined to challenge the status quo. Citing Chapter 272, Section 98 of Massachusetts General Law, which describes discrimination by sex as a punishable offense, Bucher had filed a complaint to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination the previous December against the Fly Club. In Bucher’s perspective, the male-only admission policies of the final clubs at Harvard College were in direct violation of this code.
Bucher’s complaint sparked the creation of Stop Withholding Access Today, a student group that included members of the campus magazine Perspective and aimed to end male-only admission practices at the final clubs. “SWAT the Fly,” read the headline of one of Bucher’s articles describing her case.
The controversial lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful; MCAD determined that the Fly Club was a private organization and therefore not under the body’s jurisdiction. The case, however, brought issues of gender discrimination and other social issues on Harvard’s campus to the forefront of conversation and reflected a growing frustration with a social scene that revolved around practices of exclusion.
LADIES NEED NOT APPLY
For Bucher and others on campus, Harvard’s final clubs represented centers of discrimination on campus, even as they had formally severed their ties with the University in 1984.
Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz advised Bucher in filing her case, hoping that it would bring subtle sexism on campus to the surface. “Harvard has had a very nix policy towards discrimination against women,” Dershowitz said. “I think there was passive and subtle discrimination against women in many areas in 1988.”
Dershowitz remembered that Harvard clubs had remained discriminatory toward women many years after women were admitted to the University and as the number of women faculty had grown.
“Harvard University did not play a noble role,” Dershowitz said. “It somewhat encouraged the anti-woman policy. It remained an old boys’ club for many years after it admitted women.”
Many female students felt that final clubs were still integral centers of student social life on campus.
Despite their many objections to these club policies, students said that without a female counterpart of final clubs, women were forced to turn to a social scene dominated by men.
“If you were a woman at Harvard, you had very little opportunity for a social life that didn’t involve somehow pandering to the boys in your class,” said Deborah Copaken Kogan ’88.
“Everyone knows that the social life at Harvard is lame,” Bucher said. “We just knew that having these clubs that were important to campus life discriminating against women had to be changed.”
Among the alleged discriminatory practices women remembered was being led into the clubs through side doors—only male members were allowed to enter through main entrances.
Bucher also cited final clubs’ library resources and professional networking events as opportunities not granted to female students.
Some male final club members, however, did not believe that these privileges constituted discrimination.
“I don’t recall any kind of gender discrimination at all in a college context,” said Peter Y. Lee ’88.
A member of the Delphic club, he noted the number of exclusive female and male social organizations, like fraternities and sororities, at other university campuses.
BEYOND POLICY
Frustration toward final clubs, however, was not restricted to the policy of women’s admission—some students at the time also felt that the clubs contributed to campus elitism.
“I got to college and I hadn’t even heard of ‘prep school,’” Kogan said. “I didn’t know that there was a class system in my country at all.” Kogan said that the social environment at Harvard, particularly that found in the social clubs, quickly brought this class system to light. “We understood that the men that were in the final clubs were of a different class, or aspired to a certain class, or [were] born into a certain class,” Kogan said.
The issue of final clubs reinforcing a classist struc-ture, Kogan said, was not addressed by Bucher’s complaint. Kogan cited the approximately 10 percent of Harvard’s male population that was granted admission to the clubs as a significant barrier to male entry as well.
“While I believe what [Bucher] did was very important and a very positive first step,” Kogan said, “what the case wasn’t addressing was the institutional classism—it was addressing sexism.”
Bucher herself held concerns that extended beyond those her official complaint directly cited. “[Final clubs] seemed to be a locus on campus for sexual violence,” she said, recalling a close call she had during a final club party she attended, during which she had almost become a victim. “There were all these stories that were circulating...about women being vulnerable at these places.”
Bucher hoped that her lawsuit, if realized, could somehow shift this dynamic.
PERSISTING PROBLEMS
Even today, final clubs are not co-educational, and Harvard students continue to debate their exclusivity. “It’s just amazing to me that 25 years, later Harvard still has the same problem,” Bucher said. “It’s so sad for me to know that nothing, where it should have been, changed.”
While final clubs were the primary spaces in which Bucher and other female students say they felt discrimination toward women on campus at the time, Dershowitz noted that he saw other instances of sexism at Harvard from behind the scenes as a professor.
“I think there were many professors who did not think women were academic equals,” he said.
Today, Dershowitz said, in the final clubs and beyond, things are still not perfect.
“I think there’s a residual feeling [of sexism] among people that still exists,” he said. “Harvard’s record has been improving, but in 1988, it was a B minus with grade inflation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Johnathan O. Williams ’88 was studying late at night in Currier House when four white students catapulting oranges from a neighboring breezeway shattered the plate glass window next to him. Not long after, Williams received a mysterious phone call.
“Negro hit squad strikes again,” the stranger said.
The incident, which occurred in January of 1987, seized the attention of the student body and brought racial attitudes to the forefront of campus discussions. That fall, Jack C. Patterson ’88—the student who made the racially charged call—was forced to withdraw from the College for a year.
Although the Administrative Board ruled that the breaking of the window was a separate incident and not racially motivated, the four students found responsible were also asked to withdraw from the College for a year.
But the disciplinary sanctions failed to resolve simmering racial tensions both on Harvard’s campus and in the city of Cambridge. Although incidents of overt racism among the student body were rare, white students and students of color at the College still sometimes felt uncomfortable in each other’s presence, and complaints of racism in the city of Cambridge were frequent.
In addition, although cultural organizations gave undergraduates a forum to raise concerns about racial attitudes on campus, students at the time said that a perceived racial divide among the student body made open discussion of such issues difficult.
RACISM ON CAMPUS
In the fall of their sophomore year, Kenneth W. Johnson ’87 and two other members of his rooming group moved into their new upperclassmen dorm, a Leverett House suite they shared with two white students.
By the end of the semester, their rooming situation had fallen apart. One white roommate had moved out. The other went to their housing administrator, now Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and told him that he felt threatened by the black students in his room. Dingman moved the three black roommates to a room next to the dining hall.
Although he was unsure whether his roommate’s dorm reassignment request was racially motivated, Johnson said that there was a tendency among students to self-segregate.
“Did I have someone openly calling me ‘nigger’? No,” said Johnson, a former president of the Black Students Association. “Were there people who were uncomfortable in my presence? Yes.” Johnson acknowledged that he also felt uncomfortable sometimes in the presence of white students.
“There was almost a natural segregation that happened,” said Brenda J. Walker ’88.
“Certain finals clubs would not have students of color ever,” Walker added. “We all accepted it as what it was...there were certainly groups of people who were just not going to be social with people of color.”
According to Walker, students of color found themselves the victims of racial bias both outside the classroom and within it. Walker recalls that one professor asserted in his class that African-Americans were genetically inferior to Caucasians.
Walker said that many black students effectively cut off their ties to Harvard after graduation in response to the racial bias they experienced as undergraduates. “There were people...bothered a great deal, to the point where they have no alumni affiliation at all,” Walker said. “They didn’t want anything to do with the University after they left.”
BEYOND THE YARD
In April of 1988, the Cambridge Human Rights Commission planned a special public hearing to address racism in the city of Cambridge and to provide and publicize resources for victims. The hearing was in response to multiple complaints of minorities being taken advantage of by landlords, or stopped on the street and asked for identification by the Cambridge Police Department.
For students of color at Harvard, who walked the city’s streets and frequented its restaurants, this type of discrimination was nothing new.
“At that time, you know, you would have trouble getting a cab,” said David G. Latimore ‘88, a former director of Harvard’s Afro-American Cultural Center, which was slowly disbanded as the BSA assumed its duties. “Comments were made, racial epithets hurled.”
Walker recalled an incident in which she and a group of black friends were made to wait to enter a restaurant in Cambridge, even as waiters seated numerous groups white patrons who walked in after Walker. She and her friends decided to leave the restaurant.
Johnson remembered another time when he and his roommate, Darryl A. Parson ’87, were walking back to Leverett from a friend’s room in the Harvard-Radcliffe Quadrangle late one evening. The pair noticed that a police car was following them for no apparent reason.
Though they attempted to ignore it at first, Johnson and his roommate decided to run when they reached the end of their street.
“We heard the screeching of tires,” Johnson said, and shortly after the two entered their dorm, the two policemen knocked on their door.
“Why’d you run?” they were asked, to which Johnson responded, “Why’d you follow us?”
“You looked suspicious,” the policemen answered.
GROWING CONVERSATIONS
Amid this tension, Harvard was stepping up its efforts to recruit minority students in its incoming classes. In 1983, Harvard admitted a record number of black students for the Class of 1987. The following year, 6.3 percent of incoming freshmen were black.
“We were probably the second wave of having significant numbers of black students on campus,” Parson said.
And as Harvard’s student body grew increasingly diverse, dialogue on the subject of racial attitudes was becoming more commonplace.
“It was a time where there were lots of conversations centered around race,” Latimore said. “It was an environment particularly in the African-American community where you had a number of vocal, vibrant students that were undeterred.”
However, students admit that they struggled to engage in discussions across the racial divide, and that conversations that did take place tended to occur in segregated student organizations or among groups of friends.
“When it came to race, it was much more difficult to have those vigorous conversations where we were truly seeking to understand others,” Johnson said.
But despite experiencing racial tensions on campus, upon looking back, many members of the African-American community at Harvard said that they enjoyed their undergraduate years and made the best of the opportunity they had.
“The foolishness is out there. And I’m going to not embrace the foolishness,” Johnson said. “I’m going to take advantage of the opportunities that are here.”
Finally, students who graduated in 1988 said that they see Harvard as much more diverse and more open to conversation now than it ever was before. Over 45 percent of the incoming Class of 2017 were minorities.
“What I can say from what I’ve been able to see from afar is that the Harvard community seems to have continued its efforts to be more representative of the world, in terms of incorporation of people of color,” said Latimore.
“I certainly see what seems to be progress.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1986, as the Cold War neared its end, Harvard featured a Soviet prison camp of its own.
The Conservative club had built a gulag camp in the Yard that remained standing throughout the academic year, protesting human rights abuses in the U.S.S.R., recalled Charlene H. Li ’88.
According to Li, who likened the protests to those of the recent Occupy movement, students adhered to a schedule to ensure that the encampment was constantly occupied so that University officials would not tear it down.
Harvard’s lone gulag marked a tangible link between Harvard students and the Cold War, the decades-long standoff that separated the United States and its NATO allies from the Soviet Union and its satellite nations in Eastern and Central Europe. This connection was otherwise often lost on students focused on daily campus life.
“People were preoccupied with more mundane things, like ‘How am I going to do on my Ec10 exam?’ and ‘Who am I going to meet on Friday night?’” said Scott W. Horsley ’88. “It was probably the same thing in Moscow or East Berlin.”
Nevertheless, the tense political atmosphere of the epoch permeated campus, making its influence felt in numerous aspects of University life.
As an academic institution, Harvard played an important role in fostering cross-cultural awareness and dialogue between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
A SPACE FOR DISSIDENCE
The University was home to a number of émigré professors, who had fled the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe for a place to voice their opinions openly.
One of these was social sciences professor Liah Greenfeld, who had fled the U.S.S.R. with her family when she was 17. For intellectuals like herself, “the [Soviet] lack of freedom was unbearable,” she said.
These professors often published perspectives critical of the Soviet Union, as they “had strong commitments to individual rights and liberties and strong indictment of the totalitarian or Soviet system of government,” said Frank E. Sysyn, who taught Soviet and East European studies on campus between 1976 and 1988.
Featuring voices like Greenfeld’s, the many research contributions to Russian and European Slavic studies that Harvard’s Russian Research Center and Ukrainian Institute facilitated were not always appreciated on both ends of the spectrum.
“The soviet Union did not like the attention [Harvard] paid to dissidence within the Soviet Union, to the striving of European peoples to autonomy, and to various Eastern European cultures,” Sysyn said.
As a result, he said, many Harvard students researching Soviet countries were frequently denied access to important works.
Sysyn said he thought that this censorship made work in this area more attractive to students, who were already interested in studying the Soviet system.
STUDYING THE SOVIETS
To meet student interests, Harvard had created a regional studies program focusing on the Soviet Union during the Second World War.
The two-year masters program offered courses that aimed to provide students with a background in the history, cultures, languages, and politics of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe.
Courses offered under the program included “The Soviet Political System” and Sysyn’s “The Other Europe: A Cultural History Of Eastern Europe.”
Lubomyr Hajda, who became the program’s academic coordinator in 1978, recalled a growing applicant pool that reached between 75 to 100 interested students in certain years.
Students showed marked enthusiasm toward the Solidarity movement in Poland, Czech writers who spoke of autonomy and dissidence, and emigration rights of Jewish Soviet citizens, Sysyn said.
According to Sysyn, funds from Washington supported the study of critical languages, namely Russian and Eastern European tongues, after the U.S.S.R’s development of the atomic bomb and deployment of Sputnik shocked the United States.
Meanwhile, nationalist groups hoping to preserve their cultures funded the study of European countries that had been swallowed by the Soviet Union.
THE LIMITS OF EXCHANGE
in addition to new paths of study on campus, Harvard worked to offer opportunities abroad. In 1988, the Harvard Center For International Affairs’ Student Council organized a Harvard-Soviet student exchange.
The trip allowed 12 undergraduates, one graduate delegate, and one professor to travel to Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, and Prague.
In conferences at Kiev State University, U.S. and Soviet students discussed concepts such as nationality and the American Dream.
A group of 12 soviet students also visited Harvard the following fall.
At the time, however, Harvard affiliates benefiting from the direct exchange with the U.S.S.R. still questioned the impact of these programs.
Anna V. E. Forrester ’88, one of the students in the group, recalled being skeptical of the effects of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s recent perestroika and glasnost policies promoting openness, transparency, and democracy.
“i didn’t know if what i was getting from the Russian students was genuine in terms of their ideas and what they had to say,” Forrester said. “People were inculcated with party ideas for so long—I couldn’t tell if they were just sprouting the new party line.”
Greenfeld echoed similar sentiments about a conference in London in 1987, during which she had met Moscow intellectuals.
When she asked the Soviet group if they were rejoicing over newfound freedom brought about by perestroika, she said, one member of the group became angry.
“Freedom! You talk about freedom!” she yelled. “There is no sausage in Moscow! And you talk about freedom?”
Soon after the Class of 1988 stepped off campus, the remaining structural tensions burdening the relationship between the two countries would shift.
CHANGES ABROAD AND ON CAMPUS
One year after her graduation and far from the gulag camp in Harvard Yard, Li found her- self in Amsterdam on November 9, 1989, the pivotal date that saw the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. Two days later, Li took a train to visit the site of the wall firsthand and found her worldview altered.
“It completely changed everything i had ever studied—my whole world,” she said. Li had written her senior thesis on U.S. foreign policy toward declining dictators; now, these dictators were losing power. “The view of the political world that we grew up with and went to college with very quickly changed,” Li said.
Although students such as Horsley noticed “a certain amount of elation watching crowds on top of Berlin wall," the fall of the Soviet Union brought with it other instabilities.
But the end of the Cold War might have marked the beginning of a new mindset on campus—one of optimism for a different future, something Li felt when she returned to Harvard Business School three years later.
“There was a new sense of hope for peace,” she recalled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time a Harvard man and a Yale man faced off in a presidential election, the year was 1912, and neither candidate won.
That November, Princeton graduate Woodrow Wilson edged out Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Class of 1888, and William H. Taft of Yale to clinch the presidential title.
Seventy-six years later, as the nation prepared to head to the polls again to choose a leader for the next four years, another Harvard-Yale contest was brewing—this time, between Harvard Law School graduate Michael S. Dukakis and Yale graduate George H. W. Bush.
But for Dukakis, a former Kennedy School professor and Governor of Massachusetts at the time, the school rivalry was a non-issue in the race.
“The Harvard-Yale rivalry really kind of meant nothing to me,” Dukakis said in an interview with The Crimson.
And although students at Harvard also failed to see the race as an Ivy League rivalry, the subject of Dukakis’s educational background made headlines across the nation.
The Harvard-bashing started soon after then-Vice President Bush safely secured the Republican presidential primaries. At the Texas Republican Convention in early June, Bush accused the Massachusetts democrat of being soft on foreign policy, claiming that his opponent’s views, “born in Harvard Yard’s boutique, would cut the muscle of our defense.”
“Out of that Yard comes a specific Massachusetts liberalism,” Bush told reporters the next day, calling Harvard “a philosophical cult” that encouraged extreme left-wing thinking among its students.
The Dukakis campaign dismissed these comments at the time, a decision that he stands by to this day. “Look, I was a public school kid, went on to Swarthmore, and then eventually to Harvard Law School... the guy never stepped foot in a public school,” Dukakis said.
“I thought it was silly, I thought it was ridiculous, and I didn’t think the public was interested and I think I was correct in all of those assumptions.”
Dukakis explained that by the time he entered the Law School, he already had a “pretty well-developed political philosophy,” and that his time as a student at Harvard did not significantly affect his political views.
“It’s not the Law School that transformed my views in any way,” Dukakis said, adding that the most important thing he learned was to never hesitate in challenging conventional wisdom.
Even if Dukakis’s time at Harvard did not influence his views, Dukakis did benefit from the wide access to University faculty that came with his Harvard pedigree.
HKS professors such as Joseph S. Nye, Jr. and Graham T. Allison ’62 joined the Dukakis campaign as advisors while then-HLS professors Christopher F. Edley, Jr. and Susan R. Estrich served as the issues coordinator and the campaign manager, respectively.
“I certainly made use of every person at the school who was interested, and a lot of them were involved,” Dukakis said.
Alice Wolf, who served on the Cambridge City Council at the time, explained that there was overwhelming support for Dukakis in Harvard and the surrounding Cambridge area.
When Dukakis ran for Massachusetts governor in 1982, Wolf said that the city of Cambridge gave Dukakis one of the largest margins of victory in the state.
“He was a very popular figure in Cambridge in the ’80s,” Wolf said.
As a result, when Bush ultimately trumped Dukakis in the general election in November, the results were disappointing for many members of the Cambridge community, 80 percent of whom voted for the Massachusetts governor and anticipated his presidency.
Glenn S. Koocher ’71, who was the warden of the precinct that Harvard was located in, distinctly remembers making a having breakfast at the Kennedy School the day after the election to get a sense of the sentiment after Dukakis’s defeat.
“So many people at the Kennedy School had been so obnoxious about talking about what was going to happen once ‘Michael’ was elected president,” Koocher said. “There was a lot of excitement at the Kennedy School because they all assumed they’d just pack up and move to Washington.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
J. Kent Smith ’88 still remembers the fear and tension he and his friends felt when stock markets around the world plummeted on October 19, 1987, a day also known as “Black Monday.”
Smith and his friends were huddled silently around a transistor radio in Dunster House, listening to news that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recorded its largest single-day percentage loss.
“It was the first time this had happened in modern history,” Smith said. The last time the Dow had posted a record single-day loss was in 1929, and the crash had plunged the nation into the Great Depression.
But the Black Monday crash dwarfed the 12 percent drop of 1929, with a 22.61 percent decline in prices.
As policymakers and economists around the world sought to find explanations for the crisis, Smith and other students at Harvard watched nervously from the sidelines.
For juniors and seniors considering a career in finance, October’s crash was particularly alarming, as students prepared to enter the job market in the midst of unprecedented market turmoil.
CRASH LANDING
“It was definitely a big-impact day,” said Smith, now an executive director at UBS Investment Bank.
“Nobody knew quite what to make of it and how it could have happened.”
Most analysts today agree that the rise of computerized trading techniques led to the sudden collapse in stock prices.
With new strategies such as portfolio insurance and program trading, much of the buying and selling of securities on Wall Street was conducted by automated programs.
“In retrospect, we have a pretty good idea of why it happened,” said Smith.
But Smith also noted how unexpected market behavior can quickly lead to disaster, even when investors are equipped with the best predictors and financial models.
“When you have a systemic shock to the system, which is what we had in 1987 and again [in] the housing market crash, the rest of the markets don’t behave rationally,” Smith said. “The size of the shocks are sufficiently large to ripple across the entire economy.”
Smith remembers that even on Harvard’s campus, the effects of the crisis felt very real.
“I was sitting with a friend who is and was quite wealthy, and I was imagining the impact on him as we were listening to all this happen,” Smith said.
AN UNCLEAR FUTURE
The uncertainty immediately after the financial downturn led some students to reconsider their post-graduate plans.
According to a Crimson article in December of that year, many students interested in investment banking were considering a shift to the fields of consulting and commercial banking.
The article reported that investment banking information sessions that fall were sparsely populated, while those for consulting and commercial banking were packed with interested undergraduates.
However, some former students believe that the crisis had a greater impact on those who had already graduated, compared to those who were still in college.
“I had heard it might potentially hurt my friends who had graduated and were in training classes,” said Robert O. L. Lynn ’88, a consultant at Morgan Stanley.
And although students interested in the financial services industry may have been rattled by news of the crisis shortly after it happened, Lynn said that the recruitment process—which occurred later in the year—was not significantly affected by that fall’s stock market crash.
“By the time interviewing season rolled around... [the investment banks] went back to business as usual,” Lynn said. The trouble in the markets did not ultimately stop students in Class of 1988 from seeking employment from the same prestigious firms that garner much attention on campus today, according to Smith. “The hottest tickets on campus were to get Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,” he said.
Smith said that despite the severity of the 1987 crash, the long-term economic impact was limited. In fact, graduates today may actually face a more difficult job market than the one in 1988, he added.
“I see much more impact today than in the crash of 1987.
“[Black Monday was] exciting, but we recovered quickly,” Smith said. “[Now, we are in] year eight of what is a very long down cycle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Ilene Seidman saw a photo in the newspaper of the 2004 Democratic National Convention’s keynote speaker and his wife, she was shocked.
Upon seeing the picture, Seidman called a friend and asked, “Isn’t that Michelle Robinson?”
Though Seidman had known both then-Senator Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson during their respective years at Harvard Law School, she did not know the two had married because their years at Harvard never overlapped. Michelle graduated in 1988, only a few months before Barack entered as a first-year.
Before future President Barack Obama dominated classroom conversation, Michelle Obama impressed faculty and mentors with her quiet yet intelligent demeanor and concern for others.
These attributes, cemented during her time at the Law School, have translated into a successful career in the office of the First Lady.
QUIET, SELF-CONTAINED
Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. first encountered Michelle as a student in his special course called “Saturday School.” The course was intended to teach first-generation lawyers the tricks of the trade, including study skills and tactics for speaking up in class.
Ogletree remembered Obama not as a domineering student, but one who constructively contributed to class discussion.
“She was someone who thought a lot about what was being said and had a lot to offer to others who had the same sense that it’s better to be docile and reflective than to be outspoken and wrong,” Ogletree said.
Law School professor David B. Wilkins ’77 taught Obama in one of his first classes of students in a course about legal ethics.
Wilkins said that the topics of the course fascinated Obama, who was “very focused around the responsibility of lawyers to make the world a better place.”
Obama, who was concerned with making Harvard itself more equitable, entered a Law School racked by ideological differences, divided into progressive and conservative camps. A major source of controversy emerged over the appointment of minority and female faculty.
During Obama’s third year, the Black Law Students Association, of which she was a member, staged a sit-in in the office of James Vorenberg ’48, then-Dean of the Law School, to address their concerns about the hiring of minority faculty.
Ogletree said that while Obama was very supportive of these efforts, her focus was primarily concentrated on helping those less fortunate than herself.
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
Obama’s professors said they were struck not only by her academic abilities, but also by her awareness of her responsibility as a lawyer to give back to society.
“I just was very impressed with her ability to not simply understand the theory and the broader nuances of being a Harvard law student, but also very interested in the practice of lawyers and representing poor clients,” Ogletree said.
This moral compass led Obama to pursue what would become her most formative activity in Law School—working at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, where students in their second and third years provided free legal service to poor clients on a variety of civil matters, including government benefits and public housing.
Obama’s mentors described her remarkable ability not only to aptly represent clients in court, but also to connect with them on a human level.
“She was just phenomenal in terms of being able to make sure that the judges would not only respond to her eloquence and very powerful oratory and intellectual rigor on behalf of her clients, but also to see that they’re clients and this is a single woman trying to get into public housing, this is someone who’s been a victim of abuse, who hasn’t had the opportunity to raise her children properly,” Ogletree said.
Seidman, the attorney who supervised Obama’s work at the Legal Aid Bureau, said that she believed Obama’s concern for others came from her gratefulness for her parents.
“She was somebody who didn’t take any of her advantages for granted, which one cannot always necessarily say about people who have the opportunity to go to Harvard Law School,” Seidman said.
DIFFERENT AND EXACTLY THE SAME
Obama’s teachers and mentors agreed that her devotion and concern for the good of others has been brought out in her work as the First Lady.
When asked what Obama was like as a law student, Seidman responded, “Well, she was really different and exactly the same.”
Whereas Obama’s time at Harvard increased her confidence, her mores have remained constant to this day.
“She was a poor law student, so she didn’t have the beautiful wardrobe she has now, but fundamentally I think that the core values that she represents now are exactly the same core values that she presented as a law student,” Seidman said.
Ogletree said he sees this same concern for others, which Obama displayed during Law School as well as in her various campaigns as First Lady, including assisting veterans and their families and improving health and nutrition in the U.S.
“I think there are a lot of people who are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Class of 1988 and see Michelle Obama as one of those people who received everything Harvard had to offer and has given back even more in kind with her public service,” Ogletree said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Soledad M. O’Brien ’88-’00 was lobbying for the vote of Cabot House sophomore Charles “Bradley” Raymond ’89, she did not know that she was speaking to her future husband.
O’Brien, a Cabot House resident herself, was campaigning room-to-room in preparation for that year’s House Committee elections.
Neither Raymond nor any of his roommates ended up voting, but Raymond was struck by how personable “Soly” was.
O’Brien’s winning personality helped her clinch the HoCo seat, where she would organize House events and Housing Day festivities.
But after college, O’Brien would emerge from her role as a behind-the-scenes organizer to become one of America’s most recognizable broadcast journalists.
Perhaps most famous as the former co-anchor of the CNN show “American Morning,” O’Brien has earned accolades for her coverage of Hurricane Katrina and her critical portrayal of race relations in the “Black in America” and “Latino in America” documentary series.
Friends and family say that O’Brien’s success in the media industry can be attributed to her upbringing in a first-generation immigrant family and to her exposure to a diverse array of opportunities in college.
A FIRST-GENERATION UPBRINGING
When O’Brien left her suburban Long Island home and entered Harvard as a freshman in the fall of 1984, she was following in the footsteps of her older siblings Maria O. Hylton ’82, Anthony N. O’Brien ’84, and Estela V. Ogiste ’85, all of whom graduated from the College before her.
Despite its numerous Harvard connections, O’Brien said she considers her family to be just like everyone else’s.
“When I think of a Harvard family, I think of a family who made enough money to build a library after them. We’re not that family,” said O’Brien.
“My parents were regular, middle-class folks who really valued education and encouraged their children to do well in school.”
O’Brien’s father, a mechanical engineering professor of Irish descent, and her mother, an Afro-Cuban French and English teacher, faced challenges as an interracial couple in the late 1950s.
According to Kim Bondy, O’Brien’s longtime executive producer and god-mother to O’Brien’s four children, O’Brien’s work ethic is a direct result of her upbringing.
“She’s a child of immigrants. Her parents are both super accomplished and smart people who have a very immigrant thought pattern about putting your head down and doing the hard work,” Bondy said.
According to Bondy, O’Brien’s parents also fostered her sense that many great stories were still untold.
“Soledad witnessed a lot of human tragedy over her career, from the tsunami to Haiti and Katrina,” Bondy said. “She over the years connected that to some of her early learning she got from her parents and from her mother, and her instincts are right to pick up on those kinds of stories.”
WHO SHE WAS
When she got to Harvard, O’Brien quickly immersed herself in college life.
“I loved being in a place where being smart was celebrated,” she said.
When O’Brien took a break from studying for her pre-med and English concentration classes, she played club and intramural rugby and volunteered with community service organizations, including Housing and Neighborhood Development and Phillips Brooks House Association.
“For me, Harvard was a time to figure out who I was,” she said.
According to her husband, O’Brien was very social, making friends across a wide variety of groups and cliques.
“It was very easy for her to integrate in a whole host of people, something that has borne out today,” Raymond said.
Above all, however, O’Brien appreciates that Harvard introduced her to Raymond, whom she befriended as a junior in college and started dating a few years after his graduation.
“Looking back, if there’s one thing I walked away with, it was an amazing husband,” O’Brien said.
CALLING ‘BULLSHIT’
Towards the end of her junior year, O’Brien left school to start working as an associate producer and news writer at WBZ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Boston.
Although dropping out of college can be a daunting experience, O’Brien said it was an option that made the most sense at the time.
“I was much more terrified about graduating without a clue,” O’Brien said. “That was much scarier to me. As soon I started working at a TV station, I knew I was going to love it.”
O’Brien’s consistently high-quality journalism enabled her to move up the ranks of media broadcasting, joining NBC News in New York as a field producer for Nightly News and Today. She became a local reporter and bureau chief for San Francisco’s NBC affiliate for three years and ultimately started work as an anchor at MSNBC in 1996.
This past year, O’Brien anchored the CNN morning show “Starting Point,” in which her confrontational one-on-one interview style became a trademark.
“Soledad does not suffer fools lightly,” said Bondy. “She knows when to call bullshit because she does her homework.”
After leaving Starting Point this past March, O’Brien launched her own production company, StarFish Media, through which she will continue to produce documentaries and expand her “Black in America” documentary series.
O’Brien is currently a visiting fellow at the Graduate School of Education and will deliver the Class Day speech at Harvard’s 376th commencement exercises.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Wicked Witch of the West and her evil winged monkeys appeared on screen in “The Wizard of Oz,” A.O. Scott ’87-’88 ran out of the room screaming.
While he was only three at the time, his mother Joan W. Scott, who received an honorary degree from Harvard in 2007, explained that her son’s reaction is not exactly what you would expect from the future chief film critic for the New York Times.
From a very young age, his mother said, Scott had won writing competitions held by English teachers and children’s magazines. Although it was always clear that he had wanted to be a writer of some kind, his foray into a professional career in writing did not begin with films.
At Harvard, in fact, when Scott was not at home in the Dudley Co-op or waiting tables at Café Pamplona, he spent most of his time with books.
Scott, who graduated magna cum laude with a degree in literature, found that his time on campus influenced his career in many indirect ways, whether it was through his conversations with friends, attendance at local movie screenings, or focus on his coursework.
Michael Katz ’87, a close friend of Scott’s from college, remembered Scott’s passion for literature. He loved reading stories, and he loved telling them.
“He could sit at a manual typewriter and type an entire essay for whatever essay he was doing from beginning to end,” Katz said. “You could count the number of times on a hand that he would backspace.”
Katz said that the group of friends spent most of their time at Harvard discussing a range of topics, from poetry to books to movies.
“Whatever it was—it could have been a Latin American novel that Carlos Fuentes was teaching at the school at the time, or it could have been anything—he would just have a blast talking and thinking about it,” Katz said.
Justine H. Henning ’88, now Scott’s wife, also stressed Scott’s genuine interest in his studies. The two first met while attending to some of the Co-op’s chores: He had signed up to wash the pots, while she had signed up to wash the dishes.
“He was part of the cigarette smoking crowd of the Co-op, and I was more of the vegetarian, hippie crowd,” Henning said. “It was a little bit like Romeo and Juliet.”
Scott’s intellectual nature was something that Henning found charming.
“He took academics very seriously, which he still does. He reads absolutely everything,” Henning said. “He has this impressive breadth of knowledge which has served him really well.”
One of her fondest memories of Scott from their college days involved a trip to the library together. When she and Scott first began dating, he offered to walk her to Hilles Library, carrying her books for her as they walked.
“It’s so old-fashioned, and I was really touched by that,” Henning said.
Although Scott said there was a lull in the movie scene on campus during his time as a student, he still found time to watch films when he was not studying, making it to the movies three or four times every week. Scott also remembered partaking in some of Harvard’s movie traditions, like watching “Casablanca” at the Brattle Theatre or watching “Love Story” during Opening Days as a freshman. “I got a pretty good movie education from the Brattle Theatre, different house film societies, and the Orson Welles Theatre,” he said.
Still, Scott’s education did not directly translate to a clear future career path. Henning cited Scott’s further ties to academia, noting that both of his parents are professors. “It was almost in his genes to do that,” she said.
After graduating, Scott spent a few years in a graduate program in literature at Johns Hopkins University before deciding to write book reviews for The Nation.
From there, he went on to the New York Review of Books and eventually worked as a book critic for Newsday and as a contributor to Slate magazine. When the New York Times read a piece he wrote on Martin Scorsese in 1999, they had discovered their next chief film critic.
“Writing careers are often a series of accidents or lucky breaks or decisions that someone else has made,” Scott said. “That I write about movies for a living happened by accident.”
Despite this, Katz said that even as a college student, Scott exhibited some characteristics of his future role as a critic.
“He’s a natural-born critic in the true sense of the word: He is an appreciator of things and likes to digest them and think about them and think about what it means in the world,” Katz said. “Although I never identified him with film in any way, I can see why he became a critic.”
The intellectual environment that Harvard and his friends provided helped Scott build the skills he would later need for a career in criticism.
“In a general way, what I learned as an undergraduate was kind of how to be serious and how to take pleasure in being serious,” said Scott. “More than any particular subject I learned in a class, it was that atmosphere of intellectual intensity and curiosity that helped me.”
This passion for literature and film still lives in the Scott family today. Scott is currently working on a few book projects of his own, and Henning has been involved in teaching and tutoring.
Their children, Ezra, 16, and Carmen, 14, have already been bitten by the performing and film-making bugs, according to Scott’s mother. Carmen has played lead roles in school theater productions, like Juliet in “Romeo and Juliet,” while Ezra, on the other hand, has taken a behind-the-scenes approach, aspiring to be a filmmaker.
Twenty-five years later and a new career path aside, his friends conclude that the intellectually driven Scott has not changed all too much.
“Tony to me is still the Tony he was when we hung out in college...except now he sees a lot more movies,” Katz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On July 4, 2006, NASA’s Discovery space shuttle lifted off into space, sending Harvard graduate Stephanie D. Wilson ’88 beyond the earth’s atmosphere for the first time in her life.
For the Massachusetts native and former currier House resident, the trip was the culmination of years of hard work and the realization of a lifelong dream. As a group of students from class of 1988 eagerly watched and cheered her on, wilson—an engineer and NASA astronaut—became the second African-American woman to go into space.
“She’s a brilliant engineer that I think has paved the way for a lot of other future engineers, to sum it up,” said Jean M. Andino ’88, Wilson’s blockmate in Currier House.
But her friends watching on the sidelines that day knew her not only as an historical figure, but also as a compassionate and inspiring presence during their college years.
Donny Frederick ’88 described Wilson as a “humble Christian” and “probably one of the most endearing souls” he ever met.
When asked what his best memory with Wilson was, Frederick responded without pause.
“September 30, 1984. Our date to Legal Seafoods and then to the Diana Ross concert in Boston Gardens,” he said.
Others knew Wilson as a hard-working student who stayed by their sides through many an all-nighter.
“I have fond memories [of Wilson],” said Isabella E. Fu ’88, who lived with Wilson as a Freshman in Thayer. “I do remember staying up late working on problem sets and papers and Expos and that kind of thing.”
An engineering concentrator, Wilson had wanted to become an astronaut since a very young age, and friends say she pursued the field of aeronautics with a passion in college.
“If I remember the story correctly, [Wilson] actually met an astronaut when she was younger, and ever since that point she always wanted to be an astronaut,” Andino said.
Although andino said she didn’t know about Wilson’s desire to be an astronaut until after she graduated, she always knew that Wilson had an interest in space. According to Andino, Wilson focused on tethered satellites—which are satellites anchored to each other in space—when the two worked on their senior engineering project.
In addition, Wilson worked as an undergraduate researcher for James G. Anderson, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at Harvard.
“Stephanie was an excellent contributor to our research group as an undergraduate,” Anderson said. “She was very good in the sciences, very good in creative research, and a superb person to work with on any project.”
According to Anderson, Wilson’s work was crucial for helping the group understand the relationship between the release of chlorofluorocarbons—a common ingredient in refrigerants and cleaning agents—and ozone destruction.
Outside of class, Wilson played clarinet and was a radio disc jockey for WHRB’s classical music station.
“She was very much into classical music,” Andino remembers.
Those who knew Wilson in college continued to follow her career trajectory with interest after her graduation.
“We’ve stayed in touch with her since [her undergraduate years],” Anderson said. “I’ve followed her career as an astronaut with great interest and think the world of her.”
After leaving Harvard, Wilson earned a masters degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas. Following a four-year stint at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., she was selected by NASA in 1996 to undergo training and evaluation as an astronaut candidate.
Since embarking on her first trip in 2006, Wilson has gone into space twice more.
“Stephanie is indeed an inspiration to a lot of folks. She did something that is quite unique within NASA [and it is] an absolute pleasure to know her,” Andino said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recently unearthed 2009 Ph.D. dissertation approved by Harvard Kennedy School faculty has drawn strong criticism for its assertion that low-IQ individuals—a demographic that the author says is disproportionately Hispanic or of other non-white or non-Asian ethnicities—should be restricted from immigrating to the United States because they lack “raw cognitive ability or intelligence.”
Outrage over the thesis—unearthed by the Washington Post after its author Jason M. Richwine coauthored a paper published by the Heritage Foundation—has led Harvard students to write a petition stating that the Kennedy School “cannot ethically stand behind academic work advocating a national policy of exclusion and advancing an agenda of discrimination.”
The petition, delivered to University President Drew G. Faust and Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood earlier this month, garnered the support of 23 Kennedy School student groups and Kennedy School Student Government President Rohit Malhotra.
In an email to the petitioners, Ellwood defended the Kennedy School’s decision to approve the thesis.
”Bad ideas should be pushed out by good ideas, not by censorship,” he wrote.
In an interview with the Boston Globe, Richwine defended his thesis in the name of academic freedom.
“This is a really worrisome idea here, that the students want to dictate what scholarship will be allowed at Harvard University,” Richwine said.
In a statement to The Crimson, Richwine also defended the relevance of his research.
“Right now there are so many powerful interest groups aligned to support low-skill immigration that I doubt any proposal to switch to high-skill immigration (with or without the use of IQ tests) could go very far politically,” he wrote. “But it can’t hurt to talk about it.”
The thesis was brought to public attention when Richwine coauthored a Heritage Foundation paper examining the economic impact of proposals to overhaul the country's immigration laws. Subsequent backlash against the thesis precipitated Richwine’s resignation from the Heritage Foundation earlier this month.
While Kennedy School officials and faculty have countered claims that the dissertation does not meet academic standards, petitioners insist that Richwine’s dissertation committee was ill-prepared to oversee his thesis.
Although professor George Borjas—head of the committee that oversaw Richwine’s research—told Slate magazine the dissertation’s empirical work was sound, he acknowledged that he had not studied the relationship between IQ and immigration.
Richwine told The Crimson, however, that the other members of the faculty committee, Christopher S. Jencks ’58 and Charles A. Murray ’65, are experts in this area.
Ellwood also defended the expertise of the committee, writing that “three intellectually diverse, serious scholars reviewed and accepted the dissertation.”
The review committee aside, some questioned the quality of Richwine’s research.
“Key terms are poorly defined, auxiliary assumptions abound, and the literature I’m familiar with that is cited as authoritative is, well, not good,” wrote Tufts University professor Daniel W. Drezner in a Foreign Policy blog post.
A number of petition signatories read Richwine’s thesis and said they found numerous errors and missteps, which they brought to Ellwood’s attention during a recent meeting, according to Malhotra.
Since the beginning of the controversy, the Heritage Foundation has distanced itself from the former staffer and from his contentious academic work.
“The Harvard paper is not a work product of The Heritage Foundation. Its findings do not reflect the positions of The Heritage Foundation or the conclusions of our study on the cost of amnesty to U.S. taxpayers, as race and ethnicity are not part of Heritage immigration policy recommendations,” wrote Mike Gonzalez, vice president for communications at The Heritage Foundation, in a statement earlier this month.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification and corrections:
CLARIFICATION: May 30, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that Jason M. Richwine’s controversial dissertation was a Harvard Kennedy School Ph.D. thesis. To clarify, while the thesis was approved by Kennedy School faculty, Richwine's degree was conferred by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
CORRECTIONS: May 30, 2013
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the dissertation claimed that Hispanics and other ethnic groups should be restricted from immigrating to the United States. In fact, the thesis claims that people who have low IQs—a demographic that Richwine claims is disproportionately Hispanic or of other non-white or non-Asian ethnicities—should face immigration restrictions. The article also incorrectly stated that Richwine used data from his Harvard dissertation to coauthor a Heritage Foundation paper. In fact, the two papers are unrelated, according to Richwine.

UPDATED: May 29, 2013, at 11:08 p.m.
Harvard may have to change its admissions policies depending on the Supreme Court’s ruling in a landmark affirmative action case expected to be decided in the next few weeks.
The case, Fisher v. University of Texas, centers around a white woman who claims she was denied admission to the University of Texas on the basis of her race in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Justices are expected to rule on the case before the Court’s term ends the last week of June.
Because Harvard receives federal funding, a Supreme Court ruling impacting affirmative action policies might force the University to adjust to comply with federal law.
In the most extreme circumstance, if the Justices find affirmative action to be wholly unconstitutional, Harvard will be forced to dramatically transform the way it evaluates applicants.
“If the Court says that the Texas practices are a form of discrimination, it would seem hard to believe that any form of affirmative action, even the kind that Harvard uses as part of a holistic process with diversity as part of its goals, would be considered legal,” said Julie A. Reuben, a professor at Graduate School of Education.
Matthew P. Shaw, a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education who like Harvard submitted an amicus brief on the case, pointed out that because the current holistic admissions process accepted by the Court is based off of Harvard’s model, “if affirmative action is found to be a discriminatory use of race, Harvard will have to assess it’s policies for admissions and recruitment.”
On the other extreme, if the Justices choose to rule narrowly and base their decision on Texas’s history of discrimination, this case would not affect Harvard’s policies, Reuben said.
“Harvard might not have to change anytime soon, but we might expect the Court to take another case...where the school does not have a history of de jure segregation,” she said.
Nevertheless, the Court could still rule against Texas without affecting Harvard’s policies if the Justices make a narrow decision specific to the situation of the University of Texas, a likely scenario according to Harvard Law professor Richard H. Fallon. “Everything would depend on how the opinion was written,” he said.
Following the oral arguments for the case in October and the Court’s unexpected ruling on the Affordable Care Act in 2012, many predicted the Court would rule in favor of Texas. But the outcome still remains up in the air.
“I think they’re going to overturn the policy. The question is how far they might go,” said Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, a former Crimson sports and editorial editor.
Fallon agreed, saying, “The Texas plan is doomed.”
Shaw said that since Justice Elena Kagan, the former Dean of Harvard Law School, has recused herself from the case, it is likely that the Justices will split their vote. If that happens, the Court will defer to a lower court ruling in favor of the University of Texas.
Legal experts predict that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will cast the deciding vote, siding either with the more liberal-leaning Justices to produce a deadlock or with the conservatives to strike down the existing affirmative action policy.
Harvard Law School professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin wrote in an email that while most commentators think Kennedy will “forbid or further restrict the use of race in admissions,” she thinks it is possible that he will support the University of Texas’s affirmative action policy “if he recognizes the historical and social significance” of the case.
“[I]t’s the first case in which the Court will rule on an affirmative action case that arises from the South or South West, where the history of discrimination in higher education is egregious and effects of discrimination linger,” she wrote.
Shaw said it is also possible that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 will join Kennedy and the liberal Justices if he wants to write the majority opinion in order to narrow the impact of the decision.
Reuben said that because the issues in Fisher are so similar to those in Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger, two 2003 cases about admissions policies at the University of Michigan, she is unsure how the Justices will approach a precedentJ set so recently.
“I was frankly somewhat surprised that the Court decided to take this case so soon after the Michigan case,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist, lawyer, and award-winning author Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82 told over 700 Harvard Law School graduates to be imaginative with their careers amid a declining and transforming job market during the school’s class day ceremony on Wednesday.
Toobin, who graduated from the Law School in 1986, said that the graduating class bears a responsibility to use their Harvard degrees to better society. “Now you have to go out and make that great degree work for you and the rest of us,” he said.
Toobin’s speech comes as law school graduates across the country face a declining job market. “2013 is not the greatest time in history to graduate from law school,” he said.
But Toobin, a former Crimson sports and editorial editor, pointed out that students graduating from Harvard face a far healthier job market. In 2012, just 56.2 percent of graduates secured full-time, long-term positions that require the passage of the bar exam. That same year, over 87 percent of Harvard’s Class of 2012 filled comparable positions.
“You’re Harvard lawyers,” he said. “That gets people’s attention from Cambridge to Cambodia.”
Many say that the dearth of jobs is caused by an excess in the number of lawyers, but Toobin described that belief as “only true in a limited sense” in an interview with The Crimson.
“There’s not an oversupply for people who really need them,” he said. “I think it’s incumbent for people who are privileged to help those who really need it.”
In his speech, Toobin advised graduates that navigating a changing job market would require skills beyond those they learned in school.
“Students do what they’re told,” he said, adding that the rapidly changing nature of the legal profession requires students to build upon whichever jobs exist. “Even if you go to the largest law firm in the world, you will have to invent your own career,” he said.
Graduating students said that Toobin’s speech offered them the chance to reflect on the trajectory of their own employment aspirations.
“I took away the idea to try to find your own path and do whatever you like that makes a difference,” said Jake Laperruque, a third-year student at the Law School.
Kibrom T. Teweldebirhan, an LL.M. student, said he took away the message that one’s career “all depends on your own creativity.”
Jordan C. Wall, one of the class marshals, said Toobin “really illuminated what’s ahead of us.”
“We have the opportunity to do whatever we want,” Wall said. “We need to be open to adapting.”
Toobin told The Crimson that he was “extremely flattered” when he first heard he would give the class day address. “I just loved law school,” he said, describing his experience at Harvard Law School as “the most challenging and interesting part of my education.”
“I feel that my life as a journalist is sort of like being a perpetual law student,” he added.

Come fall semester, two familiar faces in the Freshman Dean’s Office will no longer be there. Resident deans William Cooper ’94 of Ivy Yard and Jonas V. Clark of Oak Yard are leaving the FDO.
Madeleine A. Currie, a former proctor who is currently doing a postdoctorate at Harvard, will replace Cooper, while Clark’s role has yet to be filled.
Clark, who worked as a proctor in Wigglesworth for five years before spending four years as a dean, will depart to attend the Yale School of Management.
“I wanted to have a chance to get back from the day-to-day work and step back to get some new schooling,” Clark said.
Cooper will leave the FDO after seven years to defend his dissertation before considering new professional options, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
Cooper did not return repeated requests for comment on his departure.
Dingman said that Cooper and Clark will be missed by their colleagues.
“Dean Cooper has tremendous judgment, and he is absolutely unflappable,” Dingman said. “Dean Clark was enjoying the responsibilities, and we saw how smart and committed and compassionate he was. We’ve had a wonderful run with the current four resident deans. They’re all quite different from one another, but I think that’s a strength. We’ve really enjoyed this work together.”
Clark said that he will miss many things about Harvard—stopping to talk with so many of his friends and colleagues while walking across campus, viewing the Charles River from DeWolfe Street apartments, and experiencing the excitement of move-in day.
“Harvard is something very new and unexpected, and nothing beats watching as people pull up to the gates, their eyes wide,” Clark said.
Reflecting on his time at Harvard, Clark said he was honored to have worked as a freshman resident dean.
“It’s a real privilege to be working with students who are so talented and enthusiastic,” Clark said. “It’s equally inspiring to be around the staff and faculty and the people who want to support these students. It’s been a great chapter.”
Currie, the new Ivy Yard Dean, was chosen from an applicant pool of 152 people, which was then whittled down to six people who were brought on to campus for interviews, according to Dingman. Students also were involved in the interviewing process, Dingman said.
“It’s premature to say who’s moving into [Clark’s] role,” Dingman said. “We may well have a third opening, too, which means we’ll go back to the finalists and decide who among the remaining folks seems strongest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Soledad M. O’ Brien ’88-’00 encouraged thousands of students, parents, and alumni gathered in Tercentenary Theatre for Senior Class Day Exercises Wednesday to break down barriers and “seek out goodness in others.”
“Lean in to use your voice, lean in to make change where it needs to be made, and lean in to invest your heart and your soul in ideas and people,” she said, adapting the “lean in” phrase coined by Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 in her book by that name.
In her address, O’Brien—a former CNN anchor—drew upon her experiences, especially those from her time as a journalist.
“I have seen in my career, whether I’m covering tsunamis in Asia or Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans or earthquakes in Haiti, is that pretty much, everybody wants the same things,” O’Brien said. “You need to break through walls that you think exist between people who don’t look like you and don’t act like you because those walls don’t have to exist.”
In a deeply personal part of the speech, she shared stories of her parents’ experiences as an interracial couple in Maryland when such marriages were illegal.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, in her first public speech since the official announcement that she will step down as Dean, told students to use the skills they learned from their time at Harvard to better others around the globe.
“We’re bound to use the knowledge we gained at Harvard to serve not only ourselves but our kind,” Hammonds said. “You now have the power of a Harvard degree to help you do what you want to do, you can use it to benefit yourselves, your families, and your friends. But there are also things that you can do to improve the situation for humanity at large.”
Following Hammonds’s speech, four students selected by the Senior Class Committee addressed their fellow graduates.
Damilare K. Sonoiki ’13, the male Harvard Orator, recalled the beginning of his time at Harvard when he continually promised himself that he would “eventually” go listen to a sermon given by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, only to be thwarted by “problem sets, due dates, and meetings.” One day he woke up to an email from University President Drew G. Faust saying that Gomes had passed away.
“We should perhaps limit our eventuallys,” said Sonoiki, who is an inactive Crimson news editor. “I hope that we might turn our somedays into todays and our eventuallys into nows.”
Julie M. Zauzmer ’13, a former Crimson managing editor, delivered the other Harvard Oration.
“Here’s what the world needs: people who know how to arrive at a place that’s huge and complicated and scary—a place like Harvard—and then make it their own, and that means every single one of us,” Zauzmer said at the conclusion of her oration.
The Ivy Orators, whose addresses are typically more lighthearted in tone, poked fun at Harvard and student life.
“Back when I was 18, I thought I was going to run into Drew Gilpin Faust on the streets, at least one time, but that did not happen,” said Blythe B. Roberson ’13, the female Ivy orator.
“Drew, where are you? Is she—is she here today?” Roberson continued, scouring the audience with binoculars she brought with her to the podium.
Philip M. Gillen ’13, the other Ivy orator, took a more extreme approach, calling on the Class of 2013 to “burn this University to the ground.”
“I need you to stop Snachatting pictures of administrators with grainy, drawn-on handlebar mustaches, stand up, and treat this school the way you treat your liver during Harvard-Yale,” Gillen shouted, calling his fellow classmates to arms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Addressing soon-to-be Harvard Kennedy School graduates and their families at the School’s class day on Wednesday, Geoffrey Canada, president and CEO of social service organization Harlem Children’s Zone, encouraged this generation to complete the charitable work of the previous generation and improve society for the children who need it most.
“My time as leader is coming to an end,” Canada said. “Others will have to finish this work. Someone else will have to pick up the mantel and say, ‘No matter what else I do as a career, I will make sure I leave my country a better place than it was left to me.’”
Canada, a social activist whose nonprofit serves approximately 100 blocks of central Harlem, emphasized that his generation of community leaders is reaching the end of its tenure, creating a pressing need for the youth to step up and carry out his mission of tackling poverty to promote opportunity and education.
Canada­, who was raised by a single mother in the South Bronx, was introduced by Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75. In his introduction, Ellwood called Canada “one of my heroes,” evoking the same words that First Lady Michelle Obama has used to describe the CEO.
In his remarks, Canada told the crowd that there are many paths to a career of service and that the potential wealth that follows a Harvard degree is just one start on that journey.
In the address, which Canada said was written for his “soul brothers,” he said that his achievements with the Harlem Children’s Zone have come with the financial and organizational support of the board, especially its Chair Stanley F. Druckenmiller, a former hedge fund manager.
“I could not have created Harlem Children’s Zone alone,” Canada told the crowd. “I want you to aspire to a higher calling, but you need not take a vow of poverty.”
Audience members, such as Kennedy School student Jamal A. Jones, were moved by Canada’s willingness to ask for help in his career.
“One of the things that stood out for me was the fact that [Canada] didn’t do it alone,” said Jones, who will receive his master’s degree in public administration on Thursday. “He had a lot of help. He had partners developing his organization. It’s always helpful to know that you need help and you should seek help.”
In his speech, Canada also referred to leaders who had inspired him to act, such as Civil Rights Movement pioneers Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr., and former president John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson business editor.
“As a young boy, [Kennedy] meant so much to be because he stood up for civil rights at a time in this nation where that very concept was debated and challenged openly in the press,” Canada.
Canada continued to discuss King’s famous oratory, in which King claimed that oftentimes the great work of making society a better place is an effort started and then left to successors.
As he approaches the end of his career, Canada, 61, expressed hope for the future.
“The best of America is yet to come,” Canada said.
Reflecting on the speech, Jones said he thinks Canada’s message is an important one.
“He’s done his part, and he’s coming towards the end of his career,” Jones said. “People need to pick up the baton and carry his mission forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November 2011, the Harvard football team wrapped up a dominant season with a 45-7 thrashing of rival Yale.
The Crimson, which finished the year ranked No. 14 in the Football Championship Subdivision, went 9-1 overall and undefeated in the Ivy League on the way to winning the conference title.
“We got beat by a better football team today,” former Yale coach Tom Williams said after the contest. “They’re the best team in our league—the best team we’ve played this year—and it showed.”
It was a meaningful statement from Williams, whose squad had also faced the Patriot League’s Lehigh Mountain Hawks in a non-conference contest earlier in the season. In the week following The Game, Lehigh would go on to play in the FCS Tournament, where it reached the quarterfinals and finished the season ranked No. 5 in the nation.
Harvard—in Williams’ mind a better team than Lehigh—never had such a chance.
That’s because the Ancient Eight does not allow its teams to compete in the six-week, 20-team championship playoffs.
Though winners of 11 conferences, including the Patriot League, earn automatic bids to the field, the Ivy League continues to decline a bid. That means that no matter how well an Ancient Eight team plays during the regular season, its year will come to an end a month before that of its elite peers.
The conference is one of just two FCS leagues to opt out of the playoff—the other being the Southwestern Athletic Conference, which instead splits its members into divisions and plays a conference championship game of its own.
As an explanation for this ban on postseason play, Ivy conference administrators cite concerns about both tradition and academics, noting that the playoff—which begins the weekend after Thanksgiving—could interfere with reading period and finals.
Denied the opportunity to test themselves against the nation’s best FCS squads, teams like the 2004 Crimson—which finished the regular season as the nation’s only undefeated FCS team and was ranked No. 13 in the country at year’s end—must be content with only winning an Ivy League championship.
Though some support this ban and share the belief that the football season should conclude before the start of reading period, others point to the spring NCAA tournaments for golf, softball, tennis, and lacrosse—all of which feature the participation of the Ancient Eight champion (and sometimes multiple Ivy teams), despite the fact that they can and often do extend into the heart of finals.
The Ivy League’s continued rejection of postseason play for football, on the other hand, has left many players, coaches, and fans disappointed about the missed opportunity for the best of the Ivy League to test itself on the gridiron against the nation’s elite in a quest to win a national championship.
AN INFLEXIBLE POSITION
Though the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) has continued to use the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) computer system to determine the participants in its national championship game—a setup that will change when it implements a four-team playoff in 2014—the FCS has used a tournament model since the inception of Division I-AA football in 1978.
That year, the playoff included just four teams; the tournament then expanded to eight squads in 1981, 12 in 1982, 16 in 1986, and 20 in 2010.
In 2013, the playoff will expand to 24 teams. The Ancient Eight champion will not be one of them.
“Other commissioners would love to see the Ivy League be part of the playoffs, but they understand it’s a long-standing traditional decision,” said Robin Harris, the Executive Director of the conference. “They would love to see us and they mention it occasionally, but they understand that we’re not participating.”
Crimson coach Tim Murphy says that the Ivy presidents have been mostly quiet on the issue during his 13-year tenure, despite the fact that—according to Brown coach Phil Estes—the league’s coaches will often ask to have playoff participation put up for discussion among the conference’s presidents.
“I think [the coaches would] all be in support of it,” Estes said.
So far, though, the presidents haven’t budged.
“There was a point, maybe back in 1998-99 [when] there were a few presidents that tried to make a push to put it on the agenda,” Estes said. “But it didn’t go anywhere from there.”
Currently, the Ivy League remains an active member of the subdivision, meeting two or three times per year with its commissioner and maintaining regular communications about FCS administrative issues. But it continues to remain rigid when it comes to joining the playoff.
“The position on this issue is the same. There’s been no serious discussion about changing it since I’ve been here,” said Harris, who joined the Ivy League in 2009.
ACADEMICS VERSUS ATHLETICS
The most commonly-cited reason for the conference’s lack of participation in the playoffs is academics.
This past year, the tournament ran from Nov. 24 through Jan. 5, meaning it overlapped with the finals period of every Ivy League institution except Princeton.
“Postseason play would undermine the student identity of our student-athletes by carrying the season on into exam times and through a greater portion of the year,” University President Drew G. Faust said in November.
But football remains the only one of Harvard’s 41 varsity sports that is ineligible for postseason play, and other Ivy League teams are routinely asked to balance the academic-athletic scheduling conflict.
Earlier in May, for example, the women’s golf team traveled to its NCAA Tournament, which took place during the spring reading and finals period. Players were often required to take finals early in the morning before heading out to play a full tournament round of golf.
“I found it pretty difficult,” said freshman Christine Lin, who took an exam at 8 a.m. in the coaches’ room of the Stanford Golf Course, where the Crimson was competing. “On the one hand I really wanted to play well in golf, but I also had my exam to focus on.... It was pretty hard to split the difference and switch my focus from one to the other.”
Lin says she already finds it challenging to balance athletics with academics while at Harvard, and asking students to take exams on the road makes it “10 times as hard.” But despite the difficulty involved with the process, Lin says she does not support the Ivy League banning postseason football due to academic concerns.
“Athletes are recruited to play for the school in their sport,” she said. “I’m not saying academics aren’t important, [but] I feel like it can be scheduled around.”
Andy Nguyen, co-captain of the men’s tennis team—which also recently returned from an NCAA Tournament that took place during reading and finals period—agrees, saying that taking exams on the road “wasn’t that big of a deal.”
“The academic officials are really accommodating,” explained Nguyen, who took a take-home test while at the tournament in Mississippi this year. “They understand we’re students first.”
Nguyen says that though things can become difficult when players are asked to take exams right after their matches, he does not find maintaining academic success while on the road to be inordinately challenging.
“I think the guys did well [on the tests they took at the tournament],” Nguyen said. “It’s what we’ve been doing all year, balancing tennis and school.... It’s just a little bit more intense.”
According to Tim McDonnell, who covers the subdivision for The Sports Network, one of two organizations that releases an FCS poll, football teams in other conferences, such as the Colonial Athletic Association, often face similar conflicts and thus have permitted their players to take tests on the Friday before the game or earlier in the week in order to allow them to compete in the playoff.
“I understand there’s a big difference academically between the Ivy League and other schools in the FCS, but I do look at some of those FCS schools [where] I know academically it’s not the same standards, but it’s still manageable,” said McDonnell. “It’s not like it’s impossible.”
Charlie Cobb, Chair of the Division I Football Committee, also says that were the Ivy League to agree to join the playoff, participating teams would undoubtedly be able to concurrently meet its academic requirements.
“We’ve done it in years past where we’ve had to proctor exams with our academic support staff, [or with] our faculty athletic [representative] when we’ve been at the championship site,” Cobb said. “Obviously you’ve got to take care of your work academically, and everybody understands that, but I think there is a way to do both.”
A POST-“GAME” LETDOWN?
Another reason often cited by Ivy League administrators for the postseason ban is tradition.
Some at Harvard claim playoff participation would be meaningless because the team already has what it considers a championship contest—The Game, the season-ending match between Harvard and Yale that annually draws sellout crowds of 30,000 to Harvard Stadium or 60,000 to the Yale bowl. By comparison, the first-round FCS playoff games last season drew an average of 4,442 fans.
“To be perfectly honest with you, to be able to end our season in a great national rivalry, on  national TV in front of a full house...there’s nothing that could happen in the FCS playoffs that’s going to be a better experience for our kids than that, or a better way to end your season,” Murphy said.
But not all of the league’s teams have that luxury; over the past two years, the season finales of the other six Ancient Eight squads drew an average of just 5,392 fans per contest.
“We’ve got a tremendous way to finalize our season, [and] I don’t think we can do any better than that,” Murphy said. “[But] I know my fellow coaches of the league may feel very differently.... I don’t think there’s any question—if I’m the Brown coach or I’m the Princeton coach or I’m the Penn coach, I may have a much different take on it.”
Viewing the situation from Providence, R.I., Estes is one of those coaches who sees things differently.
“In the past, it’s always been about the Harvard-Yale game, and they feel maybe the playoffs would be a bit of a letdown after that,” he said. “I think the rest of the league would like to have the opportunity...to play in the playoffs.”
Harris says she feels Ivy League fan support for existing games and rivalries stands independent from whether teams compete against national competition in the playoffs.
“I think our fans care about Ivy League football,” she said. “Rivalry games are going to draw the most fans [to] a given game, and whether or not a team is going on to the FCS playoffs, I don’t think is going to [have an] impact.”
Tradition, therefore, continues to dominate when it comes to Ivy League football.
“The Ivy League presidents are not interested in allowing participation in the playoffs because they value Ivy football as it currently exists,” Harris said. “The focus for our teams is on the regular season and the value of Ivy League play. The tradition and history of Ivy League football is paramount.”
A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE?
Even if the Ivy League did participate in the FCS playoffs, the question remains whether the conference champion could even contend with the best teams from around the country, who are not burdened with the same academic restrictions on recruiting that Ancient Eight squads deal with.
“I think the general conception of the Ivy League is...[that its teams are] not going to be able to compete with the North Dakota States, the Sam Houston States, or the Georgia Southerns,” McDonnell said.
But McDonnell, who covers all of the subdivision’s programs, believes that perception is the wrong one.
“You can make the argument that some teams that made the field this year didn’t have as good of a season as Harvard did, or Penn, and that’s what the strange thing is,” he said. “It’s not like they have bad players in the Ivy League; some people don’t realize that. I look at [senior running back Treavor] Scales from Harvard, I look at [Crimson senior quarterback] Colton Chapple, those are guys we talk about all the time. It just stinks we’re not able to talk about them at a championship level.”
Murphy agrees that the league’s top squads would do fine in a national tournament.
“The best teams over the years from the Ivy League could compete at the highest level, I don’t think there’s any question about it,” Murphy said. “And I say that not as conjecture, but having been in [the playoff] four times as a head coach at Maine and as an assistant coach at Boston University back in the day.”
McDonnell even says that in the league’s best seasons, two or more Ancient Eight squads could earn tournament bids.
“You could see an at-large happen, for sure,” he said. “It’s not like these teams are going to play in the playoffs and get rolled over. It’s going to be competitive.”
ON THE PLUS SIDE
The possibility also exists that playoff participation could provide benefits to the conference that it does not currently receive, with one potential area of growth being recruiting.
Both Murphy and Estes, two of the three coaches to win an Ancient Eight championship in the last seven years—the other, Penn’s Al Bagnoli, declined to comment for this story—say that they do not believe that the conference’s ban on postseason play has a major impact on the talent they are able to attract.
“With the type of kids the Ivy League recruits it’s such a small part of their decision-making process, and they seem to see the big picture,” Murphy said. “It doesn’t seem to be a huge issue whatsoever.”
“I’ve never encountered an athlete that decided not to come to Brown because we don’t play in the playoffs, as far as I know,” Estes echoed. “We just don’t talk about it. There’s certainly enough interest [because players] understand the value of the education...the chance to be an Ivy League champion is what we talk about.”
But Scales, who led the Ivy League in rushing this year, disagrees.
“To say that that [the playoff ban] doesn’t come into play in some people’s decisions would be ludicrous,” the running back said. “Everybody wants to be able to measure themselves against the rest of the nation, and everybody wants to be able to play against folks from their hometown or have their family and friends from nearby come see them. It can impact recruiting in some way.”
Because a sustained playoff run would increase the exposure and reputability of any program, Cobb says that tournament participation could benefit recruiting by attracting more attention around the country to the conference itself.
“What it gets back to is the experience of playing different teams in different places,” Cobb said. “I think that’s the piece that probably the Ivies are missing and the Division I playoffs [are] missing [without the Ivies].”
Currently, each Ancient Eight squad plays three non-conference games per year—contests that are largely meaningless to the teams’ ultimate goal of winning an Ivy League title because they cannot advance beyond their respective 10-game schedules. The Quakers, for example, won a league championship last season despite going 0-3 in non-conference play.
“Certainly the talent’s there, and you can make the argument that the Ivy League can play with some of the big boys in FCS football,” McDonnell said. “But until that happens, there will also be the question of what the Ivy League is actually competing for.”
Another benefit of playoff participation is that it would make those three non-conference games more significant because they would impact potential playoff seeding and at-large bids. But Murphy says those non-conference games are just as meaningful to his team as the league ones are.
“When you work probably 300 days a year in some facet preparing for those 10 games, there’s no question that they’re [all] very important,” Murphy said. “I don’t sense any different type of preparation or motivation to win those [non-conference] games.”
And while Cobb says the ability to put an additional game in the Northeastern market of the Ivy League is appealing to the subdivision, Harris says that partaking in the tournament would be “cost-neutral” for the conference itself.
“[Money is] not even a factor,” she said. “This is not like Orange Bowl participation where you might get some payment from it.... Cost is not the issue here at all, and a non-storyline.”
A SUBDUED SUBDIVISON
Despite understanding the academic, traditional, and competitive reasons why the Ivy League does not partake in the tournament, McDonnell says that the “general notion” among fans of the FCS is that the Ivy League should be allowed to compete.
“It’s just disappointing because you know one of those slots should be going to the Ivy League,” McDonnell said. “Anyone who is an FCS fan, anyone who covers FCS football wishes that [the Ancient Eight] could participate, because no one wants to see a team not have a chance to win a national championship.”
Cobb, who also serves as the Director of Athletics at Appalachian State—a perennial top FCS program that achieved one of the greatest upsets in college football history when it beat No. 5 Michigan in 2007—says that teams around the country would love the chance to compete against Ivy League schools—an opportunity the tournament would provide.
“I think for Appalachian State and Harvard to play a football game, that would be an awesome experience for [us],” Cobb said. “To me that’s what I get excited about [with] the playoffs.”
Harvard players of past and present say they too would relish the chance to participate in the bracket.
“We’d all love to be able to compete on a national scale,” Scales said. “You’re frustrated [by the ban], but that’s one of the sacrifices you make in attending this great institution and playing in this great conference.”
“I guess there’s always that underlying sentiment [of wanting to play on],” added Chris Lorditch ’11, who started at wide receiver on the 2011 championship team. “But coming into Harvard, you know the deal that The Game against Yale is your Super Bowl, and you kind of get used to that.”
Though Murphy says there was a time when he was “a bit frustrated” by the ban, he has come to accept that it’s not going to change. But Brown’s coach says he wishes it would.
“[It’d be nice to see] how far we can go, and to have the opportunity to compete against the other best teams in the country,” said Estes, whose Bears won at least a share of the Ancient Eight in 1999, 2005, and 2008. “Any time we have the opportunity to compete, I’d think we’d like to do that.”
The disappointment held by these coaches and players is shared by many small-school football supporters around the country.
“I think FCS fans in general, and anyone associated with FCS football wishes that [the Ivy League] could compete for a national title,” McDonnell said. “If you have a football program, why should you not be able to compete to be the best?”
