After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just three months after the final buzzer in Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena sounded, signaling the end of both the Harvard-Michigan State matchup and then-senior forward Kyle Casey’s collegiate career, the 6’7 forward got news that he’ll be lacing up his sneakers once more—this time in an NBA uniform.
According to Basketball Insiders’ Alex Kennedy, Casey ’14 will be joining the Brooklyn Nets’ summer team in the coming weeks, hoping to earn a more permanent spot on a professional roster. The former Harvard star will suit up with his new team for the first time on July 5th, when the Nets take on the Indiana Pacers. The following evening, Casey will go up against familiar face Shabazz Napier, who got traded to the Miami Heat on the night of the NBA Draft.
Casey will be one of seven rookies on Brooklyn’s summer league roster, joining five other players who have already gained NBA experience and exposure. Perhaps most notably, Casey will be competing for playing time with Mason Plumlee, a 6’11 forward/center who was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team last season. The first-year will also play alongside Donté Green, a four-year NBA veteran who recently took his talents to the Chinese Basketball Association.
For his career with the Crimson, Casey averaged just shy of 10 points per game, shooting at a 49.3 percent clip. The forward was part of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s first two Ivy League championships and first March Madness appearance.
