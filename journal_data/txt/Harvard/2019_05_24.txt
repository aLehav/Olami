After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kim family may not be rich, but they are definitely close. There’s Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, who also starred in Bong’s “The Host”), the optimistic and expressive father; Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the blunt and determined mother; and their children, the brilliant and cynical Ki-jung (Park So-dam) and kind-hearted Ki-woo (award-winning Choi Woo-shik). They celebrate the little victories — like finding a new free source of Wi-Fi from their basement abode and getting free fumigation through their windows from the insect terminator spraying the streets. Besides a side job they all share folding pizza boxes, they’re all out of work and nearly out of money. A master of genre, Bong Joon-Ho takes this premise as the outset of “Gisaengchung” (“Parasite”), which is driven by razor-sharp social commentary on class inequality and polarization in South Korea. For Bong, it’s not just the rich against the poor — it’s much more complicated, which he reveals as his film diverges from a heartfelt comedy into a gripping thriller full of vengeful violence.
The Kims gets a rare opportunity at fortune when an old friend asks Ki-woo to tutor his affluent mentee, Da-hye Park (Jung Ziso), while he’s away abroad. With a fake diploma made by Ki-jung, Ki-woo shows up at the lavish home of the Park family to meet Da-hye and her mother, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). When Ki-woo learns that they’re looking for someone to supervise their petulant and artistic wunderkid of a son, he recommends “Jessica,” an American-educated art teacher in high demand, who’s actually just his sister. Soon enough, each member of the Kim family serves a role in the Park’s home due to Yeon-kyo’s naivete (which Cho hilariously captures) and the limited presence of Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), the tech mogul father. The only one who seems to notice that something is awry is the young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), who notes that all of their help smell the same — like “old radishes,” Mr. Park later adds.
This quick takeover in the first half of the film is a comedic uproar. The Kim family practices what they will say to the Parks in order to hoodwink them into giving them jobs: “Jessica, only child, Illinois State,” the siblings chant in unison to remind themselves of Ki-jung’s new identity. Later, Ki-woo and Ki-taek rehearse a script they have written and direct each other to deliver their lines more passionately. These moments capture the essence of the Kim family, which starkly contrasts with the Park family, who are distant with each other and live happily in their bubble of wealth. Bong constructs a stark visual contrast between the unequal social castes at play, showing the bug-infested underground apartment that the Kims occupy, then surveying the Park’s spotless modern mansion.
But the film takes the sharpest of turns with an unexpected visit from one of the Parks’ former employees. To respect Bong’s wishes, this review will refrain from spoilers, though it’s safe to say that this particularly dark black comedy is definitely not what one could foresee or expect. Bong brings together each detail — from flickering lights to a cake from a Taiwanese bakery — into the film’s finely crafted finale, which he executes so neatly that (for better or for worse) it doesn't leave room for much up to interpretation. Like his critique of animal cruelty in “Okja” or of totalitarian government in “Snowpiercer,” this tragicomedy’s message is clear: You can trick the rich all you want, but at the end of the day, you’re still poor.

The world can’t seem to get enough of Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As Waller-Bridge debuts the second season of BBC America’s hit thriller “Killing Eve” and its first season wins accolades, the second season of her original dramedy “Fleabag” finally comes to American television. Though its first season is quite self-contained, “Fleabag” returns to screens once more, courtesy of Waller-Bridge and director Harry Bradbeer. The duo teamed up for a second run that proves to be just as funny and poignant. With its signature dark humor, self-awareness, and its ability to capture the painfully accurate truths of female experience, the final season is perhaps even better than the first.
A year after the disastrous events of the Season One finale, Fleabag is back — she has stopped going on dates and spends more time with friends, while her café has finally taken off. On paper, she is doing much better than before. In reality, Fleabag is just as confused, crippled with self-loathing, and lonely as ever. As usual, her interactions with others are interspersed with her breaking of the fourth-wall to reveal her inner dialogue, providing caustic yet hilarious commentary and humorous predictions (or misinterpretations) of what will happen next.
While Season One deals more directly with the aftermath of her best friend Boo’s death, Season Two more generally tackles Fleabag’s ruptured relationships, focusing on those with her various family members — most notably her relationship with both her uptight sister and bumbling father. Fleabag and Claire (Sian Clifford) haven’t talked in a year, but in the season premiere the two are finally reunite for their father’s engagement party. This season does an excellent job of giving each sister a voice to explain the inner conflicts that each has felt with regards to each other. Clifford moves her character beyond the controlling stereotype to provide a much more feeling portrait of a woman trying as hard as she can to hide her inner crisis.
Fleabag’s father (Bill Paterson) is officially engaged to her obnoxious godmother (Olivia Colman). This event forces Fleabag and her father to come to terms with their dissolved relationship and to confront the strange void that has filled their world since the death of Fleabag’s mother. Though he suffers the same idiosyncratic stilted speech, Fleabag’s father eventually manages to provide a satisfactory explanation for his odd, neglectful behavior — finally giving the audience a deeper understanding of his character.
The wedding introduces another complicated aspect into Fleabag’s life: the Priest (Andrew Scott) with whom she has an incredibly electric and forbidden connection. If Fleabag always saw herself as a load of emotional baggage, the Priest — with his drinking problem and precarious faith — gives her a run for her money. Beyond the whole taboo, the idea of throwing these unstable characters into a charged relationship at first seems rather reductive, especially given what we know of Fleabag’s romantic past. However, Waller-Bridge’s instinct to put these two together ultimately turns out to be one of the most interesting and suspenseful parts of the show. Partly due to their honest dialogue and partly to Waller-Bridges and Scott’s tangible connection, all scenes they share are simultaneously tender and exciting. It’s a relief that the show doesn’t use Fleabag’ s romantic relationship as the basis for her slow recovery, but rather to show that she is capable of loving and being loved. If Fleabag’s actions in the first season were marked by selfishness or inflicting unintended pain, she has clearly grown more aware and open to vulnerability over the course of this season and Waller-Bridge portrays this with the right amount of tentativeness. While Fleabag’s ending is not all happiness, she emerges from the events of Season Two with more strength and the hope that she deserves.
Of course, the show’s signature hilarity is another part of its success: The Godmother’s blatant dislike for Fleabag and all scenes featuring Creepy Jake (Angus Imrie) with his constant, disconcerting cries of “Where’s Claire?” are golden. The moment when Fleabag’s therapist (Fiona Shaw) analyzes Fleabag’s motives for wanting to be with the Priest: “Do you really want to fuck the priest or do you want to fuck God?” And the pause, coupled with the rapid exchange of looks that follows right after, points to the show’s perfect use of visual humor and comedic timing. These small scenes and details all demonstrate that the writing is as sharp and creative as ever and the situations that Fleabag gets herself into are just as complex.
Of course, some characters ultimately feel unnecessary. The introduction of the lascivious lawyer billed as “Hot Misogynist” (Ray Fearon) is rather extraneous, given that this whole series is supposed to be about Fleabag’s recovery from mindless sex into more meaningful relationships. He doesn’t have much of a role and his character sticks around just a tad too long considering that he is supposed to be an unwanted reminiscence of the past. There is also Kristin Scott Thomas’s brilliant albeit almost random cameo in Episode Three. Though she delivers a fantastic, very obviously feminist-angled speech about the undermining phrase “women in business,” her appearance feels rather incongruous with the rest of the show, especially since her character never returns.
Ultimately, even these small elements can’t take away from the brilliant acting of every single member of the cast or the show’s overall witty dialogue. Though there is a two year gap between the first and second season, the actors jump into their roles so flawlessly that it takes no time to get back into the world of “Fleabag.” Nailing every single part of a fantastic production, “Fleabag” is surely one the most unique and intelligent shows that has been on recently, making its ending one of the greatest tragedies and triumphs of TV history.

Venture capitalist James W. Breyer is stepping down from his position on the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — the University announced Thursday.
The Corporation elected Breyer, founder and chief executive officer of Breyer Capital and a Harvard Business School graduate, in 2013. His appointment at the time marked the completion of the Corporation’s expansion from seven to 13 members following a set of governance reforms adopted in 2010 to promote transparency and accountability in the group.
Breyer also serves as the co-chairman of IDG Capital, an investment firm based in Beijing. In addition to serving on the Harvard Corporation, Breyer chairs the advisory board at Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management.
Breyer wrote in an emailed statement that he was honored to serve on the Corporation and that University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the remaining members of the Corporation will continue serving Harvard affiliates well.
“Serving as a member of the Harvard Corporation has been a great honor and a true pleasure,” Breyer wrote. “I am so proud of all we have accomplished together. I know that Larry Bacow and his superb leadership team, in collaboration with our distinguished faculty, will continue fulfilling Harvard’s finest aspirations.”
Breyer served on the Corporation’s finance committee and the joint committees on inspection and on alumni affairs and development. He is also a member of the Board of Dean’s advisers at the Harvard Business School, a role independent from his Corporation seat.
“Although my term of service is ending, I look forward to continued active engagement with this great University, which so seamlessly marries tradition and innovation,” Breyer added.
William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Corporation, said in an interview Thursday Breyer was a “wonderful” Corporation member and that the body will start the process of finding his replacement after Commencement.
“He's stepping down in large part because he has a huge number of responsibilities in China and Asia these days. That's where his businesses is focused. That's where some of his philanthropic efforts are focused,” Lee said. “And it just became too hard to balance everything.”
Lee also said the Corporation will look to replace Breyer with someone who has a similar background and similar experiences.
“We'll be looking to add, or basically to add, someone who might bring some of the same things that Jim did: a West Coast perspective, a technology perspective, a broad international perspective,” Lee said.
The Corporation has already selected two new members — Timothy R. Barakett ’87 and Mariano-Florentino “Tino” Cuéllar ’93 — to join its ranks July 1. They will replace outgoing members Susan L. Graham ’64 and Jessica T. Matthews ’67.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-two lecturers, preceptors, and fellows sent a letter to administrators Thursday asking the Faculty of Arts and Sciences not to terminate them once their teaching appointments automatically end.
In the letter, the signatories argue that FAS should stop placing nonrenewable “time caps” on their appointments which require them to leave Harvard no matter their credentials after three, five, or eight years, depending on their positions.
The instructors who signed the letter say they are winners of the Certificate of Teaching Excellence for Lecturers and Preceptors, which the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning and the Office of Undergraduate Education award based on student course evaluations. Roughly half of the signatories have won multiple teaching awards.
“While we are active researchers and while many of us aspire to tenured positions, we also value our work teaching Harvard’s undergraduates, and we believe that this work deserves respect,” the letter reads. “This arbitrary rule deprives contingent faculty of stability and deprives our students of hundreds of experienced teachers who ‘time out’ and are shown the door every year.”
“We write today to ask you not to fire us,” they wrote.
History and Literature Lecturer Thomas A. Dichter and Environmental Science and Public Policy Preceptor Michaela J. Thompson hand-delivered the letter to the offices of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, FAS Dean Claudine Gay, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh Thursday afternoon.
University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that non-ladder faculty are “extremely important” to FAS’s pedagogical mission.
“The ability to bring in new non-ladder faculty serves an essential educational purpose,” she wrote. “The FAS acknowledges the challenge of balancing the academic needs of students and departments with the professional advancement needs of outstanding non-ladder faculty.”
Dichter said in an interview Thursday he sees a “disconnection” between the University’s teaching awards and the “on-the-ground reality” for non-tenure-track faculty members, who comprise a significant portion of FAS instructors.
“We think it’s self-defeating for the University to be simultaneously recognizing the teaching accomplishments of non-tenure-track faculty, and automatically requiring them to leave,” Dichter said.
Preceptor in Japanese Ikue Shingu, who wrote in an email that she has received teaching awards for 12 consecutive semesters, wrote that she signed the letter because she would like to stay at Harvard past the eighth and final year of her appointment, but her requests to arrange an exception to the time cap are “not going anywhere.”
“This rule prevents qualified teachers from even applying to Harvard positions,” Shingu wrote. “I hesitated to accept the offer myself.”
Both Dichter and Thompson said FAS rules around time caps are complicated and lack transparency. They added that the process of applying to positions at other universities or at Harvard requires a significant amount of time and can be stressful. Because their positions are mainly geared towards teaching, it can be difficult to complete the amount of research needed to survive the hyper-competitive academic job market, they said.
Moreover, they said their time as non-ladder faculty in the FAS does not give them a leg-up when applying to tenure-track positions at Harvard.
“Letters take time, interviews take time, campus visits take time,” Thompson said. “This is extremely unstable, where folks don't know if they're going to be here until next year until sometimes like March, which makes it really hard to line up something.”

Sandip Nirmel ’21, a Dunster House resident whom classmates remember as a beloved friend and brilliant student, died Thursday after “an extended illness,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students Friday morning.
Nirmel was a Computer Science concentrator with a focus in Mind, Brain, and Behavior. Outside of classes, he served as a case team leader for the Harvard College Consulting Group and as the Vice Chair for the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior.
“Sandip was a deeply valued and loved member of the College and Dunster House communities,” Khurana wrote. “My deepest condolences are with Sandip’s family and loved ones during this time.”
Dunster House Faculty Deans Sean D. Kelly and Cheryl K. Chen wrote in a message to house residents that Nirmel was a “dearly loved” member of the House. He often ate breakfast with blockmates in the dining hall, participated in intramurals, and completed problem sets in Dunster’s halls, they wrote.
“The death of a beloved member of our community is one of the hardest things we can confront. Unfortunately, we have undergone it too many times already in Dunster House this year,” Kelly and Chen wrote. “If there is a saving grace, it is that we have one another for support.”
Kelly and Chen wrote in their message that the House will hold a memorial gathering in the Dunster House Junior Common Room Friday evening with Harvard chaplains and administrators.
