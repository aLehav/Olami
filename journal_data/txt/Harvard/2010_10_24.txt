After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A last-minute goal stripped the Harvard women’s hockey team from an outright win in an exhibition game against McGill Saturday afternoon. The goal, netted by freshman Katia Clement-Heydra, forced the Crimson into an overtime period, after leading the entire third period, 2-1. Ninth-ranked Harvard hosted the Martlets in a preseason exhibition game last season as well, then coming away with a dominant 4-1 win.
But yesterday, McGill struck first, recording a goal with just under seven minutes remaining in the first period.  The score came from senior Cathy Chartrand and remained unanswered until Crimson senior Katharine Chute put one between the pipes 15 minutes into the second period. The goal was the first of a pair for Chute, who notched another score for Harvard less than three minutes later.
The Crimson’s starting goaltender, sophomore Laura Bellamy, was substituted for the third period, replaced by freshman Lauren Joarnt, who played the rest of the game.
Following Clement-Heydra’s goal in the third period, the game was taken into overtime, where both teams failed to score in the allotted five-minute period.
Seven rookies, including Joarnt, made their first appearance in a Harvard uniform. Two of them, Lyndsey Fry and Jackie Young, registered an assist. Sophomore Josephine Pucci assisted on Chute’s first goal as well.
The Crimson will open its regular season at home against Yale on Friday, Oct. 29 at 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard athletes often excel at balancing success on and off the playing field—yet very few do it quite as well as women’s soccer co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh.
On account of such success, Sheeleigh has been selected as one of 10 finalists for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award for collegiate women’s soccer. The award, given to one senior each year, was created to honor student-athletes who “exemplify the four Cs—community, classroom, character, and competition.”
Sheeleigh has certainly excelled at her sport, being named to the All-Ivy first team and National Soccer Coaches Association of America all-region team three times each.
Perhaps even more remarkably, Sheeleigh has also made a difference in local and international communities where she has spent time as a volunteer physical therapy aide in the summer and an intern for the Ministry of Education, helping to tailor programs for high school students in the Marshall Islands during last J-term.
But what really makes Sheeleigh stand out, even among fellow Lowe’s finalists, is the series of obstacles she has overcome to get where she is. As many athletes know, it’s difficult to come back from two serious injuries during a college career. But what’s even more difficult is being diagnosed with cerebral palsy and having no movement in one half of your body.
Yet that’s exactly what happened to Sheeleigh as an infant, and now–thanks to huge amounts of perseverance and seven years of physical therapy–she is one of the nation’s most elite, and well-rounded, collegiate women’s soccer players.

Ballots close November 14th.

They're small. They don't make noise. They don't need to be fed. You can leave them unattended for weeks and they (probably) won't die. And your tutor likely won't care that you're harboring them illicitly in your room.
So while they won't cuddle with you at night, bioluminescent dinoflagellates can make pretty convenient pets.
These single-celled organisms were handed out free during the Harvard Museum of Natural History's "Night at the Museum," hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Biological Sciences Society on Friday night.
Why bioluminescent dinoflagellates? "They're extremely fascinating, it's close to Halloween, and they  demonstrate key biological phenomena," said HUBSS President S. John Liu '11. They proved popular, as the 60 available 50 mL flasks of dinoflagellates  were handed out within the first five minutes of the event.
The dinoflagellates grow in seawater and are photosynthetic, so if kept in direct sunlight they could theoretically live and reproduce forever—and according to Liu, they should live "a couple of months, no problem."
Perhaps the coolest feature of the dinoflagellates is the "bioluminescent" part: they're mechanically responsive, so if you shake them while in a dark room you can see them start to glow a greenish color. But don't overdo it—"If you shake them too much, they'll stop glowing," said Liu.
The organizers were kind enough to give us the demonstration flask at the end of the night. We obviously won't be able to name all of our new pets, but we're going to see how long we can keep them growing—and glowing.

As part of our series on final clubs, we decided to get out on the street and find out what people around here actually think about the clubs. We asked the same set of questions to men, women, students, and visitors alike (including, it seems, a Final Club member who decided to have a little fun with his accent). Check out the video to see what they had to say.

In this series, we bring you creative and delicious recipes that can be made in 10 minutes and less, all within the constraints of Harvard’s dining halls. Have a recipe you'd like to share? E-mail us at flyby@thecrimson.com.
Today we have a delicious entrée and dessert: a greek chicken wrap and a delectable brown sugar pear crisp. The wrap is perfect for both lunch or dinner and can be made using ingredients available at both meals. The pear crisp is best enjoyed after dinner, as the finishing touch to a long day.
GREEK CHICKEN WRAP
Ingredients:
1 open pita or tortilla
Honey-mustard dressing
1 grilled chicken breast
3-4 slices of tomato
A few leaves of lettuce
Crumbled feta
A spoonful of raisins (optional)
Olives, pitted (optional)
Directions: Order a grilled chicken breast from the grill. Slice the chicken into strips, place aside. Put the pita or tortilla on a plate. Drizzle honey-mustard dressing on the pita, adding enough to taste. Now add the chicken, tomato slices, lettuce, and feta to the wrap. If you like, add raisins (delicious!) or olives as well. Fold over the sides of the pita and there you have it—your own delicious wrap.
BROWN SUGAR PEAR CRISP
Ingredients:
Hemp-plus granola
Cracklin’ Oat Bran
Honey
1 pear, sliced into ½ inch strips
Brown-sugar
Whipped cream
Directions: In a small bowl, add hemp-plus granola and a small amount of Cracklin’ Oat Bran. Use your hands to crumble the Cracklin’ Oat Bran into pieces about the size of the granola. You’ll need to eyeball the amount of cereal, but a good estimate is to make sure that it covers the bottom of the bowl but does not fill the bowl all the way to the rim. Add honey (usually found at the tea station) to the cereal, mixing continuously with a spoon until the cereals stick together and the mixture appears crust-like. Your crust is done.
Place the sliced pears in a larger bowl. Sprinkle the pears with brown sugar (about two spoonfuls) and then put the bowl in the microwave. Warm the pears for 40 seconds. If the brown sugar still needs to melt, warm for another 20 seconds.
Remove the pears from the microwave and pour them and the brown-sugar liquid into the other bowl. Top with a generous helping of whipped cream (often found in the refrigerator with the soymilk) and enjoy!
