After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to create a coordinated university-wide calendar, Interim President Derek C. Bok in 2007 approved a new month-long break between semesters at the College, known colloquially as J-Term and officially as Winter Break. This January marks the first time in recent history that, from Jan. 4 through Jan. 22, students will no longer be hunkering down in library carrels preparing for final exams. Instead, undergraduates will be pursuing self-directed activities on campus or will be required to vacate the premises. Unfortunately, that choice, which should rest with students, instead depends largely on the whims of a committee set up to grant approval to those interested in staying.The committee will be comprised of Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer alongside representatives from the Freshman Dean’s Office, Athletics Department, the Office of Student Life, the Facilities Maintenance Office, and three students—two members of the Undergraduate Council and one Peer Advising Fellow. We are pleased to see the College incorporating student input in the committee decision process. However, students should have also had greater say in actually outlining the requirements and the evaluative standards by which students will be allowed to stay. We also commend the College for making the Office of International Programs, Office of Career Services, Office of the Arts, Center for Public Interest Careers, and Phillip Brooks House Association available to help students find internships, travel-abroad opportunities and other activities.Yet the proposed system of selectively excluding some students from housing during J-Term is misguided at best and dishonest at worst. The university’s current approach to J-Term housing seems overly and unnecessarily restrictive. Current guidelines suggest that only thesis writers with a compelling research need, students working in labs, international students, and members of 19 varsity sports teams have been categorized as groups likely guaranteed to be approved. This narrow categorization leaves out many other students who may have a strong reason for requiring housing. For example, those participating in community-service programs, those constrained by financial difficulty, and those participating in performing-arts groups—to name a few—seemingly have far less assurance of receiving housing.The committee should look beyond categories so narrowly defined and provide all students with the opportunity to stay on campus and be productive. An obvious start would be to allow all thesis writers—with or without a compelling research need—to stay on campus in order to write and research without the distractions that forcing them to be at home may entail. The College should generally take a more accommodating stance in their review of submitted applications and provide students with more options. We agree that it is important that students have a reason to stay on campus; however, we wish to see this requirement be more broadly defined.And while the limits on J-Term housing have been largely billed as a necessity of budget restrictions, similar to other cuts undertaken recently by the university, we sense that the primary reason for limiting housing during January actually stems from a very different set of concerns—namely, fear in the administration that students will misbehave without highly structured activities to occupy their time and without a full residential staff to monitor them. In April, Dean of Students Evelynn M. Hammonds said that after the decision was made not to provide January programming, administrators did not want idle students to remain on campus.The marginal cost of keeping additional students beyond the current upper limit of 1,000 would not actually be very high. Especially if, for example, the College is already willing to heat the suite of a senior thesis writer doing research, while barring his roommate who would be writing a thesis but not doing research on campus. And while we question claims that Annenberg—the only dining hall that will be open—can only accommodate 1,000 students, if this is truly prohibitive, then the College should offer the possibility for students to remain without a meal plan to those willing to do so.While concerns about the excessive partying and safety of an idling undergraduate population may be a valid reason for limiting housing to those “with a recognized and pre-approved need to be on campus,” as Hammonds stated in her recent e-mail, the College should still be more open about its motivations and when framing these decisions. If, as it seems, that costs are not the real issue, then every student with a good plan for doing something productive on campus during January should be allowed to stay on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During my two-month internship in India this summer, I was curious to see how Indians viewed America. Had the aftermath of the Bush administration left them with a negative view of our country, as it had for most of the world? Or had the presidency of Barack Obama inspired them to respect our country? To my surprise, I found that India—a country in the midst of a sweeping economic and social transformation—has a much more favorable impression of the United States than I had expected.
When many Indians I talked to initially think of the United States, they think of the American president. Their support in this regard makes sense. From the time of President Kennedy, an ardent defender of India in its conflicts with Pakistan and China, American leaders have generally backed India in its political and economic activities. This trend continued even with President Bush, whose strong support of the country’s nuclear-energy deal and foreign-policy positions made India one of the few countries in which he was well-received.
Indeed, the Indians I met who were old enough to remember President Kennedy spoke of him fondly and frequently commented on “how good a man” President Bush was. That positive opinion extends to the nation as a whole: A 2008 Pew Research Survey found that 66 percent of Indians hold a favorable view of the United States, a statistic significantly higher than in almost any other country, including Japan (50 percent), Spain (33 percent), and Turkey (12 percent). Indians admire American leaders that reach out to them and treat them as equal partners, as President Kennedy did when he remarked that Indian independence leaders shared “the great aspirations of people all over the world” or President Bush did when he suggested joint military training and missions.
Political leaders might be the American faces that Indians see on the news, but just as important is the corporate face that they see in their business interactions with the United States. A prime example of this is the growing attraction of Indian consumers to American supermarkets. Consumers are now being introduced to stores where they can purchase a wide variety of groceries; for those Indians who still purchase food daily from street vendors, the cleanliness and organization of large grocery operations is extremely appealing. As a few American stores start making inroads in the Indian economy, employing Indians and selling cheaper goods to Indians, they are received enthusiastically by much of the country’s growing consumer class. America’s dramatic industrial progress is still rare in most of the world and is often still its most defining characteristic in the arena of global opinion.
Finally, and most refreshingly to an American worried about the country’s place in an ever-changing world, most Indians I met admire our country’s egalitarianism and diversity. A friend of mine one day asked me during a political conversation if Barack Obama was actually the son of a Muslim. When I responded affirmatively, he remarked, “Now that type of thing only happens in America.” Though Indians of diverse religious beliefs are widely represented in India’s governing structures, the general population’s interactions are often severely restricted by religion. One can work with Hindus for weeks on end without working with a Muslim, and vice versa. Similarly, socioeconomic mobility, especially in the social world, is still significantly limited. The idea of something as egalitarian as public golf courses was fascinating to the populace of Mumbai, a city that has only three golf courses, all of which are extremely exclusive and pervaded with colonial British influence. 
Indian views of America are not uniformly positive, of course. Many Indians are skeptical of American prodding on issues such as climate change and relations with Pakistan. They also fault the American market for the crash that brought down the global economy with it. Yet, as a whole, the people admire and respect a country that, more often than not, treats them as an equal partner, introduces new business models and economic ideas to their country, and sets a model for tolerance and diversity. As we work to rebuild our bonds with the rest of the world, these lessons are worth keeping in mind.

As a senior looking back on my Camp Harvard experience, I find it nearly impossible to remember the flurry of activities that took place during freshman week, and much more so the information we were supposed to have learned from each planned event. However, three years later, “Sex Signals,” a freshman week rite of passage, still stands apart from everything else that filled the pages of the Calendar of Opening Days. After attending the performance this week, I can report few changes have been made over the years. 
Sex Signals still stands out because of the gravity of its subject matter as well as the importance of the message all the newly minted freshmen take back to their dorms after the event. In both categories, unfortunately, the program falls short. Sex Signals points incoming freshmen in the wrong direction by how casually it treats both sexual activity and rape, by the amount of sex it implies is occurring on campus, and by failing to adequately address personal responsibility to make smart choices.
Rape isn’t funny. Twenty to 25 percent of women will be raped or will have an attempt to rape them made during their college years. Eighty-four Harvard students utilized the Harvard Office of Sexual Prevention and Response after being raped, sexually assaulted, or experiencing relationship violence in the 2007-2008 academic year. The statistics are staggering and the problem heartbreaking. Sex Signals trivializes this issue by treating it like a joke. 
Nearly two-thirds of the program is run like a Harvard improvisation show, with skits exploring societal stereotypes about men and women designed to get a laugh out of the excited crowd. With lines like, “He who hesitates masturbates,” “I’m so manly I don’t just have a dick, I am one,” and “Sometimes hot girls in their underwear make my pants a little tight,” the show feels more like a live version of Knocked Up than a program designed to decrease sexual assault. In fact, making light of this serious subject matter in the university-sponsored event actually seemed to encourage the students to laugh at attitudes that are present during sexual assault. When one of the actors mimicked a male stereotype about sex yelling, “We see what we want and we go get it! Yeah?,” a male freshman in the crowd yelled back, “Fuck yeah!” to cheers and laughs throughout the audience. Does dialogue like this truly discourage rape?
During the last third of the show, the issue of sexual assault is addressed directly, yet still unsatisfactorily. An ambiguous scene is described where drunken sexual intercourse takes place. At the end of the scene, the freshman audience is asked whether the man clearly raped the woman. A few hands go up around the room. The audience is then asked whether the man clearly did not rape the woman. Again, a few hands go up around the room. When the audience is asked if it is unclear whether rape occurred in this vague scene, the vast majority of students in the room put their hands up. The actors then went on to explain why a room full of Harvard students was wrong and what had occurred was clearly rape. While the performers certainly emphasized the necessity of unambiguous consent for any sexual activity, they did little to address the issue of making intelligent decisions to reduce the likelihood of sexual assault. There was no talk of the necessity of taking responsibility by setting clear sexual boundaries with the person you’re with so that lines don’t get blurred in the heat of the moment. The importance of getting clear consent for sexual activity is paramount, yet the obligation to make smart choices in being clear about boundaries and not putting oneself in a position where rape is likely to occur is equally crucial to prevention. This discussion was largely absent from Sex Signals.
At one point during the performance, incoming freshmen were asked to raise their hands if they had ever been naked with a person without having sex. To freshmen arriving on campus who are not sexually active, the room full of raised hands (combined with the free condoms in every dorm) might give the impression that everyone on campus is having sex. The cavalier attitude expressed by the university toward sexual activity could be just enough to nudge some freshmen into sexual activity. During my first year, the Freshman Dean’s Office hosted an event called, “Hooking Up: Hot Hints For Making Your Harvard (Or Future) Sex Life Great” billed as “An All-Out Guide to Sex and Sexuality” with “sexxxxxy suggestions” to be given.) After all the sex talk, one weak disclaimer was given by a Sex Signals actress asking, “Are there people in the world choosing not to have sex?” However, after sitting through Sex Signals, most freshmen would likely be shocked to hear that a majority of Harvard students report either not having sex at all while at the College or having it with only one partner.
Ultimately, Sex Signals squanders the opportunity that the College has to begin a frank, informed discussion about how serious the issue of sexual assault is and what we can do to prevent it. It leaves students with jokes about sex and the attitudes that fuel rape as well as the impression that much more sex is happening at the College than truly is. At the end of the performance, the actors emphasize that something “magical” can happen when the lessons of the show are followed. They then proceed to jokingly discuss different sexual activities that the magic might entail. What a shame: Sexual assault is no laughing matter, especially at a university-sponsored rape prevention program.

For the first time since Obama came onto the national stage, I’ve heard disgruntled chatter from the voting bloc he takes most for granted: young progressives. We were the backbone and energy of his campaign, and our inboxes are still flooded weekly with calls for volunteers and donations. But as health- care reform stalls and sours, many of us are losing confidence. And if I were Obama, I’d be worried about this more than anything. Because the health-care battle is about more than health care: It’s about whether young Americans will regain faith in the American political system or wake up from the Obama dream and retreat toward complacency and disillusionment.
Like the many millions who campaigned for Obama and celebrated his victory, I was confident going into the summer that significant health-care reform would pass and would define his first year in office, if not his presidency. After all, the time was ripe: President Obama had campaigned hard on health-care reform and now had a mandate. The public seemed to understand that reform was not just a matter of extending care to the growing millions of Americans without it, but also a matter of harnessing out-of-control costs. Despite the best efforts of Fox News, a New York Times/CBS poll in June revealed not only that a large majority of Americans were in favor of fundamentally changing or rebuilding our health-care system, but also that 72 percent of Americans supported a government-sponsored health-care plan to compete with private insurers. 
How things have changed. Somewhere along the line we’ve reached a scenario of red-faced middle-aged men screaming and spitting at their senators about Hitler and death panels. Now we’ve heard that a public option, once seen as a central, if not critical, piece of true health-care reform, might be “off the table,” replaced by non-profit cooperatives that studies have shown will not effectively lower insurance costs, supposedly their biggest selling point. In fact, the public option has been sidelined by many as a far-left fixation—as socialized medicine—rather than what it actually is: an option, one that would compete with and keep in check insurance companies that care about our health about as much as the inventors of fried dough. The Democratic Party seems disorganized and fragmented. And, perhaps most surprising, Obama and his administration, the masters of messaging, seem to be losing the communications battle and, with it, the confidence of the American people. 
Despite all of this, the most recent Rasmussen poll shows 57 percent of Americans oppose a reform bill that doesn’t include government-run insurance somewhere. And three out of four Americans polled in late August still support a choice between government-run health care and private coverage. It begs the question: If Obama can’t take advantage of such a huge mandate and historical moment, what faith should we have in the rest of his presidency?
So much can be written about this defining moment in American politics, and so much has been, from the increasingly complacent mainstream media to the insurance industry’s frenzied advertising and lobbying against reform. But from the perspective of a young progressive and Obama campaigner, my advice to Obama is this: Don’t bend over backward compromising with people who want as little change as possible. Doing so will not only water down meaningful health-care reform, but it will also prove that there is no “meaningful” change in politics. The power of “Yes we can!” will fade away, and millions of Obama recruits to the political process will conclude that it’s “business as usual” again.
What we need right now, President Obama, is a leader, not a lawyer. Do what’s right for America because, in this case at least, doing what’s right and doing what will get you re-elected are the same.

In an era of shrinking University finances and recession-related budget cuts, one student organization—the Leadership Institute at Harvard College—just received a $50,000 cash infusion.The grant from the Flora Family Foundation, which supports public service initiatives, will be given to the student group in two yearly installments of $25,000. The money will be used to expand the Leadership Institute’s existing programs as well as develop new curriculum. The student-run Institute—started in 2004-2005—seeks to provide concrete leadership training to supplement academic education for students. The organization holds skill-building workshops, hosts guest speakers, stages discussion forums among student organization leaders, and runs a program to mentor middle school students.John W. Coleman, a member of the Institute’s board of advisers, said he hopes the funding will help “kickstart the institutionalization of the Leadership Institute at the College.”The Institute was originally formed to address what its founders perceived as a void in formal leadership training at the College.“There was no real dedicated office to leadership,” said Ben L. Brinkopf ’11, president of the Institute. “There was no leadership institute at the undergrad level.”Now, Coleman said, the grant will allow the organization the opportunity to grow.“At a time when financial resources are tight around the University, this gives the Leadership Institute the confidence to move forward with a lot of different initiatives that they were hoping to execute,” he said.The Leadership Institute applied for the grant after being nominated by one of the council members at the Flora Family Foundation, which often supports small organizations seeking to expand.“What I believe they saw in this situation was an organization that has the potential to expand to affect Harvard, the greater United States, and the world,” said Jonathan P. Doochin ’04-’05, the chair of the Institute’s board of advisers.Brinkopf also said that he believes leadership training “cannot be compromised,” especially in these “tough times.”“Leadership is more critical now than ever,” Doochin said, pointing out that faulty leadership was a potential factor in the current financial crisis. —Staff writer Michelle L.

A female graduate student was allegedly attacked while walking on Putnam Avenue at approximately 9:05 p.m. Sunday, according to a community advisory e-mail issued Monday evening by the Harvard University Police Department.The attack was allegedly part of an unarmed robbery.According to the advisory, an unidentified male approached the student from behind while she was walking towards Peabody Terrace, grabbed her iPhone out of her hand and fled the area.The student was not injured in the robbery, the advisory said. The Cambridge Police Department is investigating the incident because it did not occur on Harvard University property.HUPD sent a community advisory e-mail—the first of its kind since April—on Monday evening.The department sends advisories directly to students, faculty, and staff at Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as well as to the deans of the University’s other schools and the Director of News and Public Affairs for the University. They also ask representatives to post the advisories in conspicuous locations on campus in addition to electronically forwarding them widely to students, faculty, and staff.Prior to Monday’s notice, the last advisory was sent out on April 23, detailing an armed robbery that had occurred on Flagg Street and Putnam Avenue.Since 2007, 13 such community advisories have been issued by the police department.CPD public information officials could not be reached for comment yesterday evening.—Staff writer Marianna N.

A 22-member committee that University President Drew G. Faust charged with creating additional social spaces on campus over a year ago announced the first of its plans yesterday: a collection of chairs and tables to be sprinkled across Harvard Yard and the Quad.
But these are no ordinary pieces of lawn furniture. The 476 chairs and 82 tables come in a variety of bright shades and are modeled after those found in the Jardin du Luxembourg of Paris so as to not detract from the aesthetic appeal of Harvard’s campus.
Starting tomorrow and lasting until the end of October, when it may prove difficult to congregate outside given Cambridge’s inclement weather, the chairs and tables will be placed near the Science Center, Memorial Hall, the Old Yard, Lehman Hall, and Boylston Hall. Harvard University Dining Services will set up Crimson Cash-friendly food stands featuring organic offerings and Mediterranean foods at many of the new seating areas.
“Lots of people would like Harvard Yard to be more of a place to kind of rest, so to speak,” said Mohsen Mostafavi, Dean of the Graduate School of Design and co-chair of the Common Spaces Steering Committee. “There’s a lot of movement, and people were keen to find ways to basically slow down the traffic.”
Placing the low-cost chairs outside in the Yard amidst the hustle and bustle of students, faculty, and staff—as well as hordes of tourists sporting fanny packs—would be an experiment to provide “new forms of gathering spaces,” said Mostafavi.
The new gathering spaces will also serve as a makeshift performance space for student and affiliate groups, as per a recommendation included in the Arts Task Force Report released last December. Tomorrow will feature a lunchtime dance performance by cast members of the American Repertory Theater’s production of the Off-Broadway disco musical, “The Donkey Show.”
Though the committee may create indoor social space in the future, Mostafavi said that it will use feedback from the two-month experiment in the fall in making further recommendations.
“We have spaces that we can make into engaging interactive social places” said Lizabeth Cohen, chair of the History Department who also co-chairs the committee. 
“This project is a model of what may happen on a larger scale: making better use of what we already have,” she added.
Since the committee’s creation last April, it has been soliciting input from the Harvard community about ways the Cambridge campus could be improved. Citing the need for “additional spaces for cultural, recreational, and social activities,” 
Faust had instructed the committee to plan beyond campus construction projects at the time, such as the Lamont Library Café and the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub.
Already, student dance and music groups have expressed interest in performing in the newly created spaces. Executive board member of the Harvard Ballroom dance team Marco F. Perez-Moreno ’11 said that he and his teammates are thinking of putting on a lunchtime event.
Perez-Moreno called the program a “great opportunity” for student groups on campus and added that he hoped it will bring more attention to the arts on campus.
But some students remained skeptical of the new initiative.
“I respect the sentiment, but I think it’s bullshit,” said Adams resident Ashley “Aja” Jovanovski ’10.
 “First of all, it’s going to be freezing in no time, and secondly, who stops in the middle of the Yard to sit?” she added.
Her friend, Catherine P. Humphreville ’10, also an Adams resident, added that she wouldn’t want to sit with tourists gawking at her.

The Bureau of Study Counsel will raise hourly tutoring rates starting today from the $4 fee students had to pay last year in an effort to cut costs as the College grapples with a mandate to slash budgets.
The fee for a student’s first 10 hours of tutoring in a particular course will rise to $7, and for hours after that, students will have to pay an unsubsidized rate of $14—a $10 hike from the hourly rate before. 
Last year, more than 75 percent of requests resulted in 10 or fewer hours of tutoring, according to Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira.
The increase in rates was part of the College’s cost-cutting efforts in response to the budget crisis, but Barreira said they had been examining the rates for the last three years.
The charge for students to get tutoring has remained unchanged since 1998, whereas salaries for student tutors last increased in February 2008, according to Barreira.
“The starting point was that the peer tutoring program is very effective and utilized by a lot of students,” Barreira said. “We didn’t want to see it compromised.”
The Financial Aid Office will still assist eligible students with the tutoring cost, both at the $7 rate for the first 10 hours and at the $14 rate thereafter.
The BSC does not expect the number of tutoring requests to decrease, in part due to the reimbursements from the Financial Aid Office. 
BSC Director Abigail Lipson referred requests for comment to Barreira.
Peer tutors Diane J. Choi ’10 and Alexander E. H. McNaughton ’11 said the price increase was unfortunate because it would dissuade students from seeking assistance.
“I always thought it was wonderful that Harvard subsidized the service so much,” Choi said. “It decreased the stigma of having to get tutoring, because I think it’s difficult for a lot of Harvard students to admit that they need help, especially from their peers.”
At the end of fall semester, Barreira plans on comparing this year’s numbers to last year’s to see if the increase in cost has affected the number of students who request tutoring. 
Last year, 965 students were tutored through the BSC, according to Barreira.
“If we thought that we had created a barrier to accessing peer tutoring, we would obviously talk about it at the College,” Barreira said.

Louis Byington “By” Barnes, a longtime organizational behavior professor at Harvard Business School, died Aug. 22 at a hospital in Bangor, Maine, from complications from kidney failure. He was 81.
Family members and former colleagues and students remembered Barnes as a good listener who charmed many of the people he met.
“He definitely gave me the emotional support I never expected to get at business school,” said Rebecca S. Leung, a former student of Barnes who named him the god-grandfather for her two children.
One of Harvard Business School’s first experts in using the case method, Barnes taught the human side of business—organizational behavior—at Harvard as a tenured professor from 1968 until he retired in 1998. Before receiving tenure, he had served as a research associate at HBS since 1956 and spent much of that time as a teaching fellow.
Barnes was born on August 6, 1928, in St. Paul, Minn., and grew up there as the middle child of three boys. After graduating from Phillips Academy, Andover, he went on to Amherst to study English and rose to become president of his class and captain of the varsity football team.
Barnes then received his MBA and doctorate in business administration in 1952 and 1958 from HBS before becoming a full professor in 1968.
Though Barnes spent over half of his life at Harvard, he never took himself too seriously, according to his widow and former student, Julie C. Wang, 62, who used to head her own medical public relations firm.
“Most women who knew him felt as though they were being heard and listened to for the first time in their lives,” Wang said of Barnes, who married three times.
Barnes served as the second president of the Iran Center for Management Studies (ICMS)—a Harvard-affiliated business school in Tehran, where HBS professors and Iranian Harvard graduates taught both Iranian and foreign businessmen in an 11-month program—from 1975 to 1977. He also taught there, charming both the students and professors—listening so intently that he made it seem “as though you were the only person in the world that mattered at the time,” said Kasra Ferdows, a Georgetown Business School professor who taught at ICMS.
Barnes’ experience in Iran left a lasting impression on him. When Ferdows visited Barnes in Cambridge a little over a decade after Barnes’ tenure in Iran, he recalled seeing about 40 photos of ICMS professors, staff, and students in Barnes’ office.
Habib Ladjevardi, who founded ICMS in 1972, said that he still recalls one lesson from Barnes’ lectures, which he came to follow himself: visiting an employee in his or her own work environment, rather than calling an employee to one’s office.
“First they’re flattered...secondly, you get an idea of his work situation,” said Ladjevardi, who served as ICMS’ vice president from 1972 until it closed in 1978, on the eve of the Islamic Revolution. “Sometimes a guy turns out to be a different person than he was in my office.”
Barnes was also an avid Democrat. He celebrated Obama’s election in 2008 with champagne in a nursing home with Wang.
Though he already began dialysis two and a half years ago, he made phone calls on behalf of Democrats for the last five years of his life—including for Obama’s general election campaign.
Barnes, who grew up near Minnesota’s Gull Lake, spent the final years of his life in his Brooklin, Maine home overlooking Bar Harbor.
He listened almost entirely to classical music—especially Brahms’ symphonies. Barnes also loved to read mystery novels and hike through the Swiss Alps, according to Wang.
A professional cellist will perform selections from Bach’s cello suites at his memorial service in Maine on Saturday, where attendees will later toast him with chocolate shakes—“his favorite drink,” Wang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The words of literary critic Barbara E. Johnson often adhered to the memory in the way that the works she studied remained indelible after her own analysis.The late professor of law and psychiatry in society at Harvard knew how to both speak with careful hesitation and opinionate with force, yielding a hard-to-forget intelligence and wit, according to Professor of English Werner Sollors.He remembered watching his close friend and colleague respond to a comment made during one of her lectures: “She nodded very strongly, and said, ‘I agree completely with the opposite of what you’re arguing.’”“She was an unbelievably smart close reader with a good amount of whimsy—very hard to replicate the kind of intellectual acumen that went into her quick sayings,” added Sollors, who also teaches in the department of African and African American studies. “She was just a powerhouse.”Johnson passed away on Thursday in her home from cerebellar ataxia, according to her brother Bruce Pollack-Johnson. She was 61.Eight years ago, the acclaimed literary critic and translator had been diagnosed with the rare degenerative condition with effects similar to multiple sclerosis that made it difficult for her to speak and walk. But Johnson—who taught at Harvard for 25 years—continued to advise dissertations and produce scholarly works years after her diagnosis, according to Pollack-Johnson.“Her productivity was incredible...The blessing was that her mind was always as sharp as a tack until the very end. She was telling jokes and making literary references,” Pollack-Johnson said. “It took long to figure out what the joke was, but she was as brilliant as ever.”Former student Lili P. Porten called her dissertation adviser a “truly beloved” woman who was able to adopt that rare fusion of brilliance and kindness.“I have dozens of e-mails from people since her death...she changed their lives,” Porten said. “She would find the insight you didn’t know you had, and that was really wonderful.”Barbara Ellen Johnson was born in Boston, Mass. on October 4, 1947. One of two Presidential Scholars from Massachusetts in 1965, Johnson graduated from Oberlin College four years later and continued her education at Yale, where she received her Ph.D. in French in 1977.The “Yale School”—a group of deconstructionist literary critics and theorists including Johnson’s thesis director, Paul de Man—would serve as a signifcant influence on Johnson’s own criticism.In her 25 years at Harvard, Johnson worked for multiple departments, including the departments of English, comparative literature, women’s studies, and African and African American studies. When she was chair of the latter, Johnson brought in Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr., according to Porten.Johnson’s works include “The Critical Difference” (1980), “A World of Difference” (1987), and “The Wake of Deconstruction” (1994).“She often focuses on a very small detail in a novel that you might have otherwise overlooked,” Sollors said. “She draws so much out of it that the next time you read the novel, you can’t help thinking of Barbara Johnson.”—Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former associate dean of Harvard College for administration and finance John F. Gates resigned this past May to pursue personal ambitions that had been waylaid during his tenure as dean. “All is well with me and my relationship with Harvard,” assured Gates, who had been a key player in the financial planning of the largest school within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “This was, for me, an important transition time.” For almost the past decade, Gates had been working on his Ph.D. at the University of London. In the latter stages of the last academic year, Gates said he realized that “the clock [was] running out” and that he would need “some concentrated time” to devote his full attention to his degree. Gates has also been appointed a Senior Fellow for Global Higher Education at the Jamestown Project, a non-profit think tank based in Washington, D.C. “My expertise in institutional change management and governance stands to help many colleges and universities with their efforts to be self-managing learning organizations and to thrive in this era of uncertainty,” said Gates, a former assistant provost at New York University for three years. “[I]t was a difficult decision to arrive at because I so loved working with student groups,” said Gates, who was involved with the Black Men’s Forum. “After four years as associate dean of the College, Crimson is in my blood, and I will always cherish it.” In 2005, Gates left his position as senior adviser to the president and the provost of the University of Vermont to take the post of associate dean of Harvard College. Gates replaced Georgene B. Herschbach—currently the College’s dean for administration—and assumed responsibility for managing a wide range of administrative sectors, including finance, human resources, information technology, facilities, and operations. Gates’ post, which was especially critical during a time marked by severe financial constraints and substantial budget cuts, has been claimed by assistant dean of the College and director of budgets and finance Patricia B. Harrington, according to an administrator, who requested that they not be named to preserve relations with the University.The individual said that Harrington is now directing the department of administration and finance, which recently reduced its staff from seven people to four. Harrington could not be reached for comment yesterday.—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds e-mailed students earlier today to announce the unveiling of the much delayed application for J-Term housing. You can find it here. The app is pretty short, so you might as well fill it out soon and not play chicken with the Oct. 15 deadline. A couple of things to note after the jump:
1) The application wastes no time making clear that your swipe cards will not work in Houses if you are not approved for J-Term. So if you're hoping to crash with your more J-Term eligible roommate, you'll have to live with the inconvenience of calling them every time you need to get in.
2) The language about allowing thesis writers to stay sounds very cautious, and leaves a lot of wiggle-room for rejection:
If this is to be believed, the designation "absolutely must stay on campus" is only enough to get your application considered.

And 2 + 2 = 5.
But seriously, this makes perfect sense.  Today is Monday, tomorrow is Thursday, Friday is Friday, we have no classes Monday, Tuesday is Tuesday, and Wednesday is Wednesday.
And, non-freshman, you turn in your study card on Thursday, after experiencing all days of the week.  Couldn't be simpler or make more sense.  Let's not hear any complaining...we would hope you have a better conversation starter than that.

All of the rooms in Eliot and Winthrop, among other Houses, have been redone – not with the brand new paint and rugs we desperately want (Why would the College give us that?), but with new sprinkler heads. If set off, these super powerful devices dump 70 to 90 gallons of water per minute on your bedroom, so all of your belongings are guaranteed to be soaked.
According to an e-mail from Eliot Building Manager Francisco Medeiros, “sprinkler heads are VERY SENSITIVE and are easily set off by even a tiny amount of direct pressure.” The sprinkler also goes off when the temperature reaches 130 degrees.
That's all well and good, but the e-mail also mentioned a ban on partitioning suites out of concern that the divisions might block sprinklers from putting out fires in certain portions of a room. Kirkland Building Manager Scott Haywood says office and curtain partitions are generally fine, although preferably they should be flame resistant or flame retardant. Obviously, you’re not allowed to bring in plywood and build a wall in the middle of your common room. If a flood of sprinkler water will easily knock down your partition, you’re probably fine.
The aesthetic of your room, though, maybe not so much...

The new school year’s just started, the budget cutting never stopped.
The College closed its Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response for the month of July, and administrators combined the Office of Residential Life and Office of Student Life and Activities into a single office while downsizing staff. The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, which gives advice to faculty and teaching fellows, is also struggling after a 40 percent budget cut and a halving of its staff.
Students in Cambridge over the summer also faced reduced services, as administrators trimmed hours for the Bureau of Study Counsel and the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
But perhaps most notably, the University announced only a few weeks into the summer a series of long-anticipated layoffs, cutting 275 jobs and offering reduced or changed work hours for roughly 40 others. Half the positions were professional or administrative jobs, and the rest were clerical and technical jobs.
Find out what else you’ve missed in rainy Cambridge over the summer after the jump.
The cuts hit schools across the University, including the Kennedy School, the Business School, and the Law School. The Medical School also eliminated roughly 17 staff positions, and four staff members were given reduced schedules. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which includes the College and is Harvard’s largest school, laid off 77 staffers and cut work hours for 15 others.
All this came after Harvard announced that 531 staff members had participated in the University’s Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program.
Further budget cuts loom at FAS, which is still scrambling to close the $143 million deficit that remains after the cuts. Harvard College Library, which runs the popular Lamont, Cabot Science, and Widener Libraries, cut over 20 staffers and restricted circulation at its Fung Library.
Even though activists, staff, and students had protested loudly after janitorial layoffs last year, subcontracted cleaning jobs continued to see cuts across the University as well. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences reduced work hours for over 100 janitors, a move that drew heated union criticism.
Students and faculty at the Medical School began circulating a petition after administrators cut funding for the already-unglamorous Primary Care Division, and Harvard University Press laid off seven employees and closed its 61-year-old display room in the Holyoke Center due to sagging sales figures.
