After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trickery, profanity, and hard drinking are par for the course when it comes to the cutthroat world of Chicago real estate—at least according to David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Glengarry Glen Ross.” All these shady dealings come together for a night of felonious entertainment in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production, which runs in the Loeb Ex through March 31. Directed by Benjamin A. Silva ’14, the show illustrates the interactions among a group of untrustworthy real estate agents. While abrupt actions and abundant profanity­—combined with solid acting performances—keep the story moving quickly, the lack of nuanced direction makes it difficult to understand the subtleties of the script.
“Glengarry Glen Ross” begins by showcasing a hectic work day for several Chicago real estate agents. With the exception of a waitress who makes a brief appearance toward the beginning of the show, the cast is entirely male. The play is built around a series of vignettes, and each one highlights certain characters and reveals their underlying motives. It is split into two acts: The first shows three one-on-one conversations between swindling real estate agents and their associates; the second depicts the chaos that ensues when their wheeling and dealing blows up in smoke.
The show feels intimate because of the actors’ proximity to the audience, which is mostly due to the small size of the Loeb Ex. Quirky musical transitions are the only pauses in dialogue. This minimalist approach could intensify the unassisted dialogue, but unfortunately, the lack of emphasis on the plot of the show makes conversation between characters drag.
The characters in “Glengarry Glen Ross” are highly emotional, but the script does not offer the actors much in the way of history to give meaning to this emotion. Though their objectives are clearly outlined in their conversations throughout the first half of the show, the reasons behind them are never explored in the script, and this limits the potential growth of the characters over the course of the story.
Though this drawback is built into the original script of the show, as opposed to Silva’s take on it, certain changes in direction could have made the changes more accessible. They deliver their lines rapidly, and while this speaks to the skills of the actors in being able to relay the script so assuredly, it does not leave much room for audience reflection. Better emphasized nonverbal cues and intonations from the actors would have improved the overall understanding of the characters’ intentions and actions. The script is undeniably a challenging one to work with, and Silva should be applauded for his effort. However, by not exploring ways of making the characters real people that the audience can relate to, what could have been a very compelling character study became a blandly comic show.
While their characters may not be developed enough to evoke significant emotional reactions, the seven actors in “Glengarry Glen Ross” do give a compelling performance. Their lines consist of loud, emotional outbursts and dramatic monologues, all of which are powerfully delivered, though a few in particular stand out. Daniel W. Erickson ’14 plays older businessman Shelly Levene, and his animated energy never fades, contributing to a captivating performance. Teis D. Jorgensen ’14, who portrays crooked seller and thief Dave Moss, also gives an exceptionally lively performance. The most poignant lines of the show come from Ricky Roma, played by Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson advertising manager. Conner excellently delivers a provocative monologue in the first act, capturing the air of someone who is a very effective salesman while asking the audience such questions as “What is our life?” and “What are we afraid of?” Its sense of ease and professionalism makes his character by far the most dynamic one.
Effective deliveries are worth little without solid direction, and this is the problem faced by the HRDC’s rendition of “Glengarry Glen Ross.” Though parts of the production work, the show as a whole is lackluster.  Due to directorial choices, the story’s events are not explained in an easily understandable manner. The actors’ performances keep this play from flopping entirely, but at the same time the script’s undeveloped characters and puzzling events left unclarified by the direction keep it from leaving a lasting impression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone knows that libertarians don’t especially like it when the government, er, does stuff. But even the most doctrinaire libertarians generally accept that there are some functions that the state can justifiably perform. Apart from radical anarcho-capitalists like Murray N. Rothbard or David D. Friedman ’65, libertarians are generally comfortable with a state that enforces contracts between consenting parties, provides for the national defense, and, most importantly, stops individuals from violating each others’ rights. Robert Nozick, the late, great libertarian Harvard political philosopher, argued that only a minimal “night-watchman state” is justifiable. Among this state’s most important duties, he wrote in “Anarchy, State, and Utopia,” was “protecting all its citizens against violence, theft, and fraud.”
No one would mistake Florida for a night-watchman state, but on Feb. 26, it failed to fulfill that basic duty that Nozick identified. One of its citizens, Trayvon Martin, was pursued and fatally shot by another private citizen, George Zimmerman, and, because the police agree with Zimmerman’s claim of self-defense, the killer was not arrested. As has been widely noted, this outcome likely has something to do with Florida’s extremely expansive “Stand Your Ground” law, under which one is allowed to use deadly force if they feel threatened even when they could have peacefully retreated instead.
There is some dispute over whether the Stand Your Ground statute, as written, actually renders Zimmerman criminally faultless. By many accounts, he was actually chasing Martin, and the law requires a “reasonable” fear on Zimmerman’s part of injury, but such concern appears, under the circumstances, to be paranoid rather than prudent. But in practice, laws like Stand Your Ground deter prosecutors from pursuing murderers like Zimmerman for fear that they can mount a successful case or that a trial judge will dismiss it before it even goes before a jury.
In case after case, killers have successfully cited self-defense to avoid prosecution, to a point where “justifiable homicides” have nearly tripled in Florida in recent years. In the early 2000s, the state averaged about 34 per year. In 2009, there were 105. The phenomenon gets even more disturbing when one considers that young black men are far more likely to be perceived as aggressors and thus become targets of such “justifiable” killings.
If we should demand the state do anything, we should demand it protect us from murder, or at least prosecute those who murder their fellow citizens. All but the most extreme libertarians should agree to that much. So is the libertarian movement rallying against Stand Your Ground laws? Well, no. In fact, Florida’s law was generated from a template law produced by the American Legislative Exchange Council, which describes itself as a “nonpartisan membership association for conservative state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty.”  ALEC has been behind all manner of conservative/libertarian legislative endeavors, from tax limits, privatization efforts and anti-union laws to school vouchers. And it’s funded by the First Siblings of the libertarian movement, Charles G. and David H. Koch, who bankroll many, if not most, major libertarian organizations, not to mention much of the Tea Party movement.
I don’t mean to paint with too broad a brush here. A younger generation of libertarians, including smart writers like Timothy B. Lee and M. Julian Sanchez, has been trying hard to push the movement to take rights violations like the state’s failure to prosecute Zimmerman more seriously. The libertarian investigative journalist Randy Balko has done more than nearly anyone to shine a light on police abuses, such as excessive SWAT raids and faked forensic science, which disproportionately hurt minorities.
But as an institutional whole, libertarianism has long been more concerned with the rights of rich people to not be taxed than the rights of the Trayvon Martins of the world to stay breathing. Indeed, there’s some irony that the Justice Department has begun weighing hate crimes charges against Zimmerman just as the Supreme Court, this week, began weighing arguments that the health care mandate is an unconscionable federal power grab. It would be hard for the Court to accept the mandate, libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin wrote, without providing a “rationale for virtually unlimited federal power.”
But the federal government’s intervention on Martin’s behalf, an action which by its very nature usurps the traditional law enforcement duties of the state of Florida, should make libertarians wonder whether their monomaniacal focus on reducing federal power, and government power generally, makes any sense. An overzealous Congress did not menace Trayvon Martin. A private individual, and an overly passive local police force, did. Liberty is not something we have until the government takes it away. It is something anyone can take away, and government is often the only thing protecting it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, in an unexpected move, President Obama picked Jim Yong Kim, the current president of Dartmouth University, to be the next leader of the World Bank. Traditionally, the United States selects the head of the World Bank, and Europe selects that of the International Monetary Fund. Thus, despite the presence of at least one other nominee, it is likely that Dr. Kim will fill the post.
We believe that Dr. Kim is a qualified, experienced candidate who will bring strong leadership and a unique vision to the World Bank. Perhaps more importantly, we hope that he uses these attributes to address the often-problematic relationship between the Bank, the United States, and developing countries, and implement much-needed reforms at the institution.
Since its inception during World War II, the World Bank has been a critically important institution for extending financial assistance to troubled countries. The organization describes poverty reduction as the primary goal of its work, and a laudable one it is. However, the methods it uses to attain this objective have come under increasing criticism in recent years. In certain cases, the World Bank attaches conditions to the financial assistance it provides, encouraging debtor nations to adopt policies it deems conducive to economic development.
While practices such as fiscal responsibility and free trade undoubtedly contribute to economic growth, the World Bank should recognize that a single set of solutions cannot be applied to the vast multitude of problems that developing countries face. To provide just one example of how this sponsorship can backfire, the World Bank recently championed utility privatization in Ghana, despite findings by the United Nations that such measures actually increase poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Bank should take heed of the fact that a one-size-fits-all approach is clearly not appropriate to the complex issues afflicting the developing world, and be less aggressive in its support for liberal economic policies.
Clearly, there is room for improvement at the World Bank, and Dr. Kim is uniquely positioned to make the most of it. Public health is a key area of World Bank involvement, and as a medical doctor, Dr. Kim will bring an important and unprecedented focus to the issue. He previously spearheaded an impressive push to provide HIV treatment at the World Health Organization. In addition, his academic, as opposed to political, background will prove refreshing at the organization; he is less likely to be influenced by ideology than his predecessors, many of whom were business executives with extensive political ties. We hope that Dr. Kim will let practicality, rather than the desire to promote certain policies, guide his actions.
In the future, we would like to see the World Bank led by someone from a developing country. American hegemony in this respect is one of the main complaints directed at the institution from developing countries. However, nationality is a far less important qualification than credentials, and Dr. Kim’s past work demonstrates that he will prove a capable, and perhaps exemplary, president of the institution. We wish him well, and hope he has better luck eradicating world poverty than he did fighting cocaine use at Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the first day back from spring break, I woke up early and headed over to Annenberg. After grabbing half a grapefruit, I sat down to enjoy my food. The two kids sitting to my left were talking about summer plans. One had a paid consulting job. I am told this is very prestigious and very lucrative. So I sat silently in the freshman dining hall, pretending to enjoy my grapefruit and lamenting my lack of summer plans. Consulting! Imagine how much prestige I would garner, and how many grapefruits I could buy, if I spent a summer as a paid consultant.
Here at Harvard, everyone seems to act like a successful forty-year-old, taking classes simply as a hobby. A girl in my entryway has already published a book. I am told that internet companies are created by Harvard students, often with a little help from friends named Eduardo and Justin Timberlake. And a friend of mine trades stocks very successfully, and is now running for political office. For those interested in a generous loan, contact me and I will be glad to put you in touch with this eager benefactor. 
 Harvard seems to be all about moving into the upper echelons of the adult world. Most people here seem to have things worked out. They already have career paths and ideas of how to achieve their goals. Many have had their summers planned for months, and those that don’t are filling out applications at this very moment. Harvard is a place of hard work and gentlemanliness. But despite my best efforts, I slip up every once in a while and act in a manner unbecoming to a stately, professional, paid consultant.
Last Friday, I went with a couple of friends to another school in Boston, which may or may not have been BU. The two were let into a small, quiet, and completely sober gathering. Unfortunately, the gentleman at the door was not as gracious to me. I then went around the back and snuck in through a window. This type of behavior would be discouraged at Harvard not because most parties are held on the fourth floor (of Mather) but because successful forty-year-old people don’t sneak through windows. They buy off the doorman. 
 You see, climbing through a window is not a gentlemanly thing to do. Harvard is an incredible place full of all things gentleman—social clubs, newspapers, monocles, and fathers in positions of power. Some people wear final club ties to class. Others spend entire days doing nothing but reading The Crimson while sipping tea and coughing quietly. And some pass their time lecturing to dozens or hundreds of students, wearing tweed jackets and sophisticatedly gesticulating with thin pieces of chalk. 
Of course, Harvard frowns upon unrefined, ungentlemanly activities. It is an institution which only with great reluctance condones nude streaking in the middle of campus, particularly around finals time. Harvard has its private police force shut down snowball fights. The administration closes the gates of Harvard Yard to outside protestors. It even ropes off grassy, protest-free areas of the Yard to prevent the occasional deviation from well-traveled paths to success and professionalism. 
 All of which leads me to my point: Harvard needs to loosen its final club tie just a little bit. We, as the collective student body, should try to have a little fun and discover firsthand the exact extent of this esteemed institution’s rules. So please take an hour or two and do something childish. Stir up some trouble. Try to sneak into a dining hall or walk into class dressed as a janitor. Act as a substitute teacher for a day. Write a strongly worded letter to the administration for no apparent reason. Try climbing through a window or two. 
Just don’t ask me to join in the fun. I’m too busy working on my summer applications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, Bakhtiyar Hajiyev will spend his 30th birthday in one of Azerbaijan’s most notorious prisons. The Kennedy  School alum has been named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and a political prisoner by Human Rights Watch. He likely won’t be freed for another year.
Why isn’t Harvard doing more to help?
When Bakhtiyar Hajiyev entered the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2007, he had already earned a BA in applied mathematics and economic cybernetics, and a master’s in information technology from top Azerbaijan universities. He had addressed the UN General Assembly as the official Youth Representative for Azerbaijan, and led a team of Azeri youth to the International Junior Science Olympiad.
At Harvard, he excelled in the sorts of courses you’d expect from a future public servant, ranging from leadership development to economics and policy analysis. He interned at the National Democratic Institute and worked as a consultant at the World Bank, both in Washington. When he graduated from Harvard in 2009 with a master’s degree in public policy, he had the type of resume that glistens to the blue-chip consultants regularly recruiting on campus.
But Bakhtiyar had taken the Kennedy  School’s mission of the public interest to heart. Instead of easing into a well-paid private sector job, he decided to leave the comfort of Cambridge and return to his native country with the goal of making it a better place. The challenge for Bakhtiyar was this meant returning to Azerbaijan.
Located in the Caucasus region of Eurasia, Azerbaijan is bounded by Russia, Georgia, and Iran. It’s hard to find on a map, and if you’re not from the region, chances are you’ll never have a reason to visit. Like other former Soviet republics, its efforts to democratize have been marred by deeply-rooted corruption. Since a successful military coup in the early 1990s, Azeri elections have fallen well short of international standards. The government retains notoriously aggressive control of the press and the freedom of assembly has fared no better.
This was the political climate Bakhtiyar faced when he returned to Azerbaijan to run for parliament in 2010. As an independent candidate, he championed increased government accountability and democratic reform, finishing third among a field of 14 candidates in a highly contentious race. He lost, perhaps not unexpectedly, to two government loyalists. The allegedly unlawful tactics used to defeat him have been presented to the European Court of Human Rights for review.
Undeterred, Bakhtiyar found inspiration in the Arab Spring and organized an online campaign calling for peaceful protests of the government. Almost immediately after this campaign went public, the government arrested Bakhtiyar and charged him with evading military service in violation of Azerbaijan’s conscription law, despite his status as a conscientious objector and a well-known constitutional provision granting the legislature authority to permit alternative forms of service.
While Azerbaijan had promised to enact such an alternative service law more than a decade before as a condition of its acceptance into the Council of Europe in 2001, the legislature has since failed to act and the government continues to selectively enforce conscription, as Bakhtiyar found out the hard way.
Considering the curious timing of Bakhtiyar’s arrest and the government’s long record of stifling dissent, a number of human rights organizations—including Freedom Now, co-chaired by Bishop Desmond M. Tutu—have protested Bakhtiyar’s conviction. In May 2011, Bakhtiyar was sentenced to the maximum term of two years in prison.
In a show of solidarity, hundreds of Harvard students and alumni recently signed a petition calling for Bakhtiyar’s release. This week, a dozen professors will join them. But Harvard University has failed to officially condemn Bakhtiyar’s arrest and conviction, or leverage its weight on the international stage to raise awareness about his case.
This year alone, there are nearly 4,200 international students studying at Harvard. More than 50,000 international alumni live worldwide. With many of these students hailing from politically unstable countries, like Myanmar and Uzbekistan, Bakhtiyar likely won’t be the last Harvard alum imprisoned for espousing the ideals of democracy. This is precisely why his case is so important.
Bakhtiyar represents the Harvard graduates of tomorrow who will attempt to answer John Kennedy’s famous call to action–often at great risk and sacrifice to themselves and their families. While President Kennedy would have expected nothing less, he almost certainly would have expected his alma mater to do more to defend these graduates in times of trial. These men and women should have the confidence of knowing the same institution that nurtured their ideals as students will fully support them as leaders when they strike out to effectuate meaningful change in the world.
To this end, Harvard President Drew Faust should draw a clear line in the sand by calling upon the Azerbaijani government to immediately and unconditionally release Bakhtiyar from prison. In doing so, she will send a strong signal of support to future graduates considering courageous paths like Bakhtiyar’s, while reaffirming Harvard’s commitment to advancing the public interest around the world.

On a Sunday night in March, people line up outside the door to get into Club Passim, the unassuming basement space on Palmer Street. Inside, the venue is stifling with heat from the kitchen and the cramped bodies of the patrons—men and women of all ages—as the smell of good food wafts through the air. The white walls are covered with the legendary faces of a storied past: Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell. The floor is paved with worn brick, exposed piping crosses the ceiling here and there, and diners crowd around little square tables, enjoying their meals before the show. When the show starts, the lights go down in the dining room and performers take to the stage, their sounds filling the tiny, hot room.
BEFORE PASSIM
 In 1958, Joyce Kalina and Paula Kelly opened up a new jazz club at 47 Mt. Auburn Street. Fittingly named Club 47, it was relocated to its current space on Palmer Street in 1963.
 During Club 47’s early years in the late ’50s, Cambridge was a central hub of the American Folk Revival—what Passim’s managing director Matthew Smith describes as “young, educated people rejecting the popular ’50s music and looking for something that meant a little more.” These restless college students gravitated towards the tradition of socially conscious American music coming out of the working class ballads of Woody Guthrie and the blues of the Mississippi Delta.
 Folk performers began to move into the new venue at 47 Mt. Auburn and make it their own—many of them students from local colleges like Harvard, Boston University, and Boston College. A number of performers who would move on to enjoy great fame got their first exposure at Club 47, including singer-songwriter Tom W. Rush ’63 and Joan Baez, who studied at Boston University.
 Notably, a little-known performer from the Midwest, who went by the name Bob Dylan, played in between sets during the early ’60s. Though he never received a proper billing, Club 47 had become such a standard that performers like Dylan welcomed the opportunity just to say that they had played there. The club also helped to bring north many of the retired and neglected Southern blues musicians of the ’30s and ’40s—like Skip James, Son House, and John Lee Hooker—whose records college-age folkies were rediscovering.
 “Club 47 was the big center of it all,” Smith says. “Anyone who was part of that scene in those days, they played here.”
THE REBIRTH OF A VENUE
 By the late ’60s, Dylan had become a folk messiah—only to go electric and shake the Folk Revival establishment to its core. The movement became embroiled in the political turmoil and loss of innocence of the Woodstock generation. The people who had started the club in their early ’20s were getting older and beginning to move on, and the folk music community was dwindling.
 The club shut down in April 1968. After a limbo period, the space was reopened in 1969 by a couple named the Donlins—this time, as a gift shop. Although they had no plans for music, fans and musicians continually visited the historic venue in search of song. As a result, the Donlins began to host performers, and thus, the club was reborn in its current incarnation as the evocatively named “Passim” (pronounced “pass-EEM”), a Latin term meaning “here and there.”
 Over its four decades, Passim has seen many changes in the music and performers it has hosted, but it remains true to its sense of tight-knit fellowship.
 “Passim has always been a small community, and folk has always taken place in a small community,” says Passim executive director Daniel B. Hogan, Ph.D ’83.
 For patrons like Sam Litvin, who has been going to Passim for a decade, it’s this same sense of community that brings him back time after time.
 “It’s the best venue for folk music I’ve ever been too. There’s a sense of intimacy, and a community with an audience that really cares about the music,” he says.
 Kimber Ludiker, a bluegrass musician, has been playing at the club ever since moving to Somerville four years ago. For musicians like her, playing here is a special experience.
 “It’s so intimate, and there’s not a bad seat in the house,” she says. “There’s definitely a sense of history.”
PASSIM TODAY
 Rather than being stuck revering its history, Passim envisions itself as a vital and vibrant community: a melting pot where talented performers of diverse backgrounds come together to collaborate and to share ideas.
 “Folk is not about a musical style but a sense of what brings you there. It’s about the community, and why that music is there, rather than how it is played. You can play folk music on an electric guitar. You can play folk music on a synthesizer,” Smith says.
 Passim operates as a nonprofit today, but continues to receive support from Harvard, which has allowed the club to hold events in Sanders Theater. Passim’s offices are also located in a Harvard-owned building.
 “Harvard has been a good partner for us. We’re very appreciative of the support we’ve had,” Hogan says.
 From the start, the folk scene that made Club 47 so famous has thrived on the intellectual and creative energy of the community around Harvard. The first Tuesday of every month is open-mic night: student performers are welcome.

When I wanted to go to lunch this past week, I didn’t call anyone to join me. Instead, I went to go sit alone by a certain tree in the yard, smiling politely at passers by until I found a friend willing to eat lunch with me. Often, I would reach for my cell phone, only to feel a painful void in my pocket as I remembered my dedication to the experiment. It had to be done.
You see, for the past few days, instead of using my cell phone, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, WriteAPrisoner.com, or any other social media, I went old school, contacting others solely using the red phone that comes with all Harvard dorm rooms. Disappointingly, I didn’t get to make or receive any calls from Moscow the entire week.
To start off, I had to plug my phone into the wall. Since August, my roommates and I had hidden the phone under the couch, and it took me eight tries to place a successful call from my room. However, I’m an important guy—I need to call people at all times during the day. So, I brought the phone with me, casually throwing it in my backpack as I went to class and various activities. This worked well. Making a quick call during Ec10 section, I ignored the looks of my TF and classmates as I ran out of the room carrying the phone. Later, I only experienced mild embarrassment when I dropped the phone on the floor during lunch in Annenberg.
This was one of the nicest weeks we’ve had this year, so I spent a fair amount of time on the grass. Of course, so did my bright red phone. Every time I sat down outside, I made sure the phone was visible to those around me, as I wanted the world to recognize my struggles. However, when people asked what I was doing, no one seemed to appreciate my serious journalism:
Friend: “Hey. What’s with the phone?”
Me: “Oh, nothing.” I put the receiver to my ear for a moment, “Just enjoying the sunlight—doing some important business.”
Friend: “Oh.” Awkward pause. “Why...why the red phone?”
Me: “Why not? I have to call people, don’t I?”
Friend: “Yeah, but...cell phones...convenience...modern technology...whatever. I’ll see you later.”
Granted, it wasn’t all fun and games. Although most of my friends just laughed at me, a few of them were able to successfully make me feel awkward. On the bright side, they couldn’t text me to complain.
When Friday finally arrived, I retired the red phone to its rightful place, and released my cell phone from its desk-drawer prison. For a moment, I felt extremely popular. Most of the missed calls and texts weren’t important, but I did have a series of messages from my mom and dad. I called back immediately, only to find that they were simply asking after my whereabouts, as they hadn’t heard from me in a few days. Moral of the story: don’t call your parents. Just kidding. Kind of.
When people don’t communicate, especially overeager Harvard kids, they go crazy. I found myself spending an overwhelming amount of time worrying about what I had missed. That said, we should use our red phones. They’re surprisingly fun, even if you spend most of the time taking fake calls as you sunbathe in the yard. If everyone took breaks from Harvard’s constant grind of communication more often, we might all be more relaxed. Or we could go insane. Either way, it’s time for red phones to make a comeback this spring. And I’m not just saying that so I can say I did it before it was cool.

Until my junior year of high school, a Google search of my name did not yield links chronicling my accomplishments, but rather my mom’s blog posts.
One particularly colorful (and incriminating) post describes my sixteenth birthday party: “My daughter Marina had started fantasizing about her sixteenth birthday at least three years ago. In her imagination, it was going to be a huge bash in an elegant ballroom, or possibly a swank Upper East Side club, like something out of ‘Gossip Girl.’” Hardly the stuff Ivy League admissions officers are looking for when they Google applicants. Luckily, such posts have since been drowned by more scholarly activities and my tendency to sign every petition on change.org. But my mom blogs—and various iterations of my younger self live on in her writing.
My mom started blogging in 2008, but she has always been a writer. When I was little, before the internet eclipsed the print publishing industry, she wrote about travel and culture for The Los Angeles Times and the now-defunct magazine Travel Holiday. Back then, too, I cropped up as a character in her articles, hoping for the chance to pelt tomatoes at the actors performing at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in London and declaring, at age four, “with absolute conviction,” that directly beneath the paving stones in Oaxaca, Mexico, clouds and airplanes were whizzing by.
I like this memorialized version of myself as a child, so lovingly captured in my mom’s prose, far better than the grinning, pig-tailed version in photo albums. Though the Marina of my mom’s writing speaks “with the drama only a teenager can summon,” she is—let’s face it—exponentially more palatable than the picture painted by my own early adolescent ventures into the blogosphere.

The Pizza Hut stands across from the gated Giza Pyramid complex, next to the "Beauty Perfume & Papyrus Palace." The company icon, store layout, server uniforms (red and black) are all familiar. Even the menu items are identical—mostly—except for some rare exceptions: pepperoni, which isn’t halal, is absent from the toppings list, and I've never seen a beef shawarma pizza in the U.S. But I'd never actually been to a Pizza Hut, so it was all new to me.
I was in Egypt with Charlie, a friend from school and my roommate in Cairo, working at a newspaper for the summer, and we had made the trip out to the pyramids as soon as we had a day off from work. We too were tourists. After exploring all morning in the 104 degree heat, we took a lunch break at the Pizza Hut across the street. Until then, the King's Chamber at the center of the Great Pyramid had been our only refuge from the sun and the army of unofficial tour guides and memorabilia salesmen wandering that corner of the unfriendly desert.
The Pizza Hut was upstairs from the KFC (fried chicken, we'd decided, was too heavy in this weather) and faced the Giza Necropolis. We sat down at the window in the air-conditioned room and ordered a cheese pie with cheese-stuffed crust, bread sticks, and two Cokes. When in Rome.
The window framed the entire Giza Plateau. Immediately below, the taxi driver who said he would drive us back to downtown Cairo "for cheap price" stood, waiting for our exit. In the foreground, the Great Sphinx eyed the Stuffed Pizza Rollers at the table next to us.
Behind the statue, we could just make out the helipad for VIP visitors beside one of the Pyramids, where Charlie and I had slumped with an overpriced bottle of Dasani water. In the distance, as Shelley would say, the lone and level sands stretch far away.
An hour earlier, Charlie and I had entered the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid. The oldest (and only surviving) of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramid was built as a tomb for the fourth dynasty Pharaoh Khufu and completed in 2560 B.C. We visitors entered through the "Robber’s Tunnel," ascended the angled Grand Gallery—some 150 feet long—and arrived at the King's Chamber. The granite room was bare, save a partly shattered sarcophagus at one side. Charlie flashed his Blackberry into the tomb. I checked to see if I had service.
But by now the waitress had arrived with our pizza, bread sticks, and soda. She asked us kindly, and in perfect English, if we wanted anything else. Sending her off with a broken and smile-ridden "kol tammam"—all's good—we turned to our meal. I peeled opened my Coke with the pull-tab, different from American stay-tab can-opening mechanisms but resulting in the same familiar and comforting swoosh.
Reaching for a slice, Charlie raised the inevitable question: how could an ancient civilization have constructed such behemoth structures? Answering himself, he recalled the conversation with our taxi driver a few days before.
The man had explained that everything we'd been told about the pyramids' construction was wrong, forcing us to conceive of the Disney Channel as something other than absolute Fact.
"You will see," he said, "the bricks are too massive, the pyramids too tall."
"Then how were they built?" we asked.
The driver mulled the question over in his head, for a moment—perhaps formulating the English translation: "Tall people."
The steaming, greasy, cheese-filled crust sagged as we ate the slices New York-style. "Man," I said to Charlie, "I wish there was a Pizza Hut in the Square."
That evening, we passed through Tahrir Square. People were selling t-shirts for the revolution. Protests would pick up later that month.
There’s a Pizza Hut there, too, but we never went.

I bought my first diary from Wal-Mart when I was eight years old. It had a picture of Barbie and a chihuahua on its bubblegum pink plastic cover, and an utterly ineffective lock and key device. I wrote in smeared graphite, and each line took up three on the paper. My first entry was: “Dear Diery, Today I bought this diery and some candy but I didn’t want to share the candy with my brother so I ate it.” The second entry was: “Dear Diery, I broke my pensil when I wrote Diery.”
Obviously, this was before those English as a Second Language classes really started kicking in. Near the end of the diary, I started writing the lowercase letter “a” like it appears on a typewriter instead of the way they teach you in kindergarten: I was copying my best friend, who was already reading chapter books. It’s a habit I’ve never managed to kick.
I bought my second diary from the school book fair when I was ten years old. It was matte black with a picture of two golden retriever puppies and the caption “Your secret’s safe with us!” It also had a lock and key device, which I religiously utilized until I broke it. I would have been mortified if anyone found out about my searing crush on the quiet, freckly kid in my math class whose paper valentine I kept for years. I wrote in gel pen, and my calligraphy bore an unfortunate resemblance to Comic Sans. This was the first journal where I stopped spelling the word “excited” like “exited.” I was in honors English by then. The sixth grade girl who lived across the street once stole it from me and drew anatomically improbable images in the margins. Bitch.
I bought my third diary when I was 13 years old. It was dark red, fake leather, and had a little black ribbon for marking what page I was on. I started calling it a journal. This book probably contains the most embarrassing written content that I will ever generate and plenty of solid blackmail should I ever become a public figure.
Whenever I read over it, I cringe at my solemn declaration to resist alcohol, at my genuine belief that people didn’t judge you based on your appearance, and at my unfortunate decision to “Say Anything.” There is an especially sharp pain in my heart when I read entries from the Ayn Rand phase, which I usually prefer to skip over as if they never existed.
An anacoluthon is an abrupt change in sentence syntax that is inconsistent with the previous structure. It is considered common in speech and stream of consciousness writing, but a mistake in formal essaying.
It’s the kind of mistake I make frequently in my journal, when I’m not really thinking about how I’m going to end the sentence until I end it. My entries are unfiltered, unpolished, and rambling: Anacolutha are inevitable.
I bought my fourth and current journal when I left for college. It is black, cloth-bound, unremarkable. It’s filled with my complaints about my crushing load of psets, boys who don’t text me back, boys who do text me back, Harvard-related career angst, my mother.
I know that my past two years of college have consisted of more than sad things, but somehow it’s the sad things, more than anything, that demand to be written down. From the most recent entry in my journal: “I could really use some real food.” And later, what follows: “I guess I’d just have to decide if my happiness is worth $4,000.”

In Feb. 2011, the Office of Public Affairs and Communications was confronted with a challenge—to communicate a modern image of Harvard in anticipation of the University’s 375th birthday. In collaboration with Alumni Affairs and Development, it launched a project to represent the University, starting with 100 video clips. Of the voices captured, these are three:
Peter A. Boyce II ’13 helps nurture fledgling Silicon Valley moguls on campus. As a founder of HackHarvard, which gives students in Computer Science 50 the opportunity to turn their final projects into real-life websites or apps, Boyce organizes weekly HackNights and coordinates mentorships. He comes alive on camera describing his experience building the organization while pursuing a concentration in applied math. Boyce is a far cry from the scrawny, socially fumbling Harvard computer scientist portrayed in “The Social Network.” Wearing dark-framed glasses, he sports an Afro and an irrepressible grin. He’s charismatic, his energy infectious, as he tells his story.
The first person in his family to go to college, Kevin Jennings ’85 had never heard of the Ivy League before he set foot on campus. He moved around a lot as a child and was bullied for being gay. Jennings exudes a quiet confidence in the video as he talks about his time on campus, saying, “It was the first time in my life for someone like me to be happy and successful. I hadnever seen that in the world where I grew up. Here Icame to Harvard where being smart was applauded and being gay was not such a big deal.” Jennings was voted the chief marshall of his class and, after graduating,founded the first Gay-Straight Alliance which isnow a nationwide organization.
Teresita Alvarez-Bjelland ’76 needed a winter coat. During her freshman year, the “coat fund” was limited to male students, so she took a job washing dishes inCurrier dining hall. She laughs on film and recalls thinking this would be a good lesson to tell her children someday. Alvarez-Bjelland went on to become president of the Harvard Alumni Association, placinga focus on public service during her term.
Their stories illustrate the changing Harvard brand. Boyce, Jennings, and Alvarez-Bjelland’s clips are three of the more than 100 anecdotal videos that are part of the Harvard Stories Project called “Veritas Verbatim,” which features students, alumni, faculty,and staff discussing their personal connections with Harvard. This project is one branch of a greater movement by the University to ensure that the image Harvard presents to the world is representative of the Harvard experience.
Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president of public affairs, notes that “Veritas Verbatim” allows the people who experience the Harvard brand to personify it.
“Your brand is your essential promise,” she says, “and your reputation is how you deliver against that promise.”
Wearing a dark blazer and sunny yellow shirt, Heenan sits on a chair in her neat, open office on the second floor of Massachusetts Hall. She says these stories are key to dispelling false perceptions of Harvard and to establishing an image that is an accurate depiction of the school as it is today. Says Heenan of Jennings’ story: “I think for people of certain generations, that is a different face of Harvard, and a different take on Harvard.”
“Telling the story of Harvard’s amazing diversity, telling the story of Harvard’s emerging internationalism and globalist focus, telling the story of a culture of belonging at Harvard that includes students of all stripes in a way that was less true, frankly, in different generations and different centuries, is a really important part of our work,” Heenan says.
Heenan believes the Harvard brand is currently viewed as a blend of “enduring,” “legacy,” and “emerging” attributes, reflecting some qualities which are at odds with what the University experience has become for many students. Through strategies like the Harvard Stories Project, the University aims to update the brand so that the perception is consistent with the reality.
“ENDURING”: SELF-SUSTAINING VALUE
Harvard’s “enduring attributes”—the qualities many people associate with the school due to its achievements and heritage—form the core of the brand. “I think of excellence, leadership, and tradition. I feel like these are self-perpetuating. Every crop of incredible students perpetuates the promise of that brand,” says Heenan. “Every amazing faculty member, every alumnus who goes on to serve in leadership capacities in government, nonprofit, business, go on to reinforce that element of what makes Harvard Harvard.”
In this sense, all people affiliated with the University become brand ambassadors in the way they represent Harvard and interact with the world.
Dan H. Schawbel, an authority on personal branding and author of global bestseller “Me 2.0: Build a Powerful Brand to Achieve Career Success,” cites the faculty at Harvard as an example of this “self-perpetuating” phenomenon. “The professors are famous; they’re so successful and so well-known,” Schawbel says. “Whenever they speak, whatever they do, the interactions they have with CEOs—it keeps on marketing the Harvard brand, saying, ‘We’re really great; they’re really great’—it’s a mutually beneficial thing.”
He compares the mechanism of the Harvard brand to the way news spreads online—a source breaks the information and then everyone else links back to it. “Everyone in the physical world is re-linking back to Harvard.”
From books written by faculty to case studies distributed by the Business School to articles published by newspapers that quote prominent Harvard figures, content establishes and reestablishes the brand. “Reputational success is based on substantive success,” says Harvard Business School Chapman Professor of Marketing and Communications Stephen A. Greyser ’56, “Substance is much more important than communications.”
In conveying the “substance” present, the role of the Office of Public Affairs at Harvard is “trying to help shape a positive image around the facts,” Greyser says. “Our job is not to in any way influence what happens in the classroom, what happens in the Houses, what happens in extracurricular activities or on the athletic fields,” Heenan says.
“Our job is to tell that story. In some ways, the delivery of that promise of the experience sits in the hands of faculty, of House Masters, of fellow students.”
“LEGACY”: OVERCOMING PERCEPTIONS
On one hand, the “substance” of these enduring attributes—the work and the people and the history that make up the brand—speak for themselves. “I think it’s a self-sustaining brand, if anything, because it has a long history, a long tradition, so it has that advantage,” says Alisha D. Ramos ’12, president of the Harvard Advertising and Marketing Club.
Yet there are traits with which Harvard is associated that send a negative message. In addition to refuting an old image, the University must forge a new one.
“When I think about the ‘legacy’ attributes—things like Harvard being conservative, being fusty, being exclusionary, being elitist—I think it’s our job to bat against those brand myths, things that are no longer true of Harvard, that were only true at one time,” says Heenan.
Though these attributes still describe Harvard in part, the general observation by students and alumni alike is that they are gradually disappearing, beginning with the experience and following with the image.
Natalie C. Padilla ’12, a writer for the Harvard College Student Admissions blog, participates in changing this image by chronicling her experiences on campus. Her perception of the school prior to matriculation differs from her experience here. “I thought it could be hard to fit in,” she recalls. “There might be pretensions—wasn’t sure what to expect coming from a public school in California.”
In her blog, Padilla, who is also a Crimson arts columnist, sheds light on how she found her place on campus, writing about the opportunities and activities that have defined her time here—posting about everything from Leverett’s renowned monkey bread at Masters’ Teas to an early morning adventure at FedEx the night before the due date of her government thesis.
Improvements in student engagement in campus life are apparent to alumni such as Steven H. Ohler ’74, an executive creative director at advertising agency McCann Erickson Worldwide whose daughter is now a freshman. “I think the experience in general is a lot more involving, engaging. There’s more stuff to do. There are more social opportunities now,” Ohler says. “I think Harvard does a really good job overcoming the perception it is an all-work-and-no-play place and that it’s stuffy and full of wonky people.”
Ramos has observed inconsistency between Harvard’s perception and its reality. After Harvard’s loss in the NCAA playoffs, she remembers reading a Wall Street Journal liveblog that highlighted some of the “legacy” attributes Heenan describes: “It said something like, ‘You can go back to your stuffy yacht clubs, your 401ks,’ something ridiculous like that. I think people perceive Harvard people as very elitist, and I don’t think that is an accurate depiction at all of Harvard, of Harvard students.”
Heenan offers a rationale for this perception. “I think that, in general, it’s easy in popular culture. Harvard is an easy reference point for a series of attributes,” she says. “When I wince is when we’re depicted as typifying those legacy aspects that are no longer true. You know, the caricature from ‘Legally Blonde’ of the tweeded admissions officer peeking over his horn-rimmed glasses.”
While overcoming these preexisting perceptions is an important component of Harvard branding, perhaps even more vital is providing access to information about the school for audiences who have not considered it as an option or opportunity.
One of the primary purposes of Harvard branding, says David A. Shore, who teaches a course on brand and reputation at the Extension School, is to break that initial barrier and become part of the  list of schools that potential students think of as viable possibilities—the “consideration set,” as he calls it.
Greyser remembers a conversation he once had with a colleague in admissions who represented Mississippi, a state from which, on average, three students have matriculated to the College annually in the past six years. He recalls that she said Harvard considered every student that matriculated from the state as a victory, because the real goal is to convince guidance departments to help students decide they should give Harvard a try.
Given the number of students matriculating to the College—one, five, four, six, three, and two in past six years, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 comments, “It shows that when the students are there, they certainly get in.”
The launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative in 2004, which strives to make Harvard more accessible to students from low and middle-income families, enables any applicant whose family makes $60,000 or less to attend without required parental contribution. In the fall of 2012, this number will increase to $65,000. Establishing its presence is part of the university’s main goals of branding.
Heenan, says “Our work is much more about reaching students who may not know their families can afford Harvard, may not know they’re academically qualified to go to Harvard and telling the broader world stories about Harvard as it continues to adapt and evolve in the 21st century.”
“EMERGING”: “NOT YOUR FATHER’S HARVARD”
In addition to sloughing off increasingly inaccurate stigmas, Heenan sees the University adopting an exciting set of “emerging” brand attributes that comprise a new dimension of Harvard’s personality.
“Harvard as a hotbed of entrepreneurship and innovation is a relatively new and young emerging aspect of the brand, but one that is really taking hold. Through the i-Lab, for example, there is a growing notion that Harvard is a place where innovation happens, where entrepreneurship happens,” says Heenan.
Boyce is an active participant in the proliferation of entrepreneurship on campus. He names United States in the World 36: “Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective”, a fall 2011 class cross-registered with Harvard Business School, as one of his favorite courses thus far. In this course, students learned from real start-up leaders.
Harvard is more than innovative—it’s cool. Heenan lists Lady Gaga’s visit, a nationally ranked basketball team, and the extensive coverage of Linsanity as events that have contributed to this fresh perspective on the University. “These different dimensions are enhancements, and in no way threatening of the enduring attributes, but a different lens for which people to look at and experience the school,” says Heenan enthusiastically. “It’s not your father’s Harvard.”
Ohler noticed these changes while accompanying his daughter to Visitas 2011. “There were parties in the Yard and we never saw that before. It’s a conscious decision on their part to make the experience more social,” he says. “I think this is great marketing by the University...to make Harvard feel like it’s not only a studious place but a fun place too.”
VALUE PROPOSITION
“Objectively, Harvard as a brand has a personality, but it has a value for its students,” says Ramos. “In terms of looking for jobs, having Harvard on your resume—it gets your foot in the door.”
Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities, says that potential employers have an understanding of the students they will encounter when they recruit at Harvard.
As Ramos and Mount suggest, Harvard’s image translates into concrete value for the University and many of its key stakeholders, including students, faculty, alumni and donors.
In part, the impact is monetary: When the brand takes a hit, so too does the University bank account. For example, controversy surrounding the 2010 Allston construction project compelled some alumni to retract their donations, Greyser notes, and dips in the endowment in past years created negative waves about the University’s status.
Conversely, Greyser points out, relaying positive news about the University, its leadership and faculty, keeps alumni and donors abreast of advances that may inspire them to give.
Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 and Katherine A. O’Donnell most recently donated $30 million to the University, a gift that Joseph said he was confident in providing given his belief in university President Drew G. Faust’s leadership. In a Crimson news article, he said, “If the school weren’t the proper steward for all that money, I’d feel differently. If it had different leadership, I’d feel differently.” Says Greyser, “The leader of Harvard is a symbol.”
A strong financial foundation supports a strong brand, which in turn attracts top-notch faculty and students. “It serves us well that among well-endowed universities we are the most well-endowed,” Shore says, “therefore our ability to attract talent and what we can theoretically offer is always attractive. That’s what strong organizations do: Attract human capital into the structural capital of organizations.”
In 2011, Harvard received $639.15 million in fiscal year donations and almost 35,000 applications for undergraduate admission. It also reached over 1 million Facebook fans and was featured in apparel lines for brands such as Forever 21, New Balance, and Vineyard Vines.
The commercial side of branding is simple: Harvard sells. “We receive dozens of license applications each year, and we approve as many as possible,” writes Rick Calixto, director of the Harvard Trademark Program in an email about the licensing process. Royalties from all Harvard-licensed items go to help funding financial aid. Around $500,000 is contributed annually by merchandise sales.
Elizabeth D. Hodgson, public relations and marketing manager at Vineyard Vines, says that Harvard has led the charge in sales of her company’s college collection, which launched in 2011 and includes merchandise from more than two dozen schools.
Calixto notes that the Harvard Trademark Program works through third parties who obtain licensing to produce Harvard apparel, rather than working directly with stores like Vineyard Vines. “We license companies to produce appropriate Harvard-licensed insignia items and they then sell these items to stores like Forever 21, the Coop, Target, etc. We try to offer Harvard items at a range of price points so that licensees are able to sell to different types of stores.”
When evaluating prospective merchandise licensees, the Harvard Trademark Program looks for “the appropriateness and quality of the proposed licensed products; how the Harvard trademarks will be used; the marketability of the products; and a potential licensee’s history of compliance with business and licensing standards,” according to its website. These standards offer guidelines but do not highlight explicit characteristics a company must possess in terms of what traits its image stands for.
This opens up the potential for brands to carry Harvard goods that promote legacy attributes or distort enduring attributes. The licensing of the phrase “Harvard Yard” for a preppy menswear clothing line by Wearwolf Group in 2009 struck some students as conflicting with the Harvard image. In a 2009 Crimson news story, Nicholas J. Navarro ’10 said, “As a student on financial aid, I care about expanding the financial aid system at Harvard, but at the same time, as a Latino, I came into Harvard my freshman year with preconceptions about Harvard being a culture of wealthy Caucasians, and the product line comes at the cost of reinforcing those stereotypes.”
PRODUCT OF EDUCATION
The commercial associations of branding and the use of the Harvard name to sell merchandise might seem at odds with the idea of Harvard as an institution of higher learning.
“This whole notion of brand management is somewhat distasteful, because universities are not retail stores; they’re not sports teams. We’re not trying to sell  a product after all. Somehow it seems slightly dissonant with the higher purposes of education, to think of it as a brand,” says professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
Lewis is not alone in his hesitation to embrace branding for the college. After all, though assembly lines package trademarked hoodies that fit neatly onto the shelves of the COOP, one would not like to think that Harvard likewise churns out students who have been branded with a crimson seal of approval.
Fortuitously, branding need not emphasize the Harvard name over the education it represents. Shore says “Everything has a brand. All that branding is about is having a reputation. The question is what you want to have a reputation for. Harvard is a brand just like every other university. Do you just let that happen on its own? As Harvard has concluded, you don’t let it just pop out of the ether.”
Discomfort with the idea of branding potentially lies more with how these efforts are implemented rather than the actual efforts themselves. “I want Harvard to be the one everyone recognizes as the best, but not because we have a booth at SXSW,” remarks Lewis. “I want the Harvard brand to emerge naturally, because we have the best professors, the best students, who emerge to become leaders in society.”
Heenan stresses that the image Harvard communicates to its stakeholders and the public is derived organically from the people and the work within the University. “Unlike a product brand manager, we don’t have any role—nor should we—in influencing the delivery of education, the experience students have. But the ability to capture it and depict it and share it with more people does influence how the brand is experienced.”
Much of this outreach is done through the technological resources that have become increasingly present in people’s lives—from offering “Justice” lectures on iTunes U to posting a daily story on the Harvard Facebook page, which now has 1.6 million fans and counting.
“To the extent that there is that mythology, the more you can say, ‘That professor is really interesting;’ ‘that student is someone like me and funny and interesting, or is from my state or from my country, someone I can relate to, ‘maybe I could find a place at that institution;’ ‘Maybe I belong there as well’...I think is so powerful,” says Heenan. “These stories can close those gaps between perception and reality.”

Twenty steps from Lamont stands the home of the sixth largest art collection in the United States. Since 2008, The Harvard Art Museums have been undergoing renovations, and the Fogg—the most expansive of the museums—has been off-limits to visitors. For some Harvard students, the construction on Quincy Street is just an incovenience. For others, it represents a missed opportunity.
“As a prefrosh, I got a glimpse [of the museum] for a half hour and they seemed pretty amazing,” says Shannon E. Mulshine ’12, a History of Art and Architecture concentrator. Mulshine, the former vice president of Harvard Art Museums’ Undergraduate Connection, has witnessed the construction unfold over her four years at Harvard. Though she has enjoyed access to the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, as well as the museums’ storage facility in Sommerville, the main building at 32 Quincy Street has been a mere construction site.
“There have been times when I’ve been looking at the construction and the building which is a hollow shell and [have felt] cheated,” Mulshine says.
A LONG TIME COMING
The Harvard Art Museums began planning an extreme redesign and renovation project almost 10 years ago, according to Daron J. Manoogian, Directorof Communications for the Harvard Art Museums.“When [Director Thomas W. Lentz] came to the museums [in 2003] there had already been a lot of discussion about renovating the building, and there had been some architectural planning although nothing was approved.”
The original intent of the project, as well as its current driving principle, has been to make the museums serve an educational role. “[Lentz] wanted to make sure that this wasn’t simply an architectural project,” says Manoogian, but that it also “furthered our academic goals as a teaching institution.”
Former president of HAMUC, Shannon M. Morrow ’12, is particularly excited about the incorporation of study spaces within the new building. “I think that the additional classroom space that they have planned will make the Fogg a much more accessible museum for the student population of the university, and will hopefully make students curious to see the galleries as they come in for classes,” she explains in an email.
Deborah M. Kao, Acting Head of the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art and Chief Curator for the Museums, notes that gallery space will increase by almost 40 percent.
The primary architect of the renovations is Renzo Piano, who was also responsible for the design of such buildings as the Pompidou Center and The New York Times Building. Peter J. Atkinson, Director of Facilities and Planning Management for the Harvard Art Museums, says that Piano and his team—known collectively as the Renzo Piano Building Workshop—are “a class act. They dedicate a full studio to each project.” Piano, now 74, travels from Italy to check on the project several times each year.
LIMITED OPTIONS
Architecturally speaking, this job is not an easy one. Rather than tearing down the buildings completely and starting from scratch, the architects will preserve the façade and interior plan even as they add new study spaces and galleries. “It involves not only new construction but lots of restoration work on a 1927 building that had never before undergone substantial renovation,” says Manoogian. “A lot of people ask why it’s taking so long, and that’s the primary reason.”
With the project slated for completion in the fall of 2013, the Sackler Museum remains the Harvard Art Museums’ primary location in Cambridge. The Sackler has remained open throughout the renovations of the Quincy Street buildings, and displays highlights of the collection. Remaining pieces are stored in warehouses in Somerville, which are open to students and accessible by shuttle.
For Mulshine, the inaccessibility of much of Harvard’s expansive permanent collection has left a gaping hole in her experience as a student at Harvard. However, she also believes that most Harvard students who have been here throughout the years-long renovation process barely know about the Harvard Art Museums at all.
Having only one art museum open to the public on Harvard’s campus substantially limits the visibility of the visual arts. “When Harvard students think about where they should bring their family and friends, I doubt it’s the Sackler Museum right now,” Mulshine says. “I hope in the future that it will be the Fogg museum.”
Nonetheless, the Sackler has far more to offer than many realize. “I can’t tell you how amazed people are,” says Danielle J. Parga ’12, former vice president of HAMUC. Parga has helped to organize several of HAMUC’s “Night at the Museum” events, which are designed to introduce the Harvard Art Museums’ collection to undergraduates.
“Students shouldn’t let the closing of the Fogg be an excuse to not see the museums on campus,” says Morrow, who urges undergraduates to explore the multitude of other on-campus museums Harvard has to offer. When the Fogg renovation is complete, she, for one, is sure she’ll be back to visit.

In 1878, a woman named Abby Leach came to Harvard in search of an education.
In 1997, Gloria A. Bruce ’00, a freshman at Harvard College, took a seminar on women’s history, documenting her own experience along the way.
Separated by more than a century, these two voices inhabit the same space: the Radcliffe College Archives at Schlesinger Library. In paper soft with age and still crisp from the printer, in cursive loops and cartridge-ink, they tell their stories. These stories are bookends to the institution in which the library is housed, and that which they document: Radcliffe, first an annex, then a College, and now a center for advanced research. The century between them brought a radical rethinking of not only co-education at Harvard, but of a woman’s traditional place in the world.
Founded in 1943, Schlesinger Library holds one of the largest women’s history archives in the world. The archives paint portraits, sometimes literally, rich in historical knowledge and deeply personal, revealing the thoughts and desires of women who were passionate, conflicted, interested, and interesting. They are vital, and they are not quiet.
HANDSOME MRS. AGASSIZ 
 When Leach came to Cambridge searching for Harvard professors to instruct her in Latin, English, and Greek, Harvard offered no official women’s education outlet. Instead, several professors taught her individually—and she so impressed them with her intelligence that they grew more receptive to the idea of establishing an educational institution explicitly for women. The idea was partially achieved in 1879, with the founding of the Harvard Annex, a non-degree-granting educational institution for women that was fully realized in 1882 as Radcliffe College, with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz as President.
More than a century later, Bruce donated a folder of her letters to the Schlesinger Archives as part of a women’s history seminar. Two years before the official end of Radcliffe College and 25 years after the integration of Radcliffe women into Harvard College, Bruce’s contributions were a lived archive: first-hand documentation of a woman’s experience enshrined in and created at the explicit behest of an institution that had, for so long, denied female voices.
SWEET GIRLS
A similar self-awareness was surfacing in the early seventies. A turbulent time for all of the United States, Harvard was no exception—especially in the realm of gender relations. 1943 had marked the beginning of joint instruction, and in 1963 women started receiving Harvard diplomas, but it was not until 1972 that Harvard instituted full-fledged co-residence, with complete integration coming in 1977.
Yet the underlying values of “the ideal Radcliffe girl: wife, mother, career,” as women’s liberation activist Nancy Grey Osterud ’78 wrote during her time at Harvard, were also being contested by feminists and Women’s Liberation groups as well as by the cultural agitation elicited by protests of the Vietnam War.
The Radcliffe Archives reveal this tension. “We tried our best to be sexy and interesting, feminine and creative,” Osterud wrote. “Why, then, were the Harvard guys always the more creative musicians and writers, the more dynamic political leaders, while we had the obviously inferior merit of ‘getting better grades.’”
Sallie Bingham ’58 reflected on these warring roles in “Notes on a Freshman’s Diary,” an essay she submitted to a project called “Radcliffe Reminiscences,” a series of essays written by Radcliffe women collected for the Archives in 1968.
“Work was the backbone of my life,” she wrote, reflecting on academic pressure. “Work was what I had been doing ever since I saw the light and realized that no one would be pleased with me and that I would hate myself unless I was pretty regularly pulling down A’s. Work had not changed since I had changed into an adolescent, although everything else had…For me, growing up meant still more work: responsibility, sexual labor and wearing stockings to class.”
Bingham wrote her essay in the late sixties. By the time the seventies rolled around, women at Radcliffe were vocalizing these frustrations in hopes of inspiring change. Osterud concluded: “The happy matron-career woman notion promoted by Radcliffe is a dreadful illusion.”
FINE ADDRESS
By the time Bruce wrote her letters in 1997, much had changed. Yet much was still similar. Some uneasiness remained: the struggle for a women’s center, though one existed in 1997, would resume with its disbandment in 1999; in 1997, celebrations of the 25th anniversary of coeducation at Harvard caused concerns that the full scope of women’s participation in the University, especially pre-1972, was underrepresented in Harvard’s official histories.
Yet Bruce’s concerns are familiar to students of all genders today: work, stress, blocking. In winter 1997, she wrote, “I’m enjoying my classes even though I’m struggling with some of them. The research I’ve been doing for the women’s history seminar is really interesting.”
It was a history she was self-consciously becoming part of: on Oct. 1, 1999—roughly two years after Gloria Bruce donated her letters—Radcliffe College was fully absorbed into Harvard.
NEW INSTITUTION
 On a spring day, daffodils abound in Radcliffe Yard. You can see some from the window of Schlesinger Library. Yellow and prim as teacups, they bob their heads in the sun.
Open a Radcliffe student’s diary from a hundred years ago and a flower slips out. Tissue-thin, crinkled old, its translucent petals are pressed against the page, maybe picked with student’s hands in Radcliffe Yard.
The Archive itself is a lot like that. Women fold their thoughts and daffodils into papers and notebooks. These documents become bits of life from other times, perennial, both past and present. The voices and flowers are preserved, but constantly generating. Each year they grow in the Yard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past three days, the Harvard University and Cambridge police departments have reported two violent unarmed robberies in the area around the Harvard campus.
On Tuesday afternoon, all Harvard students received a community advisory email regarding the two recent robberies.
The community advisory reported that two victims, both females in their early twenties, were approached and robbed at night. Both victims described their assailant as “a light skinned black or white male in his 30’s.”
The first victim was assaulted on Sunday night between 1:30 and 2 a.m. near the corner of Kirkland Street and Trowbridge Street, about five blocks northeast of Memorial Hall. The attacker threw the woman to the ground, knocked her unconscious, and then stole her iPhone and purse, according to the email.
The second victim was physically assaulted the next night at approximately 11:15 p.m. on the corner of Ellery Street and Harvard Street, about two blocks east of Pennypacker.
The Cambridge Police Department has neither confirmed nor discounted the possibility that the robberies were conducted by the same individual, according to Daniel M. Riviello, a police department spokesperson.
Detectives are working on finding the perpetrator of both robberies, and the CPD will conduct extra patrols in the area where the crimes were committed, Riviello wrote in an email.
Both of the victims were wearing headphones when attacked, and the advisory email warned against this in a list of precautions which also included staring at the ground and walking alone.
“We cannot stress enough that residents and students take care to follow the safety tips in the alert,” Riviello said. “Specifically to always be aware of their surroundings, walk in a group whenever possible, and avoid wearing headphones and listening to music so they are not distracted.”
This community advisory was the Harvard University Police Department’s first message to the student body this semester. The police sent mass emails in response to crimes on or near Harvard’s campus five times last semester.
In the 2010-11 academic year, HUPD released six community advisories in the fall semester and two in the spring.

The alcohol was provided at Bring Your Own (BYO): Voices of the Contemporary’s discussion about the role of art in the Occupy movement at the Sert Seminar Space on Tuesday.
More than fifty college and community members delved into the open bar and Thai food at the “Unstable Art” discussion as they were greeted by the event’s facilitators—a various collection of Graduate School of Design students and artists.
“We really wanted to foster discussion about the involvement of art in the Occupy movement,” History of Art and Architecture graduate student Claire R. Grace said. “This evening is for open-form discussions, so that the conversation can form organically, much like the organizational structure of the Occupy movement.”
The participants were broken up into several discussion groups and asked to come up with keywords or questions about the relationship between art and the Occupy movement before joining together to reflect in a larger dialogue.
“I am an artist and care deeply about both Occupy and politics,” choreographer for the In Noon Migratory Dance Collective Katherine Anderson said. “I want to use art to make political change, but I am unclear as to whether art can actually change the world politically, which is why I came here today.”
Anderson said that she has been interpreting Lawrence Lessig’s theory on campaign finance reform through dance. She was inspired to create more political choreography after seeing that provocative art pieces came out of the Occupy movement, some even by highly recognizable artists.
Some participants shared their thoughts about authorship and collectivity in art, focusing on the distinctive leaderless politics of the Occupy movement.
“I see artists as having the capacity to amplify the meaning of Occupy through direct action or installations or performance,” local artist Lissy Romanow said. “However, the idea of the ‘author’ is changing...[now] social change is the ‘art’ and the ‘author’ is the movement itself.”
Alex J. Altman, an active participant in Occupy Boston, added that this “authorlessness” is one of the most important aspect of Occupy.
“You see a wealth of artistic talent responsible for the Occupy movement, [and] yet nobody is asking for any credit. Our government could learn a lot from this,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members and supporters of the bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer community gathered in Fong Auditorium on Tuesday to recognize the grand opening of the new Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
The opening has been anticipated for almost a year, since Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced the creation of the office and lounge space in the basement of Boylston Hall last spring. Her announcement came in response to recommendations from the BGLTQ Working Group and student protests for a more visible BGLTQ-specific space than the Queer Resource Center in the Thayer basement.
That spring, she also announced the establishment of a director of BGLTQ student life—a position that has yet to be filled after Lee Forest turned it down in October.
Outgoing Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus member Rhonda Wittels ’79 welcomed attendees to the grand opening, commenting on the significance and the hard work put into the creation of the office.
Nelson and Wittels’ remarks were followed by a presentation of letters  from “The Secret Court of 1920” by Lowell House co-Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck. The “Secret Court”—uncovered by a Crimson editor in 2002—expelled seven Harvard students and affiliates for perceived homosexuality.
Austin and Eck—who read from correspondence between a condemned student, his mother, and the deans—said they wanted to remind attendees of Harvard’s history with the BGLTQ community and how far the University has come.
“As we talk about gay and lesbian students and teachers in the university, this is a sobering moment to remember that time. It was only 90 years ago,” Eck said.
Reverend Jamie Washington, president of an educational and religious consulting group, delivered the evening’s keynote address. During his presentation, he outlined his “10 Tips” for confronting the issues facing the BGLTQ community, which include implementing new institutional politics, providing more campus services, and engaging in conversations about the complexities of identity.
“There are no quick fixes to improving LGBTQ resources, so we do not expect the space to answer everything,” Washington said.
The opening of an office specifically for BGLTQ students was especially personal for Jonas Q. Wang ’12, who was one of three students involved in the BGLTQ Working Group. As former QSA co-chair, Wang said he was initially disappointed with Harvard’s resources for BGLTQ students.
“Now being a senior, seeing this happen and knowing students in all future years are going to walk on a campus with amazing institutional support is a vast change and I am really happy for all of this,” Wang said.
The majority of the attendees at the inauguration of the office were either administrators or student leaders from BGLTQ related groups. Girlspot co-chair Edith C. Benavides ’14, one about a dozen students at the event, said she attended because she hopes to be a part of the development and vision of the office in the forthcoming years.
Though the new office is a welcome social space for students, the Queer Resource Center will continue to remain open and there are no plans to close it any time soon, Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña said.
Currently, Divinity School student Emily J. Miller serves as the interim coordinator of BGLTQ Student Life. The Director position remains vacant after Forest, hired by the College in September, turned down the position before she was set to begin.
According to dela Peña, the search committee is in the process of reviewing candidates for the position and plans to make an appointment by this summer. For now, dela Peña said she hopes students can take advantage of the new space.
“I really hope it becomes a place where people can come together as a community to support one another,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, four thousand miles away from the hubbub of Cambridge—removed from the Occupy movement, library cutbacks, and heated debates over the return of ROTC—scholars at Harvard’s center in Italy harvested grapes.
At Villa i Tatti, Harvard’s center for Italian Renaissance studies, a group of research fellows take part each fall in a harvest festival called the vendemmia, one of I Tatti’s many traditions that preserve the culture and the spirit of the Renaissance.
In a time of continual change in the Harvard community, I Tatti serves as a living time capsule, upholding the vision and traditions of its founder, renowned art critic Bernard Berenson, Class of 1887.
Nearly five decades after Berenson’s death, Villa i Tatti remains a bustling hive of intellectual activity and a haven for scholars to rediscover the Renaissance in the modern world.
FOOD AND FELLOWSHIP
When Berenson died in 1959, Harvard University became heir to an impressive art collection and one of the largest private libraries in the world. His Villa i Tatti, in the rustic Settignano foothills east of Florence, has since become a refuge for scholars and artists.
Former musician-in-residence Christopher Stembridge recalls his days at I Tatti with fondness: studying Frescobaldi in the library, walking a few minutes to Berenson’s study, and sitting down to play the harpsichord in the presence of original Giotto paintings.
Every day, readers and scholars enjoy conversation over morning coffee with olive-oil doused schiacciata Tuscan flatbread. Midday they gather to enjoy wine and a three course lunch in the dining room.
“We come together in fellowship around food and wine,” says Elizabeth W. Mellyn, who has studied at I Tatti.
Fellows and administrators are rightly proud of the wine and high-grade extra virgin oil served at meals, as both are from I Tatti’s own vineyards and olive groves. In a speech during I Tatti’s 50th Anniversary Celebration last year, professor Lino Pertile, director of I Tatti and former Eliot House master, noted that their olive oil has won prizes in local fairs and the wine “has now reached a quality that would definitely impress Mr. Berenson and his guests.”
While it may seem odd to some that the University owns a property that produces Harvard-label wine, the consensus of those at Villa i Tatti is that its production is a part of their broader efforts to celebrate Italian culture and to encourage the cross-culture and to encourage the cross-pollination of ideas and personal interactions among the scholars, students, and guests.
“It’s a monastery for lay-people, in a way—with all the best aspects. That’s how Berenson envisioned it. You meet together for meals, and then you go to your little cells to focus,” says Michael T. Tworek, a teaching fellow in history who spent time as a visiting graduate fellow at I Tatti.
Pertile, a native of Italy and a professor of romance languages and literatures, likened the small I Tatti community to Eliot House, where he served as House master until 2010. Pertile relates with a chuckle an incident when he accidentally welcomed a group of dignitaries to I Tatti by saying “welcome all of you to Villa—Eliot House!”
MODERN CHALLENGES
But the marvels of I Tatti do not come cheap. Although an arm of Harvard University, I Tatti is an autonomous and financially independent allied institution that must raise its own capital to fund projects.
The Villa is supported primarily by its own endowment, which has grown from the original $900,000 that Berenson bequeathed with his estate. To bridge the gap between endowment income and operating expenses, the operation of Villa i Tatti relies solely upon donations.
“While Harvard manages the endowment of I Tatti, it does not directly contribute to it,” says former Director of I Tatti Joseph Connors, who is also a professor of history of art and architecture.
“It’s not like what we spend at Villa I Tatti is taken away from Harvard Yard,” Pertile says.
During the financial crisis, Harvard University’s endowment plummeted by nearly 30 percent, leading to the slashing of budgets across the University and also dozens of employee layoffs. I Tatti’s endowment has also suffered, proving that the Italian sanctuary was not immune from the turbulence of global financial markets.
At an I Tatti Council meeting in April 2008, Connors expressed concern about the impact of the weakening dollar on I Tatti’s budget. According to a fall 2008 newsletter, Connors says that he worried that Renaissance study may be jeopardized by financial strain and reaffirmed I Tatti’s obligation to safeguard and preserve scholarship during difficult economic times.
“In general, this was a time of considerable constraint in all areas of operation,” Connors writes in an email to The Crimson.
As examples of budget cuts, he cited reduced hiring, program cutting, and the freezing of fellowship levels despite the unfavorably high Italian inflation rate.
Despite these concerns, I Tatti weathered the crisis and managed to preserve its way of life, proceeding with ambitious building projects and plans for expansion of its programming. In 2007, the Center announced plans to renovate its library and managed to raise $1 million by 2009 to complete extensive renovations. In 2008 and 2009, the Center expanded its grounds, which included the addition of a new vineyard, a new greenhouse and olive grove, according to its fall 2009 newsletter. I Tatti has also continued to focus on restoring its historic gardens, Assistant Director Allen J. Grieco, writes in an email to the Crimson.
In addition, I Tatti recently inaugurated a new building, housing study rooms for their fellows and a lecture hall, built during the height of the crisis. Although the building project was delayed when the construction company went bankrupt, it was eventually completed in 2011 after the Harvard Corporation granted permission for continued development given that funding had been previously obtained.
“I Tatti got through,” writes Connors, “though the watchword in budgetary matters is still caution.”
THE HEART OF THE VILLA
Villa i Tatti has focused on bringing its research and study into the 21st century, while keeping one foot firmly rooted in Renaissance.
A world class research center, it adds 3,500 volumes annually to its library of 175,000, a collection renowned throughout Italy. I Tatti has also continued to augment its research opportunities, adding programs that benefit Harvard students such as a Visiting Graduate Fellowship program, and a Summer Undergraduate Internship program that was created last year.
In recent years, I Tatti has expanded its academic focus beyond art history to include architecture, literature, music, religion, and science. The subjects of its scholars now include the transmission of Renaissance ideas beyond the Italian Peninsula.
Visiting graduate fellow Evan MacCarthy says that the program combats the problem of graduate students specializing too quickly.
“Interdisciplinary is the buzzword today. I Tatti is a place where you actually live it,” he says.
I Tatti has similarly sought to increase the geographical representation of its Fellows. Until the mid-1990s, half of the fellows were from North America, with another quarter from Italy. Today, that sum is just 40 percent. Villa i Tatti is committed to “reaching beyond the traditional boundaries of our center,” says Pertile, who will travel to China, Japan and Mexico next year in an effort to promote I Tatti in the far corners of the globe.
“The time has come to make ourselves available to the world,” he says.
Despite its efforts to become a more globally-focused institution, at its core, I Tatti is committed to preserving the vision and lifestyle of Berenson from nearly a century ago.
Berenson’s grave lies next to a small 18th century chapel just outside I Tatti, but his legacy and spirit are alive and well at the Villa, which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last June in a grand celebration with some 300 guests. “He had a vision to hand Villa i Tatti down beyond his own life to scores of young people who would be able to enjoy it and take advantage of it in the way he did before,” says Pertile. “Everything still speaks of him.”

On May 23, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde will deliver the commencement address to this year’s class of Harvard Kennedy School graduates. Lagarde is not only the first woman to head the IMF, but also the first woman to serve as the minister of economic affairs for a G8 country—France. In 2011, she was ranked as the ninth most powerful woman in the world by Forbes Magazine.
“Christine Lagarde is an extraordinarily talented and effective leader whose experience and insight is proving critical at a perilous time for the global economy,” Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood wrote in an emailed announcement to the Harvard community.
Many students have reacted positively to this selection.
“I think it’s awesome that we’re having such a high-profile woman address us,” Kennedy School student Robert M. Shaw student. “The IMF speaks to the Harvard population, as diverse as this community is.”
Other students said that Lagarde is an appropriate choice to deliver the commencement address because of the current state of the global economy.
“Given the reach of the financial crisis, a lot of people will have to deal with it, so I think [Lagarde] is a very relevant choice,” Kennedy School student Laura M. Gunderson said.
“I’m very curious to hear what she says—what her message to the students would be,” Kennedy School student Eric Rodriguez said.
Some students were especially pleased with the choice of a female speaker.
“I think it’s very timely...professionally, she’s always been a great advocate for women,” Kennedy School student Mehnaz Haider said.
Professors echoed their students’ sentiments, praising her influence and experience.
“I feel like it’s a great choice because she has been a powerful person in French politics and...she’s at the nexus of future important decisions,” Kennedy School Professor Lant Pritchett said.
Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy Matthew Bunn agreed with Pritchett.
“She’s obviously very educated and sophisticated, and at the fulcrum of a huge policy issue,” Bunn said.
IMF spokesperson William J. Murray said that while Lagarde gets numerous requests for appearances, “she was happy she was asked to speak [at the Kennedy School].”
“The Kennedy School produces many people that operate in the international community and the economic policy-making realm,” Murray said. “[They are] an interesting audience and the graduates are going on to do important work.”

Approximately 45 protesters gathered in front of the Science Center on Tuesday with signs and a megaphone for a “Speak-Out Against Layoffs at Harvard.” The event, which was organized by the No Layoffs Campaign, the Student Labor Action Movement, and Occupy Harvard, featured short speeches from workers, students, and faculty opposing the layoffs of Harvard Library workers.
The speak-out is the latest in a series of protests and rallies regarding library layoffs following Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton’s Jan. 19 announcement that the library’s reorganization would include staff reductions.
Library assistant Geoff P. Carens, who introduced many of the speakers, said that events like these have “definitely raised awareness” about the situation facing library workers. He called the “speak-out” format “more of an opportunity to reach out to the broader community in a more conversational way.”
Library assistant Jeffrey W. Booth also attended the event and said he was pleased with how it went. He said that each group of the library’s stakeholders were represented by a speaker, including union representatives, undergraduates, graduate students, alumni, and faculty.
The speakers focused on the arguments that layoffs would be unfair to the workers and negatively impact the quality of the library system. A No Layoffs campaign leaflet distributed at the event alleged “damage already inflicted on Harvard’s libraries by layoffs, out-sourcing, automation, and excessive reliance on student workers.” The handout listed problems such as minimal and inaccurate bibliographic records, faulty ordering and claiming processes, and thousands of books being shipped to the Harvard Depository without cataloging.
In response to the claims of the protesters, a University spokesperson wrote in an email that the library’s reorganization will actually enhance access to the Library’s holdings.
“The new organizational design unifies functions that occur within all libraries—Access Services, Technical Services, and Preservation and Digital Imaging Services,” the spokesperson said. “The shared services will enable greater focus on the needs of the user community.”
SLAM member William P. Whitham said that he thought that the “four or five” protest actions that SLAM has been involved in regarding library layoffs have been effective in spreading knowledge of the situation to the community.
“I think it’s having an impact,” Witham said. “The main purpose of these has been to inform people what’s going on.”
Whitham mentioned a variety of actions that SLAM has taken, including rallies, attending University President Drew G. Faust’s office hours, and contacting members of the administration.
“We’re going to do whatever it takes,” Whitham said. “We’ve tried so many tactics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 29, 2012, at 5:59 a.m.
In the days since President Barack Obama’s nomination of Dartmouth College president Jim Yong Kim as the president of the World Bank, opinions of Harvard government and public health professors on this relatively unorthodox choice have been split.
Opponents have argued that Kim’s academic and professional background, including a position as the chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, do not qualify him to be the head of the international financial institution. In contrast, supporters have called Kim, an expert in global health and development, an inspired pick who will add a vital new perspective to the World Bank.
The World Bank provides loans to developing countries in service of its official goal of global poverty reduction. Its operations primarily concern investment and finance, according to environmental engineering and environmental health professor John Briscoe, who served as the World Bank’s country director for Brazil.
Although the majority of World Bank leaders in the past came from careers in finance and business, Kim’s background is in the field of public health. Along with Harvard Medical School professor Paul Farmer, Kim co-founded Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit that works to deliver primary and preventive health care to underserved regions, in 1987.
“Health is a small part, but not really central,” said Briscoe of the World Bank’s mission. “[Kim] has run a health organization which survives on donations....This is a very important and admirable thing, but it’s entirely different from the mission of the World Bank.”
Kim’s appointment, Briscoe said, would reduce the power of the U.S. to shape the economic futures of developing nations, causing “the end of the World Bank as we’ve known it.”
“The World Bank is primarily a bank. It loans money to countries, which [Kim] has no experience in,” said one Harvard faculty member who formerly worked for the World Bank and wished to remain anonymous. He called the future of the World Bank “a question mark,” with the next leader able to either strengthen its role as a lending institution or transform it into a voice for other organizations to assume that responsibility.
He suggested that Kim, who has served as director of the HIV/AIDS department of the World Health Organization, was nominated in part to create popular political support for dealing with global health problems and disparities between poor and rich countries.
But supporters of Kim’s nomination have argued that this global health perspective will in fact help the World Bank focus on the most important issues facing poorer countries.
Julio Frenk, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health and former minister of health of Mexico, said he was elated to learn of Kim’s nomination, calling it “a great decision by President Obama.”
“[Kim’s] nomination signals a very strong will to transform the bank and fully devote it to become a leading development agency in the world,” said Frenk, who has worked extensively with the World Bank on the topic of health systems.
In contrast to the opponents of the nomination, Frenk said he believes Kim’s academic background and experience in global health will “enrich the work of the bank” and convey needed changes to the international financial institution.
Regardless of the arguments on either side, Kim seems likely to secure the post. Historically, the World Bank president has been an American citizen, while the International Monetary Fund has been headed by a European.
Still, critics have argued that Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the African nominee to the presidency, is more qualified than Kim.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Lant Pritchett, who studies international development and worked at the World Bank for 17 years, publicly criticized Kim’s nomination in a Forbes Magazine article on Friday.
“There is no way you can say with a straight face that this man is more qualified to head the World Bank than Ngozi,” he told Forbes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren found herself in the increasingly familiar confines of the national spotlight last week when she told the Washington Blade newspaper that she hoped President Barack Obama would “evolve” his views and endorse gay marriage.
“I want to see the president evolve because I believe that is right; marriage equality is morally right,” Warren said in an interview with the prominent LQBT weekly newspaper.
Warren’s comments came just days before the Obama campaign released 90 seconds of unused footage from the camp’s documentary promotional “The Road We’ve Traveled,” in which the U.S. Senate candidate, and former advisor to the president, argues that Obama is best equipped to continue to pull the country out of the economic recession that marked his first term in office.
“The president gets...what American families face,” Warren says in the clip.
“This election is going to affect everyone. We really have come to a real choice, and what our future looks like is going to be very different depending on who’s governing,” she adds.
The seemingly contradictory intersection between the campaigns points to what has been an important, though at times fraught, relationship between the President and his former advisor—one that helped launch Warren into political stardom and could have great effect on the political fates of both this fall, analysts here say.
“In Massachusetts, his utility to her is enormous. He’s so popular here that he is bound to have a positive effect on her and other Democrats,” Democratic analyst Daniel B. Payne said.
“Where she might be valuable to Obama is among liberal donors who are increasingly becoming Democratic anyway. They may see her as someone who can vouch for Obama’s credentials in trying to manage Wall Street excess,” Payne added.
Even as Warren criticized Obama for his positions on gay marriage last week, the President has incorporated many of Warren’s ideas on consumer protection and the social contract into his own campaign rhetoric as he has tried to center his campaign on economic issues.
Much of Obama’s economic policy during his first term has roots in Warren and her scholarship. She was tapped first as the chair of the Congressional Oversight Committee charged with regulating the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), and then as an economic advisor to Obama responsible for creating a consumer protection agency.
But despite her work in the White House, Warren was left out in the cold last summer when it came time for Obama to name the first director of the Consumer Protection Bureau—an organization that she is recognized to have brought into being.
“She lived up to the reputation—a reputation that she made for herself—as a rock thrower and that can make people in Washington quite nervous,” Payne said. “I think the fact that she was willing to be that blunt was both a blessing and curse for her.”
The suggestion that Warren’s criticism of Obama is based on hard feelings is improbable, analysts say. Instead, they posit that Warren is likely trying to push the President towards the more liberal stance that is popular within his party.
Analysts say many of the differences in policy between the two camps can be attributed to the difference between the Massachusetts and national voting bodies.
Experts warn Massachusetts has a history of splitting tickets, electing, for example, a Democratic president and a Republican senator. In other words, Warren may get a boost from her former boss, but she’ll still have to win the race herself.
“Barack Obama is going to win Massachusetts. So that’s good for her, but it is not enough to guarantee her a win. That’s going to help her but that’s not going to close it for her,” Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said.
Indeed, Obama may predict such a wide margin of victory in Massachusetts that he will not spend time campaigning here, and therefore avoid directly aiding Warren.
“Given the fact that Obama is a shoo-in for winning Massachusetts, it seems to me that, unusual as it is, both Warren and Brown will have to play the turnout game even though its a presidential year,” Kennedy School of Government lecturer M. Marty Linsky said.
Analysts say Warren’s effect on Obama may be more difficult to calculate in the long run, as it translates less clearly into tangible support.
“If he wins and she wins they’re going to be lifetime buddies, and what she says now is about her winning not about their relationship,” Linsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You are safer than you think.
According to Harvard psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, who gave a talk about his book “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined” at the Honan-Allston Branch of the Boston Public Library Tuesday evening, we are in the least violent era of human history.
The lecture is one in a series of Harvard-sponsored talks in Boston Public Libraries featuring prominent University faculty members, including University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds.
Harvard Associate Vice President for Communications and Public Affairs Kevin Casey said that the purpose of the talk—and the lecture series as a whole—is to demonstrate Harvard’s commitment to being “part of the fabric of both the Boston and Cambridge communities.”
During the lecture, Pinker said that we are living in a period of history in which “the number, duration, and deadliness of wars are all in decline.”
“We are entering the first decade of the twenty-first century with an unprecedented low death-rate,” he said.
Pinker cited statistics from inter- and intra-state wars, domestic violence, crime, and genocide to support his thesis, crediting “human experience and ingenuity” for the decreases in violence, and emphasizing the importance of focusing “not just on what we are doing wrong, but what we are doing right [to decrease violence].”
Many attendees had read Pinker’s recent book on violence and trends. Sonia R. Rosner, a Harvard doctoral student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, has read the book and said the lecture was a fair summary.
“The book is...700 pages long, to get the central thesis into a 45-minute talk is to compress and gloss over a lot of details in the book,” Rosner said.
While Pinker noted that the death-rate in the U.S. is higher than in other “developed countries,” he said that this lag could be attributed to Conservative states.
“The U.S. is really two countries,” he said. “Blue states are smack in the middle of this progression [toward a lower death rate] while red states are very far behind.”
Pinker spent a majority of the lecture discussing the United States. But Brazil native Andrea McKae, a graduate student at Boston University who attended the lecture, said that the lecture gave her a new perspective on violence in her home country.
“I never thought of it this way,” McKae said. “I’m originally from Brazil. Coming from Brazil, we have lots of violence so it’s hard for me to believe there is less violence.”
Pinker said he was eager to be a part of Harvard’s effort to reach out to the greater community, especially in Allston.
“Harvard obviously has a big footprint in Allston, and it’s going to get bigger,” he said. “The least it could do is share what it does best—knowledge—with the community.”

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is expanding its undergraduate offerings, creating new concentrations in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.
The new concentrations were designed to accommodate the growing student need for more focus on particular engineering disciplines, according to Joost J. Vlassak, SEAS area dean for materials science and mechanical engineering.
The two new concentrations will replace the electrical engineering and mechanical engineering tracks of the current engineering sciences SB concentration. Students will still be able to pursue an AB in engineering sciences under both tracks. These changes will both help students better explore specific interests in engineering subfields and allow the engineering sciences concentration to “truly serve as a general engineering education program,” SEAS Electrical Engineering Area Dean Evelyn Hu said.
The new concentrations are currently going through various approval processes and may be introduced as early as the next academic year, according to Hu. SEAS will apply for Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology accreditation for both programs.
The proposed additions are only the latest in a movement across SEAS to expand existing tracks into independent concentrations. In 2010, biomedical engineering was incorporated as a stand-alone concentration.
The new concentrations are expected to increase the visibility of Harvard’s engineering programs.
“The goal is not to compete with other much bigger engineering schools such as MIT or Stanford,” Vlassak said. “Harvard engineering will remain much smaller than engineering at MIT for the foreseeable future, and that makes sense in the Harvard liberal arts context.”
Vlassak added that a degree in a specific engineering discipline is “more easily recognizable” and would benefit students interested in jobs in certain fields.
“Back home it’s more accredited to have an electrical engineering degree than one in the engineering sciences on the EE track,” said Marc Atiyeh ’14, a current engineering sciences concentrator and international student from Lebanon.
The structure of the new concentrations will build upon the existing infrastructure within the engineering sciences SB concentration; more courses, faculty, and advising resources for concentrators will be added in tune with growth.
According to Hu, the goal is to make the transition as “seamless” as possible for current engineering students.
Administrators also plan to incorporate reforms that aim to increase the hands-on experiences that are currently available to students.
Current engineering sciences concentrator Madhura B. Narawane ’12 called the new offerings a “good move” for the school, though she said she personally appreciates the flexibility within the engineering sciences concentration.
“I do like the opportunity, within a specific track in Engineering Sciences, to take classes in other engineering disciplines,” Narawane said. “I’m generally happy with the Engineering Sciences degree, so I’m not sure if I would have liked to switch.”
Atiyeh said he welcomes the new additions and would definitely switch.
“The new concentrations will play an important role in helping Harvard emphasize and strengthen its engineering program,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ben Privot of The Consensual Project encouraged open discussions about sexual desires in Dirty Talk, a workshop on verbal sexual communication held Tuesday as part of Harvard’s first annual Sex Week.
Privot started the workshop by asking audience members to write on a note card the dirtiest and sexiest thing someone had ever said to them. He then had the audience crumple their note cards into a ball and throw them across the room, so that they could be picked up and read anonymously.
One of the note cards read, “I’ll make you the kind of dirty that doesn’t wash off.”
The workshop focused heavily on this type of participation as Privot continued to ask the audience questions about their sexual desires and how they communicate about sex.
“You are all the world’s leading experts on your own desires,” Privot said. “I want you to all go back to a space where you feel comfortable forming your desires.”
To demonstrate his personal ideas and the ideas that audience members offered, he asked for volunteers to perform short skits. Privot asked one participant to give the audience “the look,” an expression that aims to seduce.
“Body language on its own is not reliable,” Privot said, so he asked another two audience members to demonstrate the concepts of “the narrator” and “the director” in sexual roles.
One volunteer commanded the other to pat her head, demonstrating how “the director” in a sexual relationship might communicate. Another volunteer praised the other for doing good jumping jacks in ‘sexy’ tones of voice, showing how “the narrator” might communicate.
Privot said that communicating through words is one key to pleasurable, consensual sex.
Between different discussion sections, such as body language, dirty talk, and the tools for consent, Privot asked Jeopardy-style questions and gave out prizes. Questions ranged from “When was the rubber condom invented?” to “How long does a pig orgasm?”
The prizes were sex toys, such as vibrators and specially flavored lotions.
Cheryl Y. Campos ’15, said that the workshop and Sex Week is important because it “makes sex less taboo and you learn about all different aspects of it.”
Brenda M. Serpas ’15, the publicity director for Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College, which sponsors Sex Week, said that “it’s important to educate students on the issue of sex. Whether you’re sexually active or not, it’s still important to know.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences began with a major case of deja vu. Two items on the agenda looked especially familiar.
“Didn’t we already do this?” asked Professor James J. McCarthy.
In fact, the faculty already had. A motion to revise the schedule for regular meetings of the Faculty and a motion to create a new Ph.D. program in Education had already been discussed at the previous faculty meeting three weeks earlier.
But in accordance with parliamentary procedure, faculty had to wait until the following meeting—which took place yesterday afternoon—to vote.
McCarthy helped put the process in laymen’s terms.
“If we are to change the rules of the faculty, we must raise this issue at a first meeting, discuss it, then raise it up at a second meeting, discuss it again if necessary, and then vote on it.”
University President Drew G. Faust was so eager to call the long-awaited vote that she almost overlooked meeting protocol herself, forgetting to ask FAS Dean Michael D. Smith for the Faculty Council vote.
She caught herself just in time and gave Smith the floor.
“I have a big job here,” Smith joked.
Another top administrator was a given a chance in the spotlight when Faust announced three new tenure appointments from within the faculty.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 now holds a tenure appointment in the department of economics.
FIDUCIARY FUN
Perhaps due to the repetitive agenda items—or the chilly March weather—Tuesday’s meeting was not very well-attended. Nearly one-third of seats in the room remained vacant.
Those professors who did show up were treated to a slideshow about the ongoing FAS implementation of the University’s new conflict of interest policies and a demonstration of the new online financial conflict of interest reporting tool, to be launched in May.
Theodore C. Bestor, chair of the anthropology department, took to the microphone to clarify whether his primary fiduciary responsibility—over an international non-profit organization­­—would require disclosure under the University’s new financial interest disclosure policies.
When asked if he was making any money off of the position, Bestor earned some laughs.
“No,” he said emphatically. “Far from it.”
He went on to suggest that the Committee on Research Policy clarify what kinds of fiduciary responsibility faculty were required to report.
“I’m assuming President Faust has fiduciary responsibilities at Harvard?” he directed at the President.
“I hope so!” she responded.
“So do we all,” Bestor said, drawing more laughter from professors.

Faculty members will have one month to disclose their significant financial interests to the University, under the proposed implementation plan of university conflict of interest policies presented for the first time at yesterday’s Faculty Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The presentation of the FAS’ new conflict of interest procedures concluded a sparsely attended, but brisk, meeting in which faculty unanimously passed motions to adjust the calendar of faculty meetings and create a standing committee to appoint degree candidates for a new Ph.D in Education.
REPORTING FINANCIAL INTERESTS
The FAS, in addition to all of Harvard’s professional schools, was first charged with crafting a conflict of interest implementation plan in May 2010, when conflict of interest policies were revised to standardize disclosure practices across the University.
The University is also responsible for complying with regulations imposed by the U.S. Public Health Service on institutions that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control, among others.
Alexander F. Schier, chair of the FAS Committee on Research Policy and a professor in molecular and cellular biology, presented the plan that the committee has devised for FAS.
Faculty members are no longer responsible for determining their own conflicts of interest. Instead, they must disclose “outside financial interests that relate to their institutional responsibilities” using a new online reporting tool.
The tool has already been used successfully by faculty at the School of Public Health and the Divinity School.
A financial conflict of interest arises when a faculty member’s University work is “inappropriately influenced by a secondary financial interest.”
Significant financial interests include compensation exceeding $5,000 from consulting or fiduciary relationships and equity interests. Previously, faculty only had to report interests above $10,000.
Faculty members must also disclose potential financial interests of their spouses or children. Disclosures will be evaluated by a “Designated Institutional Official” at each school.
The presentation emphasized that any data submitted will be kept in full confidence and used only for conflict of interest issues.
The plan to implement the policy is still a work in progress, and some faculty members requested clarifications and made recommendations.
Theodore C. Bestor, chair of the Anthropology department, suggested that the wording of the reporting tool should make clear that fiduciary responsibilities are related to personal scholarship.
Under current deadlines, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and divisional deans will announce the new reporting tool on May 1, at which point faculty will have 30 days to disclose their financial interests.
LIBRARY TROUBLE
During the question period that begins every Faculty Meeting, faculty raised concerns about transparency in the library restructuring process and the manner in which library employees have been treated.
Citing colleagues in the Loeb Music Library who have been asked to submit employee profiles for potential job shifts, Anne C. Shreffler, acting chair of the music department, questioned what she said she felt was a lack of faculty engagement in such decisions.
“How, when, and in what form will the faculty be consulted about these far-reaching changes which will have such great impact on our research and teaching?” she asked.
University Provost Alan Garber admitted that faculty engagement early in the process was less than ideal.
“We have not, to be quite candid, effectively engaged the Faculty Advisory Board, but we’ve tried to change that,” he said. “Over the past three months, we have had 155 meetings with faculty and staff about the library transition. Some of those meetings have been only staff, and some have been only faculty. Not everybody has participated, but there has been a very extensive effort to engage the community.”
Ali Asani, chair of the department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, noted Harvard’s treatment of employees.
“How can we be compassionate and humane as we’re dealing with members of our community?” he asked University President Drew G. Faust.
Faust acknowledged the need for compassion.
“Part of that is offering to staff who have worked here for a long time and are eligible for a voluntary early retirement program the ability to choose that,” she said.
EDUCATING EDUCATORS
Faculty present also voted unanimously to approve a new Ph.D program in Education, to be offered jointly by the Graduate School of Education and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Interim Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Richard J. Tarrant addressed concerns about how the new program would affect the demand for library resources.
According to Tarrant, representatives from both Widener Library and Gutman Library concluded that the new program would not significantly change the demand for library resources by GSE faculty and staff.
“Should there be need for additional library resources, the Graduate School of Education is prepared to support those costs,” Tarrant said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a chilly Tuesday night at Garber Field in Amherst, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team quickly learned the true meaning of intrastate rival UMass’ nickname, as the Minutemen continued to pour in goals in what seemed like every moment of the contest.
Once the offensive onslaught was over, No. 2/3 Massachusetts (8-0) had showed why it is not only the top team in the state but also one of the best in the country, remaining undefeated by thrashing the Crimson (4-4), 16-8.
“UMass outplayed us, I think they outcoached us, and they were the better team,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “They jumped on us early, we started slow, and they continued their strong play throughout the night.”
In a battle of two of the country’s leading scorers, Minutemen junior attackman Will Manny got the best of Harvard senior attack Jeff Cohen. Manny, who entered the game tied for sixth nationally in goals per game, scored five times, while UMass shutout Cohen—who came in tied for first and was riding a streak of six straight games with a hat trick—until the contest’s final moments, limiting him to one score on six shots.
“We probably didn’t get [Cohen] as many shots as we should have, we didn’t generate enough looks for him,” Wojcik said. “They played very good defense on him, for sure.”
After an unassisted goal by junior midfielder Alex White cut the Minutemen lead to 6-4 with 3:57 remaining in the second quarter, UMass responded with five unanswered scores—two before the half and three after—to pull away. Manny and Art Kell each had a pair of tallies during that stretch, while Steve D’Amario also scored before Alex White finally answered for the Crimson, scoring a man-up goal off a pass from tri-captain Kevin Vaughan with 4:31 to go in the third.
“A lot of it just came down to [the fact that] they had the ball a lot more than us,” tri-captain Terry White said. “Whenever we got on offense, we were way too tentative, and once we got behind they did a good job of slowing the game down, and that makes everything a lot harder.”
After UMass’ Kyle Smith scored off teammate Mike Fetterly’s third assist of the night, making the score 12-5, Alex White completed a hat trick by beating Massachusetts goalie Tim McCormack with 1:12 to go in the period.
But the Minutemen attack came roaring back with four straight goals to open the final quarter, with Manny, Kell, Connor Mooney, and Anthony Biscardi all scoring against Crimson freshman goalie Jake Gambitsky to put UMass up double-digits, 16-6.
“Manny is an exceptional player, but other than that there’s just a lot of guys who work well together,” White said. “They were just relentless.... We didn’t stick with them.”
Following slashing and pushing penalties on UMass’ Tom Celentani and Vincent Travaglini, respectively, Harvard added two late man-up goals. Freshman Will Walker beat McCormack off a pass from Vaughan with 2:16 to go for his second goal of the night, and Walker then assisted Cohen, who finally got on the board with 1:38 remaining. But by then, the game was far out of reach.
“They just kind of jumped on us early, and never really let up,” White said. “I think as a team it was certainly an eye-opening game for us.”
The Minutemen got out to a quick 2-0 lead on goals by Kell and Manny in the contest’s first five minutes. Sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp cut the deficit in half 8:30 into the opening quarter, but that goal was all the Crimson’s second-leading scorer would be able to muster the rest of the night.
“Danny’s a guy who thrives off his change of direction and his speed,” White said. “They played him very loosely behind the cage, so it didn’t really give him the chance to get a step on his guy.”
Biscardi and Manny responded with scores midway through the period for UMass before Vaughan found junior attackman Jack Walker for a goal with just one second remaining in the first.
Will Walker got Harvard within one at 4-3 at the 13:19 mark of the second, but Biscardi responded with his second goal a minute later, and Bobby Tyler added a score two minutes after that.
“UMass is excellent offensively,” Wojcik said. “We had some breakdowns defensively, but they’re that talented. They have good players and they move the ball extremely well.”
Still undefeated in league play, the Crimson will need to turn things around quickly as it moves into the heart of its conference season.
“Tonight was tough,” White said. “We just weren’t anywhere near our true potential. Hopefully we can take the loss the right way and keep learning from the things we did wrong.... But it was a big opportunity for us, and it just kind of stunk to get run over like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard softball team hosted a game at Soldiers Field, it was the second contest of the 2011 Ivy League Championship against Cornell, and the Crimson came away with a 4-0 win that earned the team the title of Ivy Champs.
It was the ultimate redemption for Harvard, who had been defeated by the Big Red in the final round of the 2010 championships.
But on Tuesday night, the Crimson (12-7) was unable to redeem itself or make use of its home field advantage, falling, 15-6, in its home opener against Bryant University (6-14). The defeat marks Harvard’s second consecutive loss against Bryant and ties the squads’ all-time series at four games apiece.
The first four innings of the game looked promising for the Crimson, as the team entered the top of the fifth with a 3-1 lead. But the Bulldogs responded with a nine-run rally in the frame, and almost immediately, any hope of Harvard retribution for last year’s 6-3 loss to the Bulldogs vanished.
“We had a tough day today,” senior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “But it’s great incentive for us going into Ivies this weekend. [We need] to turn it around in practice tomorrow and work hard to show Harvard softball on Saturday, because we didn’t show how strong of a team we are today.”
Don’t let the high score fool you—neither squad’s offense had a particularly stellar day. Rather, it was the unusually meager performance of both team’s infield that led to such a high number of runs coming in.
Though Bryant finished with seven hits, only one more than the Crimson, it won the contest by nine runs, thanks in large part to 13 walked batters to Harvard’s four.
In the fifth inning alone, the Bulldogs earned three runs because batters were walked with the bases loaded.
Wild pitches also played a prominent role in Bryant’s victory. In the first inning, the Bulldogs’ designated hitter Lauren Guy was able to nab the team a one-run lead after advancing two bases on two wild pitches. In total, though both squads stole just one base each, the Bryant offense advanced an extra thirteen bases on eight wild pitches, while the Crimson took an additional three bases.
Harvard was able to capitalize on Bryant infield errors in the third inning, gaining a 2-1 advantage on the Bulldogs as Alexander and rookie center fielder Camilla Gibson scored on two throwing errors.
The Crimson extended its lead to 3-1 in the fourth frame, when freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz reached first on fielder’s choice, and sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson beat the throw to home plate.
But this would be the last time Harvard would have the lead, as Bryant went on to plate nine runs at the top of the fifth inning. Despite ripping only two hits, the squad grabbed a 10-3 advantage over the Crimson due to a combination of five walks, two errors, one wild pitch, and one batter hit by a pitch.
During this inning, Harvard switched pitchers twice, first putting in rookie Gabrielle Ruiz for co-captain Rachel Brown, and then after six batters, replacing Ruiz with junior Jessica Ferri, who would go on to pitch the final two innings of the contest.
In the sixth inning, the Bulldogs dug the Crimson into an even deeper hole, extending their lead to 13-3.
Harvard tried to climb out of this ten-run hole with a three-run rally at the bottom of the inning, but Bryant quickly put an end to any possibility of a Crimson comeback, plating two more at the top of the seventh.
The Harvard offense was unable to bring any players home while up for its last licks, and the game ended in a 15-6 victory for the Bulldogs.
Despite the loss, the Crimson still tops the Ancient Eight in strikeouts, ERA, fielding percentage, and opposing batting average.
“We were facing some adversity,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We need to work through some things, and we just need to get stronger and work harder the next few days. I know the girls can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is no secret that despite more and more rigorous admissions policies, there are certain high schools that send a disproportionate number of students to Harvard. Boston Latin, Philips Exeter and Philips Andover, the list goes on; all these schools have long established academic traditions that allow their students to distinguish themselves for the admissions office.
There are certain schools that endear themselves to Dean Fitzsimmons and company for another reason: their athletic programs. Over the next few weeks, I will be exploring this interplay between academics and athletics in the admissions process. Last time, we took a look at two public schools in California, Corona del Mar and Los Gatos, which almost exclusively send athletes to Harvard. Now we shift our focus to a public school in Harvard’s backyard: the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Despite sending upwards of 10 students to Harvard every year, CRLS student-athletes are a rarity on Crimson rosters.
PROXIMITY AND PERFORMANCE
The Cambridge Rindge and Latin School is located at 1640 Cambridge Street, about a two-minute walk from Memorial Hall and Annenberg. In 1977, Rindge Technical School and Cambridge Latin High School merged to form CRLS—the only public high school in Cambridge—which now serves 1,616 students, grades 9-12.
The original school was founded in 1648 after the general court of Cambridge, heavily influenced by the first graduating Harvard class of 1642, decreed that parents would be required to properly educate their children. It has since maintained a strong connection with the college, serving as the high school for poet E.E. Cummings ’15 A.M. ’16, mathematician Damodar Kosambi ’29 and Matt Damon, formerly ’92.
“We only have one high school in Cambridge,” said Senior Admissions Officer David L. Evans, the Harvard admissions officer responsible for the Cambridge area. “This is a city with many resourceful parents, parents who are teaching at Harvard, MIT, BU, UMass, the list goes on. Sociologists have shown over the years that there is a very strong correlation between the educational and economic resources of a parent and the performance of students academically. So we appreciate the high performing students that apply [from CRLS].”
Evans estimated that any given year between 40 and 50 CRLS students apply to Harvard, with the acceptance rate for Rindge students last year being 21 percent—compared to a 6.1 percent overall acceptance rate.
What distinguishes CRLS from other high schools with similarly high acceptance rates is that it is public and not a magnet school. Indeed, CRLS is often touted as one of the most diverse high schools in the country, serving students of over 83 nationalities and a wide range of socio-economic levels.
“I loved being a student there,” Josiah Bonsey ’14 said. “It was a great place to go to high school. I attribute the high number to an excellent education that we received at Rindge. [It was] just a really stellar education that left me mentally and physically prepared for college.”
The diversity of the school makes for a unique social and academic experience. Despite sending so many students on to schools like Harvard, the school’s Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) scores for 10th graders lag behind the state average in English Language Arts, Math, and Science, with an even more pronounced difference between those Rindge students considered “Low-Income” and those considered “Non-Low Income.”
“The culture here for students is very jam-packed,” CRLS Athletic Director MaryAnn Cappello said. “Whether some of the students have to have a part-time job to help out at home or are involved in any number of clubs or activities, they spread themselves very thin.”
THE FALCONS
CRLS fields 30 teams and has had varying levels of athletic success. The Falcons’ basketball team in the 1980’s sported Basketball Hall of Famer and NCAA National Champion at Georgetown Patrick Ewing, as well as NCAA Champion at Michigan and NBA journeyman, Rumeal Robinson.
“Not since Patrick Ewing have we had a guy playing at such a high level in such a high profile sport coming out of Rindge,” said Bonsey who captained his high school swimming team. “It’s kind of big news when someone goes D-1 from Rindge.”
Alma Lafler ’13-14, walked onto the Harvard sailing team and crewed her freshman and sophomore seasons. She is currently taking a leave of absence and is working at an internship with the Cambridge Public School System. She is the only recent CRLS graduate on a Crimson roster.
“Rindge has a great sailing program and we were all encouraged to learn a lot,” Lafler said. “We weren’t pushed in a negative overly competitive direction, and they really encouraged participation from all levels and abilities. In a sport like sailing, it’s great to see a diverse group of kids getting access to an often inaccessible sport.”
Cappello, who has been in her position as athletic director for the past four years, attributed the lack of CRLS student-athletes competing in college to a culture that promotes other endeavors above athletic success.
“I’ve been in the school system for 35 years, and when I came into this position [as athletic director] and tried to identify how to cultivate student-athletes, I realized that the biggest problem is that they don’t work out in the offseason,” Cappello said. “They’re just not interested until the first day of practices. It’s the culture that we’re dealing with in a city like Cambridge, and we’re trying to change the culture. You go out to the ’burbs, and those kids—whether they’re a three season athlete or a one season athlete—they’re still playing in the offseason. They’re playing club; they’re playing all the time.”
The school began an ambitious renovation campaign in 2009 that aimed to fix up facilities that had not been changed since the 1970s, athletic and otherwise.
“When I was [a student] there, Rindge was in a real period of transition,” Bonsey said. “From outdated and run down facilities, to really new, better, cleaner facilities. Our pool went from being one of the grossest places, and now we have just the most beautiful pool. I think the athletic facilities are improving every year, as opposed to falling apart as they had been for a number of years. The locker rooms were kind of lovable in a way, but kind of grimy. Now it’s sparkling, and maybe that will translate into better athletic performance.”
Cappello won’t be holding her breath. An offseason workout program that was open to the entire student body yielded only 10 participants between the winter and spring seasons. But Cappello noted that the stated goal of the CRLS athletic department is not to produce high-performing athletes, but rather high-performing student-athletes.
“I definitely think that the philosophy of the school is to have well-rounded individuals,” Cappello said. “Students that go here go to all the Ivy League colleges across the board. Kids from Rindge can go anywhere in the country. I think being involved in athletics certainly helps you to develop your time management skills, and as an athletic director, I’d love to see more athletes going D-1.”
Cappello was recently taked with reviewing students’ report cards to determine their spring season eligibility.
“It’s just amazing looking at what some of these students are up to, and you think, ‘Oh my goodness, there’s only 24 hours in a day, how do they manage all that?’” Cappello said. “Then you review their report cards, and you look at these kids, and they have all A’s, and they’re three season athletes. If we can have talented, well-rounded, healthy students, then I think we’re doing a good job.”
THE HARVARD CONNECTION
Despite the proximity and the proclivity for sending students to Harvard, Crimson athletics do not hold a place of esteem in the collective consciousness of the students at CRLS.
“No one really follows Harvard sports in Cambridge,” Bonsey said. “The only college sport that people really follow up here is the Beanpot and BU-BC hockey. But even that is not that big compared to the pro Boston sports.”
One need only look at the near-empty stands at a Harvard football game to realize that local enthusiasm for the Crimson is middling at best.
“When I was working in the elementary school, a person from the Harvard athletic department would send me tickets for the kids to go to Harvard basketball games,” Cappello said. “That generated a little interest, but there’s really not much of a following.”
Though Harvard does not rely on local support for its athletic department like many other schools around the country, the Crimson’s run to the NCAA tournament did energize an otherwise disinterested community.
“We would have loved to have seen Harvard go on in the NCAA tournament, so we could watch them play in Boston Garden,” Cappello said. “That would have been super, and I think really would have gotten people excited about Harvard in a way that they never have been before. Unfortunately, they lost.”
There is, for a variety of reasons, a level of disinterest in Harvard as an institution from the students at CRLS.
“As far as students thinking about going to Harvard, some of them will say ‘I don’t want to go to or apply to Harvard because it’s in Cambridge. I’ve lived here all my life, I want to get out,’” Cappello said.
Still, as the application numbers show, the proverbial ‘university at the top of the hill’ does have a significant draw on CRLS students considering their college options.
“It’s great being in Cambridge still,” said Bonsey of attending school in his hometown. “A lot of people want to go to college and kind of get out of their hometown. But for me it was more about being in a place that I really love. I love being in Cambridge; I love the people here. Of course, Harvard is Harvard. You’re not really going to find a school like this anywhere else, and the fact that it was in my hometown made it a pretty easy decision.”
For many student-athletes at Rindge who could play at the Division III level, compromises are made to attend Harvard.
“For me, I always knew I wanted to keep sailing just because I loved it so much,” Lafler said. “The competition level really rises in college in a lot of sports, but for sailing there’s a smaller community and so it’s a bit easier to continue in college. For a lot of my classmates, there were a lot of factors to consider, but Harvard worked out pretty perfect for me.”
Whether embraced or resented, the effect Harvard has had on the city of Cambridge vice versa is undeniable. It remains to be seen if that relationship will transfer more conspicuously onto the playing fields at Rindge and for the Crimson.
“My guess is that things won’t change,” Bonsey said. “[Rindge has] never been an athletic power house in anything, and neither has Harvard. I’m a big sports fan, but I’m fine with things being that way.”

CORRECTION: April 5
 In an earlier version of this article, Josiah Bonsey ’14 said that a student from his alma mater, Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, is recruited to play a Division I sport in college every few years. Though the athletic director at the high school declined to provide the exact number of students who are recruited to play Division I sports, the average is in fact more than one per year.

On May 23, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  will address Harvard Law School's graduating third-years as the  Commencement Class Day Speaker. Holder, who recently led the Justice Department to vote against a voter ID law in Texas, was  nominated by President Barack Obama to become the 82nd Attorney  General of the U.S. in 2008. Eleven years earlier, in 1997, Holder became  the first African-American to be named deputy attorney general. The  Class Day Program at HLS will take place on Holmes Field, with a  reception to be held afterwards.

Although there was a brief scare last year when researchers thought that neutrinos had broken the speed of light, the laws of physics haven't thrown our conceptions of speed many curveballs in the past year. Until a few days ago, that is. Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced that there might be planets which tear across the universe at many millions of miles per hour. In a paper to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, researchers Idan Ginsburg, Avi Loeb, and Gary Wegner confirm the possibility of these "hypervelocity planets."
Many of these planets move at around 1.5 million miles per hour, but some can get up to a whopping 30 million miles per hour, making them some of the fastest known objects in the universe. They are created when a supermassive black hole, such as the one at the center of our galaxy, shreds apart two stars and sends one hurtling off into the nether.
These high velocity stars have been known about for some time, but the idea posited by Ginsburg, Loeb, and Wegner is that these stars may have planets orbiting around them which either travel with them through space or are ripped off and hurtled at amazing speeds, alone.
According to Abraham "Avi" Loeb, the chair of the Astronomy Department at Harvard, this discovery represents exciting conclusions for the future of the universe.
"Because the universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate, eventually all light sources outside of the Milky Way will move away from us at a rate faster than the speed of light, leaving us in darkness," said Loeb. "In the distant future, the only sign of a universe outside of the Milky Way will be high velocity stars and their hypervelocity planets."
