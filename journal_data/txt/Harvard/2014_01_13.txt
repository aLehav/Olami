After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before their final competition at Blodgett Pool, the seniors lined up in a row to be honored with roses and speeches for their commitment to Harvard women’s swimming and diving team. These seniors and their younger teammates challenged fellow Ivy, Brown, at home on Saturday afternoon in what was a blowout victory for both the male and female Crimson swimmers.
The women of the Harvard team (3-1, 3-1 Ivy) defeated the Bears (4-1, 0-1), 202-98. The win marks the Crimson’s 11th consecutive win against Brown.
“[The eleventh win] is a testament to how strong Harvard swimming is,” senior Sara Li said. “We really built up a legacy and a tradition. It is something that we are really proud of, especially being a senior. We realize how lucky we are to be a part of such a successful team.”
The Harvard women’s team finished the day with a total of 12 event wins. The meet commenced with a splash for the women, as Li, sophomores Danielle Lee and Kendall Crawford, and rookie Victoria Chan took the gold in the 200 medley relay. The foursome finished the relay in 1:44:88, earning Harvard 11 points.
“We didn't even realize Brown was there,” Li said. “We were having so much fun and were swimming so strongly. The relay win was an awesome way to start off the meet, but in general we were barely looking at the other team.”
Three of the four swimmers, however, were not done. Each shined individually later on in the meet. Li once again brought home a first-place finish for the class of 2014 in the 50 free, finding the wall in 23.69 seconds. Crawford garnered another top spot with her 200 backstroke finish in 2:01.48. Lee picked up three additionally event wins following the 200 relay: 100 backstroke, 100 free, and 200 individual medley.
“We really dominated a lot of the events,” Li said, “We were able to get the top spots in most of them.”
Another notable quartet, sophomore Sherry Liu, junior Kelsey Hojan-Clark, freshman Willa Wang, and sophomore Marlee Erlich nabbed the top-four spots in the 1000 freestyle. Liu clocked in her first-place finish at 9:58:97.
“We are in the midst of some really tough training right now,” Li said. “So to get this win really means a lot to us. It was a fun meet to be a part of. Everyone was so energetic, and we swam really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Another year, another shutout. For the third consecutive year, the Harvard men’s squash team blanked conference foe Penn on the courts.  The No. 2 ranked Crimson (7-0, 3-0 Ivy) allowed No. 13 Penn (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) just one game in the entire contest, taking the win, 9-0, at the Murr Center. 
Besides remaining undefeated, Harvard has yet to lose a single individual match this season, making this one of the longest shutout streaks for the program in recent history.
“It was a big win for us,” captain Gary Power said. “But it was also exactly what we expected from ourselves today.”
Penn had not won a match in a contest with the Crimson since 2011, and today’s competition did not mark an end to the drought for the Quakers. Harvard continued its momentum from Saturday’s win over seventh-ranked Princeton, sweeping Penn in straight sets in eight of the nine matches.
“I think we all played pretty well, especially since we come off such tough competition yesterday,” freshman Bryan Koh said. “It was the kind of match where we all had to keep our focus and not be overconfident.”
Senior Ali Farag, the 2012 CSA national champion, got the Crimson off to a strong start while playing in the first position, winning in straight sets against the Quakers’ Liam Quinn.  After winning only one point in the first game, Quinn bounced back in the second two sets to add 11 more points.  But his newfound momentum was not enough, as Farag outmaneuvered Quinn, 11-1, 11-5, 11-6, to kick off the scoring for Harvard.
The Crimson’s rookies had an especially strong showing, as both of the team’s freshmen notched straight set victories for Harvard.  Dylan Murray, playing at the third position, handily defeated Penn’s August Frank, 11-7, 11-4, 11-7, while Koh fought through a tough second game, 14-12, to register the win.
“Bryan and Dylan both came in and won some tough matches,” Power said. “The young players have been playing very well this year, which is always a good thing.”
The eighth and ninth seeds for Harvard also picked up key wins, as senior Tom Mullaney and junior Tyler Olson blanked their opponents 3-0 to round out the shutout.  Both Mullaney and Olson improved their records to 6-0.
George Lemmon provided Penn’s only highlight, winning a game before ultimately losing to Crimson sophomore Nick Hopcroft.  After losing the first two games, 11-8, 11-8, Lemmon managed to turn the tables, claiming the third set in identical fashion, 8-11.  But he was unable to keep this momentum going as Hopcroft took the final set, 11-4. This win marked Hopcroft’s sixth of the season.
Harvard senior Brandon McLaughlin had the most decisive win of the day, sweeping his opponent, Tyler Odell, in straight sets to win at the second position for the Crimson.  McLaughlin allowed Odell only 6 points in the match, a team low for the day.  With the victory, McLaughlin improved his season record to 4-0.
“Brandon’s been playing absolutely incredible,” Power said. “Yesterday, he beat one of Princeton’s top players, a guy who was first team All-American and sixth ranked nationally last year, for the first time ever. Today was really just him repeating a good performance.”
Fourth-seeded Power and fifth-seeded senior Nigel Koh helped keep the streak alive, claiming decisive victories for Harvard.  Both Power and Koh won in straight sets, as Power took down Derek Chilvers, 11-3, 11-8, 11-4, and Koh fought off Rahil Fazelbhoy, 11-9, 11-2, 11-7.
With two key conference wins this weekend, the Crimson will look to keep this momentum in the coming weeks.  Harvard will return to action January 25th at the Murr Center when the squad goes head to head with St. Lawrence, Rochester and Toronto.
“Now it’s just a matter of us keeping our fitness up and focusing on every match,” Bryan Koh said. “Obviously, the goal is to win, and I think that we are in a position where we can absolutely do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Winter break is not yet over and Dartmouth’s famous Winter Carnival hasn’t yet occurred, but the Harvard track and field team’s season is just getting started. On Sunday, the Crimson traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire, to compete at the Dartmouth Relays, where the women’s and men’s teams placed second and third among 14 schools, respectively. 
“This meet showed us what steps we need to take in the next few months,” junior Jarvis Harris said. “We need to keep running more meets, and try to do our best to win these upcoming meets. All of our [competitions] are stepping stones for our greatest challenge at the Ivy League Championships.”
Harris placed first overall in the 60m hurdles, setting a meet record of 8.10 seconds. He also ran as part of the 4x200 relay team, which placed first at 1:29:89, along with freshmen Mekdim Ashebo and James Heckendorn, and senior Jared Kadich.
“[Our team’s overall third place finish] was a nice start to the season,” Harris said. “This was some people’s first meet competing this season; it was nice getting our feet wet going into the season. It shows us where we are now, but also where we could be in our performances.”
This weekend’s competition not only allowed the Crimson to race against Eastern powers Dartmouth, UMass Lowell, Williams and Boston College, but also allowed them to run on the track where the Ivy League championship meet will take place March 1 and 2.
The 4x400 relay team, comprised of Kadich, Heckendorn, and seniors Scott Miller and Erik Kraus, placed fourth overall.
Other highlights on the men’s side included sophomore Mark Hill’s second place long jump at 6.59m, and junior Ben Glauser’s second place performance in the shot put at 17.16m. Freshman Joshua Whitener placed second overall in the weight throw with an 18.21m toss.
“How we work, our dedication, and the effort we put in [during the rest of break] really determines how we do during our season,” Harris said. “...We will take that and incorporate it into our training, starting tomorrow in practice.”
The women’s team was led by freshmen Nikki Okwelogu, Jade Miller, Jackie Modesett, Sylvia Deppen, and Raegan Nizdil, who all placed at the meet as the Crimson took home second place behind Dartmouth.
“I think a lot of [the freshmen] realized that they are a big part of the team,” sophomore triple jumper Sophia Randolph said. “We recruited a really strong class this year and they are going to play a significant role in scoring. We are really counting on them to be an important part of the team.”
Okwelogu threw the shot put 14.08m, placing third overall, and Miller placed fourth in the 60m hurdles finals behind sophomore teammate Autumne Franklin (8.68s). In the high jump, Nizdil placed third, jumping 1.69m, followed by sophomore Allison Morrison and junior Ann Giebelhaus, who tied for fifth.
“We came in second place to Dartmouth,” Randolph said. “We didn’t have a full team and some people did events that were out of their normal range. I think our coaches could have been a bit happier, but there are things to be happy about and things to learn from.”
Junior Danielle Barbian placed second overall in the 60m dash (7.63s), and sophomore Kieran Gallagher placed second in the 800m (2:16.53). Senior Adabelle Ekechukwu tossed the weight throw 19.55m, bringing home first place in the category. Freshman Madeline Zimmerman placed fourth in the triple jump, reaching 10.44m, followed by Randolph, who placed sixth.
“The meet gave me a good idea in terms of what things I need to be working on more in practice,” Randolph said. “I think a lot of people felt the same, that it was kind of a getting-out-the-cobwebs meet, but also giving a clear image of what we have now and how much further we can go in future meets, especially for the freshmen.”
Both relay teams placed first at the races as well; the 4x200 included sophomore Christi Scott, Barbian, and juniors Ashley Collinsworth and Gabrielle Scott and the 4x400 runners were Franklin, Christi Scott, Gabrielle Scott and senior Olivia Abbate.
“We need to really get after it every day in practice and at every meet and recognize that every meet counts in terms of preparing for the championships,” Randolph said. “Working hard at this point matters down the road; we have to try to focus on the little things that can shape the big picture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know that Houston Rockets point guard Jeremy Lin, Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, and maybe even ATP star James Blake graduated with Harvard degrees, but they’re the exceptions to the Harvard kids are all brains, right? Not so fast – there are other Crimson alums out there. The Back Page takes a closer look at a few notable ones, with more to follow.
Brains—and Brawn: Matt Birk ’98
Two-time All-Pro, six Pro Bowl appearances, Super Bowl ring wearer…and Harvard football star? Scouts told Sports Illustrated the 305 pound (at the time of the 1998 NFL draft) lineman “may be the best Ivy League prospect to come along in several years.”
Boy, were they right.
After a decorated career at Harvard in which Birk was an All-Ivy, All-New England, and All-ECAC lineman, and let the Crimson to the Ivy title in 1997, Birk moved onto the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings’ sixth round draft pick.
After two seasons of relative obscurity as a backup offensive lineman, Birk got his chance in 2000 starting at center for the Vikings. He started every Vikings game for the next four years before losing the next two to injury.
But the Harvard product fought his way back to top form, turning in solid season with the Vikings and the Baltimore Ravens. In his final season with the Ravens, Birk anchored a solid offensive line that supported the team on its Super Bowl XLVII title journey. Representing the Crimson well, he was also named the sixth smartest athlete by Sporting News in 2010.
Even before retiring, Birk made an impact both on and off the field, earning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award for his work with at-risk youth in the Baltimore and surrounding areas. Though he had signed a three-year deal with the Ravens less than a year prior, Birk hung up the pads this past February.
The Moore Trio: Mark ’00, Steve ’01, and Dominic ’03
 
Older Harvard hockey fans may remember the 1999-2000 season that saw all three brothers play on the same Crimson team. They were the first – and only – band of brothers to play on the same Harvard team and the sixth trio in NCAA ice hockey history.
Intriguingly, the only one of the three Moore brothers – Mark – to not play in the NHL was nicknamed “The Smartest Man In Hockey”, with a reported 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT, according to his biography. Mark suffered a concussion in 2002 while playing for the ECHL team Augusta Lynx and had to turn down a tryout with the NHL’s Montreal Canadiens the next year due to lingering post-concussion syndromes.
All three Moore brothers were drafted by NHL teams, with Steve claiming the honors of being the highest pick at 53rd in the second round of the 1998 entry draft by the Colorado Avalanche. After a successful career with the Crimson, Steve went on to play in parts of four seasons for the Avalanche, tallying 12 points over that time.
But in 2004, Steve was on the receiving end of a vicious hit in the infamous Bertuzzi Incident and suffered fractured vertebrae and a concussion. The hit effectively ended his NHL career.
On a much brighter side, Dominic, the youngest of the bunch, is still playing in the NHL and has appeared in over 500 NHL games. After sitting out the 2012-2013 season, the 1999-2000 Ivy League Rookie of the Year signed with the New York Rangers, the team that drafted him with the 95th pick out of Harvard. Dominic, who is tenth on Harvard’s all-time goals scored list, has three goals and four assists for the Rangers this year.
Blast to the Past: Ted Donato ‘91
 
Before you ask, coach Donato isn’t playing anymore; the current Harvard hockey coach hung up his skates a few years back. But in his prime, Donato was a force to be reckoned with.
Selected 98th by the hometown Boston Bruins in the 1987 draft, Donato went on to score 14 goals and 37 assists for Harvard’s NCAA national championship team. It was Harvard’s first – and only –  NCAA title, and Donato was the tournament MVP with two goals in the Crimson’s 4-3 overtime victory over Minnesota in front of 61,418 thundering fans in St. Paul, MN.
After a down year, Donato stormed back to tally 56 points in 28 games in his senior campaign, but the Crimson would go on to fall in the ECAC semifinals. He would finish his collegiate career with 50 goals.
The 5’10” forward continued to shine at the higher level, scoring four goals in eight matches at the 1992 Winter Olympics. He then transitioned to the NHL, playing eight years for the Bruins before bouncing around the league. Eight different teams later, Donato was back with Boston for his final season, racking up 11 points in 63 games.
Finishing his NHL career with 347 points in 796 games, Donato immediately took over the helm of the Harvard hockey program upon retirement, guiding the Crimson to a 21-10-3 record in his first season as coach. The following season saw a Donato-led Harvard team capture the Ivy League and ECAC championships. He continues to coach the Crimson to this day.

The Harvard wrestling team kept it close, but ultimately fell short in a series of tight matches at the Boston Duals on Sunday. The team went 1-2 on the day with a victory against Binghamton, and losses to Army and American. 
The Crimson defeated the Bearcats by a final score of 22-15, but the Eagles notched a 25-12 victory, and the Black Knights took down Harvard, 25-13.
“Overall, we might have been expecting a bit more from ourselves, but there were definitely some positive things to take from [the match],” sophomore Jeffrey Ott said.
The last time out, Harvard faced Rutgers, where it suffered its first loss of the season, winning five of ten bouts. But injuries have plagued the team in its past few meets, making things more difficult for the remaining wrestlers.
The team was forced to forfeit at the 125 pound position against each of Sunday’s three teams, putting it down six points before a wrestler had even taken the mat.
“I thought we wrestled well, but our team is a little banged up right now,” sophomore Todd Preston said. “We’re doing well, all things considered, but we still have to make some big improvements for where we want to be. We want to be a top 25 team.”
Preston led the Crimson, going 3-0 on the day. He earned decisions over American freshman Tom Paige, 5-0, Binghamton’s Nick Tighe, 4-2, and Army senior Tyler Rauenzahn, 5-3. The victories put Preston at 13-7 for the year and undefeated in dual meets.
With two wins apiece, Ott and senior Paul Liguori were strong competitors for Harvard.  In the 133 pound class, Ott earned major decisions over Bearcat sophomore Mike Sardo, 10-0, and Black Knight sophomore Justin Seim, 13-1, both of which earned the team bonus points. In the 165 pound class, Liguori recorded victories against Eagle sophomore Marco Peralta and Binghamton sophomore Vincent Grella.
The Binghamton victory was sandwiched between the American and Army losses. Sophomore Nicholas Stager, freshman Tyler Grimaldi, and senior Ian Roy also contributed to the victory over the Bearcats. The team as a whole was able to string six straight victories together, putting it in position for a victory. Losses in the final three matches tightened the margin, but Binghamton was unable to make up the deficit.
Facing the Black Knights, the Crimson went up 7-6 after victories in the 133 and 141 pound bouts, with victories from Ott and Preston, but a pin by Army freshman Mark Marchetti against Stager in 6:12 in the 149 pound match led to five straight Black Knight victories, putting a Harvard victory out of reach.
Preston and Liguori secured the only Crimson victories against American, as the Eagles led the entire meet. The team had a chance late in the meet for a comeback with a score of 15-9 after Liguori’s’s victory, but losses in the 174, 197, and 285 pound classes secured the victory for American.
Throughout the entire day, many individual bouts were decided by only a point or two, which made a difference in the final outcome of the team events and is something the team plans on working on for the future. On the day, Harvard won six of its twelve victories by a margin of two or less.
“There was a fair amount of battling in close matches,” Ott said. “We were able to pull out some pretty close wins in overtime and right at the end of the third period, so that’s always nice to see. It’s important to win those close matches. That’s a big improvement from earlier on in the season.”
Despite closing out more tight matches, there is still room to progress, as five of 15 losses were also within two points.
“Some things didn’t go our way, but we can’t let small things get in the way,” Preston said. “We let the refs get in the way in some of our matches, which affected the turnout, but we can’t let the refs dictate the match.”
There will be little room for error the next time the Crimson takes the mat, as it faces an Ivy League rival, No. 6 Cornell, on January 18th.
“A lot of the matches we lost were all within a point or two,” Preston said. “The biggest thing we have to work on for next week is minimizing [close losses], especially going to Cornell, who are a top 10-team. We’re going to have to try and win some close matches, and that’s going to be a game changer. That’s how we can beat Cornell.”

The College’s top administrator has invited undergraduates to join him on a museum tour, as well as discuss his most recent book recommendation.
It’s no secret that Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, the former director of the Harvard University Herbaria, is a systematic botanist—he’s referenced his interests in plant biology and fungi more than once since he took up the post of dean and began sending students regular messages from his own email account.
In line with those interests, Pfister suggested in an email to students Thursday that “it might be fun” to take a group of students on a tour of the Harvard Natural History Museum in about two weeks.
We at Flyby predict that such a tour would indeed be fun.
So would taking up Pfister’s invitation to join him in discussing the book “The Signature of All Things” by Elizabeth Gilbert (which he recommended in a previous email).
“I am curious as to whether any of you have taken me up on my recommendation,” Pfister wrote. “If you have, and you would like to put together a little discussion group, contact me so that I may determine as to whether there is sufficient interest.”
We can’t think of many things cooler than a book club with the dean, although Pfister calling out your blog in one of his emails—like he did to the creator of “lolmythesis” on Thursday—might come close (#celebritystatus).
