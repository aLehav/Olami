After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One-third the guy who wrote the Grammy-nominated Bruno Mars hit “Grenade” (Andrew Wyatt) and two-thirds the team behind Britney Spears’ early aughts-defining “Toxic” (Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg), Miike Snow know their way around a pop song. With the release of their eponymous debut LP in 2009, the trio rose to the forefront of the indie electro-pop movement that dominated the college kid musical aesthetic at the turn of the last decade. Following a four-year hiatus, they’ve dropped their long-anticipated third album, “iii,” and are gearing up for a hectic summer that includes appearances at Boston Calling and Governors Ball. Prior to the start of their tour, Wyatt sat down with The Crimson to talk the band’s beginnings, the process of producing an album from three different continents, and the irreverence of Miike Snow.
The Harvard Crimson: You and your bandmates have written some of the most famous pop tracks of the last two decades. What drove you guys to form a band and move from backstage as producers into the spotlight as performers?
Andrew Wyatt: When you’re writing a song with a big pop artist, your goal is to try to be impactful in a way in which the economy of the songwriting is streamlined for maximum immediacy. Miike Snow is done with a lot more aleatory elements. Basically, with Miike Snow, whatever we do in the studio, that’s the album. There’s no, like, “This is not poppy enough,” “The chorus isn’t good enough.” Obviously there’s an overlap with your intentions when you’re doing a big song for somebody like Bruno [Mars] or Britney [Spears] or something, but with Miike Snow, we don’t worry about whether some A&R guy is going to love this song. That’s what it boils down to. We just do what we like to do, and then that’s the song, you know? When you’re doing an album there’s a management layer; there’s an A&R layer; there’s the label; there’s all these other mechanics, hoops to jump through. With Miike Snow, we decide when the album’s done. Making the music in Miike Snow is something that comes very quickly to us. There’s a feeling of freedom to it.
THC: What’s the process of making an album together like?
AW: For the first two albums, we were all three in the same room, making the beats.... This album, I did half the record with me and Christian in a room and half the album with me and Pontus in a room because Christian was living in Bangkok and Pontus was living in Stockholm and I was living in LA. Pretty much we segmented the globe into thirds doing that. We did it logistically the only way we could; those guys have kids, and so basically we did half the record in Stockholm—I did it with Pontus—and half the record it was Christian and I in LA. We start with the music and then figure out what kind of an approach is going to go good on top of that with the vocals, then pick the songs that are going to go together best on the album.
THC: So you guys have only recently started playing shows together again, right, since you’ve been geographically separate? Has it been challenging getting back in the swing of things after not doing it for four years, especially since you’re going on a major tour this summer?
AW: Oh, yeah. It’s one thing to sing a song in a studio and have infinite takes or be able to chop pieces and edit takes of the vocals. [But] singing it live, you know—it takes a while to get my throat around these new songs. Some of them are very high in the register. And then also the technical aspects of pulling off what we do live—it’s a very thorough process of everything from the sonics and the mix and getting that right to the mechanics of performing the songs live and putting on a show and entertaining people as well. That’s a very, very involved process, and there’s many layers to it and it takes a while to get it right. So I would say the first few thousand people who saw us play were not getting the same show that they’re going to get now. We got it pretty tight by Coachella, which was kind of our goal all along.
THC: Speaking of Coachella, you’re playing a ton of festivals this summer. What’s the rationale there? Do you prefer festivals over solo shows?
AW: No—oftentimes, when you’re promoting a record, [playing festivals] is probably a great way of getting new people into your band. You’re able to play for 20, 30 thousand people at one time, whereas with our own shows they probably max out with considerably fewer people. If we were going to do a headlining show, you know, you can only play for a few thousand people at once. So we’re going to do both, because I think there are some experiences you can’t give people in a festival setting that you can give them in your live show. But when your album is brand new and you’re just trying to introduce people to some of the songs, I think going out and doing the festivals is a good way of introducing your music to people. I think also the way we play live is exciting in a different way than the way albums are exciting. If you put out an album, you also want to present what you do live to for as many people as you can.
THC: Yeah, and your latest album definitely has a different feel from your first two. “Miike Snow” and “Happy to You” were characterized by that quintessential indie electro-pop sound, whereas there’s more of a hip-hop undercurrent on “iii.” What inspired you to go in that direction for this album?
AW: I think a lot of stuff sounds, now, kind of the way our first record sounded in that it had sort of a hushed melancholy to it. I think a lot of people are doing that now. And as soon as everybody starts doing something, that’s when I want to do something else. It pisses me off, kind of, when people all sound the same. So I think you just on some level have to be ready to burn whatever you’ve built when you’re doing art, if you want to keep it interesting. We just started pulling up a lot of these hip-hop beats that didn’t sound like anything that was going on in music now, and that’s when I was excited. And that’s why Miike Snow kind of reserves this special place for all of us, I think. It’s like a place where we can be really experimental and playful while at the same time writing pop songs—but [also] do something that is irreverent to what is going on. I do think we did that on the first record, too, and I don’t know whether it influenced a lot of people or not, but I definitely think that it was one of the first records that had those elements to them in that time period. You don’t really win unless you take the risk.

“Life’s full of clatter, but none of it matters,” the smooth voice of Joshuah B. Campbell ’16 rang out in a haunting recording about halfway through the first act of “The Wonderful World of Dissocia.” On stage, puppet master Alona R. Bach ’16, dressed in angelic white and wearing her hair in youthful pigtails, cradled and maneuvered a polar bear as the voiceover song continued, “Only who’ll hold your paw when you die?”
This moment of paradoxical comfort for protagonist Lisa Jones (Chloe A. Brooks ’19, an active Crimson Arts editor) exemplified the poignant tension and tenderness that characterized the entire production, which ran from April 22 to 30 on the American Repertory Theater’s mainstage. From the moment the stark spotlight hit Brooks in the play’s opening scene, it never left. Taken together, Brooks’s powerhouse performance and a compelling ensemble blended witty humor, bouts of profound pain, and love, ultimately raising lingering questions about the multifaceted depths of Lisa’s mental illness.
The play opened as Lisa, ceasing her neurotic fiddling with a guitar and reluctantly opening her front door, learns from watchmaker Victor Hesse (Cole V. Edick ’17) that she has lost an hour of her time on a transatlantic flight, leaving her unfocused and unbalanced. “Somehow, in all the temporal confusion of that instant, the hour that you surrendered—the hour that was rightfully yours—went astray!” Edick said in a frenzy as he orbited in a stop-motion path around Brooks like the second-hand of a clock, one of the many carefully attuned choices made by director Garrett C. Allen ’16. With a faltering tone and fidgeting body language, Brooks from the get-go made it clear, though, that Lisa’s struggles extended beyond the seemingly simplistic explanation Hesse has offered. In Brooks’ skillful hands (indeed, Brooks has shown her talents as an actress in previous Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club productions), Lisa elicited more than empathy; in an understated fashion, she broke open uncharted layers of the mind and, in turn, loosed the imagination.
Lisa dials the number that Hesse provided on a business card and follows the subsequent instructions—“You wish to correct a temporal disturbance. Your flat is now an elevator. To descend to Dissocia, please press 9”—and travels to Dissocia, a world in which a candy-coated exterior often belies darker inner-workings, features that Allen continued to tease out successfully. Under his direction, Lisa and her flat-elevator companions became the elevator, using just their bodies to convey the requisite motion, intimacy, and ambivalence, à la a 2008 theatrical adaptation of Hitchcock's “The 39 Steps.” In addition, Allen and the cast managed to emphasize the script’s striking blend of comical wordplay,  song, and brutal, unsettling underpinnings, stretching and compressing time to heighten the believability of disbelief. At times reminiscent of Norton Juster’s childhood novel “The Phantom Tollbooth,” albeit with a darker flavor, the play poignantly tracked Lisa’s encounters with “insecurity guards” (Geoffrey G. Binney ’16 and Sara K. Rosenburg ’16, a painfully humorous and self-deprecating pair), an oathtaker-oatcake eater, a malicious scapegoat, and an elusive villain, the “Black Dog” king.
If Act I showcased the actors’ abilities to navigate the wacky and perverted world of “Dissocia,” Act II reinforced the play’s pathos, nuance, and relevance to the ongoing mental health dialogue on college campuses (in fact, the playbill provided the contact information for several on-campus resources). Swept clean of confetti, the bare-bones set—although still a precariously slanted raked platform—changed without much physical transformation into Lisa’s hospital room, staid and maddeningly silent except for the gentle taps of the attending nurses. Believable and sad, the situation in which Lisa found herself here stood in stark contrast to her active, surprisingly lucid declaration to the Dissocian associates at the end of the first act, a mere 15 minutes earlier:  “I don’t want you all to be destroyed. But I’ve got a life too, and it’s off balance,” she said. “I’ve got people that I care about—that I love and that love me—and I’m letting them down.” These words packed a punch, raising questions about Lisa’s “wonderful world,” her reality, and the creative potential that lies beneath her mental illness.

The art of building a relationship is something I’ve yet to master. I think it’s because I’m bad at poker.
In poker, you place something valuable in jeopardy for a short while; Leo DiCaprio, for example, participates in games with stakes as high as $200,000. As a player, I stand to either suffer a loss or enjoy a benefit. Regardless, I can’t close the deal how I opened it, and I can’t back out once I’ve entered. For better or worse, making the bet will somehow change me—or at least the contents of my wallet.
Recently, I’ve started looking at relationships the same way. I envision the process of developing a relationship as an infinite number of little steps forward. In order to progress from one step to the next, I must take a gamble. Instead of laying down money, I’m putting a relationship on the line. And just as a round of poker either costs or makes me money, these gambles will either deepen or weaken my relationships.
If this seems a little irrelevant to you, think about the most awesome and meaningful friendships you’ve had in your life. Think about the people that you can be your ugly, imperfect, unedited self with, and try to imagine what you’d do without them. Maybe you’re picturing your dad, sister, girlfriend, or best friend. The people that I’m seeing in my mind’s eye are few in number, but I owe them my happiness.
When I think about how I got this comfortable with these people in my life, I think of the millions of moments in which I decided to let them see me as I truly am: insecure about my looks, stressed about my future, passionate about what I study, worried about my family, decidedly imperfect.
The point being that friendships are easy to start, but to turn one into the really beautiful, awesome kind, you have to be willing to do more than just smile, or laugh, or even share a living space. You need to be able to confide. You need to be willing to tell the truth about yourself. And you need to feel comfortable being your true self, whether that means being engaging and upbeat or, on a bad day, subdued or quiet or crying.
Doing any of these things seems like a gamble to me.
Opening up to people is nerve-wracking: What if I reveal something about myself that pushes my friends away?
Telling the truth is scary: What if the real reason that I don’t want to hang out—because I’m feeling overwhelmed or I need to be alone or I’d rather watch the finale of "House of Cards"—isn’t good enough? Will my friends understand me enough to know that, sometimes, even though I love them, I prefer to be alone?
Being myself can leave me fraught with anxieties: What if, sometimes, I’m too tired to play the part of the joyous, upbeat, manic pixie dream girl, and my friends decide that my friendship is a burden rather than a joy?
I realize that this way of viewing friendships and relationships might sound sad, silly, or cynical. And maybe it points to a shortcoming on my part. Maybe I should analyze relationships less or work on my self-confidence more.
But I think poker as a metaphor for relationships is worth considering, because, if you’re like me, you need the reminder every now and then that making bets is sometimes good for you. The momentary discomfort you feel when opening up to a friend is often dissolved by the advice and support they can offer in return. Acting “real” around your friends—even if that’s not always the same as “happy,” and even if it sometimes requires that they be there for you rather than simply with you—is okay. Better than okay, even: It keeps you sane.
Beyond that, it’s surprising and heartening to realize that the gambles that feel big and scary are actually not so dramatic after all. I’ve found that my friends and family are more accepting and understanding than even I expect them to be. In those moments, even amidst stress and sadness, I’ve never been surer that I’ll be okay in the end.
And after all that, the gambling metaphor is helpful because it reminds us how tenuous a friendship is—how much work and investment it takes to build one, how easily we can take the most valuable ones for granted, and how frivolous it would be to throw those away.
No paycheck—not even Leonardo DiCaprio’s—could ever be worth as much.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, the Undergraduate Council revoked funding from four student groups that had received the support for events planned during reading period. The UC Finance Committee cited miscommunication for the error: According to an agreement with the Office of Student Life, the UC is not permitted to distribute funds from the annual $75 Student Activities fee during shopping period, reading period, and finals. But following these events, some members of the Finance Committee said that they would push to change that rule.
At the core of the funding rule, according to Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ‘17, is the concern that “given unlimited time, people will throw a lot of events and not do work.” During the three periods of the year when UC funding is barred, the College fears that students lack their regular level of commitments and could be inclined to spend their time in the wrong places.
This reasoning, however, falls short on several fronts. First, students are the best judges of their own time. Throughout the semester, students juggle organization events on top of heavy workloads—a reality perhaps best reflected during midterm season. House and organization formals already factor into students’ schedule during reading period, and there’s no reason to think that additional events would render students unable to manage their time.
Of course, student events should not proliferate during reading period—if anything, that would represent an inefficient use of student funding. But the UC’s proposed fix, which would allow funding for the first weekend of reading period and the annual Arts First festival, is a smart compromise. Relaxing the rule so that Arts First performances are included would be a particularly welcome change. Three Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club productions ran afoul of the current rule this semester for performances during Arts First, which occurs during reading period. Put simply, HRDC and other arts organizations should not be penalized because the Office of the Arts encourages events to take place during the Arts First festival.
The College should further note that UC-funded events could supplement students’ preparations for finals week. With libraries across campus packed, reading period is among the most stressful times of the semester. Study breaks and other wellness events could help support students at this time.
A final reason to support a more relaxed reading period funding rule is the continuing effort to restore on-campus events to the center of the College's social life. Off-campus organizations with private streams of funding are currently the most-equipped for social events during this period, which can only serve to further polarize the social scene. Giving student groups some support at the beginning of reading period may help create more opportunities for on-campus socializing at the end of the semester.
Ultimately, the UC and the Office of Student Life have many compelling reasons to make the reading period funding rules more flexible. Doing so will recognize students' ability to plan their time, help arts groups participate in an annual tradition, reduce stress, and give on-campus groups more resources for social events. Balancing academics and extracurricular activities is crucial, but a small adjustment in favor of more funding may very well decrease student stress and make the beginning of reading period more enjoyable for all.

It’s almost caricatural now to claim that politics these days  transcends caricature. The absurdities that regularly come out of Trump’s mouth—and Cruz’s, Clinton’s, and Sanders’ at times—don’t need parody, as so many have pointed out. The examples are self-evident: Tina Fey’s impression of Sarah Palin’s surreal endorsement of Trump was tamer than the original. The implausible inanity that “Veep” is premised upon is all too plausible. It was unclear whether Donald Trump was the butt of his SNL appearance or we were.
How can we exaggerate, and therefore satirize, an election cycle with a man who thinks “it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful piece of ass”?
But political satire still is necessary—if not to intoxicate us with improbable fantasy, then to sober us up to our unlikely reality. Every talk-show impression of The Donald and every Onion article scathing Cruz or Hillary is too similar to real life for it to serve no greater purpose than providing a quick laugh. There is solemn truth to a popular meme circulating the web this year: We used to laugh at comedians, and listen to politicians. Now we laugh at politicians and listen to comedians.
This year, we listened to John Oliver, Amy Schumer, and Samantha Bee as they angrily implored Americans to wake up, delivering fiery torrent after torrent at the current state of our nation’s politics.
And last week, we saw this acerbic, mission-oriented brand of political humor on a different, more powerful stage—the 2016 White House Correspondents Dinner, an event for Washington’s most high-minded to politely indulge the most powerful man in the free world as he delivers harmless one-liners and self-deprecating punchlines.
But President Obama had a different plan in mind for his final dinner: to use absurd means to call attention to the absurdity of the world. Last week, we saw a president disenchanted with the descent of his nation and intelligent enough to use comedy as a tool to make this anger clear.
A far cry from Reagan joking about his age at the 1988 dinner, this year Obama didn’t pull any punches, and these punches were not aimed at himself. An uppercut at corrupt media establishments:"'Spotlight' is... a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since 'Star Wars.'” A hook at Republican congressmen: "In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck...and Republican leaders won’t take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to.” And a fatal sucker punch at the whole situation: "Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific.”
Obama’s jokes have had edge in the past—“Let’s face it, Fox, you’ll miss me when I’m gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya,” he said at last year’s dinner. But never before have they had such a sense of urgency. Obama seems to be doing what Trevor Noah or John Oliver do every week—making us laugh, yes, but to the end that we realize that this humor masks a painfully unfunny reality. Like any good comedian, Obama ended his roast with a mic drop—a universally recognized symbol of odium and disappointment, and a sign that he is self-aware that this was no ordinary Washington black tie affair.
Somewhere between the obligatory self-loathing and lovable dad jokes is a morbid sense of humor in our president—the type of humor that dominated this election cycle and will likely continue to gain traction as long as we as a nation maintain this level of political dysfunction. “The end of the republic never looked better,” Obama joked at the beginning of his roast, a line that cued rapturous applause and laughter in the audience. The real punchline, though, was that he was not kidding.

It seems that we need to have yet another discussion about rape. In the wake of final clubs saying that sexual assault happens when men find themselves in the same room as women and requesting details on allegations of sexual assault that happened on their property but only allegations that have been “deemed credible,” and in the wake of a state court's ruling that it’s not rape when you put your penis in an unconscious person’s mouth, it seems like it’s time to talk about rape again.  
We’ve already talked about victim-blaming. We’ve already talked about the societal pressures that make it hard for women to report, or even admit to themselves that what happened to them was “rape.” We’ve already heard the brave stories from sexual assault survivors. But people still don’t get it, apparently.
One of the major reasons why women don’t report, and why women who do report are stigmatized, is because of the idea that she’s “ruining his life.” This is an idea that’s thrown around a fair bit in media reporting of rape trials. This is when reporters say things like, it’s “incredibly difficult” to “watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart” and they were labeled sex offenders, a label that would “haunt them for the rest of their lives.”
But I think it’s “incredibly difficult” to hear about how many young women are sexually assaulted, about how their “no’s” fell upon deaf ears, about how they were forced to engage in sexual acts against their will, about how they were penetrated and physically violated while unconscious. I think it’s “incredibly difficult” to watch as my female friend cries because of what someone did to her the night before, to watch as she blames herself and refuses to report, to watch as she relives her pain every time she sees him walk across the dining hall, to watch as the memory of her trauma “haunts her for the rest of her life.”
And I think it is “incredibly difficult” to hear people wax sympathetic about the rape perpetrators and talk about how they had friends, they had family, they had such a promising career. Because I’m pretty sure the person who got raped had friends, too, and a family, and great grades, and passions, and maybe she was a star athlete or the president of the debate society, and maybe she was going to go to law school, but we never hear about that, do we? We never talk about how she is a person too, whose life has been irrevocably changed for the worse.
We sympathize with perpetrators, and we imagine how hard it must be to have your life ruined at the age of nineteen, when you’re just a college sophomore, labeled “sex offender” for the rest of your life. And instead of facing the ugly truth—that a young man can knowingly choose to rape someone—we question whether the victim was clear about giving consent. Perhaps she should have said “no” louder or a few more times. Perhaps she shouldn’t have drunk so much. Perhaps she should've just stayed home. It's easy for us to laugh at trigger warnings, deriding "political correctness" and saying she ought to toughen up and not feel victimized all the goddamn time. We tell her that her trauma and her pain wasn't real. We tell her that her interests, her passions, her grades, her future aren’t important. We tell her that she doesn't matter.  We rarely sympathize with shoplifters, child molesters, murderers, or other people who break the law and must be disciplined. We think they get what they deserved. We think jail is a suitable punishment for someone who has stolen, abused, or murdered.  So why do we sympathize so often with rapists? Is it because a small part of us—men and women alike—sees ourselves in him? Is it because we suddenly remember all the times we ignored someone's consent, and we feel a twinge of guilt?
It’s easy to unknowingly violate another person’s consent, when we forget to check in to make sure that the other person wants to keep going, or when we ignore signs that the other person might want to stop. And it's not just in sexual encounters. It's also in our everyday lives. When we force our children to kiss or hug their relatives, even when they say they don’t want to. When we touch pregnant women on the stomach without asking.
We have been raised in a world that didn't learn what the word consent meant until fairly recently. We have been raised in a world where marital rape was legal up until very recently. We have been raised in a world where raping an unconscious person is, apparently, still okay.  Our world is flawed, and it has imparted its flaws onto us. But we can do better. And we can change this world to reflect these changing norms and definitions, and maybe by the time we have children and grandchildren, they will have the opportunity to grow up in a safer, more inclusive world—a world where we respect each other's right to consent: a world without rape.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This morning, in an email to Harvard College students, University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana staked out their strongest position yet on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. Starting in 2017, members of such groups will be barred from holding team captaincies, gaining leadership positions within recognized student groups, or winning College support in fellowship applications. This is a critical step, but the administration ought to refine the policy to better reflect the nuance in campus social life.
Most significantly, we are troubled by the University’s choice to group male final clubs, female final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Though all are technically single-gender social organizations, male final clubs are remarkably different in character. The intersection of male privilege, sexual entitlement, private space, and exclusive membership that Harvard officials rightly decry is specific to those organizations. The most troubling statistic—nearly half of all female undergraduates who “participate” in the final clubs suffer incidents of sexual assaults—is a clear sign that the clubs need to be reformed.
By contrast, sororities in particular and also female final clubs provide a key social outlet for undergraduate women. Precisely because of the potentially hostile environments created by the male clubs, it is crucial that our campus have places for women to bond. With the just-announced policy, women lose an important space—one that is particularly crucial given the prevalence of sexual assault on campus. Demanding the male groups become co-ed is two valuable steps forward, but sanctioning all-female social organizations is unfortunately a step back.
These meaningful differences deserve meaningfully different treatment. Indeed, we believe that the outsized influence that male final clubs exert on Harvard’s social sphere deserves still more aggressive action from the University. In the past, we have questioned the wisdom of sanctioning final club members, but faced with the continued intransigence of the male clubs, the administration must be able to back up its reformist rhetoric with action. It is clear that mere conversations—conversations that have gone on for years between the clubs and Harvard—have not resolved the deep, structural, and horrific issues of sexual assault in many of these organizations.
Encouraging them to become co-ed is an important step, as we have said many times before. We hope that when parties and punch are planned in part by women, these spaces will become more welcoming and less exclusionary without the weight of gender disparities. More fundamentally, such a move will open the doors of these historic institutions and their alumni networks to the half of Harvard undergraduates who are currently shut out simply because of their gender.
Requiring the clubs to become co-ed, however, should not be the only concession the administration demands. Clubs must also address issues of socioeconomic, racial, and geographic exclusivity, perhaps through open punch policies like the one recently instituted by the A.D. Making their financial aid programs more transparent would also help broaden the clubs’ appeal. Going co-ed is a necessary step, but it is surely not sufficient.
Khurana is right to revisit this issue to ensure the reforms are having their intended effects. These checkpoints would be excellent opportunities to make the sanctions policy more nuanced. While painting with a broad brush is tempting, a finer policy would, we hope, create a more transformative result for the Harvard community.

Upperclassmen would eat in the mornings more often if hot breakfast options were available in the College’s Houses, according to a survey conducted earlier this semester by the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee.
The results of the survey, organized by Leverett House Representative Jullian A. Duran ’18, indicated that 92 percent of 1216 undergraduates surveyed “want something more than what is currently offered” for breakfast—whether that was “basic warm breakfast options” such as eggs and cooked meat, or “full breakfast options” akin to food currently offered in Annenberg Hall, the freshman dining hall.
Among surveyed student athletes, that figure is 97 percent.
“A lot of athletes mentioned how inconvenient it was to not have enough protein,” Duran said. “Athletes do a lot in the mornings; we should provide them a lot to eat.”
UC Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 said during a UC meeting in March that the survey “started out as a way to cater to the needs of student athletes on campus,” but that it expanded into a broader “College-wide interest.”
Sixty-six percent of all students surveyed said that, if breakfast options were to expand, they would be more likely to attend breakfast on a regular basis.
The College removed hot breakfast items from the Houses during weekdays in 2009 in response to the economic downturn, when the College decided “to keep the cost of attending Harvard lower by cutting the board rate and modifying the breakfast menu,” according to Harvard University Dining Services Spokesperson Crista Martin.
At a town hall in 2009, then-HUDS Executive Director Ted A. Mayer estimated that the decision to eliminate most hot break options in the Houses would save the College $900,000 per year.
Martin noted that House residents who would like hot breakfast options can dine in Annenberg for breakfast. She also pointed out that the UC’s survey did not account for the sacrifices that would be necessary in order to fund expanded breakfast options.
“Unfortunately, the UC survey failed to ask students what they were willing to give up for expanded breakfast options to be in place, or how much more they would be willing to pay for their board plan in order for those options to be extended,” Martin wrote in an emailed statement.
Duran said he recognized the financial difficulty of expanding breakfast options in the Houses, but suggested that compromise solutions—such as having a few Houses offering the options on different parts of campus—could make expansion more feasible.
“There are certainly ways to make it less of a financial strain and still satisfy a clear campus need,” Duran said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Slipping, shouting, and streaking, herds of naked students participated in the biannual tradition of Primal Scream at midnight Thursday morning, blowing off steam before the beginning of final exams.
Although chilly and drizzling outside—considered suboptimal conditions by some—the weather did not stop a large mass of “screamers” from forming outside the “starting line” of Hollis Hall shortly before midnight. Students donned accessories ranging from neckties to whale-shaped Vineyard Vines hats, while others were sporting glow-in-the-dark body paint for the occasion.
Hordes of tourists also gathered near the edge of the Yard and around the John Harvard statue, eagerly waiting for students to streak past. Several students said they feared having their picture taken by tourists.
Harry T. Newman Plotnick ’18 said he thinks that final exams are not as stressful as the possibility of being photographed by tourists, adding that the strangers’ flashing cameras are “for sure the worst part of it.”
After a slightly botched attempt at a countdown, runners began their sprint around the Yard clutching everything from towels to crutches as they completed their lap past many of the freshman dorms.
In line with tradition, the Harvard University Band rallied the runners as they passed the John Harvard statue, playing songs such as Walk the Moon’s “Shut Up and Dance.”
Shriya Anand, a visiting student from the United Kingdom, said the bare-all affair was very different than traditions in her own country but that she enjoyed witnessing a Harvard tradition.
“It’s a very U.S. thing and a very Harvard thing,” Anand said. “It’s cool to see.”
While the ritual draws varying numbers of participants each semester, many students said they would wait until next year, believing that participating in Primal Scream during the cold temperatures of December is more authentic.
“My first time is going to be [next] winter,” said Calais N. Galbraith ’18. “You gotta go big or go home.”

Sixty-four undergraduates learned Wednesday that they had received the College’s Hoopes Prize, an award that recognizes outstanding scholarly work or research. The majority of this year’s awardees received the prize for their senior theses or senior projects.
Awarded annually, the Hoopes Prize is funded through the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, and seeks to “recognize, promote, honor, and reward excellence in the work of undergraduates and their capabilities and skills in any subject,” according to the prize’s website.
Winners of the prize come from across the College’s concentrations, with this year’s winning projects ranging from an anthropological analysis of the Detroit water crisis to a feature-length creative film.
Earth and Planetary Sciences concentrator Sam L. Goldberg ’16 received the prize for his work on refining mathematical models for sea level change.
“I am proud of my thesis, and my adviser is proud of the thesis,” he said, “but it was nice to get the additional validation.”
To be considered for the award, students must be nominated by their thesis or project advisers and then complete a nomination form. Lane B. Baker ’16, a history concentrator who won the prize for his thesis on exploration in the Renaissance, emphasizes the role his adviser played in the success of his thesis.
“The part of this that is most important to me is the role that my adviser has played in this,” Baker said. “He was very influential in pushing me to write something of this caliber.”
Magdalene M. Zier ’16 received the prize for her thesis in History and Literature, which focused on anti-lynching plays by African American playwrights from the early 20th century. Zier also staged the productions with the help of the American Repertory Theater, Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and Harvard Law School.
“It was one of those moments where things serendipitously fit together,” Zier said.
Also among the prize’s awardees is Rhodes Scholar Rivka B. Hyland ’16. A Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator, Hyland’s winning thesis discusses the relationship between early Christian and Islamic theology.
“Writing a thesis is unlike any experience I’ve had academically or otherwise... long parts of it are these crippling periods of self-doubt, and a big part of the process is learning to moderate that with reason,” Hyland said. “So it’s just a huge affirmation to receive the Hoopes.”
Winners of the prize receive $4,000 in addition to have their winning papers bound and available at Lamont Library for the next two years. The prize also comes with a $1,500 honorarium for the advisers.
Approximately 75 faculty members from across FAS divisions were readers for the award this year, according to Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively. Lively said that the involved faculty typically make up three subcommittees with one devoted to science and engineering, another to arts and humanities, and the third to the social sciences.

Daniel Aaron, an emeritus professor at Harvard and an academic who helped develop the field of American Studies, died Saturday at Mt. Auburn Hospital at the age of 103 because of pneumonia complications.
Aaron spent his undergraduate years at the University of Michigan. In 1943, he received his Ph.D. in American Civilization from Harvard, becoming the first student in the University’s history to study in that program.
Before coming to Harvard, Aaron spent three decades teaching American Studies at Smith College. Subsequently, Aaron held the title of Victor S. Thomas professor of English and American literature emeritus at Harvard University. He taught at Harvard from 1971 to 1983.
While at Harvard, he taught Harvard underclassmen, including future president John F. Kennedy ’40, who wrote a “so-so examination paper for a Harvard American literature course.”
Aaron was the founding president of the Library of America, a nonprofit publisher of classic American literature. The Library of America has published more than 200 volumes written by American authors, ranging from Mark Twain to Nathaniel Hawthorne.
Throughout his career, Aaron published extensively, writing about literature, history, and American culture. He published his first scholarly paper, “Melville and the Missionaries,” in 1935. His most recent work, published in 2007, is an autobiography titled “The Americanist.”
“The United States suddenly loomed as the last democratic bastion in the world after the German occupation of France in 1940. About then, I began to feel that it might be almost as important to understand American civilization as to preserve it,” he wrote in “The Americanist.”
Helen Vendler, an American literary academic, said Aaron was “a chief founder of the discipline of American studies” in a 2012 interview with Harvard magazine, adding that he “advocated the scholarly study of American authors at a time when universities still emphasized English and European literature.”
Aaron also contributed to the New York Review of Books, the New Republic, and the London Review of Books.
Aaron was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a National Humanities Medalist.
The son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, he was born in Chicago, but spent his later years living in Cambridge.
Aaron’s son, Jonathan Aaron, has also pursued a career in the humanities. He holds a doctorate from Yale University and teaches in the department of writing, literature and publishing at Emerson College.

As Harvard Law School admissions officers finalize next year’s class, they do so with an eye toward a group of fields that deviate from the traditional path to legal studies: STEM.
Law School chief admissions officer Jessica L. Soban said the percentage of admitted students with backgrounds in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—will remain in the double digits for the second year in a row, reflecting a deliberate effort by Law School admissions officers in recent years to increase the number of students with such backgrounds.
The school began actively recruiting STEM applicants during the 2012-2013 admissions cycle, Soban said. At the time, students with STEM backgrounds comprised around eight percent of the first-year class.
Admissions officers altered recruiting presentations and messages to attract these students and adjusted how they consider GPAs of STEM applicants to ensure that the class composition would change. In the past, Soban said, evaluating GPAs equally across undergraduate majors put STEM students at a disadvantage and may have deterred some from applying in the first place.
“We’re helping applicants to understand that we understand that a GPA in a STEM major often looks different than one for a humanities major. There tend to be different curves for those classes, and therefore an overall GPA may look different,” Soban said. “We’re leveling the playing field.”
The school also launched the Junior Deferral Program in 2013 to appeal to STEM students. The program, which is in a pilot stage, admits a number of Harvard College juniors each year on the condition that they will spend at least two years in the workforce before returning to the Law School. Soban said admissions officers thought the program would be well-suited to STEM-focused students, but so far, it has not attracted a significantly higher proportion of STEM applicants.
Data from the last two admissions cycles, however, suggests that other measures are working. The percentage of STEM-focused students admitted to the Law School increased to around 12 percent in the 2014-2015 cycle, according to Soban, who projects that this cycle’s proportion will hover around the same percentage.
The shift toward STEM is not confined to Harvard Law School but is part of a larger nationwide trend in recent years resulting from dramatic growth in the technology industry, according to U.S. News. New technology and scientific innovations require a new crop of lawyers to deal with legal questions “that didn’t exist 10 years ago,” Soban said.
Law School clinical professor Christopher T. Bavitz said he thinks students with STEM backgrounds possess skills well-suited to the law.
“There are a lot of reasons why people with tech backgrounds can do well in the law,” he said. “A lot of law practice is explaining complicated concepts to people...and people with science and tech backgrounds do that well. I think they’re great analytical thinkers in ways that kind of map on to the thinking lawyers do.”
The Law School has pioneered programs bridging science and the law. The school’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics—which was established a decade ago—was the first of its kind among law schools, according Faculty Director and Law professor I. Glenn Cohen, putting Harvard ahead of peer institutions.
Harvard’s Innovation Lab and The Berkman Center for Internet and Society are also major hubs for Law students interested in technology. Bavitz, who is the Managing Director of the center’s cyberlaw clinic, said the influx of STEM-focused students at the Law School has prompted the center to expand considerably since he arrived eight years ago.
“We are significantly bigger now than we were in 2008, and I think that’s a testament to the fact that many students are really excited and interested in this stuff,” he said. “We have a lot of students who come into the program who don’t know what they want to do, but they recognize that there is a tech component to a lot of fields in law these days.”
The Law School aims to continue to increase the proportion of students with STEM backgrounds at the school, Soban said.
“This is the direction that the world is headed. Some of the most interesting questions in law right now are driven by science moving faster than the law does,” she said. “The profession needs—and Harvard Law School kind of driving that needs—people who are able to engage on these topics and are interested in these topics.”

After a Harvard Law School student made a public comment many perceived as anti-Semitic, the school plunged into a debate about free speech on campus, and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow quickly denounced the statement as “offensive.”
Now, two weeks later, University President Drew G. Faust has affirmed that free speech does not mean the speaker should be protected from backlash.
“You’re free to say what you want,” Faust said in an interview Wednesday. “You're also free to take the hits for saying things that are stupid or prejudicial or uninformed. Those two things go together.” 
Controversy engulfed the Law School last month when a student—whose name was originally withheld, but is now identified as third-year Law student Husam El-Qoulaq—asked former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni “How is it that you are so smelly?” Many quickly decried the comment as anti-Semitic, and Minow called the comment “an embarrassment to our institution” in an email to Law School students, faculty, and staff.
The comment soon reinvigorated a discussion on the degree to which speech deemed offensive should be protected, with some demanding that El-Qoulaq’s name become public to hold him accountable for his remarks. The Law School removed footage of the event and declined to name El-Qoulaq, and the Harvard Law Record initially removed comments from its website identifying him—though El-Qoulaq eventually decided to allow the Record to publish his name.
Faust argued that free speech entails accountability.
“With freedom comes responsibility,” she said. “So I believe when free speech results in utterances that are wrong or appalling, it’s incumbent on the rest of the people in the community to point that out, correct the record, denounce the prejudice, whatever the needed intervention should be.”
El-Qoulaq has since apologized for his comments, which he said he did not intend to be anti-Semitic. While several alumni have called for El-Qoulaq to be punished, he said last week that administrators have told him he will not face disciplinary measures.
Minow mirrored Faust’s stance in her email to Law School affiliates, upholding the value of free speech while maintaining that open discourse should go both ways.
“The fact that speech is and should be free does not mean that hateful remarks should go unacknowledged or unanswered in a community dedicated to thoughtful discussion of complex issues and questions,” Minow wrote.
Free speech became a topic of widespread discussion at the Law School earlier in the semester when students debated over posters in the Caspersen Student Center. William H. Barlow, a third-year Law School student, put up posters comparing Reclaim Harvard Law School, a student activist group, to Donald Trump, prompting members of the group to remove the posters and sparking a debate about the freedom of expression.
At the time, Minow wrote in an email to the school that anyone could use the Caspersen Student Center space—which members of Reclaim Harvard Law School had been occupying since February demanding better treatment of minority students on campus.

At the conclusion of a year of lengthy discussion about graduate student unionization, leaders of the Graduate Student Council said they hope to keep an “open forum” for all perspectives as debate over unionization continues into the fall.
GSC president Darcy L. Frear—who was re-elected as president last month—emphasized that the Council represents “all grad students.”
“Unionization is a big topic of conversation, so we will continue that, and we will continue to open it for anyone who wants to talk about it, for or against.” Frear noted that she is not personally involved with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, the organization of students hoping to create a union. 
This academic year has been marked by an evolving relationship between the union effort, which went public last spring, and the Council. A November resolution passed by the Council said the union effort is “complementary to the role of the Graduate Student Council,” and that the GSC would stand in support of the students behind the movement. However, the Council has refrained from outright endorsing the effort itself.
Over the next few months, the union effort gained majority support among graduate students employed by Harvard.
In late February, Harvard joined top peer institutions in filing an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board, which will soon decide a case that may mandate that private universities recognize democratically elected graduate student unions. The brief asserted that the presence of a graduate student union could change the academic relationship between students and faculty and infringe upon the academic freedom of professors.
In response, GSC vice president John Gee spoke out to condemn the brief and proposed a resolution for the Council to do the same. That resolution passed last month 34 to 6, and called Harvard’s action an interference “with the democratic rights of graduate student workers.”
Several initiatives Frear and other Council members outlined for the next year fall in line with the union effort’s goals.
The GSC president said she wants to see expanded dental coverage added to the existing Ph.D. student health plan, which is a key part of the HGSU-UAW platform.
Graduate student Rosanna Picascia, a member of the Committee on Graduate Student Family Life, also spoke about an idea to create a Harvard-affiliated childcare center at Wednesday’s Council meeting. Childcare is another point of concern for the union effort.
Picascia said student parents are concerned about the high cost of childcare at the existing six independently-run centers, which she said are geared toward the children of faculty members and cost around $2,800 a month.
The group will meet with members of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administration next month. Picascia said the committee is also looking to MIT, which she said had a pilot childcare program a few years ago.
“We’re trying to look at the conclusions of that and see whether or not something like that is actually doable at Harvard,” she said.

Students presented research on Harvard’s history of race relations, gender equality, and BGLTQ rights following intensifying discussion of such campus issues at an event hosted at Phillips Brooks House Thursday.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 conceived of the event, called “Reframing Harvard’s History,” in March. The Undergraduate Council’s “Grant for an Open Harvard College” funded the event itself, while the College’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion paid stipends to six students to pursue the research outside their other academic pursuits.
Suslovic said she thought of the project because she and others wanted to teach people about Harvard’s history with issues of diversity following a recent decision to change the title of House master to “Faculty Dean.”
“This in particular for me was a project that I wanted to do after I realized how frustrated I felt with a lot of the conversations that were happening on campus, just because I felt like a lot of them didn’t feel like they had a historical context to them,” Suslovic said. “I would say that the project is an opportunity to add some new knowledge to people’s conversations.”
Suslovic and the other students who contributed to the project in part researched figures from Harvard’s history whose lasting presence on the University’s buildings has aroused controversy.
For example, Nawal K. Arjini ’18, Christopher Hopson ’19, and Abby D. Duker ’18 all looked into the tenure of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell. His place as the namesake of Lowell House has faced criticism in recent years for his banning of black students’ living in Harvard Yard, setting quotas for Jewish students at the College, and establishing a secret court prosecuting students suspected of being homosexuals.
Suslovic said that the creators of the event also sought to shine a light on past student activism that led to changes at Harvard.
“There’s an important thing to be recognized in the conversation—being able to recognize people who for whatever reason were marginalized in Harvard’s past, or people who were advocating to make positive change on campus,” Suslovic said. “Those people are forgotten from building names and general Harvard lore in ways that I don’t think that people like Mather or Holyoke [are],” she said, referring to former University Presidents Increase Mather and Edward Holyoke.
Telling the stories of those students—like the activists who successfully pushed for what is now the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program in 1973—will give current student activists models to follow, Suslovic said.
The Reframing Harvard’s History Project’s inception comes at a time of heightened student activism over the controversial histories of certain names and symbols on campus. Earlier this spring, Harvard approved plans to eliminate the Law School’s seal, which was linked to the slaveholding Royall family, and undergraduates are debating the name of Mather House given its namesake’s own slaveholding history. Administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have spoken against what they deem “erasing” history, urging a closer study of all aspects of Harvard’s past.
Suslovic and UC leaders said they hoped research of this sort could continue for years to come. The difficulty will be in finding a consistent source of funding, Suslovic said.
“There were some funds that were available through the Office [of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion], but we all agreed that moving forward, we want to be able to integrate this into an already existing research program,” Suslovic said.
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said she was hopeful that Suslovic and the UC could find a way to “institutionalize” this type of research, noting that she and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks’17 were in “conversations with Brianna, her researchers, as well as key administrative partners.”
“This is something that is worth giving good consideration,” Rather said.

Two weeks after a comment perceived to be anti-Semitic ignited controversy at Harvard Law School, a coalition of student groups published an open letter condemning administrators for what they considered an inappropriate response to threats consequently directed at Muslim students.
The letter—which was published in the Harvard Law Record on May 3 and signed by leaders of 11 student groups, including Reclaim Harvard Law—also calls on students to petition Law School Dean Martha L. Minow to “upstand” for Muslim students at the school. In recent speeches, Minow has urged students to be “upstanders” and actively combat injustice. 
Muslim students began receiving online threats and harassment shortly after third-year Law student Husam El-Qoulaq called former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni “smelly” at an event on April 14. Many Law School affiliates and outside observers decried El-Qoulaq’s comment as anti-Semitic, and Minow condemned the remark as “offensive” in a letter to school affiliates. El-Qoulaq denied that the comment was intended to be anti-Semitic.
Now, the Muslim Law Students Association is leading affinity group leaders in charging that Minow did not display the same level of public outrage when Muslim students became the target of hate speech.
Before El-Qoulaq’s identity as the commenter became public, one unidentified female Muslim student—who had not attended the Livni event—became the target of online threats and hate mail accusing her of anti-Semitism. Third-year Law student and Muslim Law Students Association board member Noor Zafar said several Law School alumni and people unaffiliated with the school also directed racist comments to several other Muslim students online.
The female student who was the target of initial defamatory comments met with Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells and Minow, who offered the student security, counseling, and assistance removing her personal information from the Internet, according to Law School Spokesperson Michelle B. Deakin.
The student asked administrators to issue a statement to Law School affiliates denouncing malevolent speech directed at Muslim students, according to the student groups’ letter, and Sells sent an email to students after a faculty member became involved. “Much of what has been tweeted or posted about these events amounts to cyber-bullying, trolling, and bigotry, and it tears at the fabric of our community,” Sells wrote in the email.
A week later, Minow issued a statement to Law School affiliates referencing “troubling expressions of racism, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim prejudice,” writing, “we are better than that.”
Muslim students viewed these responses as inadequate, Zafar said, because Sells addressed her message to students—who are not the main perpetrators of anti-Muslim messages—and they said Minow’s letter felt vague and lacking in urgency.
The student groups’ open letter called administrators’ response a “belated and tepid denunciation” that was part of “the administration’s pattern of prioritizing political expediency over the politically unpopular needs and concerns of Muslim students–even when their physical safety is at risk.”
Deakin emphasized measures Minow has taken in recent years to create a hospitable environment for Muslim students at the Law School, including offering support to students after attacks in San Bernadino and Brussels, and expanding the school’s Islamic Legal Studies Program.
“Dean Minow has been deeply involved in assuring that our Muslim students are supported by the school, especially when the national political climate has been plagued by scapegoating and intolerance,” Deakin wrote in an email.
Zafar said, however, she thinks events of the past few weeks indicated that “institutionally, the administration has not been doing enough to really make Muslim students feel that they’re welcome at HLS.”
Sixty-four people in addition to the letter’s original signatories have signed the student groups’ petition thus far.

When Blythe K. George came to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to study sociology and social policy three years ago, she didn’t realize how different her experience would be from her time as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College.
George’s research focuses on reservations, and she explained that, at Dartmouth, there was ample opportunity for Native American studies. The college boasts an entire Native American studies department with multiple professors who exclusively study tribal communities. Currently, there are no professors in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences who works explicitly and singularly on Native American studies.
“I constantly remind Harvard that we need to be stepping it up because it’s not that hard, honestly, with the necessary institutional commitment,” George said.
The dearth of Native American studies is not particular to the College or GSAS, but can be found across the University. Affiliates of Harvard’s 12 schools who seek to pursue Native American studies gather around the Harvard University Native American Program, an interfaculty initiative sponsored by the Provost’s office.
According to HUNAP Faculty Chair Dennis K. Norman, a professor at Harvard Medical School, the program has just three employees and one staff support person working with all of Harvard’s schools. Similarly, Native American student groups, such as Native Americans at Harvard College, have memberships that range from under five to the mid-teens.
Though offerings in Native American studies at Harvard are few and far between, a small number of committed students and faculty are dedicated to maximizing the resources available to them, and hope to see more opportunities in the future.
FACULTY WANTED
Across the University, Harvard has only a handful of faculty who specifically  focus on Native American studies. And while student efforts at the College have recently mobilized around Latino studies and Asian American studies, Native American studies has less of a foothold in FAS.
Latino Studies was introduced as a secondary field in the fall, and the newly-formed Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies received official recognition last month. Yet the number of Native American studies faculty has decreased at the College in recent years.
Two junior faculty members who focused on Native American studies—Lisa Brooks in History and Literature and Malinda Maynor Lowery ’95 in History—were hired for tenure track positions in 2005 and have since moved to other institutions.
Norman said their departures were influenced by the lack of mentorship available in their field.
“There was no senior faculty to support them and their work [and] they were given very good offers at other places where there was more support for their work,” Norman said.
Tessa L. Desmond, the Administrative Director for the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights , said that just one senior faculty hire could substantially change the status of Native American studies at the College.
“Senior faculty are able to advocate for junior faculty hires, and senior faculty hires make new scholars more willing to come to a university,” she said. “If you get a job offer from Harvard University and there’s nobody working in your field, especially if you’re a junior faculty, you have to think really seriously about taking that offer.”
Where classes do exist in Native American studies at the College, such as a class on the Archaeology of Native America taught by Archaeology associate professor Matthew J. Liebmann, they are often affiliated with EMR. Norman, as well as HUNAP Director Shelly C. Lowe, serve on the EMR committee.
Kaipo T. Matsumoto ’17, co-president of Native Americans at Harvard College, said the lack of faculty has proven challenging for his personal academics.
As a freshman, Matsumoto expected to take a placement test for the Hawaiian language to place out of the College’s language requirement. However, he initially was not able to because Hawaiian is not offered at Harvard, and it took two years to work out a test.
For Matsumoto, his ultimate goal would be an independent Indigenous Studies concentration, similar to the African and African American Studies Department or the Native American Studies department at Dartmouth.
Matsumoto added that for now, however, the goal is simply more faculty, both in FAS and elsewhere.
Kau’i Baumhofer is a fourth-year graduate student at the School of Public Health and the president of the school’s recently-formed Native American Student Organization. She said that the school’s lack of both Native American faculty and faculty who focus on Native American studies almost deterred her from attending Harvard at all.
“That was actually a big concern of mine, coming into HSPH as a Native student: who was going to mentor me, and how was I going to work on the type of research project that I have been doing for the past 10 years of my career?” she said.
Matsumoto, who currently serves as a student representative on the Provost’s Advisory Council on Indigenous Affairs, said the committee has communicated the desire for more institutional support to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Lowe, who is also a member of the Council, said Garber has been open to hearing these concerns.
“I do believe the Provost is very open to hearing us and I do believe he would like to see changes,” she said.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement that several partnerships and initiatives at Harvard, such as HUNAP, “ brin[g] together Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students and interested individuals from the Harvard community for the purpose of advancing the well-being of indigenous peoples through self-determination, academic achievement, and community service.”
THE RARE EXCEPTIONS
Native American studies at Harvard Law School has a larger presence compared to other schools at the University.
Lowe cited the establishment of the Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor of Law position as an example of a positive development towards increasing Native American studies faculty. The visiting position, endowed by the Oneida Nation, a federally recognized tribe headquartered in New York, is currently filled by Robert T. Anderson, who is serving two consecutive five-year appointments as the Oneida Chair.
Anderson said he thinks there is enough student interest in American Indian Law to fill more classes than are currently offered in the field.
“Students are very interested [in American Indian Law] because it’s a very high-level student body as you would expect at Harvard, and many of the students are going on to prestigious federal and state clerkships where they’re encountering these issues,” he said.
In addition to the Oneida professorship, professor Joseph W. Singer has developed an American Indian Law problem for a mandatory “Problem Solving Workshop” required for every first-year Law student. He also leads a reading group on American Indian Law.  Additionally, the Law School runs a Native Amicus Briefing Project, which recruits students partly to keep track of cases of federal Indian law and ultimately provide amicus briefs to the cases.
However, co-presidents of the Native American Law Students Association Aharon B. Kaslow and Esther A. Labrado said, they think what currently exists is not enough. One concern is that the Oneida Chair lacks the stability of a tenured position, they said. Another is the fact that Federal Indian Law, a field of common law,  is underrepresented both in the curriculum and the faculty.
“Federal Indian Law is its own real area of law and it’s constantly being litigated and going to the Supreme Court, so it’s intellectually very interesting and one of the more complicated areas,” Kaslow said.
Like the Oneida Chair, many of the Native American studies faculty at other Harvard schools are visiting, not permanent, professors.
“The only experience I’ve had with Indigenous studies at Harvard in my time has been through visiting professors,” Matsumoto said.
MORE THAN A CLASSROOM
Although the lack of Native American studies poses an academic problem, students and faculty say that having access to these programs is also important because of the University’s history and attracting more Native people to Harvard.
For many Native American studies proponents, any discussion of the field would be incomplete without referencing the College’s charter signed in 1650, under which it continues to operate. The charter established the school as a center for “education of the English and Indian youth of this country.”
Yet some students and faculty allege that Harvard has neglected this mission. George said she thinks Dartmouth, which has similar language in its founding document from 1789, has pursued that objective more earnestly than Harvard.
“[Dartmouth’s Native American studies program] is directly based in Dartmouth’s founding as a school for Native Americans,” George said. “Harvard was similarly founded but they have failed to honor that obligation for most of the last several centuries.”
Neal, the University spokesperson, said Harvard has made a concerted effort to sustain Native American Studies research on campus and recruit Native scholars.
“While research, teaching and learning in [Native American Studies], as with nearly every field of inquiry across the University, is generated by faculty and students in Harvard’s Schools, the Office of the Provost works to support and knit together School-based efforts,” he wrote in an emailed statement. He added, “We also work to help individual Schools in their efforts to recruit, appoint and retain both tenured and tenure-track faculty whose scholarship focuses on issues related to indigenous peoples for the benefit of the entire University.”
Vice president of Native Americans at Harvard College Damon J. Clark ’17 said he chose Harvard because it is, according to its charter, the oldest Indian college in the country.
“This isn’t just something we should do because it’s important to have someone studying Native Americans or doing Native American Studies or whatever our ethical commitments are, but it’s actually written in our founding documents,” she said.
Leaders of NAHC and NALSA say that having established Native American studies coursework can often make a difference for Native students choosing between Harvard and peer institutions.
“Native students that I know personally have been much more inclined to go to Stanford because of the infrastructure there as regards to coursework,” Matsumoto said.
Kaslow said every Native student he knows at the Law School has chosen to take the American Indian Law class.
“I think being able to study the law that governs your people is a really important thing,” he said. “To have a well fleshed out program… is kind of the smallest step you can take to making a person that identifies with that unique background feel like they have the opportunity to explore that, even if they don’t plan on practicing in Indian country.”
A separate, but related, issue for both HUNAP and the student groups is the lack of faculty who identify as Native, regardless of their area of study, across Harvard’s schools. FAS, as well as many of the graduate schools, currently have no faculty who identify as Native, according to Lowe.
Kaslow said having the Oneida Chair be filled by Native professors in the recent past has made Native students feel more supported at the Law School.
“It just so happens that we’ve been lucky to have the leading experts in Indian Law recently also be Native American, and I think it’s played a huge role in helping NALSA feel like it has a stronger presence in the institution,” he said.
FORGING A PATH
Despite Harvard’s lack of formal coursework in Native American studies, students interested the subject have found ways to pursue it, through cobbling together creative schedules and academic engagement outside of the classroom.
Both Matsumoto and Clark said they chose fields that they say allowed them flexibility to pursue a form of Indigenous studies. Matsumoto is a History and Literature concentrator with a self-titled subfield in Pacific world and Indigeneity, and Clark is a Social Studies concentrator with a focus in Indigenous communities in contemporary America. According to Clark, there are currently three Native students concentrating in Social Studies in his year alone.
“I really tried to shape a curriculum that incorporated the very few Native American courses at Harvard, while also incorporating other courses at Harvard,” he said. This has meant traveling to various graduate schools to take courses, he said, including a class on nation building taught by Norman and available to undergraduate and graduate students.
In addition, Clark is one of three students who had the opportunity to take a Navajo language course this year, which Desmond said was organized through a collaboration with the Office of Undergraduate Education, HUNAP, and the EMR program.
Programs like HUNAP can also provide an outlet for students interested in Native American studies. This year, the group has hosted a variety of events co-sponsored by the Radcliffe Institute, including a symposium entitled “Native Peoples, Native Politics.” Several schools have active specific groups to talk discuss Native academic studies.
However, like visiting professors, Harvard students are only here for a limited time. According to multiple students, this means that some groups die out without enough students to sustain them.
“NALSA could very easily go away in a year based on admissions,” Kaslow said.
Matsumoto said that NAHC was worried it would not be able to fill its board in the next few years if Harvard did not attract a large number of Native students for the Class of 2020. Admissions numbers for Native admits to the College,though, are up from the previous year.
Although no comparable student group exists at GSAS, George said she has been involved with NAHC and is part of a newly-formed Native American and Indigenous Studies working group.
She said that she sees the lack of Native American Studies offerings puts Harvard at a disadvantage.
“I know Harvard likes to do things its own way, but it holds itself to the standard of the best,” she said. “They constantly remind themselves that they’re the best at everything, and I think that in my time here as well as the undergrads who are looking for these departments, they can say some very specific things that our school is not the best at.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 8, 2016, at 3:01 a.m.
Starting with Harvard’s Class of 2021, undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations will be banned from holding athletic team captaincies and leadership positions in all recognized student groups. They will also be ineligible for College endorsement for top fellowships like the Rhodes and Marshall scholarships.
Ending months of speculation, University President Drew G. Faust announced the sweeping changes in an email to undergraduates Friday morning. Accepting Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s recommendations—his first public proposals to regulate unrecognized single gender organizations—Faust framed the new policy as a matter of necessity.
“Although the fraternities, sororities, and final clubs are not formally recognized by the College, they play an unmistakable and growing role in student life, in many cases enacting forms of privilege and exclusion at odds with our deepest values,” Faust wrote. “The College cannot ignore these organizations if it is to advance our shared commitment to broadening opportunity and making Harvard a campus for all of its students.” 
Formed in response to the recommendations of a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention, the policy mirrors an idea that Khurana floated at a behind-closed-doors meeting with final club leadership in April.
While administrators have criticized single-gender social clubs, particularly male final clubs, for statistics purportedly linking them with an elevated risk of sexual assault, Faust and Khurana’s messages focused primarily on the membership selection practices of unrecognized single gender groups.
“[T]he discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances,” Khurana wrote. “The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men. In their recruitment practices and through their extensive resources and access to networks of power, these organizations propagate exclusionary values that undermine those of the larger Harvard College community.”
Khurana framed his decision as a logical evolution in Harvard’s “long and complex history of grappling with gender discrimination,” referencing Harvard’s integration with Radcliffe College and writing that “[i]n every era, change has come slowly and often with fierce opposition.”
“[The] unrecognized single-gender social organizations have lagged behind in ways that are untenable in the 21st century,” Khurana added.
Although current undergraduates as well as members of the incoming Class of 2020 will be exempt from the new policy, the change is sure to affect large swaths of the undergraduate population once it is enacted.
In February 2015, for instance, the Cambridge Panhellenic Council’s president estimated that 400 women—roughly six percent of the current undergraduate population—were involved in Harvard’s sororities. Furthermore, a number of undergraduates are members of Harvard’s unrecognized fraternities, male final clubs, female final clubs, or other unrecognized single-gender organizations such as the all-male Oak Club.
A yet-to-be-appointed committee of students, faculty, and administrators will craft the enforcement strategy for the broad proposal, likely a difficult task given that many unrecognized social clubs do not publicize their membership.
Khurana hinted that unrecognized single-gender social organizations that choose to adopt gender neutral policies and open selection processes could gain access to “certain Harvard facilities, among other possibilities to be determined by the advisory group.”
This is not the first time the College has attempted to pressure the clubs to adopt gender-neutral policies. In his letter, Khurana referenced a 1984 ultimatum to go co-ed from administrators, which clubs responded to by disaffiliation from the University. Khurana called that decision a choice “to maintain… discriminatory practices.”
Referencing the recent rise of sororities and female final clubs—the first of which, the Bee, was founded in 1991—Khurana wrote that these groups were “an effort to counter the male dominated dynamics of Harvard’s social scene.”
“Ultimately, all of these unrecognized single-gender social organizations are at odds with Harvard College’s educational philosophy and its commitment to a diverse living and learning experience,” he added.
While Faust emphasized that students could “decide for themselves” whether to join a single-gender social club, she defended the College’s decision to bar club members from captaincies, leadership positions, and fellowships.
“Captains of intercollegiate sports teams and leaders of organizations funded, sponsored, or recognized by Harvard College in a very real sense represent the College.They benefit from its resources. They operate under its name,” she wrote. “Especially as it seeks to break down structural barriers to an effectively inclusive campus, the College is right to ensure that the areas in which it provides resources and endorsement advance and reinforce its values of non-discrimination.”
Khurana meanwhile, reiterated his stance that the groups are “antithetical to our institutional values,” adding that “Harvard has the obligation to establish the general regulations and standards governing Harvard students, faculty, and staff that are consistent with our educational philosophy.”
The announcement comes at the end of a particularly tumultuous year for Harvard’s single-gender social organizations. In the fall, administrators repeatedly put pressure on all-male clubs to go co-ed, with the previously all-male Spee and the Fox clubs ultimately extending membership to some women.
Meanwhile, the College made efforts to plan College-sanctioned social events and revamp House life. In October, Faust allocated a “lump sum” to the College from her discretionary funds for the purpose of creating more open social events. Khurana used some of the funds to bankroll a party planned by women’s groups on campus. In his letter Friday, Khurana wrote that he would “continue to invest in social alternatives and increase its social programming budgets.”
This spring, the Task Force for the Prevention of Sexual Assault’s report upbraided the clubs for espousing “a culture often inimical to Harvard College.” The report found that 47 percent of surveyed senior women at the College who had “participated” in final clubs reported having experienced nonconsensual sexual contact during their undergraduate years, “ half again” the average of 31 percent for all senior women. One of the report’s six “key recommendations” advocated “address[ing] the distinctive problems presented by the Final Clubs and other unrecognized single-sex social organizations.” In her announcement today, Faust wrote that she was “mindful in particular about concerns that unsupervised social spaces can present for sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse.”
After the Task Force report’s release, Khurana held multiple meetings with undergraduate and graduate leaders of final clubs as well as a meeting with undergraduate leaders of Greek organizations. At those meetings, attendants reported that Khurana remained coy, with many coming away frustrated by what they deemed a lack of specificity from the Dean of the College.
Additionally, many final clubs worried that the College could consider barring undergraduate enrollment in the groups, an option Khurana refused to rule out last semester and has kept as a possibility for the future.
Leaders from three clubs—the all-male Porcellian Club, the all-male Fly Club, and the all-female Sablière Society—publicly criticized the administration for their dealings with the clubs, though Sablière leaders expressed support for the College’s aim of “moving towards gender inclusivity.”
Despite one meeting with undergraduate leaders of fraternities and sororities, those organizations have largely been left out of conversations with administrators. At their meeting, Greek organizations were not issued a deadline to tell Khurana whether they were planning on going co-ed, something he did ask of final club leaders. 
While members of single-gender social clubs will not be affected by the policies until the Class of 2021 arrives on campus in 2017, the move could potentially prompt some clubs to go co-ed. The policy could also spell an end to years of steady growth in the number of students rushing Greek organizations.
Khurana’s letter and Faust’s email left the door open for further sanctions against the clubs down the road, including a much-feared option similar to that pursued in 2014 at Amherst College, which would bar simultaneous membership in both the College and single-gender social organizations.
Khurana suggested that the new policy should be formally reviewed three years after its enactment “to assess whether additional steps should be considered and implemented.”
Accepting this recommendation in her letter, Faust asked Khurana to provide a report at the end of each of the next three academic years providing “the College’s assessment of the role the single-gender social organizations are playing in College life and whether the College should be considering any further action to advance our core institutional values.”

In a few years, Harvard undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations will no longer be eligible to hold leadership positions in official student organizations and athletic team captaincies. They will also be ineligible for the College’s endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall.
The new sanctions are almost sure to have sweeping effects on Harvard’s final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. The announcements marks the first time Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has publicly detailed how the College plans to regulate unrecognized single gender social organizations. Below is a quick primer on the final clubs, institutions unique to Harvard, and the administration’s actions toward them over this tumultuous year.

Final clubs are historically single-gender social clubs. Although similar to fraternities and sororities, clubs are differentiated by their unique selection process. Students may not join until their sophomore year and even then must be “punched,” or invited to apply, for membership. Over successive rounds of punch events, the number of “punches” is winnowed down until a select few are initiated into the club. Also unlike fraternities and sororities, clubs are independently owned and, since 1984, are unaffiliated with the University—a decision they made after administrators tried to force them to go co-ed. Most clubs are Massachusetts corporations ultimately run by club graduates, who control the club’s assets and finances.
Harvard has six all-male clubs, five all-female clubs, and two co-ed clubs—though within one of those, the Fox Club, women enjoy only “provisional” membership after internal divisions over whether to admit women racked the club’s graduate leadership. The eight historically male clubs own valuable Cambridge properties and have included in their membership several United States Presidents, well-known authors, and politicians. The female clubs are much younger, with the first one forming in 1991, and have yet to secure full control of off-campus properties.

The administration has levelled two main criticisms against the clubs: one centered around sexual assault and another focussing on gender equity and perceived elitism.
The clubs were the subject of much criticism in a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention released in March. The report stated that 47 percent of surveyed female College seniors “participating in the Final Clubs” had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact” during their time in College. An independent analysis commissioned by the all-male Porcellian Club, however, contested the relevance of that figure. In an interview this week, Faust stood by the report, saying that qualitative and quantitative data backed the findings.
The report also raised concerns about the clubs’ single-gender nature, referencing reports of “deeply misogynistic” attitudes and accusing the male organizations of a “culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission.”
As early as 2011, now-Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana criticized the clubs, saying that he was “always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity.” Since assuming the deanship in 2014, he has reiterated that, in his mind, single-gendered social organizations “are not appropriate” for the College.
President Faust has echoed Khurana’s concerns about what they call gender exclusivity and elitism, saying Wednesday that “the final clubs have had a focus of concern because they do have a status and an influence on campus that is long-lived… and powerful.”

Not kindly. While the Spee and the Fox did make the transition this fall, Fox undergraduates told their graduate leaders that Harvard had “forced [their] hand,” pressuring them into adding women to their ranks. Other clubs, most notably the A.D. Club, remained staunchly opposed to any change regardless of the administration’s rhetoric. An A.D. alumnus even drew up a potential legal defense for the club should Harvard ban students from participating in final clubs. The club has since adopted some policies—mandating annual sexual assault training for its undergraduates, opening its punch process, and closing its clubs to guests—perhaps aimed at addressing the College’s concerns while retaining its “single-gender character.”
This spring, leaders of the Porcellian Club and the Fly club have publicly criticized the administration for the way Harvard has pressured the clubs to reform. Then-graduate president of the Porcellian Charles M. Storey ’82 implied that the Porcellian was “being used as a scapegoat for the sexual assault problem at Harvard.” Fly Club president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 publicly called for Khurana’s recusal from conversations with clubs, citing a recent Title IX lawsuit as evidence of a “conflict of interest” on Khurana’s part.

The all-female clubs have expressed fewer of their concerns publicly, though a recent op-ed in The Crimson from the graduate leaders of the Sablière society accused administrators of ignoring the concerns of the all-female clubs and pursuing gender neutral membership “primarily as a form of damage control” after negative media attention.
Though the op-ed expressed agreement with the goal of “moving towards gender inclusivity,” its authors implied that because the female clubs do not have regular access to property, they could die out if they were forced to compete with propertied clubs for new recruits.

Khurana and other administrators repeatedly kept their options open and their thoughts private, refusing to rule out regulations as strong as prohibiting simultaneous enrollment in the College and membership in a club. For months, clubs have feared that the College could consider barring undergraduates from joining single gender social organizations, a policy Amherst instituted in 2014.
The policy that Khurana ultimately announced was proposed at a meeting with graduate and undergraduate final club leaders in April.

Starting with the Class of 2021, members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations will not be allowed to hold leadership positions in recognized student organizations and will be ineligible to apply for fellowships (such as the Rhodes and Marshall) that require endorsement from the Dean of the College.
This will include not only members of final clubs, but also students associated with fraternities, sororities, or any other single-gender unrecognized group, such as the all-male Oak Club.

A yet-to-be-appointed committee of students, faculty and administrators will decide the specifics of enforcement. Given many unrecognized single-gender clubs do not publicize their membership lists, enforcement could present a logistical headache for the administration.
While Faust wrote in her announcement that students can “decide for themselves” whether to join single-gender social organizations, neither she nor Khurana ruled out an outright ban on membership for Harvard students. Faust asked Khurana to provide a report at the end of each of the next three academic years exploring “whether the College should be considering any further action” towards the clubs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Across the board, student-athletes at Harvard must strike a delicate balance between academics and athletics—a task that, in and of itself, requires time management and resolve.
For senior Walker Kirby, a defenseman on the men’s lacrosse team, time management has proven to be one of his strong suits, enabling him to contribute to the intellectual and competitive atmosphere that embodies Harvard.
On March 30, Kirby was announced as one of only 10 lacrosse finalists for the 2016 Senior CLASS Award.
The accolade is a distinct honor awarded to NCAA Division I athletes who have displayed notable achievements in the spheres of character, community, classroom and competition.
Through his commitment to his team and to service, Kirby serves as an example of these cardinal values.
In athletics, Kirby has proven to be an integral part of the men’s lacrosse team throughout his four-year tenure as a defenseman.
“His competitive spirit fuels our team all week before games, because of his consistently high level of effort and dedication,” said freshman midfielder Conor Murphy. “The level of intensity and focus that he brings to practice everyday raises the bar for everyone else on the team…. He is always making the tough play, diving for shot out of bounds, coming up with a hard ground ball, and those plays inspires everyone on the field and on the sideline.”
While obviously goals win games, strong defense that is able to stave off shot attempts and snatch up ground balls to earn your team possession is a pivotal part of the winning recipe as well.
During his sophomore year, Kirby helped the Crimson to an Ivy League Championship split with Cornell, the first time the team had won a share in 24 years. In his subsequent year as a junior, Kirby transitioned from a long-stick midfielder to close defense, upon which he posted career highs with 33 ground balls, 13 caused turnovers and four goals in transition.
This impressive season resulted in his being named All-Ivy League Honorable Mention and to the All-New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (NEILA) second team.
In his most recent season at Harvard, Kirby has distinguished himself yet again, picking up 28 ground balls and causing 7 turnovers, to place the Crimson in fourth in the Ivy League.
“[Kirby’s] just extremely passionate about whatever it is that he’s doing,” defenseman Stephen Jahelka said. “Obviously that’s the case on the field—he’s always trying hard, he never takes a practice off, and gives a hundred and ten percent every day. He’s also really true to himself about being a student-athlete here and he brings that same intensity he has on the lacrosse field to the classroom.”
Demonstrating his ability to translate his passion for competition into the classroom, Walker Kirby has distinguished himself as an exemplar student at Harvard.
The economics concentrator has managed to maintain a 3.7 GPA throughout his seven semesters here, while additionally fulfilling his requirements for a secondary concentration in government.
“[Kirby] challenges himself in all his courses,” said Murphy upon being asked about Kirby’s academic success. “He chooses to take difficult and challenging courses, even outside of his concentration, setting a precedent, and younger guys look to that and follow suit. He doesn’t just take classes to get good grades, or get by, but takes them to truly learn the subject and get the most out of it.”
In addition to cultivating his own talents both on the field and in the classroom, Kirby has thrown his hat into the ring in other non-academic, non-athletic pursuits.
Kirby’s journey through service started in the summer following his freshman year.
That summer, Kirby spent eight weeks in South Africa at Don McKenzie Hospital, working to treat patients suffering from HIV and tuberculosis.
Currently, he holds the position of service representative on the lacrosse team’s leadership council. As such, Kirby has been crucial in getting his own team involved with several service initiatives aimed at helping out the local Boston community.
Team Impact and the One Love Foundation are two organizations in particular to which he has encouraged his teammates to contribute.
With Team Impact, the men’s lacrosse team has developed a close relationship with a young man suffering from several ailments. As a result of the formation of his bond, the team has invited him to practices and games and even gave him his own official locker in the team’s locker room.
The One Love Foundation is a charitable organization that aims to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence. In order to raise donations for the One Love Foundation, Kirby encouraged his teammates to log their yards run during winter seasons as part of the Yards for Yeardley campaign.
“One Love has been something that has really brought our team together and Walker’s been heavily involved in promoting that,” said Jahelka. “Walker not only makes sure everyone’s doing their yards [for the campaign] but he makes sure to run a lot and work extra hard for the cause. He’s also been good about not only taking this cause to our team but also making sure to spread awareness around campus about issues of domestic violence.”
