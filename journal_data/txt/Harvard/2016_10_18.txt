In their latest installment, Latin jazz duo Mili Bermejo and Dan Greenspan triumphantly return in “Arte del Dúo.” The album is a minimalist piece in which the only musical exchange occurs between the human voice and double bass over the course of 12 songs. What it lacks in instrumental diversity, however, it makes up for with powerful vocals and instrumental mastery. Over the past two decades, the duo have collaborated on a number of works. While they do not reinvent the proverbial musical wheel in Latin jazz, subtle changes that can only come from years of collaboration result in an inviting musical experience.
Compared to the pair’s 1997 album “Duo,” Greenspan has a more palpable presence. His double bass shares the space with Bermejo’s melodious vocals as opposed to remaining in the background. In “Las Orillas del Mar,” it takes center stage with the vocals serving as support. The greater role occupied by the double bass works tremendously for “Los Que se Aman” and the tango “Candombé para Gardel.” The exclusive focus on both vocals and bass is a definitive strength of the album. Nevertheless, the over-reliance on this powerful formula facilitates the emergence of a repetitive pattern between songs in an already homogeneous album.
With the exception of the penultimate track, all of the album’s lyrics are in Spanish. Although Bermejo has alternated in previous works among Spanish, English, and Portuguese, she has always expressed a preference for her native tongue. As the only song with English lyrics, “End of the Beginning,” possesses a rising tension in its lyrics that is further accentuated by the bass. Only in the latter half is there a shift from the English lyrics to wordless vocals with a playful tone that defuse the previously built up tension in the track. “Los Que se Aman,” which tells the story of those who “love one another with wonder,” is among the majority of Bermejo and Greenspan’s songs that cannot quite translate into English without betraying the feeling behind them.
The magic of singing in Spanish is at its best when Bermejo’s lyrics touch upon her Latin American heritage as the daughter of a Mexican composer and an Argentine tango singer. Discreet song titles such as “Candombé para Gardel,” are a nod to both the Uruguayan music genre “Candombe” and the famous Argentine singer Carlos Gardel. Bermejo’s tribute to her Latin American heritage extends beyond Argentina in “Tres Veces Heroica,” an homage to the city of Veracruz and its inhabitants, whose “souls are as pure as the foam that spouts from the ocean.”
In her latest work, Bermejo does not limit herself to singing lyrics but also uses her voice as an instrument. In “Candombé para Gardel,” Bermejo mimics the rhythm of the drums in the Uruguayan music genre in the previously mentioned “Candombé.” The improvisational use of vocals breaks the monotony of the bass in “End of the Beginning.” The true magic in Bermejo’s skill as a vocalist goes beyond the emotion that permeates her lyrics. Her gift lies in her unique ability as storyteller, which shines through in “Tres Veces Heroica,” one of the best tracks of the album. Here, she artfully narrates the history of the citizens of Veracruz, which “opened its door to civilization and its footsteps with laurels.” Again and again the rhythmic lyrics go beyond exposition of the story of Veracruz to immerse the listener to the story.
In their latest album, Bermejo and Greenspan are doing what they do best: taking us on a journey to the magical realm of “Arte del Dúo,” filling our hearts with melodical joy.

Duos don’t get much more promising than NxWorries. You’ve got Knxwledge, laying down shambling, unquantized drums over magically chopped samples like Dilla Dawg reincarnated; you may have heard his work on “To Pimp A Butterfly,” where he contributed the beat to the sublime “Momma.” And you’ve got Anderson .Paak (don’t forget the dot), the hidden king of 2016. After popping up indelibly on Dre’s “Compton,” he made this year his own with a soulful sophomore effort on Steel Wool/OBE/EMPIRE records, “Malibu,” and scene-stealing features on albums like Kaytranada’s “99.9%” and Schoolboy Q’s “Blank Face LP.”
Yet it turns out they’ve got a long way to go in fulfilling all of their promise. NxWorries’ breakout song, “Suede,” made for a trifling listen. Knxwledge flips a Gil Scott-Heron sample for the beat, slowing it to a sluggish crawl and sapping it of its energy. Meanwhile, .Paak coasts on his charisma, half-rapping and half-singing about such regressive topics as his fancy car and the coked-up girls sitting in it. Given the talent involved, the almost careless nature of “Suede” made for an inauspicious start. Yet the end of its music video offered hope: A smooth 30-second snippet that left people clamoring in the comments section. This snippet sat unnamed for over a year before NxWorries finally released the full version as the third single off their upcoming album, “Yes Lawd!”
That single, “Lyk Dis,” is a step in the right direction. .Paak continues to behave as though there’s nothing new under the sun, rap-singing about morning sex and milking the subject for all its worth. Yet he brings a sense of melody that only appeared in glimmers on “Suede.” Just listen to his syncopated delivery of the line, “No need to thank me, yours for the taking and yeah,” his voice easing onto each descending note like a Slinky down a staircase. Even his intro, which only consists of the words “yeah” and “oh,” is more infectious than anything on “Suede.” Knxwledge also steps up his game: Instead of stumbling around lazily like “Suede,” “Lyk Dis” flows like honey, with a soaring violin and a lurching bassline that circle each other before coming together in unearthly harmony. The brisk tempo and clattering percussion thwart the track’s destiny as mood-setting music, but they also manage to transform it into something new in the process—a kind of mutant slow jam, a song both sensual and alien. With “Lyk Dis,” NxWorries finally harnesses the peerless talents of its members and makes good on its name.

“Grace, I have to warn you,” my fifth grade classmate whispered during our quiet library time. “That book has the word…” Her eyes flickered to a copy of Lisi Harrison’s “The Clique.” Her voice dropped, and I had to lean in to hear: “... bitch.”
That was my first encounter with “The Clique” series, and it launched a three year obsession with finding every existing novel in the series and reading them voraciously. Even after the magic wore off, I still kept with the series until 2011, when the last sequel—“A Tale of Two Pretties”—was published. And after I devoured that book, I looked up from the last page with the same confusion and question I had asked for the other 13 books in the series: What did I just read?
For context, “The Clique” follows five middle school girls living in Westchester, NY. Massie Block is the “alpha” of her clique—the Pretty Committee. Other members include Alicia Rivera (Massie’s second-in-command), Dylan Marvil, and Kristen Gregory. Massie keeps their private middle school—Octavian Country Day, or “OCD” as she likes to call it—under pretty controlling leadership, using snarky insults and expensive style as her weapons. She’s like the Regina George[, or the Blair Waldorf of the series.
And what about the fifth girl? That would be Claire Lyons, a transfer student from Florida who ends up staying in the Block guest house along with the rest of her family. Lyons’s dad and Block’s dad are good friends). This move happens during seventh grade. Claire’s lower financial status and all-Gap wardrobe threaten Massie’s clique, who all happen to be ridiculously wealthy (though later on we find out that Kristen is secretly poor) and shop in stores like Barneys] and Saks.
The entire series, then, is all about the scandals that go on in the girls’ outlandishly luxurious lives. Claire battles Massie for power; they eventually become best friends and then face new challenges together, like a backstabbing foreign exchange student, slipping social statuses, and high school boys. It's like “Gossip Girl,” except trade first times for first kisses, the college application anxiety for pre-high school nervousness, and the details about high-end fashion for… actually, keep that. “The Clique” was “Gossip Girl,” just younger.
So why did I read this series so obsessively? It might be for the same reason so many people watch “Gossip Girl.” We know it’s trash. We know that characters overreact, lie, cheat, steal for petty reasons, and we know that literally all of the problems on the show—or book—could be solved with proper communication and simple human kindness. But we keep watching anyway, because all of that drama happens to be extremely entertaining.
Then again, I think I really liked the series because I could empathize with the characters. Massie was cruel. She was emotionally abusive and controlling, and I couldn’t help but feel sorry for everyone who had to deal with her.  But I also couldn't help but feel sorry for her. As the series progressed, I quickly understood that Massie’s spiky exterior was a shield for her insecurities—her fears of being alone and of never living up to expectations. These are emotions a lot of us at Harvard feel, and they were emotions that I definitely felt as an awkward middle schooler. Past the designer clothing and rudeness, Massie’s just another insecure kid with the same fears as the rest of us. As Harvard students, we're expected to get the best grades, snag the most prestigious internships, and look like we're having the most stressful but fun time of our lives.
We're expected to be perfect, just like Massie. Being anything but would be devastating.
At the end of the series (spoiler alert), Massie’s family loses all their money, and all of her worst fears come true. She’s worried that her school will shun her. But more importantly, she’s worried that her friends will too.
But that isn’t the case. They stand proudly by her side, because they’re not in it for the social status. They’re in it for the friendship. They let her know that it’s all right to slip up, to not have the newest clothes, to not have the tightest grips on things. They let her know that it’s okay to not be perfect, and I’m waiting for someone to tell me that too.

In skimming through Maroon 5’s entire music video history (which spans the course of over a decade—feel old yet?), it’s pretty safe to say that nothing the band has created is quite like the music video for their latest single, “Don’t Wanna Know.” Surprisingly, the video is a deliberate departure from their most recent offerings, entirely avoiding the sultriness of videos like “This Summer” and “Animals” in favor of something, well, more eccentric, to say the least. In brief, if you came into the video with the sole expectation of a shirtless Levine singing heart-wrenching lyrics into a standing microphone, you’re in for a shock.
The video opens with a close-up shot of Adam Levine waking up one morning as a giant pseudo-insect-tortoise. This sounds unreal. It’s not. Levine wears a worn-out expression, obviously dissatisfied with the way his life’s going despite the fact that the video depicts him living in a lavish mansion, doing yoga, and blending kale smoothies. Throughout the course of the video, we’re introduced to other equally giant and bizarre caricatures, such as an innocuous eggplant and a hemi-tomato with tentacles (seriously, this is all real). Notably, all the caricatures run away from hordes of teenagers who try to capture them through a mysterious app on their smartphones.
Given teenagers with smartphones running around the street, capturing outlandish creatures, the video clearly references the “Pokémon Go” craze that exploded during the past summer. Still, though the fact that the video alludes to Pokémon at least elucidates the cartoonish costumes, to say that the video is merely a play on the game would be to completely neglect the video’s underlying message. Maroon 5, a band that’s been under the scrutiny of the public eye since the early 2000s, uses the inanity of “Pokémon Go” to lightheartedly address an issue they’re all too familiar with—the suffocating nature of runaway celebrity culture.
The video incorporates several larger-than-life scenarios that only serve to accentuate this theme. In one scene, for example, a somehow mammalian-like bee with antlers must flee its elliptical to avert the public’s voyeuristic gaze. In another, an amorphous snow pea with a disturbing amount of leaky vitreous humor does a bit of leisure reading at an outdoor café but is ultimately chased out of its spot by a crowd and inevitably captured by a young woman’s smartphone. Even Levine’s insect-tortoise character himself, who is romantically interested in a rather disappointingly normal tangelo (Sarah Silverman), is precluded from confessing his feelings by a throng of smartphone-bearing teens.
Feel uncomfortable yet? Well, perhaps that’s the point. Each scenario’s absurdity is deliberate in its being so profuse as to be jarring. Through “Don’t Wanna Know,” Maroon 5 offers the idea that maybe celebrities aren’t people who should be sought after like pocket monsters. That maybe we should respect that celebrities enjoy going out to cafés, being in relationships, or going on an elliptical once in awhile. And that perhaps the difference between those who are celebrities and those who aren’t isn’t nearly as dichotomized as we make it out to be.

I’ve never especially prided myself on my taste in music, but I think I know a thing or two about quality tunes vs formulaic pop. The Summer Set are without a doubt the latter. Their melodies are simple and repetitive, and every time you hear a new song of theirs you think you’ve heard it before because all their songs sound pretty similar both to each other and to the other generic pop playing on the radio. And yet something about their music just speaks to me deep inside.
Some of their lyrics are cliché and trite but still manage to be satisfying. Take: “Throw our hearts in the air, hearts in the air, hearts in the air, we’re catching lightning in a bottle, don’t give a f--- about tomorrow.”
Some just seem to be factually inaccurate. For example: “If I was James Dean, you could be my Audrey / ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ for two.” I’m pretty sure James Dean was not in that movie. (Also, don’t get me started on the grammar here; that clearly should have been the subjunctive mood.)
But there are some real gems in their songs, such as “We couldn’t make it to the bedroom / So you pushed me to the ground / Said, I must confess this ain’t my house / But my ex is not around.” Or the tragically relatable: “Lately I stare into the mirror and I say to myself / I’ve spent too many nights watching ‘How I Met Your Mother’ alone / Now I’m searching for my yellow umbrella, hoping I’ll take her home / Maybe I just want to be legendary.”
There are also unexpectedly moving lines like, “Cause I believe that we gotta be good for something / I believe that the moment will come / But if we die and find out it was all for nothing / Least we know that youth wasn’t wasted on us.” 
I sometimes entertain the theory that The Summer Set are really providing a very postmodern commentary on the tropes that make up pop music and on the cultural shallowness of contemporary youth. Maybe their music is so cliché and yet so catchy because they are self-consciously cliché. Regardless of the objective quality of their melodies or the refinement of their lyrics, The Summer Set will always hold a special place in the musical shelf of my heart.

“Do you ever think your dreams are trying to tell you something?” the narrator asks in the opening sequence of “Falling Water,” USA’s newest sci-fi drama series. “What if our dreams are like tiles in a grand mosaic that we’re all dreaming together? And what if a person, that one right person, could wander out of their dream and into yours? What if that person is you?”
“Falling Water,” directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (“Intacto,” “28 Weeks Later”), tells the story of three strangers who slowly realize that their dreams are connected in the same universe. Lizzie Brocheré is Tess, a mousy, pouty woman who makes a living as a trend-spotter and whose dreams revolve around a nonexistent son. Taka (Will Yun Lee) is a quiet police officer, tasked with the care of an unresponsive woman, who is presumably his wife. His dreams vary from encountering a faceless woman in the middle of a suburban street to watching his younger self chase his mother to no avail. And in the least accessible narrative, Burton (David Ajala, “The Dark Knight”) spends his days as a head of security and his nights dreaming about the Woman in Red (Anna Wood), an old flame. Creepily monitoring the progress of the whole storyline is Bill (Zak Orth, “Wet Hot American Summer”), a businessman of some kind who offers Tess a chance to learn more about her son. Though Fresnadillo offers viewers enough clues to piece together parts of the story, he does so in a way that facilitates confusion rather than curiosity.
“Falling Water” falls prey to the standard pitfalls of dream-related narratives. Its jarring, fragmented storytelling is perpetually a little too disjointed. Viewers find themselves immersed in the constant, perplexed internal monologue: Was this scene all a dream? What about that scene? And what about that one?
Its mediocre cinematography meets standard TV criteria but does not impress in any extraordinary way. With gratuitous close-up shots of an eye slowly opening and a series of obvious falling water motifs (symbolism!), its film-editing techniques fall short of subtlety. The storytelling relies a little too heavily on voiceover—the weakest tool in the filmmaker’s box.
Casting, featuring female, black, and Asian protagonists, is commendably diverse; however, acting is unfortunately lackluster. Playing Burton, Ajala stiffly goes through the motions of acting in a lilting British accent. Lee, as Taka, is half as exciting as his character needs to be, managing to always look half-asleep. Orth’s excited delivery of the line “Imagine absolute connectivity! No wires, no wi-fi, no servers, no routers, just pure communication, cerebral cortex to cerebral cortex!” evokes impressions of a mad scientist, but in only a mildly interesting way. Only Brocheré, with permanently furrowed eyebrows and a leather jacket, offers someone for viewers to root for, demonstrating the widest emotional range of the three main characters.
With a slow beginning (the first action scene occurs after 22 minutes), “Falling Water” hesitates to deliver any story worth watching. “Falling Water” is the kind of show you know you have to see more of for it to make sense, but the show lacks enough compelling components to motivate watching further. Though it’s probably not the next “Stranger Things”-level sensation, it has the potential to attract a small but dedicated cultish following. The rest of us, however, will likely sleep through the rest of the season.

Courtney B. Vance ‘82 is an award-winning actor on stage and screen, with roles in productions including “The Hunt for Red October,” “Fences,” “Six Degrees of Separation,” “The Preacher’s Wife,” “Lucky Guy,” and “American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson.” Vance spoke with The Harvard Crimson about his path to fame and his time at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: What was the big moment in which you realized that acting was something that you wanted to pursue as a career?
Courtney B. Vance: First of all, I had no idea what I wanted to do. That was my journey to Harvard, and I figured that we all didn’t know. I was going there assuming that there would be a bunch of students who didn’t know what they wanted to do, and we would all figure it out together. And so I got there and I discovered that everybody knew in freshman year what they wanted to do, and I was left there. I was on varsity track and I wasn’t doing what I told myself I would do, which was meet new people and we would all figure everything out…. When I made the decision to run track my freshman year, I was with the same group of guys the whole year, which initially was fine; it was familiar, and I played three sports in high school, so I knew the routine, but it wasn’t what I said I was going to do…. So I came back sophomore year and decided to do some shows because I did one small play senior year of high school and I had a lot of fun. I had one line, I think. I did an audition for a show; it was experimental theater and we had a great time. For my second show, I had a great role and a great time and my aunt came to see the show. I’m doing shows just to meet folks at this point, so that I could figure out what I want to do. When she saw the show, she said, “You know what? You may want to think about this as a career! You’re really good!” And that’s when the lightbulb went off. After that it was all about trying to figure out what was the next step. So I started acting in more shows. I did about five shows on campus and then realized it was kind of cliquey there, so I decided I should do more shows in Boston, maybe a workshop, just get some craft and work. One thing led to another, and I was in the Boston Shakespeare Company my junior and senior years…. In the summers I worked for the Shakespeare company in Lenox, Massachusetts, where I did additional training work.
THC: How did you then go into television and film?
CBV: Well, I knew nothing about film. I grew up with theater. My high school teachers would take us to the Stratford Festival in Ontario. Once I figured out I wanted to do theater, I thought about maybe taking a year off, doing some studying, but my parents didn’t want me doing that because it would extend their pay, so I discovered there’s graduate school! I could do graduate school! So then there was the whole where to go and the Yale School of Drama and all that. The hard part was figuring out how to do this knowing my parents told me I couldn’t just study while I was there, and there was no drama major, but there were shows everywhere. On campus, off campus, you could work constantly throughout the city. I rode a bike everywhere because I was totally broke. Once I discovered theater, I was going 15, 16, 17 hours a day, and I had discovered what I thought I wanted to do.  It was all because of Lloyd Richards—the dean of the Yale School of Drama—that I got into film. They cast me in “Fences,” and that went everywhere. We went to Chicago, then we were pre-Broadway in San Francisco. Then after I graduated, we all stayed with the show, and we went to New York and it won all the [awards]. It became the biggest straight play by an African American in history. So everyone saw me in that; that was my introduction to the theatrical world. So that set up the filmscape, “The Hunt for Red October,” any kind of TV movie, that was the world’s introduction to who Courtney B. Vance was. It was a wonderful introduction to theatrical society. That’s why I’m indebted to Lloyd Richards for his confidence and for sticking with me.
THC: When you play a role, after the filming or the production ends, what is it like to see a different adaptation?
CBV: I try not to judge. I’ve seen adaptations of “Fences” twice. I saw my wife do it, and I saw Viola Davis and Denzel Washington…. Yale, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and then to LA: We did five different productions and we knew it inside and out, so anyone that comes to it hasn’t had the same experience. I’ve done it maybe 500, 600 times, so anybody that comes to it after four weeks doesn’t have it the same, and I can’t judge them from where they were. I’ll see the movie soon, I’m sure, but August Wilson plays are very difficult, like Chekhov plays. It sinks in; there’s nothing else to do.
THC: How did going to Harvard impact your life and career as a whole?
CBV:  It changed my life. My uncle went to Harvard, and I wanted to go since I was eleven. It was a goal, which was a positive thing for a young African American child in the ’60s and ’70s and ’80s and ’90s to be focused on that. I had a lot of relatives there at the time, so there was family…. If everything got crazy for me at Harvard, I could always just get on my bike and go to my aunt’s house and hang out and get a real perspective. My family was all about education, and me being there was a combination of my parents instilling in my sister and I that this was the ticket to wherever you want to go in life—education. And that’s what I tell my children: You’ve got to work now, play later. You’ve got to get to the place where when you’re a senior in high school, you’ve got choices; you’ve got to put in the work. From an early age, [my sister and I] spent a lot of time at the library because there were no computers back then, and if you had homework to do, you had to go there to do your research (not so much today). But Harvard was transformational for me because I discovered acting there. I discovered the Boston Shakespeare Company and a lot of my contacts that eventually I kept up with through to today, and now I’m a big supporter of the school. I love going back, and I love interviewing students. Today, it’s a transformational place. I graduated in ’82, and every day there were different things going on—they were putting in the Red Line—and it was such a great place to be and to go to school.

Many people assume that Houghton, as a rare books and manuscripts library focused on the Western tradition, is simply not capable of the diversity that other Harvard book depositories exhibit. The University has, after all, so many spaces dedicated to the study of groups traditionally ignored by academia: Schlesinger Library, for instance, centers around women and women’s history, and Yenching Library revolves around the study of East Asia.
When I decided to begin a project to link pieces in the Houghton collection to each of the Harvard College concentrations, therefore, I was both exhilarated and apprehensive. I knew that subjects such as history, English, and comparative literature would be a piece of cake: Houghton has a preposterous numbers of First Folios, letters to and from chiefs of state, and manuscripts in countless languages. Leaving those traditional fields, however, the struggle seemed all too real: Without even thinking about the sciences, where to begin addressing the fields in the humanities and social sciences that did not put Western civilization on a pedestal?
I discovered, in what was perhaps one of the most gratifying experiences of the summer, that Houghton has more than enough material to warm the academic hearts of students in disciplines as disparate as African and African American studies, East Asian studies, and women, gender, and sexuality studies—and that is absolutely not the bottom of the story.
The Houghton materials that cater to these fields are still rare. They, like their more illustrious, mainstream counterparts, also have a story to tell. Their stories, in fact, are probably among the most fascinating in the entire collection—especially because of the historical context in which some of these items were produced.
One such story is that of what is probably my favorite book in the entire Houghton collection: “Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium,” an entomology treatise on the insects of the colony of Dutch Guyana, the modern country of Suriname, published in Amsterdam in 1705. Nothing too out of the ordinary: Its title is in Latin, the international scientific language of the time, and its superficial description displays, in fact, a scientific European imperialism. The orthodoxy, however, stops there.
First of all, the actual treatise was written in Dutch, which is unusual for the time period. Even more unusual is the fact that the book’s author, Maria Sibylla Merian, was a woman—and not just any woman. An accomplished artist and scientist, she had been drawing and painting nature since a very young age. Though she did marry and have a daughter, she managed to publish three compilations of engravings before leaving her husband (in late 17th century Europe). Five years later, she moved to Amsterdam, and the city itself financed her journey to Suriname in 1699. Merian, unafraid, took her daughter with her. They returned to Europe in 1701, after Merian contracted malaria, and she published her magnum opus in 1705. She produced and, with her daughter’s help, hand-colored the insect engravings that adorn the book, which are among the most beautiful illustrations I have ever seen. Each copy of “Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium” is a unique testament to this woman’s vision and willpower. Merian was, against all odds, a self-made woman in an age when that was virtually impossible.
Unfortunately, she died in poverty in 1717 after a stroke cut her career short. Her opus, however, has survived, and she remains one of the progenitors of entomological drawing. Her beautiful plants and insects are scientific wonders and works of art. Most importantly, she carved her name in history when very few women of her time were able to do the same, and her story deserves to be studied.
As a classics concentrator, I had never imagined that the apple of my eye in a rare books and manuscripts library would be a scientific treatise, but that just shows how absolutely extraordinary this specific book is. Houghton is there for that and for countless other inquiries into areas that do not conform to the library’s stereotypical description. Merian’s treatise is just one instance of the collection’s broad range. Houghton is truly for all, and there is always more to see.
—
“Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium” can be found in HOLLIS under the call number Typ 732.05.567 or the HOLLIS number 002860975. To see it, students should call it up to the Houghton Reading Room and go to the library, which is located between Widener and Lamont.

Source of inspiration: Every major civil rights social movement is in some way a source of inspiration…. So much change can come from a movement, a person, an effort, just an idea born out of a single conversation.
A meaningful work of art: Anything by Audre Lorde.
Favorite movie: I can go really dark and tell you about a horror film that I like, but I’m not going to do that even though it seems seasonally appropriate. I do like scary movies. But I also don’t want to be so trite as to be like, “A League of Their Own”.... I think my favorite movie is “Big Fish.” It’s super weird but really touching.
Favorite book: “Fahrenheit 451” by Ray Bradbury.
Superpower of choice: Flight, for sure. It’d just be so convenient.
When not working: I go to law school at night…. But when I’m not doing that, I eat at Area Four in Kendall Square a lot with Liz Angowski and Leanna Barlow. I also try to do… things like be outside when that’s an okay thing to do. I like to go to the gym. I like to cook. I really like to cook. And I am kind of a… domestic homebody on weekends sometimes, where I just want to, like, get my life in order and do laundry and cleanup. But when I do go on adventures, I like to enjoy seasonally appropriate activities. I also really like going to Canobie Lake Park in New Hampshire. It’s an amusement park, and I make my friends go a lot. So basically, I’m 12: My favorite book is a book I read when I was 12, and my favorite activity is rollercoasters.
If you could have lunch with anyone, who would it be? My maternal grandmother, Susan B. Anthony, because Susan B. And Michelle Obama. Yeah, I think that’s my line-up: Three ladies. It’s a power lunch, and we would definitely go to Tasty Burger.
Favorite food: The not-pepperoni pizza at Area Four.
Best piece of advice received: Introduce yourself like this other person should know who you are.

We all know that life’s but a walking shadow and a poor player, but in the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production of “Macbeth,” Shakespeare’s most famous characters revealed much more. This unconventional production succeeded not only because of its strong cast but also because of the revitalizing nature of its experimental choices.
From the start, the set, which comprised of a broken deconstructed castle, perfectly echoed the fragmented minds of the leads while also encapsulating the disorder that accompanied much of the play. The warm lighting and the eerie soundtrack added a supernatural element to this atmosphere. The choice to frame soliloquies and moments of anguish with a red background or warm spotlights served as a good way to expose the truth amongst the many false political moments.
The soundtrack of the humming chords whenever the dead and the witches were present on stage breathed into these scenes a strangely ethereal quality that matched the slow, crouching movements these actors used to traverse the stage. The characters were also dressed in modern clothing, with many costumes, like the royal courts’ business suits and Lady Macbeth’s high heels and black cocktail dress, matching the formality of their characters. It seemed director Kier W. Zimmerman ’19, an inactive Crimson news editor, had done much to pare down the typical pomp that accompanies this popular production, instead imbuing a simplicity that made it more accessible to the audience.
One of the play’s strongest features was undoubtedly its stellar and gender-blind cast. “O gentle lady,/ ‘Tis not for you to hear what I speak:/ The repetition, in a woman’s ear,/  Would murder as it fell,” a grieving Macduff (Ben I. Ubiñas ’19) protested to Lady Macbeth (Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20) when she questioned him about Duncan’s murder. [There was a refreshing tinge of irony as a female Banquo (Balım Baructçu ’19) immediately crossed the stage and was given the news without hesitation. Such moments of glaring irony, peppered throughout the production, not only fascinated but also provoked valid questions regarding power and its relationship to gender.
Harvard Law School student Patrick Witt played Macbeth with curious dichotomy of violence and vulnerability that exposed his character’s tortured psyche. He delivered his bout of madness and guilt following Duncan’s murder with a tangible mix of confusion, insanity and fear. His performance created a palpable tension underscored by many of the characters entering and exiting the stage not only through the stage’s curtains but also through the audience’s exit. This staging worked in such a way as to make the characters feel closer and more real, as if the audience had been transported into this world of political strife.
Hyperion also completely reinvented the traditional role of the witches (played by Mason P. M. Sands '20, Sophia Jackman ’20, Ali L. Astin ’19). As they carried a flimsy elastic white sheet in which they enveloped the dead, the contours of limbs and faces protruded through this veil in a creepy, disembodied manner that successfully characterized the external agents of fate and death with a darkness and otherworldliness. Several of the witches’ lines were also redistributed to the troop of dead that followed them. At times, these dragged-out movements felt slightly over the top among the other minimalist elements of the play, but overall, this change continued to heighten the eeriness and served as a gentle reminder of death’s constant presence.
In another creative divergence, this “Macbeth” featured a pregnant Lady Macbeth. This decision surprisingly dovetailed with Lady Macbeth’s role, which McAuliffe played with a confidence and bravado that was at once captivating and entrancing. Each gesture and interaction with Macbeth was filled with a controlling lasciviousness that continued to fuel the ambiguity about who really holds the power within their relationship.
One of the most poignant moments of the play was perhaps MacDuff’s grief after being informed of the murder of his wife and children. Ubiñas gave a moving performance of despair, underscoring the importance of his final battle with Macbeth. Their well choreographed and exciting fight scene proved an excellent means of releasing all the tension that had been building from the start of the play.
Among many strong artistic choices, the breaking of the fourth wall by Lennox (Nick D. Hornedo ’19) in the middle of the first half of the play was less successful. While its intention might have been to bring relief and humor following Duncan’s grisly murder, which it partially achieved, it mostly engendered a kind of awkwardness and confusion. It felt too forced and out of place, breaking up the tension and mass of emotions that the play had so effectively built.
While this choice might not have worked as successfully, the play’s other creative liberties supplied a thought-provoking freshness that livened up a play that at times can feel too familiar. Along with this freshness, the Hyperion production’s powerful acting, cast and staging made it a thoroughly enjoyable show and a brilliant interpretation of the Bard’s classic.
Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s Macbeth ran from Oct. 13 to 16 in the Agassiz Theater.

On Saturday evening, Penn Masala, which bills itself as the world’s first South Asian a cappella group, performed a sold-out show at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School’s Fitzgerald Theatre. Penn Masala, formed at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996, has performed for Barack Obama and appeared in the 2015 movie “Pitch Perfect 2.” This weekend’s concert was a collaborative effort between the musical group and Harvard’s own South Asian Association.
Penn Masala performed three sets combining covers and original songs. Some songs were mashups of English and Hindi music, while others were classical Indian pieces. The group’s president, Hari Ravi, explained how they choose which songs to perform. “We actually look at multiple factors. For example, since the group rotates, we have different influxes of talent coming in. So we like to cater to the songs that we perform to whoever can sing well,” he said. “[If] we have an R&B talent, we like to put some songs into the concert list that feature R&B music or something. If we have really sweet indie tones, we like to put those voices in there as well…. Also, we like to promote the latest albums, so we have a couple of those latest songs on there as well.”
The music director of the group, Praveen P. Rajaguru, also spoke about their set list. “We always have our fan favorites…. They’re what [the audiences] come to hear. So we try to perform those songs as well.” Rajaguru explained that the group tracks views on their Spotify playlists and YouTube videos to determine their most popular songs.
Sruthi L. Muluk ’19, the South Asian Association’s outreach chair and co-lead and an inactive Crimson news editor, explained that Saturday’s concert was about more than music. “We are donating a portion of our proceeds to a charity called Pratham USA, which is dedicated to educating kids in India that do not have the opportunity to do so,” she said. “So we’re really excited about that.” Before the co-leads introduced Penn Masala, they had a representative from Pratham USA speak about the organization.
According to Simi Shah ’19, the cultural chair and another co-lead, the South Asian Association thought carefully before choosing a charity to support. “We went through a pretty hard list of organizations that we were contemplating donating to,” she said. “But I also think that investing in education is very important, and Pratham is a reputable organization that has done so much work. [The organization] maintains a presence all over the United States and in India, and when we reached out to them, [they were] just incredibly personable people that are really excited to be involved.”
Both co-leads agreed that the Penn Masala concert was an important way of spreading South Asian culture. “The coolest thing about this concert is that it’s bringing together South Asian students from all around Boston schools, which is something that is kind of hard to do,” Muluk said. “Usually SAA is focused on bringing the South Asian students in Harvard to their events, but this is [on] a really large scale. We have tons of kids from BU, MIT, Wellesley, all over, attending. So we’re really, really excited to be able to bring that many different types of people together.”

Imagine spending the next two years with seven other people under a glass biosphere, in a prototype of what could become an “off-earth colony.” Herein lies the premise of T.C. Boyle’s “The Terranauts,” a novel that explores the ecological and psychological aspects of a sealed biome coined E2. In the biosphere, which is monitored by the all-seeing Mission Control, the novel follows the stories of three individuals: Dawn Chapman, the mission’s ecologist; Linda Ryu; her bitter best friend who was rejected from E2; and Ramsay Roothoorp, E2’s resident flirt. The book touts a mixture of complex characters and compelling storytelling; however, Boyle’s latest effort falls short due to stereotypical plotlines, unconvincing attempts at realism, and largely despicable main characters.
The multi-narration in “The Terranauts” is not atypical of Boyle’s works. His previous novel, “The Harder They Come,” likewise adopted the points of view from three interconnected stories. In this aspect, the book does particularly well: By providing different views of the environment and the characters of E2, the book exposes constant subjective contradictions and commentary on each character—especially Dawn Ramsay—allowing the reader to form a much more complete view of the passing events. Linda’s story, however, is significantly different; we receive an “outside” perspective and a view from Mission Control on the progress, or lack thereof, of the eight Terranauts.
While the format has potential to be captivating, its delivery falls short. Although the book advertises an equal perspective from each of the three characters, “The Terranauts” is, in fact, a story about Dawn. A majority of the events that pass are the result of Dawn’s actions, and a sizeable portion of the novel focuses on Dawn’s mental growth when she becomes pregnant with Ramsay’s child. The reader learns about her psychological struggles around the pregnancy and the biosphere’s attempts to care for Dawn’s new baby Eve. While Dawn’s actions and stories demonstrate her being proactive, the other two characters are simply reactive: Ramsay is used as a support and foil to Dawn, while Linda essentially revolves her life around Dawn’s actions, her narrative ultimately taking the shape of a revenge story without much room for personal development. At the end of the book, Linda mentions, in reference to Dawn, “My question is, why does my story always have to be her story?” The reader is left wondering the same.
Another troublesome characteristic is that the characters are generally contemptible. Ramsay is a largely manipulative and egotistical person, and Dawn is not too dissimilar. Linda, on the other hand, is someone consumed by the prospect of revenge, unable to think or decide rationally. All three characters share something in common: unlikeability. Both Ramsay and Linda are over-the-top stereotypes, and neither are particularly captivating. Dawn, on the other hand, is much more complex in her portions of the story, but the constant negatively-toned second person view of her character ends on a sour note, as if we had been fooled by Dawn’s own sycophantic words.
Despite these failing, Boyle manages to piece together several important messages regarding religion and absurdism, all from an environmental perspective. The clever allusions to Genesis in the Old Testament go above and beyond: The leader of Mission Control is nicknamed G.C., God the Creator, and Ramsay quips about his and Dawn’s child, “If it’d been a boy, we would have called him Adam.” Dawn also becomes an analogue to Mary Magdalene, and the biosphere as a whole seems Eden-like in its status as a new world. The story in “The Terranauts” is one that has been told many times, but Boyle adapts it to a modern setting and for a place that is dangerously unknown. His references to absurdism and existentialism are stronger and subtler. By tradition, the members in E2 regularly perform plays picked out by G.C., and these are blatantly absurd—Ionesco’s “The Bald Soprano” and Sartre’s “No Exit.” These works form an important pairing, as they highlight the paradox of a prophet-like journey by atheistic scientists and ultimately delivers an intriguing commentary on science and faith.

Currently the editor-in-chief of the art world’s magazine of record, Artforum International, Michelle Kuo spoke with The Harvard Crimson this week about her path to the publication and her take on the state of the arts today. Kuo is also a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard, and her dissertation focuses on the 1960s art group E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology). She wrote for Artforum and other publications before taking the helm of the magazine in 2010.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you come to be where you are? What drew you to art history and to this work?
Michelle Kuo: I had always grown up loving art, actually practicing studio art, and really enjoying engaging with art in every way: going to museums, reading about it. When I was an undergrad, I majored in art history and political science. It was an interesting combination, because I was focusing at the time on the 19th century, so looking at 19th-century art, but also in this other major looking at the history of colonialism. I ultimately thought that I had found a real passion for art history. I was probably not cut out to be a studio artist, so I went with that. After graduation I actually ended up working in New York at one very early art start-up, which was fascinating. This was in 2000, so at the very beginning of people trying to sell art online or even think about what that would be. My job was to be the assistant editor of an online art magazine that was part of this website. So my job was really fun: I worked with a senior editor and I learned how to commission pieces and to work on editing text. And I was really immersed in the art world in New York, which was great. Then I actually ended up working for another art publication for a year before going back to graduate school at Harvard, and I did my Ph.D. in art history, which I’m actually still currently finishing…. I had already started writing for Artforum, and one of the contributing editors of Artforum was also my Ph.D. advisor, at the time teaching at Harvard, Yve-Alain Bois. I had another older classmate in graduate school who had gone to work for Artforum already, and they both encouraged me to write for the magazine. So I started writing brief pieces, reviews, columns. Then the magazine asked me to join as a staff member, and I sort of had a decision to make, which was whether to stay in academia and try to get a teaching job or to try this experiment and see what it was like working at this art magazine. From there it just expanded in ways that I hadn’t anticipated. I began as a senior editor, where I was editing essays, often by academics themselves: art historians, critics, literary critics. So it was a really great experience on a very different level of engaging with text: really trying to make sure that structurally it made sense, that it had an argument; if there wasn’t an argument, to try to give it one; then also to pay attention to language and to writing, to experiment with new kinds of styles and to really help enhance an author’s voice. So that was a great experience. Then I was asked to become the editor-in-chief two years [after joining the editorial staff], and so for the past six years that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m trying to oversee what goes into the magazine, the vision of the magazine, but at the same time on a very granular level to oversee the editing of each text, and of course putting together this really interesting visual object, which entails working with our graphic designers, photography editors, fact checkers, copy editors, etc…. And then also [I work] with our website, so with both print and digital. So that’s kind of how I got to where I am today.
THC: How does your coming from an art history background, as opposed to a publishing or literary background, change what you bring to the magazine?
MK: Surprisingly enough, most of my predecessors at Artforum have come from a publishing or literary background. So it’s an anomaly for me coming in as an art historian, even though that’s a bit ironic. So I’ve really tried to “put the art back in Artforum,” as I jokingly say, to really retrench our focus on close readings of artworks, on processes and materials, whether those materials are paint or a digital program. So I’m trying to privilege looking, listening, thinking very closely about works of art in whatever form they take, and making sure that each piece we publish has that attention and that care. In writing about art in general over, let’s say, the past 20 years, there has been a movement away from this kind of close reading and more toward what you might call social art history, or looking at context. [The social art history] is amazing, and we do that as well, but I think that any kind of understanding of art has to look at both form and content. There is no form without content, and vice versa. There is no social context without first understanding what the shapes or contours of that work are in the first place. That’s very much a mission that I’ve tried to reinforce at the magazine.
THC: What do you see as the role of the art critic, both within the art world and in public discourse considered more broadly?
MK: Well, there are always these truisms nowadays that no one cares about art criticism or critics, but I think that actually the opposite is the case. With the flood of information that we all face today, criticism, the notion of critical judgment, the notion of different perspectives, but also thinking seriously about questions of objectivity and subjectivity, are even more important. The art critic specifically can in many ways help us understand or address not only new developments in art but also in perception and experience, and to try and find new languages in which to talk about those experiences and forms. We have experiences today that someone living a hundred years ago would never have had: looking at a screen, or trying to understand what a drone is. What does that mean, first of all for artists, but also for how we can put into words what those experiences might mean or what they are like? So I think that’s become increasingly important as a role for the art critic.
THC: Where do you see interesting or compelling work being done in the art world today?
MK: On a couple of different fronts. One body of work that I am continually surprised and impressed by is that of the painter Laura Owens. She is someone who has been practicing for decades and is a painter, which to some might sound awfully quaint, but she has continually pushed the boundaries of what painting might mean and also what it might address, including things that we might not normally associate with painting, like digital culture and photography and imaging software—so not only images themselves but also how they’re circulated. Her practice changed pretty radically about five or six years ago. She just did an enormous site-specific installation in San Francisco, at the CCA Wattis [Institute for Contemporary Arts], where she didn’t just create paintings; she created an entire wall painting that wrapped around the space. The paintings were on panels, so they were the walls. It was this very large-scale venue, so it was an all-encompassing wallpaper or even decorative effect, but you felt swallowed up by these monumental images. You could also actually text a number in real time, and that would generate different sound recordings coming out of the walls, of the paintings. It was this funny, kind of hokey but really interesting experience to be immersed in this space, looking at these paintings that are partially hand-painted, partially digitally generated, and then also to be interacting with it in this way and to be hearing these sound effects, many of which were these purposefully chosen, funny found recordings from people’s speeches or movies. So I think she really has managed to engage how we see now, what it means to look at and hear in a digital age, but also still using in some way this very archaic medium of painting.
One other example would be the artist Anicka Yi, who like many other artists is exploring really new materials, different kinds of plastics, everything from [using] cell phones to chemically deriving new scents from different scent molecules. She’s creating artworks that probably relate very much to the legacy of Surrealism—this idea that you can put different things together that would otherwise not make any sense, but you get this uncanny, strange sensation seeing these things put together. Her sculptures and installations and works have very much the same effect, but updated for the kinds of experiences that surround us today.
THC: Who are some artists or writers that you look to as sources for your own work?
MK: One of the key thinkers would be my Ph.D. advisor, Yve-Alain Bois. He pioneered ways of looking at and thinking about art that are really singular because he just created these incredible insights based on essentially visual arguments and perceptions that no one had really had before. He made these incredible arguments about Mondrian, for example, by seeing certain visual elements in the pieces that no one had really put together in this way before. He just has this incredible eye, and for that’s what makes art history and art criticism exciting. I’m not a journalist, I’m not a political scientist, I’m not a historian, I’m someone who really cares about art. And that means something different, it means really thinking about that perceptual experience.
An artist that has been an inspiration to me, at least in terms of a peer in my own age group, is Cory Arcangel. He’s been extremely interesting and impacted the way that I think because he’s really pushed the boundaries of what it means to make work with technology, so dealing with obsolete technology but also pop culture and taking software programs, video games, images that circulate on the Internet, and creating extremely funny, pithy works that really deal with how we live with all this technology today. And he’s also just an incredibly smart and funny writer and in fact, also a coder. He’s someone who in the early 2000s redefined what art meant and what art could do.
THC: When you are writing about art, what is lost and what is gained in that process of translation?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


Stevie Wonder tunes, Latin dances, and jazzy melodies reverberated through Sanders Theatre among snaps and nodding heads as Béla Fleck and Victor Wooten strummed away on Saturday night. Sounds of Fleck’s banjo and Wooten’s bass paired together beautifully throughout the whole concert, sometimes mellow and sometimes bright, but always soulful and deeply engaging.
Long-term partners, Wooten and Fleck were original members of the band “The Flecktones”, which the latter started in 1988. The band has made numerous appearances throughout the years, including on screen with the “Tonight Show”, “Saturday Night Live”, and “Late Night with David Letterman.” Known for its diversified repertoire, the band created original fusions of classical, funk, bluegrass, rock, and world traditions that have won them six Grammy awards and wide acclaim.
Saturday’s performance was a manifestation of the band’s eclecticism. The show opener piece was upbeat and funky, and a couple of measures sounded awfully close to the famous opening chords of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. With such delightful surprises, as well as an impressive series of runs from Wooten, the duo established an engaging presence on stage. Their synchronization was precise and skillful, matched only by their movements back and forth on stage.
However, the slow and soulful pieces came across just as well. As Fleck and Wooten sat across from each other, gently strumming their acoustic broken chords on the strings, the music evoked a serene nighttime beach: The beat was rocking water slapping waves across the sand, and the alluring melody was the moonlight glittering over the sea.
The duo also made a point for the audience to take note of a piece in the unusual and difficult 11/16 time signature. This complex structure called for distinct rhythms that deviated from pieces that people, usually accustomed to music that comes in counts of multiples of 3 or 4 instead of 11, could sing and tap their feet to. However, the rhythm and beat flowed naturally with no sign of struggle, and the duo pulled off the impressive feat easily.
Fleck and Wooten took advantage of multiple banjos and basses each, switching among them depending on the mood of the piece. The variation and diversity of pieces in the show showcased all that Fleck could pull off without losing his flair and personal touch. “Stomping Grounds” was the most folky piece and twanged with country vibes, while the preceding piece rang with tributes to Stevie Wonder. Latin flairs also added a sassy touch that Fleck was able to accomplish perfectly on the banjo. Most notably, Fleck’s African excursion in 2005 was evident in some of his pieces, with chords and beats reminiscent of tribal influences.
In solo sections, Fleck simply shone. His count of 15 Grammy awards and 30 nominations spoke for itself, but to hear him live unveiled another treasure altogether. The raw banjo rang throughout the theatre, with his round sound resounding in his whimsical runs. Wooten executed his solo sections to the point, but what brought him above was his attention to performance. Known for his dedicated work in music outreach and education, Wooten has published a much-acclaimed novel, “The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music.” This passion for music was clearly reflected on the stage not only through his music but also through his engaging visual performance that he committed his whole body to. At one point, Wooten on the bass made a lighthearted and joking addition as he almost pretended to come in at parts of Fleck’s solo, but always pausing and waiting a few more measures. Finally, when he did come in, however, the deep sounds of the bass completed the ensemble.
The lighting in the theater, from mellow purplish vibes to warm yellow, also helped to make the show more visual and complemented the tones set by the music. The Sanders stage provided plenty of room for the performance, though perhaps the setup could have taken advantage of more of that room.

Set the scene at Princeton University, where gothic architecture wears crawling ivy rather than red brick. Students can catch evolutionary biology major Ayla Allen walking to her repertory dance class on 185 Nassau Street every Tuesday and Thursday.
If Allen were one year younger, the scene might have been drastically different. She might have been rushing past the Quad to get to the Harvard Dance Center instead. But when Allen was a high school senior, visiting Harvard in April 2014, she left disappointed. Hoping for a vibrant dance scene she could call home, she instead found the course variety lacking—and a dance-focused major or minor nonexistent.
“I didn’t see the variety of styles that I needed,” Allen says. She later mentions that she wanted to pursue dance in other ways than class or student group work. “The fact that Harvard didn’t have a minor in dance was pretty major, just because a lot of dancers that get into professional companies later on either have a BFA in dance or were involved in a minor program with dance.”
Harvard’s Theater, Dance, and Media concentration did not exist until Oct. 1, 2015, and the secondary in dramatic arts Harvard offered was primarily theater-based. While schools like Princeton and Yale had already had larger programs running for years, Harvard’s own concentration is only just starting to take the stage.
The question of why, though, is still a mystery. But some professors have a few ideas.
“I think all universities—in particular traditional universities—have had a process… of reflection and transformation in accepting art-based courses. Traditional universities were not designed to accommodate that,” says Martin Puchner, chair of Theater, Dance, and Media and the Byron and Anita Wien professor of drama and of English and comparative literature. “People will say there are art schools, vocational schools, performing arts schools like Julliard. Traditional universities—they do the humanities, but they don’t do the art-making.”
Puchner is not the only one who has attempted to carve a brighter arts scene at Harvard. In 1956, the Committee on Visual Arts published the Brown Report, which in short called for a growth in the arts at Harvard. And even earlier, in 1905, an English professor named George Pierce Baker taught his first Harvard playwriting class called English 47. Baker expanded English 47 into Workshop 47 so students could experience the plays they had written in a laboratory theater setting, and he also founded the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. He tried to persuade Harvard to offer a degree in theater, but to no avail. Current professors are unsure why, though Yale theater professor David Budries speculates that it came down to a simple lack of interest on Harvard’s part.
“Then he defected to Yale,” Puchner says. Baker left in 1925 and went on to become the first chairman of the Yale School of Drama in 1931.
“There was a history of attempts [to establish a theater concentration]. They failed,” Puchner says, referring to the pushes for the arts made by the Brown Report in 1956 and the Committee on Dramatic Arts—which used to offer a dramatic arts secondary field—in 2004. But in 2007, when Drew Faust was elected president of Harvard, a shift began to take place. “The president had defined the arts as an area which Harvard needed to do more,” Puchner says.
Under Faust’s leadership, a Task Force on the Arts was formed. They published their report in December 2008, writing much about the performing arts at Harvard:
“The gifted theater professionals at the A.R.T., though their stage is on campus, have relatively little interaction with undergraduates—not even with undergraduates engaged in drama….”
“... [W]e also recommend the creation of a new Dramatic Arts concentration. As befits a serious discipline with a long, distinguished, and complex history, this concentration should, we believe, be fully developed, not simply secondary to another concentration’s curriculum.”
“The Task Force also discussed in its curricular conversations what role dance might play within the Dramatic Arts concentration. A limited number of liberal arts courses on dance, taught by a vital and dedicated staff, are currently offered by the Committee on Dramatics within FAS.”
But the 70-page document’s recommendations did not immediately spark a new concentration, as the task force had hoped it would. Instead, in the same year, the Great Recession hit, and the idea for a new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration was put on ice—that is, until 2011, when Puchner took up the challenge again.
In 2011, as the chair of the Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts, Puchner helped revive the concentration’s beginnings. He knew that Harvard was ready to start a concentration because of all the resources the University had in place. Farkas Hall had been recently renovated, Puchner had “an alliance of people interested” in the concentration, and the Task Force report had already made a compelling argument for some form of a performing arts program.
“So I wrote a report and walked into Drew’s office and put it on her desk,” Puchner says. “And then I didn’t hear anything for a while… maybe a year.”
By October 2014, Puchner had put the concentration out of his mind—until receiving an ambiguous email from Faust. “It was just one sentence that said, ‘Mark and I just wanted to let you know that I’ve made the funds available to start this program,’” says Puchner. “And I looked at this email, and I looked at the email address, and it didn’t come from a Harvard account. I thought someone was pulling my leg.”
Puchner ignored the email, thinking it was a joke. It wasn’t until a few days later that Diana Sorensen, Dean of the Arts and Humanities at the time, called him and asked, ‘‘Didn’t you get the message? Aren’t you happy?”
“And I thought, ‘What?’” Puchner says. “This is for real?’”
University officials announced the proposed Theater, Dance, and Media concentration that same month, and Puchner and the Committee on Dramatic Arts launched into a six-month process to bring TDM to life. “Then the real work began,” Puchner says. “Because there are all kinds of committees that need to sign off on a new initiative. So there’s—for example—the Educational Policy Committee. Any new pedagogical educational initiative has to be signed off by that committee, by other committees, and in the end, the entire faculty. All the professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences had to vote on this. What started off as a five-page proposal ended up becoming 20 to 25 pages long. It grew with every committee,” Puchner says, laughing.
The Faculty voted unanimously in favor of the concentration in April 2015, and Theater, Dance, and Media started getting ready for its first act.

If the title of the concentration is any indication, Theater, Dance, and Media is all about combining elements. When asked why, lecturer and dance director Jill Johnson has a simple response.
“Maybe the question is: Why not?” she says. “I think the way art is being made—in particular performance art—the integration of these things has been longstanding. It’s important that in order to create a new arts degree in 2016, in the unique research setting Harvard has, to reflect research and to say well, where do we think these fields are now, and where might they go? So the idea of interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary inquiry is very much suited to the Harvard research environment.”
On a deeper level, TDM combines not only different fields but also different forms of studies within them. This may be in part to because Harvard is a liberal arts institution, as opposed to a conservatory. “Acting courses, dancing courses—these were the kinds of courses universities were traditionally weren’t so keen on because they didn’t seem as ‘intellectual’ or as ‘critical.’ They seemed mostly about training rather than part of a liberal arts concentration,” Puchner says. “And so in designing TDM with its basis in practice, we were very conscious of that. And we decided at Harvard… to enfold in our practice a lot of critical thinking, reading, exploration of those ideas and so to create an arts-making concentration that is really part of the liberal arts education. In a sense, you could say we’ve met a more traditional university ‘half-way.’”
If anything, the combination of theory and practice enhances the work. “There’s no distinction between history and theory and practice. We oscillate between those things, and that’s the way the field develops,” Johnson says, and then rearranges her feet to the fifth position. “So you stand in a fifth position in ballet, right? That’s a historical representation as much as it is a theoretical proposition.”
The concentration seeks to synthesize Harvard’s performing arts assets, like the American Repertory Theater and the Harvard Dance Center. In fact, TDM may owe its existence to that very aspect. “We could not be the concentration we are without those resources,” says Deborah D. Foster, director of undergraduate studies for Theater, Dance, and Media. For example, several of Johnson’s dance classes, like Movement Lab or the Harvard Dance Project, use the space the Dance Center has to offer. The concentration also brings in faculty from the A.R.T.: Ryan McKittrick, the director of artistic programs at the A.R.T., leads a course called “Introduction to Dramaturgy”; Marcus Stern, an associate director at the A.R.T., and Shira Milikowsky, A.R.T. artistic associate, teach directing.
If given the opportunity to pursue a TDM secondary at Harvard, Allen, the Princeton evolutionary biology student, says her decision would have been far more difficult, “I think that [TDM]—in addition to meeting student groups—would have been the gamechanger,” Allen says.
Theater, Dance, and Media began accepting students in Oct. 2015, a little less than a year after it was first announced. The concentration’s first run has been outstanding to its participants—but it wasn’t without a few bumps along the way. “I love so much about the concentration, but I do think I would love to see more of an option for a more traditional track, so that we can make sure we are developing as artists,” says concentrator Eliza B. Mantz ’18, who aspires to be a professional actor.
“We are small right now [11 undergraduates declared TDM as their concentration last year], and we’re trying to grow. And I think the more courses and faculty we add, the more tracks we can offer,” Puchner says in response. “For example—dance. We really only had one dancer. This is how we started: Jill Johnson, the head of the Dance Center. Now, she did a great job, and she brought in guests for master classes and so on and so forth. But that’s just one person having to do it all. So we just hired a second dancer—Mario Zambrano—who is going to start in the spring.”
It’s apparent that Puchner and the rest of the concentration take Mantz’s comment seriously, as well as the wishes of all the concentrators and non-concentrators participating in Theater, Dance, and Media. “We met with all the students at the end of last year and had a meeting with them to talk about the way in which the first year worked and where it needed tweaking in one way or another,” Foster says. “And some of the things students talked about—that is an ongoing, juggling challenge for everybody—is exactly how students can manage do all the things they hope to do and should do, all in a limited span of time.”
But of course, the student response hasn’t just been limited to critique. “I think the fact that TDM works with outside professionals in bringing them in and also works with the A.R.T. is so exciting,” says concentrator Thomas W. Peterson ’18. “It means TDM concentrators uniquely get contact with all these amazing people who are doing theater and performance in the world.” Peterson, for example, is currently the assistant director for a TDM adaptation of August Strindberg’s “A Dream Play”; Daniel Kramer—the artistic director of the English National Opera, a prestigious opera company based in London—is the director of this play, meaning Peterson is able to work closely with him in its production. For concentrators, putting on plays with professionals is not uncommon: Each concentrator is assigned an academic and a creative adviser, each faculty or A.R.T. or Dance Center professionals.
In addition to bringing in lecturers from the A.R.T., the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration also invites, every semester, a series of visiting artists from all over the world. Kramer is teaching a course called “Devising Physical Performance.” Vivian L. Huang, a former predoctoral fellow at Williams College, is now at Harvard for the year teaching “Asian American Theater and Performance,” a course cross-listed with both TDM and the Women, Gender, and Sexuality department. Katie Pearl, co-artistic director for the Obie Award-winning PearlDamour creative team, teaches a class on theater and activism. Beyond these individuals, TDM will bring nine other visiting artists to Harvard this year.

Allen is now at minoring in dance at Princeton. While she is able to pursue her interests at her current school, there are aspects of Harvard’s Theater, Dance, and Media concentration that she believes she would have preferred—most notably the way theater and dance are combined into one area of study at Harvard. At Princeton, Allen says, the fields are very “compartmentalized,” as theater and dance form their own separate programs.
Susan S. Marshall—director of dance at Princeton—says that the Princeton dance program does offer a wide variety of cross-listed courses in other departments, including theater and visual arts, and that many pursue minors in Dance while majoring in Visual Arts. “As a multidisciplinary academic unit, the Lewis Center [designed to serve different artistic disciplines at Princeton] is particularly well-suited to students who want to craft an interdisciplinary course of study in the arts as well as those who desire a deep, faceted, and rigorous engagement with an individual art form," Marshall writes in an email. But that small distinction between collaborative but separate majors and a single combined concentration may make all the difference.
While Allen may not be able to change history, other students now have the chance to change their futures in the field of the performing arts.
“It’s not a secret that Harvard has come very late to creating a performing arts concentration. People will say, ‘That’s too bad—why did Harvard take so long?’ But we didn’t actually dwell so much on that,” Puchner says. “We thought that the fact that we’re creating a concentration now—rather than 40 years ago, which is when many other schools created theirs—was a real opportunity to really think about where the performing arts are going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Who were you on your first day at Harvard? What issues did you find to be most important in the world? What did you want to study, and what did you want to pursue beyond college?
Now, who are you today? Are you the same?
Dean Khurana begins each of his speeches with the mission of the College, and one word stands out to me at each recitation: “transformative.” At Harvard, we believe in the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education. But what is transformation, how does it work, and how are we all benefiting from and contributing to the transformative spaces we inhabit?
Last Tuesday, Oct. 11, was National Coming Out Day. I had never heard of National Coming Out Day until college. I was born and raised in a town of 800 people in rural Iowa. There was a cornfield in my backyard, our town didn’t have a grocery store, and the school that served 3 separate towns—including my own—still had fewer than 40 students in each grade. My town was also bereft of diversity: There were two people of color, one family of atheists, and no out LGBT individuals. It’s difficult to develop an open and supportive attitude towards difference when sequestered in such monochrome surroundings.
It may be unsurprising that by the age of 18, I found myself engaged in an internal war from which I can still feel the scars. On the one hand, I believed deeply in the Christian God and the stone-carved tenets of the Bible. On the other hand, I was struck cold by the realization that I was gay. As a child, I had learned that being gay was a choice—one that God condemned. I had written essays in high school English classes denouncing homosexuality, even as I spent sleepless nights begging God to take away the attraction I felt towards other men. I prayed constantly for normalcy; I prayed constantly for love.
And one day I found it in my friend, Claire Molloy, who saw through my pitifully weak veil of presumed heterosexuality, and—with a smile—told me: “You know, Erik, straight men don’t use the word fabulous.” Her comments were not meant as a normative statement about who should use what language, but were instead meant to gently nudge me to share what was really on my mind, what was eating me up inside.
The months that followed were some of the roughest of my life. Relationships with my family were thrown into disarray. Some friends who disapproved of my so-called “choice” invited me to hear proclamations from those who had “overcome” their same-sex attraction, hoping I would likewise see the error in my ways. Even some of the gay men I had begun to meet didn’t understand the struggle I was experiencing. “Why is religion such a big deal?” they asked.
When I reflect on those times, a few themes jump out at me. First, I was really scared. I didn’t know if God still loved me, if my parents still loved me, or if I’d ever find the life I wanted. Second, despite my doubts, I remained committed to being me. I believed resolutely that a life spent not being who I was not was not a life worth living. Our days on this Earth are limited, and the misguided intolerance of some should not prevent anyone from living those days as fully as can be. Third, things gradually got better. Day by day, there were small acts of support, small acts of love that fed the fire of change that was burning inside me.
I was transforming. The struggle, the uncertainty, the pain, they were all worth it: They were making me “me.”
Today, I am an out and proud gay man because I pushed against the criticisms I hurled at myself; I acted from my deepest convictions, even in the face of soul-rending doubt; and I never stopped feeding the voice of hope that I heard beating in my chest. I transformed through my persistence and surrender to my deepest values.
But I also get to stand here because of the transformation that has happened in our culture. A century ago, people like me were forcefully expelled from this very college; seventy years ago, we were gassed; just two or three decades ago, we were still shunned. People laid down their lives so I can stand here and proudly say: “This is who I am.” For their lives and for their sacrifices, I am daily grateful.
The costs of transformation, both personal and cultural, are (at times) tumult and tribulation. And this is why we fight for those who are still disenfranchised, who still feel the daily fear of being judged or even harmed simply for being who they are. This is why we fight for transformation—because one of the great lessons of transformation is that the struggle of others is our struggle too.
* * *
Coming out is only one of several transformations I’ve experienced in my life. I experienced a second transformation when I became a tutor at Pforzheimer House. My time spent in Pfoho has reinforced in me the incomparable value of community. Every day, I am inspired by my students’ brilliance, willingness to ask the tough questions, daring pursuit of the world’s highest ideals, and unending care for each other. I have been transformed by my time in Pfoho, as my students have taught me how to be a better advisor, a better listener, a better teacher, and a better friend.
I urge all the students at the College—in Pfoho and elsewhere—to continue investing in their communities on campus. Open yourselves to the lessons that you have for each other. Transform within this space to become bigger, brighter, better, more open, and more caring citizens of this world. One day, not long from now, you will walk across the stage and joyfully claim your hard-earned diplomas. Between now and then, plunge deep into the pool of self-transformation so you can look at yourself that day and every day, and say to yourself: “I’m proud of who I am.”

Erik C. Nook is a resident tutor in Pforzheimer House and a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. This op-ed is adapted from a speech delivered by the writer last week in Pforzheimer House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: I’m tired of teaching everyone. I am exhausted. This institution assumes that I am the curriculum of diversity. I’m a frog in a middle school science lab. They lay me down, cut me open, and see what’s inside. I have to explain to them what it means to be Latino—what it means to be the Other. And once they’ve heard me, in the one or two comments I make in section, they assume they understand what it means to be “one of your people.” What it means to be “oppressed.”
Zoe: It feels like that's all my purpose is here. I walk into a room and, as the only person of color, I transform from being just Zoe to the voice of “the minority.” It doesn’t matter that my life is just one facet of the kaleidoscope of stories that make up our community. Someone comments on what they see as an observer looking into my “marginalized” community. I cringe when I have to begin my sentences with “As a Latina…”, because suddenly I feel like the weight of my words have grown to carry the voice of my entire ethnicity. That’s my only value. All that matters is that I have brown skin and can articulate a sentence. That I can be their walking, talking, visible diversity.
R: Pero like, it ain’t a problem because of who we are. It’s a problem with our education. The best, richest, classiest, most elitist university in the universe has problems in how it educates people. It relies on us—imperfect, unpolished, academically untrained teenagers—to teach our classmates, instead of building the histories and realities of Latinos into the requirements. Cornell has a graduation requirement that entails “critical analysis of historically or contemporary marginalized communities.” So does UMass Boston. Georgetown. University of Colorado-Boulder. They realize that their students aren’t supposed to be the educators. Groundbreaking.
Z: But we have requirements for everything else, like, what’s the purpose of the General Education requirements? It’s a program that “seeks to prepare students for lives of civic and ethical engagement in a changing world.” I didn’t realize that the minorities quickly growing to become majorities wouldn’t be considered a part of that “changing world.” I mean, it's not like the perspectives of people from marginalized communities could possibly differ significantly from the old, white European men who seem to magically appear on every single syllabus for every class I’ve ever taken here, right?
R: Stop shoving old, dead, white men down my throat. I’ve consumed Freud, Homer, Rousseau, Franklin, and countless others. They tasted fine—a bit bland, although understandably important—but now I am choking. I am choking on narratives that are supposed to be universal, but are not even remotely about me. I need the sweetness of Gloria Anzaldúa on my wild tongue and in my heart. Her cultural theory makes mouths water once students realize it exists. They need to teach her alongside all the white European and American philosophers and writers this university loves so much. A failure to do so implies that academics of color are of less quality or less importance. And seeing how accurate, how sweet, and how intelligent Anzaldúa’s work—the namesake of our column—is, there is no way to claim she is not of the highest quality. Feed me a diverse curriculum, please.
Z: I can’t describe the unimaginable feeling of validation that would come from seeing the narrative of our community gracing the pages of syllabi and being discussed in section. But it isn’t just students of color that need this diverse curriculum. Junot Díaz shouldn’t be a name evoked solely in the confines of a Latino Studies classroom. His narrative and views should fall from the lips of all students, regardless of the color of their skin or the box they check on an application under Race/Ethnicity. The University has the responsibility to teach students about the plethora of cultures they will interact with as members of a multicultural nation and the steps that should be taken to address the unique needs of those communities. If we hope to improve racial and class inequalities in the future then we need “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society” by requiring that they take courses that work to understand non-dominant cultural viewpoints.
R: I could tell you that growing up in an immigrant household is brimfull of cultural and economic tension between two countries. Or you could read Díaz and learn that traveling back to a parent’s homeland conjures “that whisper that all long-term immigrants carry inside themselves, the whisper that says ‘You do not belong.’”
Z: I could tell you that being a Chicana means being pulled constantly between what it means to be Mexican and what it means to be American, or you could read Anzaldúa and learn that the border symbolizes “the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country—a border culture.”
R & Z: And if you want “all” students, (code for white students who’ve never met a person of color in their life), to understand what it means to be brown or black or yellow, then invest in your commitment to this. Invest in a diverse curriculum, because it is not our responsibility to teach students. It’s yours, Harvard.

As the Harvard University Dining Services stretches on into its third week, daily emails from HUDS have become an expected feature of students’ morning routines. Often, these emails have described developments in a piecemeal fashion—updating students on the list of closed dining halls, or announcing new infusions of BoardPlus or Crimson Cash into students’ accounts. While we understand that the strike is “an evolving situation,” as Dean of Students Katherine O’Dair wrote in one of her first emails on the labor dispute, we wish the University had started the strike with a clearer plan and clearer communication to students.
Students would take solace in  a more proactive  strike contingency plan. As it stands, undergraduates live under the portent that more dining halls might close, that hours may change unexpectedly, or that current levels of Crimson Cash and BoardPlus may prove insufficient for the duration of the strike.
Worse, the University’s sporadic disseminations of information have even exacerbated students’ stress levels. Recent email communications have caused confusion about the exact timing of Crimson Cash availability. Some students have also encountered problems using Crimson Cash at vendors that notionally accept it. Though the University cannot foresee all of these contingencies, a more definitive schedule of Crimson Cash and BoardPlus infusions would have allowed students to plan their meals and merchants to figure out the system in advance.
Beyond the meal-time logistics of the strike, students also deserve more information about how the dining halls are being run. HUDS has sought to improve its communication on this front as the strike has prolonged, but we would like to know more about any changes that have been made to the sourcing of food in the dining halls, especially in light of last week’s closure of FlyBy due to food quality issues. This incident, combined with isolated instances of undercooked food or foreign objects found in dishes, leads us to remain concerned about food safety, notwithstanding HUDS’ increased vigilance.
Furthermore, the effects of the strike have been particularly acute for students with dietary restrictions. While HUDS has also acknowledged this concern, a general lack of options persists for these students.
Finally, students should also know more about the temporary workers staffing the dining halls. Ironically—given the root cause of this situation—these new workers may not be receiving the recognition they deserve from students, in part because we are less familiar with them.
Given that the strike will continue indefinitely, we hope that the University will begin to address students’ needs and concerns more comprehensively. While the strike presents unique difficulties, we believe that a clearer agenda of Crimson Cash infusions and more clarity on the University’s exact plans for dining hall service—among other adjustments—will help dampen the impact of this unfortunate situation on undergraduates.

Pamphlets can make seeking mental health counseling at Harvard simple for students. Call a hotline, or just head on over to the Smith Campus Center, and go up to Counseling and Mental Health Services. But for students—especially from communities where seeking counseling is stigmatized or uncommon—dialing that phone number or pressing the 4th floor button on the Campus Center elevator can be harder than it seems. And as those students consider whether to seek help, a question persists; will the person on the other end be able to relate?
In recent years, diversifying the makeup of Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services staff has become a pressing issue. Students have formed organizations to advocate for increased racial diversity among counselors, and the winning platform in last year’s Undergraduate Council presidential election also emphasized the need for diverse counselors.
Harvard University Health Services is aware of the importance of having a diverse counseling staff and is taking steps to recruit counselors from different backgrounds. But they face challenges in their recruitment, particularly a limited pool of minority candidates from which to hire. Currently,  there are seven counselors of color who work for CAMHS, according to CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis—representing roughly a quarter of CAMHS clinicians.
At a time when issues of mental health are prominent on campus, both students and health administrators understand the need for a diverse counseling staff, but recognize the difficulties of achieving that goal.
ORGANIZING FOR DIVERSITY
Across the country and at Harvard, students are increasingly seeking out mental health resources. While at Harvard, about 36 percent of last year’s graduating Class of 2016 who responded to The Crimson’s annual senior survey sought mental health support on campus from HUHS. This figure represents a seven percent increase from the same survey administered to the Class of 2013, the first year The Crimson began collecting data about whether students sought HUHS mental health resources.
In addition,  the diversity of counselors and outreach to historically underserved populations has become even more important to students at Harvard.
In fall 2015, a small group of students met in Boylston Hall to talk about their experiences with CAMHS. Karla C. Mendoza, an undergraduate currently taking time off from Harvard, said the student organization that would later morph into Diversify CAMHS began very informally.
“It started over a Facebook Messenger group, people just kept adding people,” Mendoza said. “It was people who had been to CAMHS but were really dissatisfied with their services.”
The group circulated a survey over College email lists asking students about their experiences at CAMHS. They received almost 150 responses, and Mendoza noted that the survey showed a significant number of students were dissatisfied, especially BGLTQ students and students of color.
Following the survey, a few of those students penned an op-ed in The Crimson announcing their creation of a group known as Diversify CAMHS. With the goal of improving mental health services for “marginalized and minority Harvard students,” the coalition gained traction in spring 2016, hosting discussions about the intersection of identity and mental health, according to the group’s website.
Diversify CAMHS was not the first to advocate for a more diverse counseling staff. Their calls followed similar appeals during the 2015 Undergraduate Council presidential election to increase the diversity of CAMHS counselors. Two of the tickets included the issue as part of their campaign platforms, including that of the eventual victors, now-President Shaiba Rather ’17 and now- Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17.
Campaigning on the promise to “Open Harvard,” Rather and Banks advocated for “[increasing] the racial diversity of the UHS counseling staff” as part of the mental health arm of their platform.
Mental health has since become one of the four “compelling interests” that the UC funds as part of its “Grant for an Open Harvard College” initiative, but aside from the grants, Rather said the UC has taken a more advisory role in advocating for student health issues, holding biweekly meetings to discuss student wellness with Kevin Wehmhoefer—a CAMHS social worker and supervisor of Student Mental Health Liaisons—and monthly meetings with Barreira.
While Diversify CAMHS as a group has largely gone silent this fall, and current members of the group did not respond to request for comment, a new peer counseling group addressing issues of diversity in mental health called Indigo was founded last spring. After offering counseling in spring 2016, Indigo has since seen staffing shortages this semester and is currently spending time training. The group plans to resume counseling next semester.
Other groups have also formed on campus to address issues of diversity and mental health— for example, the Asian American and Pacific Islander Mental Health Initiative.
Waverley Y. He ’18, a member of the AAPI Mental Health Initiative, said many Asian American youth are not used to admitting problems and seeking help—part of the reason for the group’s formation.
“Obviously, parents were more than happy to broadcast their children’s successes, but when anything goes wrong, if their child isn’t doing well in class, or if they’re having family struggles, that is something that’s very much kept between family members,” she said. “It’s just hard to imagine that [in college] you’d be able to tell those insecurities to somebody that you’ve never met before, that you don’t relate to.”
CHALLENGES NATIONALLY AND AT HARVARD
Earlier this semester, some students received communication through the secure message portal of Harvard University Health Services from B. Francis Chen, informing them that he would leave Harvard for Tufts University’s Counseling and Mental Health Service.
Chen, who declined to comment for this story, was the only Asian American counselor in CAMHS at the time of his departure. HUHS worked quickly to hire a new Asian American counselor, and Lewis said a Mandarin-speaking psychologist has accepted the job and is now undergoing the process of credentialing and obtaining a Massachusetts license.
“We were really lucky and we decided, if the [interviewing] group likes her, we’re offering her a job on the spot. And they did,” Lewis said.
However, Chen’s departure underscored the difficulties administrators face in hiring a diverse staff of counselors. According to Lewis, CAMHS’ goal of hiring more counselors of color is sometimes limited by the demographics of applicants. She described the tough decision her office faces when the pool of applicants is not as diverse as they hope it to be.
“Do we leave these positions open, and maybe have less access for a period of time, so we can wait in hopes that we can get someone who would add diversity to our staff?” Lewis asked.
In an interview last spring, HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira was more direct in acknowledging the challenges that come along with trying to hire a more diverse staff: “We would never be able to hire enough people of diversity to necessarily offer somebody of diversity to every student who wanted it.”
When the applicant pool does not reflect the desired diversity, the leadership of CAMHS sometimes resorts to alternate methods of finding candidates. Lewis said her office has reached out to alumni of the University and asked current staff members to make recommendations. 
The issues Harvard has faced in achieving a diverse counseling staff reflects broader national trends. The overwhelming majority—around 72 percent—of clinical counseling staff across the country identify as white, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors. Harvard participated in the survey.
Additionally, 10.2 percent of counseling staff identified as black or African American, 7.4 percent as Asian or Asian American, 6.7 percent as Latino or Latina, 2 percent as multiracial, 1 percent marking “other,” and 0.5 percent as Indian or Native American in the survey.
Although university counseling centers have historically been predominantly staffed by professionals who identify as white, David R. Reetz, a Rochester Institute of Technology health administrator who coordinates the AUCCCD’s annual survey, said he has noticed trends that show an increase in underrepresented racial identities among new staffing hires.
“More centers are hiring more staff each of the last five years. So we’re hiring more, and we’re using those staff increases to expand the diversity of staff,” Reetz said.
Barreira also said counseling staff benefit from sharing knowledge to eliminate implicit biases they might have coming from different perspectives about issues related to identity.
“There’s a way that staff can learn from each other,” Barreira said. “So, there’s value not only to the students. There’s value to the staff to have diversity because you’re looking and saying, ‘I might be missing something.’”
He said that he thinks the training and collaboration within the staff makes a huge difference in the long run for students.
DIVERSITY OF IDENTITY, DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE
Students, administrators, and mental health professionals agree that having a diverse counseling staff is important for cultivating a resource best able to support the student body. However, students’ belief in the importance of counselors sharing similar backgrounds with students differs slightly from professionals’ opinions on the effects of “matching.”
Some students said it’s important not simply to match identifies with counselors, but also to have counselors who have a diversity of life experiences that can help them relate to students of all backgrounds
“I feel so much more comfortable sitting across a black authority or a queer authority and talking about my problems than a white straight person, just because I feel there’s such an experiential gap that you just can’t cross,” Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said.
Patrick Y. Xu ’16, a former president of the AAPI Mental Health Initiative, said having a counselor of Asian descent can be advantageous for students who may prefer not to have to explain the nuances of their upbringings, like cultural discrepancies in parenting.
“It’s way easier to have someone who understands that, rather than someone being like ‘Can you explain what is it like to have an immigrant parent?’” Xu said. “By no means for me is having an Asian clinician necessary, but I can definitely foresee situations in which it might help.”
Lewis and Barreira both said that, while they value a diverse counseling staff, it is the job of counselors to empathize with clients in all situations, regardless of whether or not can they personally relate to a given situation.
“I might not necessarily feel or understand because it’s not my experience, but I should still be able to hear what that person has struggled with and come to kind of a common understanding,” Lewis said. “I know sometimes students get frustrated with having to educate, but that’s what the process is in trying to understand.”
Additionally, Edward K.S. Wang, a Medical School professor of psychology who has developed programs targeted at treating racially diverse mental health patients, said matching clients and counselors on the basis of a particular identity may not solely guarantee good or better outcomes.
According to Wang, studies in the field have concluded that the ability for counselors to “understand and connect with [their] clients” is a more crucial influence on successful outcomes than sharing identity traits.
“Just because I can match you racially or ethnically, doesn’t mean that [necessarily] that’s everything,” Wang said. “Maybe, initially, racial matching can work well together for the first two or three situations. To Wang, it’s really about, ‘Hey can my therapist understand me?’”
The value of diversity within college counseling extends beyond one-to-one interactions that clients see in appointments. Wang said that having more diversity among counselors is an overall positive factor because it affects the workplace environment and outside perception for those potentially seeking help.
“I think the reason for that is it also creates an environment of sensitivity, of cultural respectfulness, and that also reflects the view of the counseling service,” Wang said. “It’s more than just the therapy itself, it’s also about the organizational environment.”
And with mental health professionals describing the organizational environment as an integral part of a counseling resource, Reetz also linked the diversity of a university’s mental health clinicians to a student body’s use of those services.
“We do recognize that the more diverse the staff is, the most diverse the student body is that utilizes certain services,” Reetz said.
Whether having a diverse mental health counseling staff improves the experience of patients, makes the resource present as more accessible, or encourages cultural competency among clinicians, HUHS administration is unequivocal in their support for a more diverse counseling staff.
“I think the face of CAMHS has to reflect some diversity, otherwise, students won’t find it attractive. It’s not the question of a diverse staff, it’s a question of how many of each type of diversity you can have in a group,” Barreira said. “So, it’s got to be diverse and it’s got to represent at least the diversity of the student body.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the University’s historic dining hall workers’ strike nears the two-week mark, Harvard is providing students with extra funds to eat outside of dining halls.
Harvard University Dining Services wrote in an email to students early Saturday morning that the University would add a one-time value of $25 to students’ Crimson Cash and BoardPlus accounts in order to introduce more “flexibility” in student dining options.
BoardPlus is an extra $65 stipend given to students each semester as part of their meal plan and can be used at student grilles and other on-campus food retail locations. Crimson Cash is a payment account that students to which students can add value then use to make purchases at on and off-campus establishments.
While students were happy to learn of their newfound Crimson Cash wealth, some were disappointed to learn that the service was temporarily unavailable at some Harvard Square locations.
Amy Y. Zhang ’18 said she was eager to use the credit at Liquiteria, and was “disappointed” to find out that the pressed juice store was not accepting Crimson Cash temporarily because of issues with the establishment's Crimson Cash processing machine.
“I went to Liquiteria and was super excited to order a smoothie with the $25 we just received from Harvard,” Zhang said. “But after I ordered my $11 smoothie, they told me the Crimson Cash system was down.”
Liquiteria employee Cassandra Alexis said the store’s Crimson Cash machine not functioning properly.
“We actually don’t know why it is not working. It usually acts up and somebody comes up and fixes it and then it starts acting up again,” Alexis said. “I don’t know when it will start working again.”
Other students said they had a similar experience at Mexican eatery Qdoba Sunday night through Monday afternoon.
“The machine won’t be up and running until Monday afternoon at 4 p.m.,” Qdoba employee Remi Jones said Monday afternoon. “It has been down all morning.”
Michael D. Conner, director of communications for University Campus Services, said Harvard has "been made aware of a few transactions that were not processed."
"Upon investigation, we found one instance where unbeknownst to the store employee, the Crimson Cash machine was in power-save mode, and another was due to a lack of paper in the Crimson Cash machine," Conner wrote in an email. He added that in both cases the store resolved the issue quickly. He did not specify what Crimson cash locations were affected.
Despite the hiccups, students were grateful for the extra funds. Richard M. Feder-Staehle ’18 was able to use Crimson Cash on Sunday at Qdoba before the machine broke down.
“I don't eat meat, so with the strike going on, my food options in the dining halls have been more restricted than usual,” Feder said. “When my roommates and I realized we could use Crimson Cash at Qdoba, we went pretty much immediately after—it's hard to pass on a free burrito.”
Feder-Staehle’s roommate Nick M. Sertl ’18 agreed.
“I'm all about the Qdoba—10 out of 10 would recommend over El Jefe's,” Sertl said referring to a local taqueria. “All in all, those 25 bucks in Crimson Cash singlehandedly helped me regain the eight pounds I lost in the past two weeks due to the strike.”
Off-campus eateries where Crimson Cash can be used include burrito joint Boloco, upscale Charles Hotel eatery Henrietta’s Table, Liquiteria, and Mexican fast food chain Qdoba. Crimson Cash can also be used in retail and grocery stores around the Harvard Square area such as Broadway Marketplace, CVS, and the Harvard Square Coop.
According to Crimson Cash’s website, merchants are required to purchase hardware provided by payment processing company Verifone that allows the establishment to connect to Harvard's transaction system. The annual maintenance fee for each location device is about $400, according to the Crimson Cash website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard students are sizzling from excitement with the return of popular healthy fast food restaurant b.good to a new location in Harvard Square, following a six-month hiatus.
B.good, a fast food eatery that primarily uses local ingredients, vacated its previous location on Dunster Street in the spring due because of renovations to the Smith Campus Center slated to last until 2018.
The eatery’s new store opened last week at 1 Eliot St., in the former home of Japanese restaurant Osushi.
According to b.good’s Director of Marketing Aubree Giarrosso, the move to the new location has not hindered business.
“It’s one of our favorite locations. I think this [new location] is better. We have good relationships in the area,” Giarrosso said.
Giarrosso attributes the company’s local success to the “b.good name,” which she said marks a commitment to using quality food and sourcing from local farms to provide the best product possible.
“Us being able to say where our food comes from is a game-changer,” Giarrosso said.
To celebrate their reopening, b.good partnered for a fundraiser with the Harvard Square youth homeless shelter Y2Y, where restaurant patrons were asked to pay what they were able during the new location’s first day, and all proceeds were donated to the shelter.
“We always do stuff in the Harvard community,” Giarrosso said. “Every location we’re in, we’re as involved in the community as we can be. Just this last summer we opened up our own farm. Seventy-five percent of what’s grown gets donated and 25 percent goes to our restaurants.”
B.good has gained a dedicated following in Cambridge, and some Harvard students were excited about its return. “I’m very excited to have b.good back in the Square,” Christian Liu ’17 said. “I’ve been a loyal follower since freshman year and I proceeded to log 60-some visits on their app.”
Grace K Weghorst ’18 agreed. “I’m really excited that b.good is returning, my first couple years at Harvard I had b.good at least once a week so I was sad that it closed.”
Outside of Harvard, some Cambridge residents also said b.good is a welcome addition back to the Square.
“I think b.good shows that fast food can be good and good for you. It’s a great addition to the area,” Cambridge local John Meissner said.

Latin Grammy award-winning pianist Gabriela Montero fused art and politics at a 50th anniversary celebration Monday for Laspau, a Harvard-affiliated nonprofit that promotes higher education in the Americas.
Laspau’s Executive Director Angelica M. Natera said the event, which more than 100 people attended in Sanders Theatre, was meant to “celebrate diversity, community, and connections across the Americas.”
Montero opened her concert with a Franz Schubert piece, followed by Robert Schumann’s “Carnaval, Op. 9.” In addition, Montero also performed two improvised pieces, one of which was dedicated to her home country of Venezuela and Laspau’s 2016 Scholar of Honor, Leopoldo Lopez Mendoza, a Venezuelan politician and activist.
Mendoza, who attended the Kennedy School of Government, was sentenced to almost 14 years in jail in 2015. Mendoza’s father, Leopoldo Lopez Gil, represented him at the event.
Montero said she thinks part of her role as an artist is to advocate for social causes.
“I believe the most powerful way the artist can use their voice or their platform is by being a journalist, a photographer, of a current situation or injustice to denounce what we see that should not happen,” she said.
Gil said he enjoyed Montero’s performance.
“[Montero] is not only someone with talent, but she took that talent and worked hard and made something from it,” Gil said. “[The performance] means a lot to me.”
Attendee Cary A. Garcia Yero, a graduate student associate at Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, said she appreciated Montero’s political message in the performance.
“I really liked that she brought politics in her performance, and she’s being an activist for human rights in Venezuela,” she said. “I like when artists do that, it’s a responsibility to advocate for whatever they believe in.”
At the event, Montero also performed an improvised piece partly inspired by 2016 Nobel Laureate Bob Dylan, as requested by the audience.
Audience member Matthew Strassler, who is an associate in the Physics Department, said he was enticed by Montero’s improvisations.
“I’ve been going to piano concerts my entire life, and I’ve read about the great piano composers who used to do improvisations like that, but to actually hear someone do it was remarkable and hugely extremely exciting,” he said.

The 2016 election cycle has revealed divisions within the Republican Party and put conservative politics in the spotlight.
Against that backdrop, a panel of commentators discussed how current political and societal trends are affecting perceptions of conservatism Monday evening at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
The event, called “Righting the Record: Conservatism and the Archives,” featured scholars and activists. It was moderated by New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02. 
Douthat, a former Crimson columnist, said from the onset that he hoped the discussion would bridge some of the gaps that exist in the historical and popular record.
“People have more limited knowledge than they should of political conservatism, and particularly, religious conservatism,” he said.
In light of the presidential election, much of the event focused on the split between grassroots and establishment conservatism. Michelle Nickerson, who teaches history at Loyola University Chicago, said current divides between Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and other members of the GOP have led to confusion over the definition of conservatism.
“It’s hard to determine who the real conservatives are,” she said. “Historically, we haven’t always been able to differentiate between grassroots and elitist conservatives, which leads us to ask who we want to put forward as representatives of conservatism.”
However, Arizona State University history professor Donald Critchlow had a different take on the election and said Trump has changed political tactics more than the definition of conservatism.
“Figures such as Trump can be conservative, but their political tactics can be separated from their beliefs,” he said.
Beyond the election, Douthat said in an interview that the fact that academia has been dominated by liberals adds to a lack of knowledge about conservatism on college campuses in particular.
“There were conservative and liberal activist movements [in the 1960s]. What tended to happen was that conservative activists didn’t tend to go into academia whereas the liberal activists did,” he said.
Charmaine Yoest, a senior fellow at American Values, a conservative organization, argued that a lack of trust towards conservatives has led to gaps in historical archives and general knowledge.
“The fear of the other, especially in politics, can often harm productivity,” she said.
Yoest said that modern culture and technology can further harm trust.
“There is an increasing problem of having silos and filter bubbles online, where none of us are getting enough info that comes at us,” she said.
But Yoest said there are ways to remedy political polarization. She suggested becoming familiar with different points of view can help bridge the trust gap.
“There’s no shortcut to bridging the trust gap, there is only constant interaction,” she said. “We need to be more intentional in our personal news gathering, to resist the increasing partisan Balkanization we have in our culture, which is creeping in because of the choice we now have in what we consume.”

The Cambridge City Council on Monday unanimously adopted eight separate resolutions aimed at increasing bike safety as dozens of avid cyclists crowded into Cambridge City Hall.
Bicycle safety activists flooded the steps of City Hall prior to the meeting’s official call to order. Many wore buttons and held signs reading “Safe Streets Now!” During the Council’s public comment period, over 44 individuals signed up to speak, a large number of which, some visibly emotional, encouraged the Council to improve bike safety measures in Cambridge. The comment period lasted for more than two hours before the Council began its business for the evening. 
“I’m here to challenge you guys to do more now,” Cambridge resident Thomas Meek said, addressing the city councillors. “It’s time to get going guys. People are dying in the streets and we can do better.”
The Oct. 5 death of bicyclist Bernard “Joe” Lavins on Massachusetts Avenue in Porter Square, which resulted from a collision with a tractor-trailer, served as inspiration for the proposed resolutions. This was the second death of a bicyclist this year for Cambridge; Amanda N. Phillips ’10, formerly of Lowell House and student at MGH Institute of Health Professions, died in a bike accident in Inman Square over the summer.
“Many times it takes an emergency for any organization to refocus its priorities,” Councillor Dennis J. Carlone said. “This is clearly one of them.”
One of the eight resolutions will establish a pilot program of protected private bike lanes on segments of Mass. Ave. The Council ordered these programs to begin on Nov. 1.
Another resolution, sponsored by Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, and Councillor Jan Devereux, requested that the city “include separated bicycle facilities or adjacent off-street paths in any plans for reconstructing all or part of Massachusetts Avenue.” According to the resolution, Mass. Ave has more cyclist-motorist crashes than any other city street.
Other resolutions requested improvements to bike infrastructure on Pearl Street and ordered city offices to propose further solutions to bike safety issues, like creating a city-run website specifically for bicycle safety information.
“We have heard. We are listening,” Devereux said. “There’s a lot on the agenda tonight that we can point to with pride.”
Increasing safety on Cambridge’s public lands has been a significant topic of discussion for the Council in the past month. The City Council had passed a resolution only a few weeks ago mandating that new Cambridge residents, including university students, should receive information from the City regarding bike safety. At another meeting this September, the City Council began the process of lowering the city’s speed limits.
A number of residents advocating to assign the Harvard Square Kiosk landmark status were also present at the Council meeting. The Council has proposed to renovate the city-owned kiosk, which would likely evict the business inside, Out of Town News. The Cambridge Historical Commission is set to discuss the building’s landmark status at its November meeting.

UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 3:27 p.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Registrar’s Office has dedicated a single person to respond to substantial demand from students requesting to view their admissions files—an increase from a “handful” a month to 100 over the past year and a half, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke.
Students have been able to view their admissions files under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) since the law’s enactment in 1974. But a 2015 New York Times article, which reported that a group of Stanford students invoked the law successfully to view their files, put a spotlight on that process and prompted students across the country to begin requesting their materials. Last January, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 confirmed Harvard students’ rights to view their admissions records. 
The increase in admissions files requests has resulted in a “significant administrative burden” for the Registrar’s Office, Burke wrote in an email. Burke’s office now has “one person working solely” on responding to these student requests, though he declined to provide the name of this person.
Cora A. Neudeck ’19, who requested to view her file last spring, said she had to wait weeks to see her file because of high demand.
“I think everyone always wonders what did Harvard think was so special about me, since it’s a very small number of people who actually get in,” she said, adding that she wanted to see her files mainly out of curiosity.
The marked increase is challenging for the Registrar because the office has to coordinate between different administrative and academic departments, such as the Admissions Office and the Freshman Dean’s Office, in order to compile all portions of a student’s file. Under FERPA, the University has 45 days to respond to a student request.
The admissions files include all the materials a student submits as part of his or her application, in addition to some summary notes from admissions officers. Students who wish to see their files must schedule an appointment for a proctored-viewing, Burke wrote.
Ritayan Chakraborty ’19, who viewed his file last year, said, “There are no laptops, no photos, you can have your phone, but you can’t take a picture of the admissions folder.”
Burke emphasized that the information in the files consist mainly of the students’ own materials and is not “secret or surprising.”
But students who have viewed their files say that they benefited in reading them even if some of the comments were confusing or out of context.
Ashiley A. Lee ’19, who viewed her file last year as a freshman, said she was confused by a series of numbers included at the top of the summary sheet—which includes demographic information, high school information, test scores, and readers’ notes. She was not aware of the scale admissions counselors use to rank the different parts of a student’s application.
Still, Lee said she found the experience of viewing her file valuable. “I think that it gives you a newfound understanding of yourself because no matter how much you might think you don’t belong, you’re here,” she said.
Other students said the process was helpful for them in their work counseling high school students in the admissions process. Chakraborty said he requested to view his files partly because he was curious but also because he thought it would help him in his work as an admission consulting subcontractor.
“I like to help a lot of students from my high school get into different colleges, and I also college counsel on the side, so there’s the side benefit of understanding the system,” Chakraborty said. “The amount of detail with regards to serious specifics that are included in my application suprised me. I am definitely more wary about that when helping kids apply to colleges.”
Dhruva Bhat ’17 said his experience as helping friends and relatives apply to college motivated him to request his file, but ultimately he found the experience “anticlimactic.”
Still, Bhat said seeing his essays and other application materials again allowed him to reflect on his growth over the course of college.
“At the very least you see how much you’ve changed from the time when you sent in the application, and if there are any notes that’s just an additional perspective you get,” he said.
When asked about the value of seeing one’s admissions file, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said, “I’ve never seen mine so it’s hard to say.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: October 19, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Dhruva Bhat ’17 worked as a high school admissions consultant. In fact, he has informally helped his friends and relatives apply to college.

The historic Harvard University Dining Services employees' strike has made its way into classrooms across campus, with professors purchasing pizza to feed students and weaving discussions of the strike into course lectures.
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, who co-authored a letter to the editor in The Crimson last week arguing the University should not ask exempt employees to volunteer to work in dining halls, said he discussed the rationale behind the letter with his students, and added that “a couple” of his students expressed their own opinions.
Thomas, who said he personally supports the strike, has also purchased pizza for students in his freshman seminar on Bob Dylan, and intends to do so for the duration of the strike.
“It’s a conundrum, the whole thing, those of us who support the union in its bargaining and therefore support the strike—we want our students to be fed and are sympathetic to the faculty deans in the houses and everyone,” Thomas said. “So yeah, helping out by bringing in pizza helps get students fed.”
Thomas, along with dozens of other professors, criticized the University in 2014 for a new health benefits packaged it extended non-union employees; at the center of the HUDs strike is Harvard's health care proposal, which HUDS's union opposes.
History professor Sidney Chalhoub, who co-signed Thomas’s letter, heard students in his course discussing the strike before class began. He said they were “clearly worried” about the workers, and that he briefly discussed with students the University’s statements that it pays dining hall workers above the industry’s average.
“If the students bring up this type of conversation during a class that has to do with the topic, and it’s a concern that they have, I don’t think it would be correct to avoid the issue because it’s a political problem at the University at the moment,” Chalhoub said.
Professor of Contemporary Arab Studies Steven Caton, who teaches a course on language and culture, wrote in an email that he recently discussed HUDS strike slogans and chants in class.
Cole V. Edick ’17, who takes Caton’s course, said he appreciated learning about the strike in the context of studying language.
“We’ve known from the beginning that the class was going to be related to politics and that we were going to be discussing rhetoric through a political lens,” Edick said. “That’s kind of the atmosphere of the course already, to have it be relevant to our world.”
Although he personally supports the strike, Chalhoub said he does not think he would bring up the topic on his own unless it closely tied in with the subject matter of his course.
Thomas added he did not think it was “appropriate” to discuss his personal opinions about the strike in class, and Caton, another letter signatory, agreed.
“I do support the strike but I've never said so in class, believing that students should arrive at their own decisions,” Caton wrote in an email.
Some professors have even brought their classes to the strike. Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 ventured with his students into Harvard Yard as part of the student-organized walkout for striking dining hall workers on Monday.
Students said McCarthy, who co-teaches Culture and Belief 49: “American Protest Literature from Tom Paine to Tupac” with English professor John Stauffer, told members of the class that they could join him during the walkout at 12:30 p.m., or stay and continue the lecture with Stauffer. McCarthy could not be immediately reached for comment.
Alison H. Jin ’19 said a majority of students opted to go with McCarthy. But Jin, who said she supports the strike, chose to stay behind because she enjoys the course.
“We were presented with the option whether or not we would like to go and join,”Jin said. “There was no pressure, and I thought it was a really nice way to tie in the real world into our class.”
“I’m proud to go to a school that allows for spaces where people can make their voices heard,” she added.
Jin said the strike had been brought up in the course before Monday’s walkout, calling it “very relevant to our course material.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith could not be immediately reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College and Divinity School student activists came out in force Monday to support the historic Harvard University Dining Services strike, now nearing two weeks.
The protests began at 10:30 a.m., when Divinity students gathered at HDS before proceeding to the Science Center Plaza to join striking HUDS workers for a rally. Soon after, hundreds of College students walked out of their afternoon classes at 12:30 p.m., before meeting HUDS strikers by the John Harvard statue to hold another rally organized by the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate activist group.
“That’s awesome [that] they’re out here supporting us,” Angel D. Hernandez, a HUDS employee who normally works in the Harvard Faculty Club, said of the student-led protests. “That made me feel so good, sentimental, respected from the community, the students. I love them.”
Divinity School students, with yellow flowers adorning their hair and buttonholes, walked to the Science Center Plaza while singing “Lean On Me” and “We Shall Overcome.” The flowers represented students’ desire for “peace in the community,” said Nestor J. Pimienta, a Divinity School student who helped plan the event.
HUDS worker Aaron J. Duckett spoke first at the rally, criticizing Harvard for what he deemed its stingy treatment of employees. He received loud applause from the crowd—a mix of roughly 300 HUDS strikers, Divinity and College students, and a few tourists.
“We used to get a turkey on Thanksgiving [from Harvard] but over the years that turkey got smaller and smaller and smaller until now we get no turkey,” Duckett said. “This is representative of Harvard’s attitude towards us, [but] now, instead of taking a turkey away from us, they want to take away our health care.”
“We don’t want to give up that turkey, we don’t want to give up that health care,” he added. Duckett’s speech was followed by remarks from Pimienta and 11 Divinity students representing Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, and BGLTQ groups at HDS.
Wilson Hood, a Divinity School student who spoke on behalf of HDS’ BGLTQ student group Queer Rites, reminded the audience that HUDS employees working in Adams House helped defend BGLTQ students in Adams from harassment by homophobic peers in the 1980s. At one point, he said, Adams House dining hall workers even donned shirts reading, “We’re All Gay.”
“You stood with my community before it was popular, before it was safe,” Hood told the assembled HUDS strikers. “And so, from the LGBTQ community at Harvard Divinity School this morning, I have a message for you: We are all HUDS!”
Before heading over to the SLAM-led rally in the Yard, speakers and strikers sang one last rendition of “Lean On Me” and lunched on bread passed around by Divinity students. The joint breaking of bread “symbolized that we’re sharing in the struggle,” Pimienta said.
In the meantime, dozens of Harvard students had left class early and marched single-file to the Yard, shouting slogans. After chants of “No justice, no peace!” subsided, Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 ascended the steps of University Hall to address the crowd, which had reached hundreds of people.
McCarthy announced to cheers that he had “cut short” his lecture in Culture and Belief 49: “American Protest Literature from Tom Paine to Tupac” to walk out with his students. He then read aloud the text of a petition now circulating among Harvard faculty which, he said, had already garnered more than 150 signatures.
“Harvard refuses to do the right thing,” he said. “This is unacceptable to us. As faculty members we recognize that HUDS workers not only serve food but also create a sense of community in ways that are invaluable to Harvard.”
John S. Martin, a HUDS worker in Annenberg dining hall known affectionately by many Harvard students, also spoke at the rally. Martin said he is striking for his wife and two children.
“My son is diagnosed with autism, and with [Harvard’s] health care I won’t be able to afford it,” he said. “I’m fighting for my son, I’m fighting for myself, I’m fighting for my coworkers.”
Afterwards, as students and workers alike slowly trickled out of the Yard, SLAM member Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17 said she thought the rallies had been successful.
“It was a really beautiful thing to see students walk out of their classes and be joined and be greeted by HUDS workers who were rallying,” she said. “At the end of the day we all make up one community—you can’t have Harvard without the HUDS workers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and its janitorial union, which represents hundreds of employees across the University, began bargaining just after Harvard’s dining workers launched their historic strike and hope to establish a new contract by Nov. 15.
Roxana Rivera, vice president of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union’s New England branch, said the union will focus its negotiations on wage increases and health benefits in sessions starting Tuesday; their first bargaining session Oct. 7 was an introductory meeting between the two parties. Rivera drew comparisons between SEIU’s negotiations and that of HUDS, which the janitorial union has supported since the spring.
“At the core, our issues are the same in the sense of a just wage increase, and affordable health care for families here,” Rivera said. “They want to make sure  that their own children have  a shot at going to college.”
Rivera said SEIU told Harvard it was “in solidarity” with the striking dining workers at the janitors’ first bargaining session in October.
“These workers are workers that live in the same communities as our members do,” she said.
In a statement, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that Harvard looks forward to “bargaining in good faith towards a new agreement that addresses the needs of our employees.”
Rivera said the two sides will begin trading proposals Tuesday. She said the union has a set of “concrete” proposals for health care and wages, but did not specify those plans. She also did not specifically comment on how she thought HUDS negotiations would affect the SEIU’s proposals.
According to Rivera, members of SEIU do not receive their health care benefits directly from Harvard, but rather from a health care fund the union offers—similar to a health care option that Local 26 rejected. Rivera did say under the union’s health care proposal it will put forward during negotiations, Harvard would “contribute a little bit more” to the union’s fund than what the University currently pays.
Health care and wage increases have been at the center of this year’s contract talks between Harvard and its dining service workers, who are represented by the Boston-based union UNITE HERE Local 26. Initially, Harvard proposed that workers enroll in the same health benefits plan that the University’s largest union accepted in negotiations with Harvard last winter, but Local 26 rejected that offer.
And at the beginning of October, four months since the start of negotiations, HUDS workers launched their first strike since 1983 after failing to reach a contact agreement with the University. The strike is now about to enter its third week, with hundreds of HUDS employees picketing across Harvard each day.
Negotiating during the strike, the University later offered to pay into the union’s health care fund. In an email to Harvard affiliates last week, Vice President for Human resources Marilyn Hausammann detailed the specifics of that proposal, writing that Harvard would contribute 87 percent to the lowest-cost health plan the union has. Local 26 has yet to accept any of the University’s offers.
Local 26 met with Harvard on Monday for the 23rd negotiation session in this round of contract talks, but did not come to an agreement, according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Entering this past weekend, the Harvard football team had not lost to a non-conference opponent since losing to Holy Cross in 2011. The squad also hadn’t fallen on the road since succumbing to Penn in 2012, constituting the longest road winning-streak in the country.
But all things must come to an end.
It took 17 games for each streak to snap, but it happened. Holy Cross beat the Crimson 27-17 in Worcester this weekend, handing Harvard its first loss of the season.
There’s a silver lining to everything, though. A loss to a non-conference opponent means just about nothing in terms of winning a conference championship. And the Crimson are still atop the Ivy League standings.
D-LINE IS DIVINE
The loss certainly raised numerous questions about the Crimson this weekend. However, there is no question that the Harvard defensive line is one of the best in the Ivy League.
The front four is asserting itself in the run game, only allowing 100 yards per game to opponents—good for second in the Ivy League. Not only has the defense held foes to 3.6 yards per rush, but the unit has also only given up three touchdowns on the ground this season.
The defensive line contributed significantly to limiting Holy Cross to six points in the entire second half. Six sacks by the Crimson defenders kept Harvard in the game.
“I thought our defense played, at times, heroically in the second half [of the game],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
On top of their ability to stop the run, the defensive line is pivotal in the passing game. Harvard has been led by sophomore defensive end DJ Bailey’s Ivy League-leading 4.5 sacks.
But it hasn’t been just one guy. The team has racked up 14 sacks on the season, with 11 different players having recorded at least half a sack so far this season. Nine of those players are defensive linemen.
NO SHINE WITHOUT STARS
Before this weekend, the Crimson was averaging 192 rushing yards a game. Against Holy Cross, the offensive unit gained a measly 26.
Harvard sat senior quarterback Joe Viviano, junior running back Semar Smith, and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley on Saturday.
Those three have contributed for the most offensive production outside of senior halfback Anthony Firkser. Clearly, Harvard felt their absence this weekend.
“We put too much pressure on ourselves by not really being a balanced offense today,” Murphy said. “We didn’t really establish the line of scrimmage.”
On top of the lack of a rushing attack, the Crimson’s overall yardage decreased, going from their average of over 470 yards per game to just 245. Harvard had only 219 yards in the air, and first-time starter sophomore Tom Stewart was sacked six times, fumbled three times, and threw an interception.
“I thought Tom did a good job, I thought he hung in there,” Murphy said. “We just didn’t get him enough help. And any time you come out minus three on the turnover margin against a good team it’s going to be a long day.”
SECONDARY SLIPS
After starting the season playing as good as any other Ivy League team, the Harvard secondary finally had a down game this weekend. Before the Holy Cross game, the secondary had only allowed 228.8 yards per game through the air and tallied eight interceptions, the most in the Ivy League. Harvard also had only given up seven touchdowns.
Harvard really didn’t do too poorly from a purely statistical standpoint this weekend. Saturday, the Crimson allowed 244 passing yards and two touchdowns while tallying no interceptions.
The turning point of the game came in the third quarter, a play during which the defensive backs seemed out of sync. Crusader quarterback Geoff Wade stepped back in the pocket and had what seemed like years to throw the ball.
Initially, the Harvard defense seemed in good position against senior wideout Jake Wieczorek. But co-captain Sean Ahern dipped off, presumably for another responsibility.
Wieczorek ran free, wide open down the seam. Wade put up a 53-yard bomb to the wideout. Though the pass was a little short, Wieczorek caught the ball and set up a field goal that would prove significant in the game.
“We’ve got some great receivers,” Wade said. “They can really fly down the field and make things happen. Realistically, when we get them the ball, they can make things happen. We had a lot of confidence. We had a great game plan going in, and it was just our job to execute it. For the most part we did.”­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
18 years.
It has been 18 years since a Harvard field hockey player last set school records in points and goals for her career. Judy Collins ’99 set the most recent records in 1998, tallying 102 points and 43 goals just before the close of the millennium.
It’s a considerable feat for an athlete to break one program record over the course of their career. For senior forward Marissa Balleza, her pursuits did not stop after one record.
In field hockey’s 5-0 win against Cornell on Saturday, Balleza accumulated five points, scoring two goals and providing one assist. Those marks helped Balleza become Harvard field hockey’s all-time career leader in points and goals with 103 points and 44 goals.
“I tried to not think of the record because I didn’t want to make it about that,” Balleza said. “I want to make it about the team and winning. I really honestly tried not to think about it because it stressed me out because I want to break it; but, I’d rather have the team win.”
Balleza’s first points came in the 35th minute, as she played a pass from the left side of the field into the center of the circle for junior forward Emily Ott, whose shot sailed past the goalie into the net.
Just one minute later, Balleza tied the goals record as her near post shot evaded the Cornell goalkeeper. In the 53rd minute, after converting a penalty stroke, the Severna Park, Maryland, native took sole possession of the goals and points records.
“My coach called me over to do the stroke and I was so nervous,” Balleza said. “When I went up to the stroke, my legs were shaking and I was thinking ‘I have to make this they’re giving me this opportunity.’ I don’t even know what I was thinking, I was just so nervous in that moment. And even afterwards my legs were shaking because I couldn’t believe I just did that.”
Balleza was also named co-Ivy League Player of the Week after her efforts Saturday, sharing the award with Princeton senior midfielder Cat Caro.
This is Balleza’s second time receiving the honor this season, and she is the fourth consecutive Crimson student-athlete to receive this honor. Her two goals Saturday gave her 10 for the season, second best in the Ancient Eight.
“Marissa is one of the best players,” co-captain Sarah Finnemore said. “She’s so thoughtful and one of the most reliable people on the team. She always comes through when you need her the most. She has a great shot, great stick skills, she’s a player we all really look up to.”
Balleza has been a picture of consistency for Harvard, as she has averaged at least nine goals and two assists while appearing in every game during her four seasons with the team. Senior year is proving to be a career year for Balleza, as she is projected to set career highs in goals, points, shots, and shot on goal percentage. She has played a monumental role in the Crimson’s strong season.
“I think our team has been doing really well and that’s reflected in our season so far,” Balleza said. “We’ve grown a lot as a program and as a team since my freshman year. What we’re really hoping for is to win Ivies, especially all the senior girls because it’s their last year and they want to go out strong, and eventually make the NCAA tournament; I think that’s our ultimate goal.”
The Crimson opened up the season on shaky footing, starting the season off with two wins in its first six games. But since then, the Crimson has responded by rattling off a six-game winning streak, including two victories over ranked opponents in Maine and Boston Univesity. Over this span, the team has outscored opponents 15-3. Balleza has led the offense during this stretch with six goals and two assists.
Balleza and the team will look to accomplish that first goal next weekend as they travel to New Jersey to face No.11 Princeton. This matchup is of note because both teams currently stand at 4-0 and are tied atop the Ivy League standings.
While Balleza just set the school record in points and assists against Cornell, her most crucial games this season may only now be approaching.­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first official weekend of Harvard basketball for the 2016-2017 season was a busy one, with the team capping off its opening week of practice with the annual Crimson Madness event.
In addition to providing an early look at the program, this weekend saw the team add a third member to its 2017 recruiting class with the verbal commitment of Reed Farley on Friday. Farley, a 6’3”, 175-pound small forward from La Jolla, Calif., pledged to coach Tommy Amaker and the Crimson after visiting campus last week. Farley was in attendance for this weekend’s Crimson Madness event.\
ESPN rates Farley as a two-star prospect and praises his length, athleticism, and motor, projecting him as “the perfect glue-type at the next level.” Farley gives Harvard two wings in next year’s recruiting class, as he joins Chesterfield, Va. shooting guard Mario Haskett. The Crimson’s star-studded 2016 class features Seth Towns as its only wing, and next year’s team will be looking to replace three guards slated to graduate in May. Danilo Djuricic, a 6’8” power forward from Brampton, Ont., is the third member of Harvard’s 2017 recruiting class.
Farley was a key contributor on La Jolla High’s team as a junior. He averaged 14.6 points per game to go along with six rebounds and six assists. Overall the Vikings went 19-11.
Farley played AAU Basketball with Earl Watson Elite, which was co-founded by UCLA alum and Phoenix Suns head coach Earl Watson. Earl Watson Elite has produced numerous NCAA players, including Arizona State point guard Tra Holder and Arizona center Chance Comanche, not to mention Harvard sophomores Balsa Dragovic (forward) and Tommy McCarthy (point guard).
Amaker continues to have recruiting success in Southern California. In addition to Dragovic and McCarthy, senior forward Zena Edosomwan, sophomore shooting guard Robbie Feinberg, freshman point guard Christian Juzang, and freshman forward Henry Welsh all prepped in the area.
Under the lights of Lavietes Pavilion on Friday, the Harvard men’s basketball team showcased its collection of new and returning talent at its annual Crimson Madness event. The showcase featured a dunk contest, three-point shootout, and a short scrimmage.
Despite the novelty of head coach Tommy Amaker’s top-10 recruiting class, one of the biggest stories of the night was arguably the return of senior guard Siyani Chambers to the court. Chambers, a three year starter and former Ivy League Rookie of the Year, anchored the Crimson at the one spot through three Ivy League championships and subsequent tournament appearances. After tearing his ACL last summer, Chambers took a voluntary leave of absence to preserve his last year of eligibility.
Despite the year off, Chambers looked like his old self during the scrimmage, driving inside while keeping defenders on their toes. Interestingly, the starting lineup for the Crimson team had both Chambers and sophomore guard Tommy McCarthy. McCarthy, who stepped into the role of starter in Chambers’ absence last year, averaged 8.8 points per game in his rookie season with a 33.9 field goal percentage.
On Friday McCarthy paced the Crimson squad with 13 points while senior forward Zena Edosomwan lead the White squad with 14. Despite some serious freshman talent guarding him, namely four-star recruit Chris Lewis, Edosomwan was a force to be reckoned with inside throughout the contest. Another notable performance during the scrimmage came courtesy of freshman guard Bryce Aiken, who looked strong in limited minutes.
In a perhaps more interesting dunk contest than in years past, Edosomwan managed to repeat as the champion despite strong performances from junior forward Chris Egi and freshman Robert Baker Jr. Edosomwan’s most electrifying dunk came in the second round when he leapt over three of his tallest teammates.
The three-point shootout featured nearly half of the Crimson’s squad. After strong first-round performances from sophomore wing Corey Johnson, senior guard Corbin Miller, and McCarthy, Johnson shot the lights out in the final round, hitting 12 of 18 shots to take the win.
