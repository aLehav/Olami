After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORK, IRELAND. We called my grandfather Papa Bear. He passed away when I was only an infant, so I cannot remember if his laugh was booming or soft, if he smelled like soap or like cigarettes, or if his hands felt rough or smooth on mine. Instead, I cling to small details—his favorite flower was the daffodil, he loved to sing, and he always considered Ireland his true home.
While studying in Ireland this semester, my goal has been to better understand my family's roots. On the weekends I have visited the port from which my mother sailed when she was only five years old, touched the gate of the house where my Granny spent carefree summer nights, and even learned to make a dessert that my aunt still calls her favorite. But when Sunday nights come, and I return to campus, my Papa Bear remains a mystery.
My Irish friends are slowly ingraining in me the local attitude of “come what may, it will all be grand,” so instead of dwelling on another weekend gone by without knowing any more about my grandfather, this Sunday night I went to a local student pub. The rugby team was there, loudly rehashing the match they had played that afternoon. I settled into my seat, hoping that by the end of the night I would finally understand some of the finer points of their sport, but their boisterous reenactments were cut off by the sound of a fiddle.
In a dark corner of the pub, a young woman was holding a fiddle under her chin, a young man was pulling a mandolin from its case, and an older man was discussing with his wife what song to begin singing. The team moved in unison, pulling their stools closer to surround the musicians, and when the first traditional song started everyone joined in singing. They all drummed their fingers and tapped their feet, and the bartender even offered the group a tambourine from the back room. When a song ended, people called out requests for the next one, and some of the players even took lead vocals for a song or two.
I sat enthralled. While the players clapped and laughed and yelled, I could not stop looking at the older man leading them all. His smile was wide, and his face was red from the strength of his singing. He looked at the singing players with pride. I realized then that I do not need to know my Papa Bear's smell or laugh or touch or to visit every place he set foot. I understood him through his love of singing, in the middle of a student pub.

GENEVA, SWITZERLAND. Home to the United Nations and hundreds of other international organizations, Geneva plays host to a great deal of foreigners, roughly forty percent of its population and a smattering of languages. With all these foreigners to please, you can be sure that Genevans are passionate about one thing: food. Hundreds of restaurants, featuring dozens of cuisines, line the streets of Geneva and open up a world of possibilities for the curious eater.
The first thing our group of thirty-three Americans learned is that the Swiss take mealtime seriously. On most days, we are allotted an hour and a half to two hours for lunch—a far cry from my typical fifteen-minute lunches in Mather en route to class. Although Geneva is a fairly expensive city, our program’s lunch stipend of 14 Swiss francs per day (approximately $14) can go a long way. Last week alone, I ate Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Indian, Swiss, Italian, and Turkish food. Homesick for America? Fear not. You can still enjoy McDonald’s, Domino’s Pizza, or Starbucks—just be ready to pay the equivalent of $13 for a Big Mac Meal, $36 for a large pizza, or $7 for a tall Americano.
Though the Swiss borrow their food from around the world, they do have one particular claim to fame: raclette. Raclette consists of fondue-like melted cheese drizzled over potatoes, accompanied by pepper and pickles. Last week, we had a program-wide raclette dinner with all the participating students and their host families. After dinner, however, we Americans agreed that we are still not quite sure why the Swiss make such a big deal of raclette. Eat it too slowly, and the cheese hardens. Eat it too quickly, and you feel your arteries clogging. The Swiss advise drinking hot tea or wine with it, for water or beer will cause the cheese to harden into a particularly uncomfortable mass in your stomach.
Deciphering how to order and pay for meals in Geneva is another challenge. While Geneva is officially in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, most Genevans speak multiple languages and are almost always passable in English. Last week at an Indian restaurant, however, Olivia—a lovely Southern girl who is determined to speak French as much as humanly possible—continued to order in French even after the waitress detected her American-ness and resorted to English. After an odd dialogue in which the waitress asked questions in English and Olivia replied in French, the waitress finally instructed us all to speak English because she knows English much better than French. So much for trying to practice the national language.
My week of chicken curry, dumplings, pho, crepes, chicken tikka masala, raclette, veal saltimbocca, and kebabs provided me with a tasty introduction to the vibrant cultural palette of Geneva. And since Switzerland is located in the middle of Europe, in the next few months I’ll have the opportunity to visit many of the countries where these cuisines originated. But for now, back to improving my French. A bientôt!

With the simple words “I pledge my honor that I have not violated the honor code during this examination” written at the top of every exam, Princeton University students today continue a tradition of academic honesty and personal integrity that has been in place since 1893.
Unlike Princeton and other peer institutions, however, Harvard  College does not currently have an honor code. True, the College is taking steps to understand issues of academic integrity throughout the campus community. On Feb. 7, the College will open an Academic Integrity Assessment in order to “reevaluate academic integrity policy.” The Assessment is not a response to any incidents involving cheating, but it is still important to understand how students, faculty, and teaching fellows perceive academic integrity. Whatever the results, we hope the Assessment will finally impel the College to institute an official honor code.
The Assessment should ideally investigate students’ technical understanding of what constitutes academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is not always entirely clear-cut, and it is not uncommon for a student writing a paper to have doubts about how and what to cite properly. It is also important to ask students about their experiences with or observations of cheating. Both types of information would be useful in understanding the state of academic integrity at Harvard. These findings could then be used to prevent and counteract cheating and plagiarism and also to help students better understand what exactly constitutes academic dishonesty.
In light of these efforts to investigate academic integrity, the time has also come to discuss the real possibility of instating an honor code. Many of our peer institutions—including Stanford—have honor codes that expect students to know and thoroughly follow academic honesty standards. Princeton’s honor code, for example, was started by students, and, today, its Honor Committee, which investigates cases of academic dishonesty, is composed entirely of students.
Harvard students would equally benefit from having an honor code they would be required to write at the top of every exam. Such a seemingly simple act would nevertheless reinforce the idea that it is the student’s personal responsibility to achieve the highest level of honesty in all academic work. In other words, an honor code would make integrity the norm, and any academic dishonesty would thus become a positive action a student consciously decided to do.
To be sure, an honor code would not provide the ultimate solution to the age-old problem of academic dishonesty at Harvard. Naturally, some students will still consciously cheat, regardless of whatever policy is put in place. However, for others it would serve as a constant reminder of the virtues of academic honesty, and,  on a fundamental level, an honor code would force students to take seriously their decisions in the inevitable situations that emerge in scholarship, the sorts of situations in which what constitutes academic dishonesty is still under dispute. In that sense, a student who is unsure on whether or not to, say, cite a footnote in researching a term paper may decide to contact a teaching fellow or a department tutor for the necessary information. Students will hopefully also become more mindful of the other resources already in place, including the “Harvard Guide to Writing with Sources.”
The Assessment will ideally start a productive campus-wide conversation on both the prevalence of academic dishonesty and possible solutions to counteract such practices. With this in mind, it is time to once again consider instating an official student honor code. Like our peers at Princeton and Stanford, Harvard students should be held accountable by their peers for the work they do and should aspire to personal integrity in all aspects of the academic experience.

Et tu, Hasty Pudding Theatricals? By naming Jay Leno as 2010 Man of the Year, the organization unnecessarily insulted alumnus and unofficial Harvard goodwill ambassador Conan O’Brien ’85.
Conan is right now one of the most popular Harvard grads this side of Natalie Portman.  His bright red coif is a symbol of the wry, goofy persona that makes him beloved among the non-retirees who watch late night comedy. The Hasty Pudding, however, has bestowed its annual honor on his dastardly foil and comedic inferior, Jay Leno, only a year after their public battle over NBC airwaves.
For those who missed the ruckus, Leno was widely portrayed as conniving during last year’s highly-publicized conflict over the scheduling of NBC’s comedy line-up. Leno, who had hosted the flaghsip “Tonight Show” for 12 years, agreed to hand over the program’s reins to O’Brien in 2009. The network wanted to entice O’Brien not to jump to a bigger role on another channel when his contract expired. Fanfare soon surrounded the revitalized “Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien.”
However, “The Jay Leno Show” quickly fizzled and lured few viewers away from the primetime’s popular crime dramas and game shows. Conan’s ratings were also down, and only eight months after the shift, the network announced it would move both Leno and O’Brien back to their old times. The move was a betrayal of the network’s promise to the comic redhead, and O’Brien’s supporters suspected a power play by a big-chinned wisecracker who was not ready to step aside for the next generation.
A public feud between O’Brien and the network ensued, ending with O’Brien leaving the network, contractually exiled from television. Leno does not deserve sole blame for the incident—it was horribly mismanaged by the corporation—but in the public arena he was understood to have betrayed O’Brien. The slogan “I’m With Coco” prevailed as comics and fans alike aligned with O’Brien and against Leno and NBC. O’Brien is now back on the air nightly with Conan on TBS, and Leno is hosting a diminished Tonight Show. No one emerged unscathed from the battle, but Leno came out looking like a usurper of the throne.
After being president of the Lampoon at Harvard, O’Brien went on to write for “Saturday Night Live” and “The Simpsons” before he established himself as one of the most powerful and likeable forces in comedy on “Late Night.” Harvard has benefitted from its association with him ever since, reinforced by the fact that the Class of 2000 chose him to speak at their Class Day before graduation.
Only a year after the dust settled from the late-night ordeal, Harvard should defend its noble Celtic graduate. There are a dwindling number of Harvard men and women in the public realm who are popularly liked and revered by the masses—even Barack Obama is barely scraping by with a 50.5 percent approval rating—and we should be loyal to those who make the rest of us here look good.
With all this in mind, I ask of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals: Why, of all people, Jay Leno? He is a recognizable name, and bringing in celebrities enhances the Man of the Year event and theoretically enriches our community. But in this case they confuse fame with notoriety. No matter how much his chops are busted during the ceremonial roast, Leno does not deserve such an honorific from anyone, least of all the alma mater of his honorable nemesis. In fact, if America took a vote for “2010 Jerk of the Year Award,” Leno would likely be in close contention with Mark Zuckerberg and Julian Assange. (2009’s award would be split between Kanye “Imma Let You Finish But…” West and Rep. Joe “You Lie!” Wilson).
When Conan spoke at the 2000 Class Day, he delivered a spin on a graduation cliché: “If you can laugh at yourself loud and hard every time you fall, people will think you’re drunk.” Upon his departure from NBC, he inspired again with another bleak aphorism: “You can do anything you want in life. Unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of Harvard’s gates has stood proudly since 1889 as a daily reminder to Harvard students of their duty to “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” Every year, professors, administrators, and students encourage Harvard students to enter public service and make a positive difference in society.
But every year, hundreds of Harvard graduates persist in pursuing the socially useless and even destructive career of investment banking. If we truly want to serve Americans, Harvard administrators and students must work to change our pervasive I-banking culture.
In the class of 2009, over 20 percent of Harvard graduates chose careers in finance, the greatest percentage of any field. For some, the lucrative profession promises a way to pay off college debts or establish financial independence. For others, it simply seems like a continuation of the competitive and rewarding game Harvard students have played since first applying to college. Some graduates have suggested that it’s simply reassuring to follow the well-travelled path from internships to expensive dinners with recruiters to interviews.
However, many people, including some investment bankers, acknowledge that the industry is of little social significance. For example, the Epicurean Dealmaker, an investment banker who anonymously blogs critiques of his industry, asks his coworkers: “You mean to tell me your work as [a banker] is worth more to society than a firefighter? An elementary school teacher? A combat infantryman in Afghanistan? A priest? Good luck with that.”
Unfortunately, finance is not a zero-sum game, and the damage does not end at simply not doing good. In fact, the social injustice inherent to investment banking is rampant and well documented.
Investment banking is frequently destructive to normal, non-risk-taking Americans. The recent financial crisis and scandals involving huge bonuses for bank executives exemplify the danger of entrusting a lot of economic power to a few people. And in a profession pursued primarily for the sake of the salaries it pays, there is little incentive to act in a socially just manner.
Of course, the financial industry does provide needed capital to companies, allowing them to hire and innovate. However, investment banks spend most of their energy trading in securities, which have no social impact whatsoever—in fact, large banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs often gain less than 15 percent of their revenues from investing in companies. And even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke noted that financial innovations increase risk or can be used “to take unfair advantage rather than create a more efficient market.”
Benjamin M. Freidman ’66, a Harvard economics professor, bemoans the fact that so many graduates “go into activities that are not economically productive for the country, for society.” He cites a skewed rewards system as an explanation for why so many Harvard graduates pursue investment banking as a career.
Luckily, there is a way to remedy this. Top-tier schools have begun experimenting with incentivizing careers in public service rather than finance. For example, Harvard Law  School recently created a program providing grants to third year law students interesting in pursuing careers in public service. This replaced the “Public Service Initiative,” a previous trial program granting a year of free tuition to law students who promised to do public service work, like taking jobs at nonprofits. Yale Law School has followed suit. These grants send hundreds of students each year to fulfill Harvard’s vision of social responsibility.
Harvard College should consider establishing a similar program incentivizing public service work for its graduates, either providing grant money or waiving a year of tuition to those interested in working towards the betterment of society. Programs like the Peace Corps and Teach for America, while certainly not perfect, have begun to catalyze the kind of culture change desperately needed by Harvard’s undergraduate population.
If they truly wish to fulfill Harvard’s imperative for social responsibility, students must consider the social implications of their long-term as well as short-term career goals. It is downright shameful that, even with such a diverse student body, Harvard’s graduates disproportionately flock to investment banks.
It is vital that students question the ubiquitous pre-finance culture that pervades Harvard and dedicate themselves to truly serving their fellow human beings—not creating more wrongs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new GOP leadership of the House of Representatives accomplished its most anticipated objective in the second week of the 112th Congress, when three Democrats joined all 242 Republicans in approving a repeal of last March’s health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. While this largely symbolic effort was defeated on Wednesday night by the Democratic majority in the Senate, the earlier decisive House vote hardly bodes well for the law’s prospects down the road, especially if it remains unpopular with the public.
Yet, a more immediate concern for Obamacare’s supporters is the threat that the law’s individual mandate, which imposes a fine on most citizens and legal residents who fail to purchase a certain amount of health insurance by 2014, will be found unconstitutional. More than half of the state governments have joined a lawsuit against the provision. While two federal judges have upheld the mandate, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson of Virginia ruled in December that it lies outside the scope of Congress’s enumerated powers, and Judge Roger Vinson of Pensacola, Fla. issued a similar decision on Jan. 31. The final word is likely to come from the Supreme Court, whose ideological balance leaves the real possibility that the individual mandate could be struck down. If that happens, PPACA’s strategy for making insurance affordable will become untenable.
Frequently noted during the health care debate was the population of uninsured Americans—50.7 million as of 2009—many of whom cannot afford coverage and are denied care: A recent Harvard Medical School study concludes that nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with a lack of health insurance. There are two reasons people may be unable to afford insurance: Either they have insufficient income, or they entail such a high medical risk as to make insurance prohibitively expensive. The latter problem, which the individual mandate is designed to solve, results from insurers’ efforts to eliminate adverse selection, a phenomenon whereby high-risk individuals have more information on their health status than the insurer and are able to buy insurance at a premium based on a lower-risk group.
Demand for insurance is based on the consumer’s actuarially fair premium—the probability of a consumer incurring a medical expense multiplied by the size of the expense. Since healthy people have a low actuarially fair premium, they are less likely to buy insurance for any given price than sicker, or higher-risk, people. If insurers charged every customer the same premium based on the average risk of the entire population, the healthiest people would not buy insurance since their actuarially fair premium would be lower than that of the average citizen. The exit of the healthiest people from the market would necessitate an increase in the premium to compensate for the increased risk per person, which would induce the next healthiest group of people to exit the market, which in turn would require a further premium increase. This process, called a “death spiral,” would likely continue until health insurance became prohibitively expensive for everyone.
One of the principal ways insurers mitigate adverse selection is by tailoring policies to the health status of enrollees. This is accomplished through such strategies as medical underwriting, which sets premiums as a function of health status (i.e., lower-risk people pay lower premiums), and preexisting conditions clauses, which exempt the insurer from covering expenses related to conditions consumers had prior to purchasing insurance. The problem with such techniques is that they often make insurance prohibitively expensive for high-risk individuals.
To improve affordability, PPACA would ban medical underwriting and preexisting conditions clauses. The law replaces these devices as the antidote to adverse selection with the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to purchase health insurance beginning in 2014—premiums would (theoretically) remain affordable since low-risk people would not be allowed to drop their coverage without paying a fine. The hope is that the individual mandate, along with the expansion of Medicaid and subsidized insurance exchanges, will make insurance affordable regardless of income or health status.
While there are reasons to think the individual mandate would not completely eliminate adverse selection, its nullification would unequivocally doom the scheme by allowing low-risk citizens to drop out of the insurance market without penalty, leaving insurers without any means of getting around the adverse selection problem. An August 2010 study by MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber ’92 of the Center for American Progress estimates that repealing the mandate, absent any other changes, would increase the average premium by 27 percent in 2019 since more people would not buy insurance until they got sick, and that enrollment would increase by only seven million over the same period as opposed to the projected 32 million under the mandate.
With the individual mandate, there is a strong case that PPACA’s restrictions on medical underwriting and preexisting conditions clauses would improve access to care at a reasonable cost; without the mandate, these restrictions would clearly be more cost than benefit. If the Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate in isolation, Congress should repeal the bans on medical underwriting and preexisting conditions clauses and devise a constitutionally sound way of improving affordability.

As bloody protests continue to rock the streets of Egypt, a panel convened at the Harvard Institute of Politics yesterday to discuss how the U.S. should approach the complex situation called it “the most historic moment in the modern Arab world in the last century.”
The panelists offered historical context for the recent spread of political instability across Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab nations, and said that even for countries in which the government remains in power, the unrest will fundamentally alter the political fabric of the region.
The panel—Rami G. Khouri, a journalist from the American University in Beirut; Tarek Masoud, a HKS professor; E. Roger Owen, a history professor; and Malika Zeghal, a near eastern languages and civilizations professor—said that high unemployment in many nations has been coupled with a widespread belief that governments have failed to protect their citizens.
The recent success of the Tunisian protests in ending former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali’s reign has sparked protest movements in other nations to oust governments that have grown unpopular with their people, Masoud said.
“The wall of fear has fallen and has changed the psychology and culture of the region,” said Zeghal. Several panelists agreed that while the U.S. is in a difficult diplomatic position, as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is a long-standing ally, the U.S. should stand strongly behind the demands of the Egyptian people for a fully accountable democracy.
Khouri, the journalist, said that the U.S. must back its pledge to encourage the creation of a democratic government in Egypt.
“The U.S. and Europeans missed the boat when they refused to deal with Hamas when they won a democratic election,” he said, referring to the political group that came to power in Palestine in 2006. “They should not miss the boat again this time.”
All of the panelists also warned that while Americans might see Mubarak’s regime as beneficial to U.S. foreign policy, fighting the will of the Egyptian people could be disastrous for the U.S. in the future.
“Eventually [the Egyptian people] are going to achieve their freedom, and they’re going to ask, ‘Where was the U.S. when I was engaged in this process? Was it with me or was it against me?’” said Masoud, the Kennedy School professor.
Despite emphasis in many media reports on the potential for Islamist groups to capitalize on the protest movement and gain power, Zeghal said that the unrest should be seen as a nationalist revolution, rather than as a religious one like the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
“If the Islamists come back—and they have started to come back—they will have to participate in a democratic transition as any other movement,” Zeghal said.
Looking ahead, all of the panelists agreed that the actions of Egypt’s army will be key in deciding who ultimately holds power. But Khouri said that it is unrealistic to expect that unrest on Egyptian streets will to result in a rapid democratic transition.
“It took the United States 300 years to go from slavery to giving women the right to vote and blacks equal rights. These things take time,” Khouri said.
Following the event, several students said that the talk had presented a different perspective than the one offered by the media, especially about the potential rise of the Muslim Brotherhood as a dominant Islamist group in Egypt.
Some students also said that they appreciated the panelists’ call for the U.S. to follow its proclaimed message and support the creation of democracies.
“[The event] was a call to citizens of the United States to keep an open mind and keep supporting democracies everywhere in the world,” said Jordan E. Sessler ’13.

Everything has its benefits, even fat. A group of ten freshmen learned this lesson—and more—last night at a vegetarian cooking class, held at the house of Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
“Not all fats are equal,” said chef Martin T. Breslin, the director for culinary operations. “Oil is a fat, but it’s a healthy fat.”
The event, hosted by the Food Literacy Project, provided students with an opportunity to learn how to cook healthy food while mingling with the chef, the Dean, and their fellow classmates.
As Breslin drizzled a generous helping of olive oil into a pan, with classical music playing in the background, he reminded the attendees that “good cooking starts with good oil.”
Breslin, who came to Harvard in 2002, suggested that when cooking for yourself, it’s better to cook without a recipe. This go-with-your-gut attitude, he said, allows for more creativity.
According to Food Literacy Project Coordinator Dara B. Olmsted ’00, more than 80 people expressed interest in participating in the cooking class.
Though Lauren M. Chaleff ’14 was initially put on the waiting list, she was notified a few days ago that she was among the lucky freshmen—all of whom turned out to be female—who were invited to Dingman’s house for the class.
A vegetarian for three years, Chaleff said she loves Annenberg for its variety of options and accommodations for those leading a meatless lifestyle.
While vegan split pea soup was simmering on the stove, students molded palm-sized patties with black beans that had been boiled and soaked the day before. Nearby, Breslin scooped a spoonful of Dijon mustard and poured champagne vinegar into the orange vinaigrette dressing.
“Bring it on!” Dingman said, generating laughter in the kitchen.
During the event, Dingman recalled a story he heard from a parent several years ago. After taking a cooking class at Dingman’s house, the parent told Dingman that his son came home and stepped up in the kitchen, excited to show his parents what he learned during his first semester at Harvard.
“Harvard education should be more than passing the required courses,” Dingman said.
The smell of food permeated through the house as students complained of watery mouths. Soon after the night’s feast—which also included whole grain pasta primavera and bulgur wheat pilaf with dried fruits—was served, students were eager for their seconds and thirds.
Olmsted said the cooking class, an annual event, reflects the mission of FLP because it not only builds a community among food enthusiasts, but also teaches students about food preparation.
“Students don’t get the chance to cook in college because of the dining halls,” she said. “Knowing how to cook prepares them for life after college.”
Later this month, FLP will host additional cooking classes, including one on Mediterranean food in Quincy on Feb. 8 and one on hors d’oeuvres in Mather on Feb. 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elementary school students sat in the front row of the common room at the Harvard Allston Education Portal yesterday evening, eagerly waiting to learn more about two things with which they are very familiar but can never get enough of: bugs and robots.
Benjamin M. Finio, a graduate student in the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory, gave a family-friendly presentation titled “Bots that Mimic Bugs” explaining the research on bio-inspired microrobotics at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.
“It’s a chance for families, and especially kids, to learn from a young scientist,” said Robert A. Lue, director of life sciences education in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and one of the organizers of the event. “We want to excite young minds about science as soon as possible,” Lue said.
Kids squealed with disgust and delight as the scientist showed a cockroach move across the screen. Their eyes lit up when the screen showed a giant centipede catching a bat in a black and white clip reminiscent of a horror film.
Finio explained to the families how researchers use nature as inspiration to build tiny robots that mimic insects—such as flies, cockroaches, and centipedes—that can be used to crawl and squirm into small areas. Future uses of the technology might include searching for people who have been trapped under rubble from an earthquake, Finio said.
Last night marked the first lecture in a series of planned events focusing on engaging young students with science.
Alison Brissette, one of the organizers of the event, said that most of the lectures hosted in the past had been adult-focused.
“It’s the first lecture that was kid-oriented, and I’m so glad to see how many kids came,” she said. “Clearly robotics is a hot topic.”
During another short video of a fly flapping its wings in slow motion, Finio discussed the difficulties of building a robot that is the size of a fingertip and lacks the natural balance and instinct of an insect.
“We can’t take big things and make them small because the parts are too big,” Finio said to the children. He and other researchers and engineers are still in the process of creating a small and lightweight battery that would allow the robot to lift off the ground without support.
The scientists’ latest research involves creating “squishy” robots, inspired by octopi and the muscles in an elephant’s trunk. Using products such as silicone rubber and balloons, researchers have so far been able to create robotic worms that do not break under pressure from a hammer.
“There’s a stereotype that science is for nerds, and I want to show kids that there is lots of cool stuff you can do with science—that it’s fun,” Finio said.

Donations to Harvard for fiscal year 2010 totaled $596.96 million, placing it second among colleges and universities across the nation, according to an annual survey released earlier this week by the Council for Aid to Education.
Harvard saw a 0.8 percent decrease from 2009 in total donations. Overall, donations to colleges and universities across the nation rose 0.5 percent from 2009, totaling $28 billion. This figure is roughly equal to the amount donated in 2006.
However, when adjusted for inflation, the amount fell by 0.6 percent since 2009, and is 0.8 percent lower than in 2006.
Stanford topped the list with $598.89 million in giving, a 6.4 percent decrease from last year. Harvard was followed by Johns Hopkins and the University of Southern California.
“Though lackluster, the findings are more sanguine than those of last year,” the report said. Last year, donations decreased by about 11.9 percent.
“The study indicates that the fundraising nadir was reached in 2009 but that a full recovery is yet to materialize,” the report said.
Harvard officials have sounded cautious notes of optimism about the University’s fundraising performance as it gears up to launch its long-delayed capital campaign.
“Last year, Harvard fundraising held steady despite the unpredictable economic circumstances that all alumni and donors faced,” said Tamara E. Rogers,  Harvard’s vice president for alumni affairs and development, in a statement. “While fundraising results rise and fall, and in any individual year there are good quarters and bad quarters, so far this fiscal year we are very pleased with the momentum that we have seen.”
According to the report, this trend may indicate that donors’ willingness to give may lag behind the recovery of the stock market.
“We’re still not out of the woods. Charitable contributions to education are recovering very slowly,” said director of the survey Ann E. Kaplan in a statement.
“Still, historical patterns show that the pace of the recovery in charitable giving usually reflects overall economic recovery. As long as the economy continues to improve, we can expect further improvement in giving, even if incremental at first.”
The report showed that corporate and foundation giving increased in 2010 by about two percent. Corporate donations represent about 17 percent, and foundation giving represents 30 percent of total donations.
Alumni giving has decreased by 0.4 percent overall. The average amount of each alumni donation also dropped by 0.4 percent.
This decrease is far less dramatic than last year, which witnessed an 18 percent drop in alumni donations. Alumni donations account for about a quarter of all donations to universities and colleges.
The report indicated that alumni participation has been declining for many years, even before the financial crisis.

While developed nations have made progress in reducing the incidence of hypertension, obesity, and high cholesterol, low-income and developing nations have experienced a significant increase in the number of people afflicted with these risk factors for heart disease, according to a recent study published by researchers in public health.
The study—co-authored by Goodarz Danaei, a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, and Professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London—found that obesity has nearly doubled worldwide since 1980, making it a global concern.
Speaking about the study, Ezzati said his research shows both good news and bad news.
“The good news is there are places that have managed to contain obesity,” Ezzati said. “The bad news is the divide in blood pressure and cholesterol in high-income and low-income countries.”
Conducted over the course of two years, the study was published in the medical journal “The Lancet” as three separate scientific papers. One paper focused on surveying body mass index, while the other two focused on blood pressure and cholesterol. Researchers at the World Health Organization also collaborated on the study.
The rapidly increasing population numbers in developing countries help explain the disparity between high-income and low-income countries, Danaei said.
“The large increase in South Asia, because of the population, for example, contributes a lot to the numbers,” Danaei said.
But the issue is not limited to South Asia, Danaei added. The incidence of obesity is also high in East Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, he noted.
Due to the implications of the research, the United Nations General Assembly on Non-Communicable Diseases will discuss chronic, cardiovascular disease for the first time this September, according to Danaei.
The U.N. will work with the World Health Organization to look at risk prevention techniques for cardiovascular disease.
“These estimates are informing our future global policies as to what is the best possible scenario” for preventing these diseases, Danaei said.
Ezzati said in the next phase of their research, the team will start looking at other factors that contribute to obesity.
“We are going to update these numbers and begin looking at the health effects of them, so there’s lots more coming in the future,” Ezzati said.

Harvard and MIT libraries today announced the possibility of a long-term collaboration that will explore joint efforts to preserve digital materials, ease access between library catalogues, and build a new shared storage site.
The two library systems, authorized and mandated by provosts from both Harvard and MIT, will deliver a plan of action by this June. There will be assessments every 12 months over an initial three-year period, according to University Professor Robert C. Darnton ’60, who served as administrative director of the Harvard University Library before the administrative restructuring.
The most “exciting” part of this collaboration is the possibility of developing new ways to preserve digital materials, according to Darnton.
“[Harvard and MIT] are both in the process for developing long-term digital preservation of resources that we already own,” Director of MIT Libraries Ann J. Wolpert said.
“Electronic texts are not resistant to changes as our paper texts are ... [and] it is important that we keep them alive,” Darnton said.
By mobilizing computer science experts at Harvard and MIT, the project will look into new methods for long-term digital preservation that also will be applicable to other digital libraries, Darnton added.
Another long-term goal of this potential collaboration would be that Harvard students and faculty members have full access to printed materials in all MIT libraries, and vice versa, according to Darnton. When combined, the two library systems would make available 20 million volumes of printed material to the students and faculty at both universities.
While reciprocal borrowing has been in place between Harvard College Library and MIT libraries in the past, access to Harvard’s graduate and professional school libraries was limited, Wolpert said.
In addition, the university libraries will explore new models of licensing that may lower prices for electronic materials, according to Wolpert.
“The present model requires that we have two different licenses [for the two library systems],” Wolpert said.
If the project moves forward, an additional off-site depository likely will be added to serve both library systems.
Harvard and MIT have shared the Harvard Depository since it opened in 1986.
“It seems like a great collaboration to bring both collections,” Wolpert said. “[The library systems at Harvard and MIT] are two magnificent collections in Cambridge and they don’t overlap too much, given the different foci of the universities.”

Some department administrators questioned the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ capacity to close its $35 million deficit by the 2012 self-imposed deadline, citing already painfully slim budgets.
Last spring, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said the school would eliminate the deficit—reduced from some $220 million after the recession first hit—by the end of the 2012 fiscal year though a combination of budget cuts and withdrawals from FAS reserve funds.
“Dean Smith has also acknowledged that many challenges remain,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement. “In particular, from the beginning of the global financial crisis, he has said that the current fiscal year would be the most challenging. As a result, he has explained that the FAS would use some amount of reserves to bridge the gap this year.”
But administrators interviewed yesterday named faculty retirements and further centralization—including mergers of some centers and small departments—as potential avenues for further slashing the deficit.
While department administrators—many of whom requested anonymity to protect their relationship with the FAS administration—are quick to praise Smith’s deficit-shrinking initiatives, some said they fear whether fewer explicit references to the severity of the crisis has led to a false sense of normalcy.
The administrators expressed concern that the lack of financial discussion at the most recent Faculty meeting this past Tuesday represented this decreasing emphasis, as finances have been a consistent topic at Faculty meetings since the economic meltdown ravaged Harvard’s finances.
“They have to keep saying it, and we have to keep saying it: We haven’t solved the crisis,” history department Director of Administration Janet H. Hatch said.
But in a Jan. 20 meeting with department administrators, leaders within FAS presented a cautious, but non-specific message, according to another department administrator.
“They told us not to come to [the FAS central administration] unless we really, really needed something,” the administrator said. “Of course we’re going to go with them if we really need something.”
Many said that they already were running with the lowest budgets possible without impacting their departments’ curricular rigor.
“I’m not sure how they’re going to do it,” Hatch said. “We’re operating at a lower level, and we’re still maintaining that level—and there’s nothing else to cut.”
Administrators pointed to potential merging of departments and centers—and the centralization of staff as a result—as ways they expected FAS to balance its budget.
Some departments have already taken advantage of centralization. The History and History of Science departments last year began partially outsourcing the work of administrative assistants.
“The largest expenditure for most departments will be the retaining of faculty and staff,” another administrator said.
The administrator went on to assert that, for the same reason, the retirement package offered the past two years would financially benefit FAS. Searching for and hiring a junior faculty member would not cost as much as a veteran faculty member’s salary, she said.
The FAS fiscal year 2010 Annual Financial Report discusses the fiscal benefits from “organizational actions including an early retirement plan.”
Still, many faculty members accepting the package did so last year, administrators said, leaving department officials uncertain what future gains they can expect from the program.

In response to concerns raised by the city’s GLBT Commission and members of the transgender community, the Cambridge City Council has passed a resolution requesting that the City Manager draft an ordinance on gender-neutral bathrooms.
Members of the GLBT Commission have had the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms on their radar for some time, but after hearing specific concerns about bathroom accessibility in the public library and anecdotes of residents facing harassment, commissioners concluded a city-wide ordinance was needed, according to Co-Chairs John W. Gintell and Sarav S. Chidambaram.
“Multitudes of people are facing these issues,” Chidambaram said.
He noted that gender neutral bathrooms seek to address overall accessibility. In addition to providing a space for those who do not fully identify as male or female, the single-stall restrooms also tend to be handicapped accessible.
The resolution says that the facilities will make it easier for those with caretakers of the opposite gender—such as a father accompanying a daughter—to access the restroom.
Because it is not yet officially an ordinance, it is unclear how Harvard might be affected. Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of the Harvard Queer Students and Allies, said the potential ordinance may shape discussions on gender neutral bathrooms with regards to House renewal.
“Harvard has definitely been keeping up with trying to cater to the needs of trans students on campus,” said Jia Hui Lee ’12, chair of the Harvard Trans Task Force.
“I see [the resolution] to be a very good step forward for the city .... It’s not about making all bathrooms gender neutral, it’s about providing an alternative to gendered bathrooms.”
The resolution passed the City Council with virtually unanimous approval.
City Councilor and former Mayor E. Denise Simmons—the country’s first African-American, openly lesbian mayor—rallied support for the measure from her colleagues.
“The City Council is very progressive and proactive,” said Simmons, who said the order will make the transgender community feel less isolated.
But the think tank Massachusetts Family Institute has expressed opposition to the order.
“MFI does oppose gender neutral bathrooms because we believe in the safety, and the privacy, and the modesty that should be available to all citizens,” said spokesperson Lisa J. Barstow. “And we believe gender-specific bathrooms do protect that.”
Though she said she was not familiar with the specifics of the Cambridge resolution, Barstow expressed concern that an ordinance might become an “unfunded mandate” requiring businesses to construct additional facilities—though she stated that the institute does not oppose gender-neutral bathrooms if the establishment constructs them voluntarily.
Timothy P. McCarthy ’83, director of the Human Rights and Social Movements Program at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, noted that other cities such as San Francisco have gender-neutral bathroom ordinances. He said opposition to such orders is initially over fear of blurring gender boundaries, but later people realize the utility of the facilities.
Simmons said that neither she nor the GLBT commission chairs had heard any opposition from the business community, adding that many institutions already have gender-neutral bathrooms or single-stalled restrooms in place.
“It doesn’t just serve the GLBT community, it serves families,” Simmons said.

For the first time this summer, two new pilot programs modeled after the six-year-old Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE) will offer undergraduates an opportunity to conduct research in business and the social sciences.
But unlike PRISE, which will host about 120 students this summer, the two new programs—Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences (BLISS) and the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations (PRIMO)—will provide programming for only 35 students combined.
BLISS will allow students to work with professors from the psychology department, the Harvard Kennedy School, and the Graduate School of Education, while PRIMO will pair participants with researchers at the Harvard Business School.
“This is very much a part of the larger commitment on the part of the College to make research opportunities available to as many students as possible,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said. “Part of what it means to get a solid college education is not just being able to consume knowledge but to learn to be a part of producing it.”
BLISS and PRIMO will provide on-campus housing, evening programming, and a small stipend for students in the programs. But unlike PRISE—which requires students to secure jobs in research labs—in this pilot year BLISS and PRIMO administrators have already selected the projects that students will be able to participate in.
“Given the size of the pilot, what we wanted to do was make sure that we had some kind of approach that facilitated a good working relationship with the faculty and the students and also gave the project a sense of breadth,” Gregory A. Llacer, director of the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives said, adding that he hopes that funding will allow the programs to expand in future years.
Psychology Professor Susan E. Carey ’64—who will host BLISS students in her lab this summer and has run an undergraduate internship program for the last 15 years—said she thinks it is important for Harvard to provide more opportunities for funding for social science research.
“It’s really to give them a chance to see what the day-to-day texture of scientific work is really like,” Carey said.
For psychology concentrator Jocelyn G. Karlan ’12, the creation of programs such as BLISS help ease the pressure on students hoping to find lab placements and funding for senior thesis research over the summer.
“I applied to be a proctor just because I was so uncomfortable just relying on the psych department [for housing]. Obviously there’s not an unlimited source of funding,” Karlan said. “With new programs, it should be better this year.”
While the idea for BLISS arose as a natural counterpart to PRISE for College administrators, the impetus for PRIMO came from business school professors who hoped to spread interest in research among undergraduates who typically look to HBS for MBA programs, according to Llacer.
HBS Professor Sunil Gupta, who will host PRIMO participants working on digital revolution and social media projects, agreed that exposing students to research is an important goal of the program.
“We want to excite them on an intellectual basis,” Gupta said. “We can always use bright people in this profession.”
The application deadline for BLISS and PRIMO is Feb. 28.

The powdery substance that was discovered in the Science Center more than a week ago has been confirmed to be flour, Lieutenant David J. Pierce of the Cambridge Fire Department’s Fire Investigation Unit reported yesterday.
The Cambridge Fire Department was called to 1 Oxford St. on Jan. 23 at approximately 3:27 p.m. when a powdery substance was discovered in a container on its premises. The incident was initially reported to the Harvard University Police Department.
Police officials deemed the substance “suspicious,” and the Cambridge Fire Department was called to remove it.
At the time, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not provide details due to the open investigation.
“The substance is in the custody of the CFD to be tested,” Catalano wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson last Tuesday. “Until those tests come back we can’t confirm what the substance was or was not.”
After about a week of testing, Pierce told The Crimson yesterday that the powdery substance was flour and not a hazardous chemical substance.
Pierce did not provide details as to the color of the substance, the amount, or the size of the container.
While this type of testing could have had a longer turnaround time, the department was able to obtain the test results for the substance in fewer than 10 business days.
John B. Mathers, assistant director of the Science Center, said in an interview last week that whenever anyone finds a suspicious package, the individual is encouraged to alert the police department.
Catalano did not return The Crimson’s request for comment on the investigation yesterday afternoon.

A group of researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have turned their focus to improving how hospitals communicate with their patients—including those who lack strong literacy skills.
The Health Literacy Studies groups, led by Rima Rudd as principal investigator, have produced a number of findings that tie adult literacy to health problems. Rudd outlined her findings in a perspective piece in the December issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
“It’s time to look in the mirror and look at what it is that we are doing and what we are contributing to the information exchange to make sure we eliminate literacy related barriers,” Rudd said.
Rudd’s own work attempts to question many of the assumptions made by health care systems, hospitals, and health centers. She said she examines things as “simple” as a sign on the wall to things as “complicated” as forms and questionnaires.
“We have to pay attention to vocabulary, to the clarity of our thought, to avoiding jargon, to explaining complex mathematical terms like risk and normal and range,” Rudd said. “We don’t do a very good job with that.”
To study the barriers to navigating health care systems, Rudd devised a test to challenge the efficacy of hospital signs. An informant and an observer must find their way to a part of a hospital, such as a medical record room, and take note of all the things that led them there.
The results can be surprising, Rudd said, because even the most literate of people are unable to find directions to a certain area of a hospital.
Associate Professor Kasisomayajula “Vish” Viswanath also conducts research on health literacy. Institutions such as hospitals should be sensitive to the fact that they cannot just provide information, he said. They have to make sure it is comprehended by people in a way that they can use it.
“The information they are providing actually should take into account the needs of the patient,” Viswanath said.
“You have to really make accommodations on differences among people and how to really provide information taking into account those differences.”
The recently passed health care legislation attempts to address barriers to health literacy, Rudd said.
“There’s a lot of mention of the importance of explaining language, presenting things in plain language, and paying attention to literacy in writing and speaking,” Rudd said of health care reform legislation.
With health care information being distributed over a variety of mediums—electronically and in print—medical institutions must adjust their facilities to be accessible to all types of patients, Viswanath said.
“Health literacy is one of the ingredients that would help people cope with the explosion of information,” he said.

A new microfluidics teaching lab—designed to bring cutting-edge research to the classroom—will open its doors to undergraduates and faculty affiliates at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences this semester.
Microfluidics is the study of the flow of fluids at extremely small volumes, with functions ranging from inkjet printheads to DNA microtechnology. The science relies on building devices called microfluidic chips to study those fluids.
The lab is meant to foster a hands-on approach to learning and has been a long-term vision of Anas Chalah, director of undergraduate teaching labs at SEAS. Chalah, who cited Harvard as the birthplace of microfluidic studies, hopes that the facility will expose undergraduates to research at the cutting edge.
“The sky is the limit in this field, and we are excited to bring this technology to the teaching labs so that undergrads can gain experience before joining a research lab,” Chalah said. “This is really rare, and Harvard is a magnificent place for students to be exposed to these technologies.”
Chalah called microfluidics a field that addresses every discipline in the engineering sciences. He also noted that the facility seeks to foster cross-disciplinary dialogue between biological and physical science concentrators. For example, students interested in mechanical engineering can build microfluidic chips that monitor fluid dynamics, while those following a bioengineering track can use the same devices to analyze blood samples.
“People are excited from both ends, whether they’re mechanical engineers or bioengineers,” said Chalah. “We’re really proud of this lab because we can support many classes.”
In addition to studying fluid samples, students will also be given the opportunity to build their own microfluidic chips. Chalah said that while a simple commercial chip can cost up to $600, his devices—developed by Joe Childs, a high school physics instructor at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School—can cost as little as $10.
The lab has already been incorporated as an experimental component of Engineering Sciences 123: “Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Transport Processes.”
Chalah said that the collaboration has generated excitement among faculty affiliates.
“It’s a very concrete illustration of the class—and a way for students to connect to the cutting edge,” said Daniel Needleman, assistant professor of applied physics and instructor of ES 123.
Undergraduates in the class echoed Needleman’s comments.
“Microfluidics is a very useful device—there are many applications to many fields, especially in biomedical engineering,” said Nan R. Du ’12, an engineering concentrator currently enrolled in ES 123. “There’s going to be a lot of interesting research that Harvard undergraduates can do.”

A relatively new hybrid form of cholera, a disease underscored by recent deadly outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Haiti, may be more dangerous than past strains, according to researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University.
Edward T. Ryan, an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health, said that cholera has undergone two major mutations in the last twenty or so years. The first, in the early 1990s, involved a change in the bacteria’s “coat,” which allowed it to infect those previously thought to be immune to the disease.
The second mutation has made the disease more deadly, according to Ryan. In an editorial published in Jan. 25 in the journal “PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,” Ryan wrote that the cholera caused by the new hybrid strain may be more severe, which “may explain why we are seeing case fatality rates of 1 to 5 percent in recent outbreaks as opposed to under 1 percent historically accepted as the goal for response teams.”
For the past five years, researchers at Harvard University’s Edward T. Ryan Laboratory have been studying the immune responses of humans infected with the cholera bacterium, Vibrio cholerae. According to the Ryan Laboratory’s website, the researchers hope to identify the “mediators of protection against cholera” to better inform the development of new vaccines and methods of prevention.
“Our work focuses on the immune response to a new cholera vaccine,” said Ryan, who runs the laboratory. “We want to identify protection factors to help develop knowledge and find a vaccine.”
“The current usable vaccines provide a protective immune response that lasts just six months to two years,” said Richelle C. Charles, an instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Ryan Laboratory. Charles said that a goal of the research would be to extend the period of time for which people remain immunized.
Charles recently spent three weeks in Haiti providing clinical help to Haitians affected by the ongoing cholera pandemic. During that time, she also collected samples for research.
The Ryan Laboratory is collaborating with four other Harvard professors and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Researchers at the center famously discovered oral rehydration therapy, a treatment for cholera and diarrhea, which Ryan said has saved over 40 million lives since its discovery in 1969.
The media has extensively covered the ongoing cholera outbreaks in Haiti and Zimbabwe. Currently, the world is experiencing the seventh cholera pandemic since the 1820s. The pandemic, which began in 1961 in Indonesia and has since spread across Asia and Africa, among other places, is now in its 50th year.
“It catches the attention of the media for a couple major outbreaks, but we’re concerned with the long-term [effects],” Ryan said.

Joshua R. Wortzel ’13 has always been fascinated by genetics: as a young boy he discussed evolution with his father from the bathtub, and in 6th grade he bred 70 mice in his basement while conducting a Mendelian-inspired experiment on coat color.
Now a researcher at Harvard Medical School Professor Christopher A. Walsh’s neurogenetics lab, Wortzel is exploring his passion once again.
Last summer, he joined a project working to identify a gene whose mutation causes microcephaly, a typically lethal condition characterized by abnormally tiny brains. Microcephaly often results when progenitor cells—the “stem cells” of the brain—die prematurely or differentiate too quickly to form a whole brain.
After sampling DNA from eight children in a Palestinian Arab family—seven of whom had the neurodevelopmental disorder microcephaly—researchers at the Walsh lab were able to isolate one gene that was commonly mutated among all of the afflicted children.
The researchers observed that a similar copy of the gene is located on the mouse genome. By mutating that gene in mice, Wortzel and his colleagues have been able to confirm that mutations of the gene in question (whose name Wortzel cannot reveal until it is officially published) result in altered progenitor cells, strengthening evidence that the gene may be responsible for microcephaly.
“I think it’s pretty cool that you’re faced with a mystery, and in a very systematic way you can go about peeling that mystery,” he said. “It’s a puzzle—a creative outlet.”
This enthusiasm is one of the most important traits an undergraduate can bring to the laboratory, said Walsh, Wortzel’s research adviser.
“He’s really, really smart, and that’s the most important thing. But you know that is not the only important thing for being a good researcher,” said Waslh. “First of all, you have to be an optimist. You always have to be skillful with your hands. And then you have to be fearless.”
The human developmental and regenerative biology concentrator has begun independent research on the function of the gene that Wortzel and his colleagues believe may be behind microcephaly. Wortzel said that recent research suggests that it influences the modification of histones, which play an important role in gene regulation.
Flourescently tagged antibodies only stick to histones with certain residues. By inserting these antibodies into cells from human control and mutated samples, Wortzel can identify whether the gene mutation affects histone modification.
Wortzel said his interest in neurobiology and genetics is in large part due to personal experience—his grandfather suffered from Alzheimer’s and in middle school Wortzel was “big brother” to a boy with autism.
“The brain makes us human, but when it goes wrong there’s little we can do about it,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an early age, human infants can perceive social hierarchy and recognize physical size as a metric of social dominance, according to a study by psychology postdoctoral fellow Lotte Thomsen.
The study, released in an article in Science last week, found that animations of larger agents yielding to smaller ones attracted infants’ attention longer than animations of larger objects dominating smaller ones—an indication that infants were puzzled by the images of submissive larger agents.
Preverbal infants—ranging from about 8 to 13 months of age—were selected for this study as they were deemed too young to actively participate in dominance fights.
“American infants are unlikely to have watched small agents bow and prostrate in subordination to others of more formidable physical size, such as their parents,” the study said.
Noting that body size appears to be a nearly universal cue for dominance, the study observed that contestants in dominance fights typically assume postures that maximize their apparent size.
“Human infants face the formidable challenge of learning the structure of their social environment,” the study read.  “Previous research indicates that infants have early-developing representations of intentional agents, and of cooperative social interactions, that help meet that challenge.”
Through this study, Thomsen was able to discover that 10 to 13-month-old infants—but not 8-month-olds—recognize when two novel agents have conflicting goals, and that they use the agents’ relative size to predict the outcome of the dominance contests between them.
The study concluded that preverbal infants form representations of social hierarchy that mirror the generally accepted idea that larger sizes are dominant.
Thomsen—who works at the Laboratory for Developmental Studies—wrote her doctoral research on a related topic, “Seeing Social Relations.”
She wrote on her website that she is “interested in how elementary kinds of relational motives underpin meaningful psychological and social phenomena and intergroup relations.”
“I see this as a general psychological topic that relates to social, cognitive, evolutionary, and developmental psychology,” Thomsen wrote.

President Obama appointed Physics Professor Lisa J. Randall ’84 to the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science last week.
Randall, a prominent theoretical physicist responsible for several major breakthroughs in string theory, said she is looking forward to serving on the committee.
“It’s an honor and should be an interesting experience,” Randall said.
Randall—the first tenured woman in the Princeton physics department and the first tenured female theoretical physicist at Harvard—will be one of twelve scientists and engineers appointed by the President to evaluate nominees for the award.
Randall’s co-workers in the Harvard physics department are enthusiastic about the announcement.
“I don’t think there’s much to say beyond the obvious—that she is a terrific scientist,” said Howard M. Georgi ’68, Mallinckrodt professor of physics and master of Leverett House.
Since its establishment, the National Medal of Science has been awarded to 468 scientists and engineers. Former winners of the medal include chemist Arnold O. Beckman, the creator of the pH meter, physicist and science popularizer Richard P. Feynman, and mathematician Kurt Gödel.
According to the National Science Foundation records, the medal has been awarded to more than 30 researchers with Harvard affiliations.  A number are still active at the University today, including professors George M. Whitesides, E.O. Wilson, Elias J. Corey, and Shing-Tung Yau—all dominant members of their fields and widely respected for the magnitude of their contributions to science or mathematics.
Scientists may be nominated for the award through the National Science Foundation website until March 31, and the committee will meet for deliberations soon thereafter.
Randall said she believes that awarding the National Medal of Science not only affects the award recipient but also has a significant impact on public perception of science.
“It is a good opportunity to raise awareness of science in general and one person’s accomplishments in particular,” she said. “Recognition by the President and the scientific community at large is a big deal.”
Randall also shows concern about the future of science education, especially in light of the current budget environment.
“I hope people see the wisdom, especially in the long term, of promoting these goals,” Randall said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Sept., 1992, enrollment for Science A-17: “The Astronomical Perspective” was not as sky-high as professors Owen Gingerich and David W. Latham would have liked.  Some faculty  might have called it a day and commenced firing excess teaching fellows—but for Latham, the fun was just beginning.
“At a meeting to brainstorm ways of increasing enrollment, I suggested skywriting,” Gingerich recalled. “Dave went right back to his office and started telephoning.”
After downgrading from a skywriter to a banner-bearing plane (the skywriter was all the way in Newark, N.J.) and securing a half-price deal, it was only a matter of time before the simple message—“Sci A-17. M, W, F. Try it!”—rippled above Harvard Yard for all to see.
“The amazing thing was that Harvard students aren’t used to looking up, so very few students actually noticed the plane with the banner,” Gingerich said.
In the 1960s, this same spirit inspired Latham to spearhead the relocation of the Michael Telescope from Bucyrus, Ohio to its current home atop the Science Center in the Loomis-Michael Observatory. The observatory, ten stories high and brimming with vibrant paintings of astrological signs and symbols, is now accessible to anyone in the Harvard community who attends a short training session.
But since its installation, the observatory has been more than a scientific tool. Over the years, the dome perched high above campus has become a cross between an educational resource and a social space—playing host to amateur stargazers and poetry readings, study breaks and pre-Formal photo-ops, as well as an aging log book with messages from all the visitors who have passed through the observatory since 1976.
OHIO TO CAMBRIDGE OR BUST
Charles Michael was an avid astronomer, so for Christmas one year, his father Walter presented fifteen-year-old Charles with a telescope all his own. The enormous telescope was conveniently stored in the backyard observatory of his family’s Bucyrus, Ohio estate.
When Charles went off to college, the telescope fell into disuse and his father—head of the Ohio Locomotive Crane Company­—bequeathed it to Harvard University.
But before the construction of the Science Center in 1973, the University had nowhere to house the nearly four-meter, cast iron instrument.
“Walter Michael asked every year, politely at first, ‘when are you going to come get your telescope?’” recalled Latham, who was a graduate student at Harvard at the time and is now an Associate of the Harvard College Observatory and a lecturer on astronomy.
Once space was set aside in the Science Center, another obstacle arose—the estimated cost for transporting and installing the telescope was astronomical, so to speak.
If not for Latham, the story might have ended there.
“[Latham] decided he could personally get the telescope here for half the estimate of Buildings and Grounds, so he was commissioned to do it,” said Gingerich, referring to the Harvard department that would have been responsible for the relocation. Gingerich is professor emeritus of astronomy and of the history of science, and a senior astronomer emeritus at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
Latham zipped over to Ohio, and, with a few local vendors and a hired crane, lifted all the telescope sections out of Michael’s garden. He drove the pieces to Cambridge in a rental truck, all the while contemplating how he would lift them to the tenth story of the Science Center when the elevators only reached floor number eight.
After some poking around, Latham found a hatch in the machine room above the elevator that enabled him to hoist the pieces up the final stretch.
Despite the occasional hiccup—like when strong winds almost swept away the partially-assembled dome—colorful characters made the task quite fun, Latham said. For instance, Latham remembers the head of the rigging crew, whose encouragement involved not only commands about force, mass, and acceleration but some “spicy language” as well.
“After it was all assembled, he approached me very meekly and asked if he could bring his bible class into the telescope room,” recalled Latham, who was fascinated by the contrast and happy to oblige.
Ever since the installation—funded by busines entrepreneur Lee Loomis—was completed, that tradition of openness has continued.
“I always emphasized that we should make the telescope available to anyone with a little training,” Latham said. ”I think there is enormous value in being able to do something yourself, get your hands on the equipment, and make your own mistakes.”
DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
Upon entering the observatory, visitors are encircled by the emerald-green dragons, turquoise sea-monsters, husky gray dogs, and fiery phoenix that blaze across the walls around the roughly 2,000-pound telescope.
Each painting puts its own spin on traditional iconography: the Sagitarrius constellation is depicted with Egyptian flair, another adopts a Chinese motif, and yet another portrays the classic scene of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus.
These paintings were not the work of an ancient mythology professor, but a final project in Science A-17. Beyond these paintings, project options included writing music that followed Kepler’s laws for the music of the spheres and choreographing dances that represented planetary movements.
“You can imagine a professional observatory being a really dry place,” said current Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe President Tom S. Rice ’12. “But the paintings add a really romantic element.”
Faded photographs depicting the telescope’s installation, old Crimson articles about STAHR, and images of galaxies fill the remaining bits of wall.
An outdated computer sits on a desk next to a bookshelf of old astronomy texts—the “rejects” from Cabot Library, according to STAHR Observatory Manager Kristin I. Barclay ’14.
“The computer doesn’t connect to the internet, so it’s essentially a very expensive CD player,” Barclay said.
Latham and Gingerich were known for playing a different astronomy-related tune at the beginning of every class, and challenging students to connect its lyrics to the day’s lesson.
“I’m convinced that a handful of the students would get that little extra motivation to come to lecture just to see what music I was going to pick,” he said, recalling music ranging from the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun,” to “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen (for its famed lines “Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro,” of course).
Today, music and stargazing still go hand in hand.
“The Planets Suite by Gustav Holst is still up there today,” Rice said. “But we also recently brought a copy of Pink Floyd’s ‘Dark Side of the Moon.’”
MORE THAN JUST STARGAZING
Because the University has since acquired several state-of-the-art, computerized telescopes, the Michael Telescope serves as a tool for amateur stargazing.
“The delightful thing about the Loomis-Michael telescope is that you have to use it by hand and really understand firsthand what is needed to find your way around the sky,” said Astronomy Professor Jonathan E. Grindlay, who advises STAHR.
Over the past year, STAHR trained over 200 students to use the telescope, Rice said. In addition, STAHR recently hosted celestial poetry readings in conjunction with The Gamut—a Harvard poetry magazine—and a mooncakes festival with the Chinese Students Association.
Students also use the deck for their own undertakings.
Allyson M. Freedy ’14 took advantage of the “stunning” view from the outside deck to take freshman formal photos with her date last weekend. Due to the combination of high heels and an accumulated two feet of snow on the deck, her date had to carry her in most of the shots, she said.
Peer Advising Fellows Todd G. Venook ’13, Sophie L. Angelis ’13, and Alex L. Sopko ’12 led their advisees to the roof for a study break this fall, complete with hot chocolate, cookies, and Angelis’ guitar.
“I think it’s representative of something about Harvard that anybody can be granted access to both the observatory and the roof with only a two hour class,” Venook said, as he recalled sitting on the rooftop in the September air while his advisees sang along to “Wagon Wheel” by Old Crow Medicine Show.
Several students alluded to something spiritual about sitting ten stories high and gazing at the silhouettes of Annenberg and Memorial Church in the twilight.
“We went up there and prayed to the housing gods that we’d get into Adams,” Ryan E. Heffrin ’13 said, referring to housing day last year. “It definitely worked.”
Grindlay remembers seeing a space shuttle blazing across the Boston sky and the rare Transit of Venus in 2004 from the rooftop.
“It was visible in Cambridge at 6:30 in the morning, and the Science Center was literally packed with people,” Grindlay said. “Through the telescope filter you could see this black block crawling across the surface of the sun—it was something you only get to see once in a lifetime.”
WRITTEN IN THE STARS
When students take the STAHR training course, they learn many important rules: never open the dome when winds are above 25 miles per hour, do not use the telescope to look at the sun, and do not swing the telescope too forcefully. But the most important rule, STAHR Treasurer Samuel M. Meyer ’13 says, is to always, always sign the logbook before leaving the observatory.
The logbooks, stacked on a shelf that holds a robotronic “Dalek” figurine (from the science-fiction television show Dr. Who), date back to 1976.
While many messages are practical (“Some idiot left the telescope at a 135 degree angle”—1984), others are more romantic (“The line of light at darkness, moving against the moon; celestial, orblike, seasoning, wearing the grooves ... But all is not lost! Those love tossed nights SUSTAIN”—1990). Beatles quotes, sketches of Bart Simpson poking his eye on a telescope, and depictions of lunar surfaces also adorn these pages.
Flipping through the books recently, Rice said he found signatures from a genuine astronomy legend—Neil deGrasse Tyson ’80—who is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City.
Not all the entries are equally inspiring, however.
“Duuuude! Sweet. Had a lunar eclipse party with college chicks and salsa with chips!” reads a 2008 entry.
The observatory, it seems, is full of life lessons—both about everyday experiences and the bigger picture.
“Learning about the universe gives you a sense of perspective about life and what you want out of it and what everything means,” Rice said. “I think you get that not by reading books or seeing movies, but by actually going outside and watching the stars.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Thursday, The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
HARVARD HOOPS TO FACE PRINCETON AND PENN
450 – Number of wins for women’s basketball head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith after the Crimson’s victory over Cornell on January 29th.
6 – Number of combined conference wins for the top two women’s basketball teams in the Ancient Eight. Harvard (11-6, 3-0 Ivy) and Princeton (14-3, 3-0) face off on Friday night to determine which team gains sole possession of first place in the Ivy League standings.
2 – Number of top-ten lists for the Crimson that senior forward Emma Markley is now on, claiming tenth place on both the all-time rebounds list, with 580 boards, and the all-time scoring list with 1,148 career points.
55 – Number of years since the Harvard men’s basketball team went on a nine-game win streak. The Crimson (15-3, 4-0 Ivy) is on an eight-game win streak, the seventh longest in the country, as it enters Friday night’s contest against the Tigers (14-4, 2-0 Ivy).
1991 – The last year that the Harvard men began the conference season at 5-0. Going into a critical Ivy League weekend against Princeton and Penn, the Crimson hopes to pick up wins against both teams and post a 6-0 Ivy League record for the first time in school history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s quest for an Ivy League championship kicked off Tuesday afternoon with the Crimson’s first practice of the 2011 season.
After its young squad posted a fifth-place conference finish and an 8-7 overall record in 2010, Harvard has reason to be optimistic heading into the upcoming season.
But the Crimson’s road to the top of the conference will be a difficult one.
This season, Harvard is slated to go up against seven opponents ranked in Inside Lacrosse Magazine’s Women’s Top 20—No. 7 Virginia, No. 8 Penn, No. 12 Dartmouth, No. 14 Stanford, No. 17 Boston College, No. 18 Princeton, and No. 19 Johns Hopkins.
In fact, the Crimson will take on four ranked opponents in its first five matchups.
While last season’s squad went 0-4 against opponents that finished in the top 20, there is reason to believe that this year’s Harvard team will fare better.
For one, the Crimson returns 89 percent of its scoring, including its top four goal scorers—sophomores Jennifer VanderMeulen, Danielle Tetreault, and Micaela Cyr, and junior co-captain Melanie Baskind.
VanderMeulen led the pack, tallying a league-high 56 goals while finishing third in the nation in goals per game.
But this season, Harvard should add even more firepower to its offense thanks to the return of Jessica Halpern.
Halpern—the 2008 Ivy League Rookie of the Year—suffered a season-ending injury two games into the 2010 season. But Halpern is expected to be back in uniform for the Crimson’s opener at Stanford on Feb. 27.
In her first two seasons with Harvard, Halpern combined for 80 goals and 21 assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every streak must have its end, and although the Harvard men’s volleyball team started the season 2-0, it met its match last night at the Malkin Athletic Center against a hot Cal Baptist team, also riding a six-game win streak.
The Crimson (2-1, 0-0 EIVA Hay) lost three quick sets to the Lancers (8-3, 0-0 NAIA), which are ranked No. 1 in the AVCA NAIA Division, losing by the score of 25-14, 25-12, and 25-15.
“We were outplayed from point one to the last one,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “They are a really good team with a lot of size.”
Harvard started off slowly, committing several hitting errors and allowing CBU to rally to a 7-3 lead early in the first set. Coming out of a timeout, a strong service game brought the Crimson back into contention, 9-7, but as Harvard’s defense struggled, the Lancers went up, 12-8.
“We served pretty well,” Baise said, “I felt we put some pressure on their passers, but they did a good job handling it. We didn’t back it up with…offense of our own. We didn’t play defense particularly well. We need to do more than serve.”
CBU’s front row caused trouble for the Crimson offense, blocking several shots early in the set.
“They blocked pretty [well] everywhere,” junior Matt Jones said. “As a team, we didn’t pass well, so it makes it easier for them to put the block up. When the set is coming from further away from the net, they usually know where it’s going.”
The Lancers’ powerful serves broke down Harvard’s passing, leading to a 7-3 run, forcing the Crimson to call its second timeout with the score set at 19-11. CBU continued its dominance, forcing a large 23-12 lead. The Lancers capped off a dominant 25-14 set with a powerful kill by junior Levi Cabral, who finished with a game-high 10 kills.
“We couldn’t handle their serves,” Baise said. “It was simple as that. When you can’t handle serves in volleyball, you have no chance to run your offense.”
CBU started off the second set with three straight points, relying on its great defense and accurate serves to take the lead.
Despite several impressive plays by Harvard, the Lancers jumped to an 11-4 lead, using its serving power to disrupt the Crimson’s offensive rhythm.
Inconsistent passing led to hitting errors by Harvard, forcing a 15-5 deficit in the middle of the second set. Despite a late ace by the Jones, the Crimson could not find the answer to CBU’s offense, dropping the set, 25-12, and going down, 2-0, on the match.
“[We need to be] playing consistently throughout the whole match and try to not give up those big runs of four or five points,” Jones said. “The more we can minimize those, the better.”
Harvard got a solid start in the third set, leading 4-2 early. But, like in the last two sets, the Lancers’ service game stopped any Crimson momentum, and got CBU back up top, 11-7. After trading several points, the Lancers went on a three-point run followed by a second five-point run that enabled the CBU to take the game, 25-15, and, ultimately, the match.
Jones finished with five kills, and freshmen Kyle Rehkemper, Chris Gibbons, and Michael Owen racked up six, five, and three kills, respectively.
“I think our freshmen are playing with a lot of confidence,” Jones said. “Hopefully this means we will be good for quite a few years. The term ‘freshman’ is a term that’s thrown around a lot. The question is whether or not you can play volleyball at a high level, and right now those guys are doing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Road trips are a part of America’s fabric. Think of all the stories, through each generation, that take place on the road: “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” “The Grapes of Wrath,” “As I Lay Dying,” “Lolita,” “On the Road,” “The Road” (to name just a few classics). The open road has always been an outlet for America’s wanderlust, unfolding before its people as a frontier of discovery and imagination.
Of course, an hour into any trip, the road begins to lose its mystique.
When I was little, road trips meant being crammed in the back of a minivan with the other four Walsh children. Idleness eventually gave way to tickle fights, tickling escalated into violence, and violence led to Mom or Dad yelling.
“KNOCK IT OFF. I’LL PULL THIS DAMN CAR OVER.”
A mandatory ceasefire would force us to sit in tense silence until, invariably, my little sister would say she wasn’t feeling well. We’d watch her closely, using all of our psychic energy to ward off her mounting nausea, but my sister’s motion sickness was, and would remain, undefeated against our telekinesis.
“I’M GONNA THROW UP!”
“GET HER THE BUCKET!” (We always had a durable puke pail handy).
As if the splash and slop of her cascading vomit weren’t bad enough, the barfy miasma, amplified by the confines of our Honda prison, left the rest of us retching for the rest of the ride.
So road trips are not necessarily the stuff of fairy tales.  But although road woes might be common, they can be altogether avoided if the travelers are committed to enjoying each moment. Their success has nothing to do with the destination and everything to do with the company. Good times, in other words, are a function not of the road trip but of the road trippers.
Harvard men’s basketball travels to face the Killer P’s this weekend on its toughest road trip of the season. Princeton and Philadelphia have always been nightmarish destinations for the Crimson. But Harvard, irrespective of the Quakers and Tigers, has the power to determine this weekend’s success through its own collective play and mindset. If Harvard digs deep and executes, it will take the reins of the Ivy League race.
On to the picks.
HARVARD (15-3, 4-0 Ivy) at PRINCETON (14-4, 2-0 Ivy)
Given The Crimson’s preview of this weekend’s games, I won’t dwell too long here. Princeton is the slight favorite as it’s home at Jadwin Gymnasium, where the Crimson has not won since 1989. I see a close contest, decided by one or two possessions, but Harvard eking out a signature Ivy win.
Pick: Harvard 67, Princeton 64
CORNELL (4-14, 0-4 Ivy) at YALE (9-9, 2-2 Ivy)
Both Cornell and Yale went winless last weekend, but their stories could not have been more different. The Big Red skunked up Hanover, N.H., on Friday, scoring only 14 points in the first half. The next night Cornell was trounced at Lavietes, 78-57. Not much to build on there.
The Bulldogs, meanwhile, were competitive in an eight-point loss to Penn , even though they got almost nothing (just 19 points) outside of forward Greg Mangano and guard Porter Braswell. And on Saturday, Yale put a legitimate scare into the Tigers with a late 15-4 run but came up just short, 67-63.
The Bulldogs are on the upswing, and the Big Red is looking like the Ivy doormat. Take Yale.
Pick: Yale 68, Cornell 60
DARTMOUTH (5-13, 1-3 Ivy) at PENN (8-8, 2-0 Ivy)
Back in high school, my school’s college counselors classified the odds of getting into different colleges as “Likely,” “Maybe,” “Reach,” and “Double Reach.” Last week, Penn had a pair of “Maybe” matchups in Yale and Brown and took both down, thanks in large part to co-Ivy Player of the Week Jack Eggleston.
The forward went for 13 points and eight rebounds in the Quakers’ win over the Bulldogs, and then redoubled his efforts to the tune of 25 points and 12 rebounds in a two-point, overtime, come-from-behind victory against Brown.
Dartmouth had its own success last weekend. The Big Green tagged Cornell in their game of “Who’s the Worst Ivy Team?” You’re “It” Cornell.
Penn should win fairly easily.
Pick: Penn 65, Dartmouth 55
COLUMBIA (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) at BROWN (7-11, 0-4 Ivy)
Brown is sitting beside the Big Red in the cellar of the Ivy League right now, but the Bears have also had the toughest road so far. Saturday’s heartbreaking loss at the Palestra came without Brown’s leading scorer, Peter Sullivan, who suffered a shoulder injury the night before. The Bears are certainly capable of rallying and notching a win tonight.
But I liked what I saw out of Columbia last weekend. Guards Noruwa Agho and Brian Barbour might be the most deadly backcourt duo in the conference, as each player is totally capable of carrying an offense (though perhaps at the cost of freezing out their teammates). Between Mark Cisco and Asenso Ampim, the Lions also have some presence down low. They are the smart choice tonight.
Pick: Columbia 72, Brown 68
DARTMOUTH at PRINCETON
Princeton will win in a landslide. Lock of the week. Book it.
Pick: Princeton 72, Dartmouth 58
COLUMBIA at YALE
Assuming they win tonight, the Bulldogs will be sitting at 3-2. Either Harvard or Princeton will be undefeated heading into tomorrow and have a good chance at sweeping the weekend. This means that if Yale wants to stay in the race, it must beat the Lions.
Columbia, too, needs at least a split this weekend. Between the Bears and the Bulldogs, it has a good shot, but the Lions are still an unproven squad. Their three league wins are against the two worst Ivies. Because this game will likely mean more to Yale and because the Elis are on their home court, I’ll take the Bulldogs.
Pick: Yale 67, Columbia 65
CORNELL at BROWN
The good news is that one team will get its first league win. The bad news is that this game is irrelevant. Only degenerate gamblers, players’ families, and delusional Cornell fans will follow this game. I think Brown wins the pillow fight.
Pick: Brown 70, Cornell 65
HARVARD at PENN
Tomorrow will be the first time I visit the Palestra, and I could not be more excited. I feel like a kid visiting Fenway. I’m definitely going to change my prof pic to a glamour shot with the Palestra’s plaque: “To win the game is great. To play the game is greater. But to love the game is the greatest of all.”
Harvard will settle for great if that means beating Penn. I’ll take the road trippers.
Pick: Harvard 72, Penn 66
PENN at PRINCETON
In another quirk in an already quirky league schedule, the Tigers and the Quakers face off on Tuesday night. These two traditional rivals have not finished in the top half of the league together since 2006. With both teams talented and off to a good start, this game is a renewal of sorts to the days when the Killer Ps ruled the league.  I see a competitive game, but Princeton holding serve on its home court.
Pick: Princeton 68, Penn 60
RECORD LAST WEEK: 6-2 (To date: 6-2)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There will be a lot at stake when the Harvard men’s basketball team attempts to pick up a couple of W’s against the Killer P’s this weekend.
Doing so would give the Crimson (15-3, 4-0 Ivy) its best conference start in history, garner its longest winning streak since 1946, and, most importantly, go a long way towards helping Harvard earn its first-ever Ivy League title.
But earning two road victories against Princeton (14-4, 3-0) and Penn (8-8, 3-0) will be no easy task. The Crimson is a combined 69-252 all-time against the two teams and has not swept the pair on the road since 1984.
But that can all change this weekend when, for the second straight year, Harvard is faced with an Ancient Eight road game in which it can prove that it’s not just an Ivy contender, but the frontrunner.
Last season, the Crimson–then 14-3 overall–had that opportunity, when it put its undefeated conference record on the line against an also-unscathed Cornell team at Newman Arena. But with the pressure on, Harvard struggled to keep its composure early and ended up being embarrassed by the Big Red, 86-50, making Crimson fans realize that their team was not yet ready to take the next step towards a conference title.
This year, with Cornell out of the picture after losing its three stars and coach, the Tigers emerged as the preseason No. 1, and have not disappointed to date.
Princeton has wins against respectable nonconference foes like Rutgers, Bucknell, and Tulsa–as well as a six-point loss to then-No. 19 UCF–on its resume, and is coming off a sweep of Brown and Yale last weekend.
“We know what Princeton’s going to bring to the table,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “They’ve got a lot of talented guys and tough system to play against, but we’re also playing well.”
Against the Tigers tonight, in a game that will be broadcast on ESPNU at 7 p.m., Harvard has another chance to prove that it is the team to beat in the Ancient Eight. But to win, the Crimson defense will have to contain a balanced Tiger attack in which four players (sophomore Ian Hummer, senior Kareem Maddox, junior Doug Davis, and senior Dan Mavraides) average in between 13.7 and 13.3 points per game, without anyone eclipsing that mark.
“We have to play them inside-out,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They have good balance.”
For the Crimson to pull out the victory, it will likely need to win the front-court battle. Amaker said sophomore Kyle Casey–coming off an Ivy co-Player of the Week honor after averaging 16.5 points and 9.5 rebounds in wins versus Columbia and Cornell–will likely be on Maddox, who averaged a double-double of 16 points and 10.5 rebounds last weekend. Junior co-captain Keith Wright will need to contain Hummer, who has taken big strides in his second year. Maddox and Hummer lead the team with 6.9 and 6.4 rebounds per game respectively, and Amaker stressed the necessity of his post players staying out of foul trouble against the pair.
“[Maddox and Hummer] are just terrors around the goal, and their post-up offensive production around the goal has been terrific,” Amaker said. “It’s always been that when we show up, [Maddox] plays his best.”
In the backcourt, Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry–the team’s best perimeter defender–will likely be asked to contain Davis. Mavraides’ sharpshooting ability will need to be matched by a strong game from long distance by sophomore Christian Webster and/or freshman Laurent Rivard, who are second and third on the team in scoring with 13.6 and 11.8 points per game, respectively.
“We need to make sure we’re not giving Mavraides anything easy, any open looks.” Amaker said. “Hopefully we can defend them the way we normally defend.”
Last season, the Tigers swept the Crimson and finished a game ahead of Harvard for second in the Ivy standings. In the first matchup, at Lavietes Pavilion, Princeton withstood a ferocious rally by the Crimson–who were down 14 with 4:55 to go–holding on to win when Harvard’s Jeremy Lin ’10 missed a game-tying three at the buzzer. In the second meeting, at Jadwin Gymnasium, the Tigers again won by three in a contest that came down to the wire.
But last year, Wright–who leads the team with 14.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game–missed the first contest and was limited to 20 minutes in the second with injury. Having its best low-post threat back against the Tigers’ big men could be the difference this time around.
“[Keith’s] the centerpiece of our offense,” McNally said. “He’s [also] a rock-solid force defensively, and he rebounds the ball well, so I think [having him healthy this year] is going to be huge.”
It is clear that the two squads have been the best the Ivy has to offer this season, with Harvard 50th and Princeton 67th in national RPI as of Wednesday. The Crimson and the Tigers are 1-2 in the conference in scoring defense and scoring margin, respectively, while Princeton is first and Harvard second in field-goal and three-point percentage.
“We need to get a tempo we’re comfortable with,” Amaker said. “It’s been lower scoring games [versus Princeton in the past]. I think it’s important that the tempo moves a little faster...which is easier said than done with way they play.”
Tomorrow evening, the Crimson travels to Philadelphia, where it will take on the Quakers in the historic Palestra. Penn played an extremely tough nonconference schedule and is also undefeated in conference play this season, but it has blemishes against 4-18 Manhattan and 4-19 Marist on its resume.
The Quakers are led by guard Zack Rosen, who finished first in the conference in scoring last season with 17.7 points per game, but is down to 15.5 this year in a more balanced offense.
“It’s got to always start with Rosen, how crafty he is with ball-screens” Amaker said. “I think that’s going to be a concern of ours, defending him off the bounce.”
Wright will have a tough matchup once again on Saturday with Penn forward Jack Eggleston, who averages 13.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, tied with Wright for second in the conference.
On the wings, the Quakers feature freshman Miles Cartwright–who at 11.6 points per contest is Rivard’s main competition for Ivy Rookie of the Year–and the talented but oft-injured senior Tyler Bernadini, who is averaging 11.7 points.
Harvard swept Penn last season, but with the addition of Cartwright and a healthy Bernadini, the Quakers will be a tough matchup for the second game of a road-road doubleheader for the Crimson.
If Harvard is able to emerge as the last undefeated team standing, it will control its own destiny for its first tournament berth since 1946, with the toughest part of its schedule behind it.
“Those two programs are synonymous with Ivy league basketball,” Amaker said. “I think now with Princeton being the favorite in our league this year, for us to have a chance to go on the road, play them first, Penn the next night, I know our kids will be ready to play.”

Along with the heaps of snow, this winter has brought the 50th anniversary of ECAC Hockey.
And, joining in the celebrations after being named one of the top-50 players in league history is former Olympian and Harvard athlete Lane MacDonald ’88-’89.
The seventh installment of the list made its debut this past Wednesday, and MacDonald made the cut from a pool of no fewer than 145 nominees. His achievement marks the fourth time a Crimson player has nabbed a spot on the list, after Mark Fusco ’83, Joe Cavanagh ’71, and Gene Kinasewich ’64.
During his years donning a Harvard jersey, MacDonald led his squad to a 31-1 record and an NCAA title—the first in Crimson Athletics history. He also racked up numerous accolades, including the Bingham Award (awarded to one Harvard senior male), the Hobey Baker Award (for the honor of college hockey’s top player), and the title of Beanpot MVP, among numerous others.
Outside the college circuit, MacDonald made waves on the U.S. National Team and the Olympic Team in 1988, for which he took a year off from school.
Now, MacDonald sits atop the Crimson leader board for all-time scorers with 111 goals, and he ranks second all-time in points with 225.
Hopefully, the exciting news will breathe some fresh inspiration into the men’s hockey program, which is 1-8 in its last nine games. The crew will need it for its next game against No. 3 Yale—the Bulldogs have only four losses, which match the number of wins for Harvard this season.

It's time for the Weekend Preview! Here's a rundown of the action:
The men and women’s basketball teams face off against Princeton and Penn, with the women taking on the Tigers and the Quakers at home while the men are on the road. The women play at the Lavietes Pavilion tonight and tomorrow night at 7 p.m. Both Harvard and Princeton are 3-0 in the Ivy League and will battle for first place in the conference, while Penn heads into the weekend with a 1-2 conference record.
The men’s basketball team has clearly looked like a contender for the top spot of the Ivy League. The men are 15-3 for the season, including a current eight-game win streak, and have bested their conference rivals in all four Ivy contests. However, the Tigers have taken down the Crimson in the teams’ last four meetings, which will prove a challenge for Harvard to maintain its streak. The last time the Crimson faced off against the Quakers, Harvard earned an 80-66 victory.
The women’s ice hockey squad also competes against Princeton, this time at home tonight at 7 p.m. The Crimson has defeated the Tigers in nine of the last 15 matchups. The team has another home match against Quinnipiac tomorrow afternoon at 4 p.m. Harvard has the upper hand in that matchup with a 9-2-0 overall record.
The men’s hockey squad is traveling to play another conference rival this weekend: Yale. The two teams face off tonight at 7 p.m. The Crimson was on a seven-game losing streak heading into last weekend, but broke out of the slump with a 6-2 win over Colgate. Harvard doesn’t hold a great record against other Ivy League opponents this campaign, going 0-6.
The men’s tennis team takes on Indiana this evening at 5 p.m. and William & Mary and Boston University on Sunday. Last weekend, the Crimson kicked off its dual action, splitting its two opening contests against Northwestern and Purdue. Last season, Indiana defeated Harvard, 6-1.
The women’s tennis team also has a home match this weekend against Boston College tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. The squad started off with an opening victory against Boston University, but lost its next two matchups to Northwestern and Boise St., 5-0 and 4-3, respectively. Harvard has beaten Boston College for the last two years and looks to extend the streak even further.
The women’s water polo team kicks off action this weekend with three matches. The Crimson takes on Boston College, Iona, and Villanova, all on Saturday throughout the day. The last meeting between Harvard and Boston College came in 2000, an encounter the Crimson won, 14-5. Harvard has never lost to Iona and has beaten Villanova the last nine matchups.
The men and women’s squash teams travel to Penn and Princeton this weekend to take on the Quakers and the Tigers. The men are currently 6-2, a record which includes a three-game win streak and a 2-1 conference record. Princeton is 6-1 for the season and Penn holds a 4-5 record. The women’s squad also has six wins for the season, but has not dropped a match so far and has gained the win 9-0 every time. Last year, the women defeated Penn, 8-1, and Princeton by a score of 6-3.
Last but certainly not least, the track and field teams heads into the weekend for the Battle of Beantown. Both teams are hoping to defend their titles from last year. The wrestling team also has matchups against Princeton and Penn, tomorrow at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Finally, the skiing team heads to Vermont for the University of Vermont Carnival.

The freshman intramural program got a makeover recently.
Alana G. Pradhan '13 redesigned the website for freshman intramurals, which according to Daniel L. Liss '11, who coordinates the inter-dormitory sports program for the Freshman Dean's Office, was many years out of date.
"We're hoping that next year, it will make more active participants," Liss said.
The website allows freshmen to register a team, see game schedules, and check updated standings.
