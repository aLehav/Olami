After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I realize it may seem silly for me, only four years out of college, to write advice to seniors. I certainly have not accomplished anything great, had a transformational experience, or stumbled upon some rare discovery that I am burning to share with you. But I did spend four years on a much-desired traditional path and have walked away with a few new impressions and reactions I did not have upon graduation.
I don’t regret my post-college experience of working at McKinsey & Company and then in private equity. The two greatest advantages of such a path are the people you will meet and the doors that will be open to you. But the way I view what I want going forward has changed since graduation, and I would love to share it with you.
The first realization that occurred to me four years out of college is that a career is not simply a path to get through as quickly as possible in order to reach some end result of success. Rather, a career is more an exploration of an individual rather than an expression of an individual. Finding the right next job is not necessarily about where can I succeed the most or signal my value the most; it is about where can I learn the most about myself. The content on the job is ever-changing, and frankly, like school, you will forget most of it. More importantly, you will walk away from each job knowing more about what interests you and what excites you. If I had been told as a senior in college that a job would be a mechanism for self-discovery, I would have probably responded, “you are so ending up in law school, dude.”
The second key lesson is the difference between significance and success. Success is very easy to signal: wealth, influence on others, prestige. Coming out of college, I had been successful in gaining admission to an elite school, and I wanted to be successful in getting prestigious jobs and creating wealth—not for a selfish reason, but to validate all those who had supported me, believed in me, and had confidence in my success more than I did.
Four years later, I realize that success is very fleeting, especially in the business and political worlds. Significance, or making an impact through what you do, is not. I think there are successful people in the finance world that are hugely significant by the way they choose to spend their wealth, but there are also many non-successful people in areas such as local politics that, in the day-to-day, have a greater significance on the lives of those around them. For a student, it can be hard to understand how success can be won and lost since your value is largely understood through your perceived potential. Grasping the importance and value of making a lasting impact can be difficult. While there is some correlation between success and significance, I believe one should target the latter, and if the former accompanies it, see it as an added benefit. Four years ago, I would have thought the opposite.
All the clichés are true! Enjoy life, make mistakes, and donate to the College! But now is not a bad time to be honest with yourself about what motivates and excites you and how can you make a lasting impact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the lights and in front of over 2,500 fans the Harvard men’s soccer team opened its 2011 season with a 1-0 victory over Northeastern. After a promising summer tour in South Korea and an impressive accumulation of talent, the Crimson seemed poised to realize the high expectations from the previous season, when they occupied a spot in the Top 25.
Not so fast.
Harvard (2-12-3, 0-6-1 Ivy) would only win one more game, a home match against UMass, en route to a dead last finish in the Ivy League.
“Generally, the season was very disappointing,” co-captain Tim Linden says. “We had a lot of talent but weren’t able to put it together and get the results we wanted. We have a talented squad with a lot of guys who can play and make things happen, but it’s a matter of them meshing as a team, and the program really coming together and being on the same page.”
A 2-0 loss against No. 25 St. Johns in the second match of the campaign marked the first of eight games in which the Crimson offense was shut out. In total, Harvard would only score 14 goals in 17 games. Sophomore defender Ross Friedman, who was named All-Ivy honorable mention, wound up leading the team in scoring by virtue of his six assists.
“In the beginning of the year we really struggled with scoring,” Friedman says. “Then we kind of switched things up a bit offensively, and we were scoring more but also conceding more. We really struggled to find an identity during the fall—if we changed things up top it would weaken our defense, and vice versa.”
Nine of the 14 goals came in the last four games of the year. Three of those games went to double overtime, resulting in two ties and a devastating 3-2 loss to Penn. After tying the game in the last minute of regulation on a Friedman free-kick to freshman Tim Schmoll, the Crimson conceded in the 102nd minute to end its fall season.
After the victory over UMass, senior goalkeeper Austin Harms sat at 18 career shutouts, one away from the program record. With 13 matches left on the schedule, the chances of Harms setting the record looked good. Unfortunately for him, Harvard didn’t manage another shutout the rest of the way.
“That was frustrating for him, getting so many shutouts early in his career and then not being able to break that record at the end,” Friedman says. “Definitely frustrating in the sense that individually you know he wanted to have that record. It was tough at the time because the whole team was pulling for him, but we also couldn’t focus on it because there were other things to worry about. I think he did a good job of not making it a big deal as a personal record and being a good team player, wanting what’s best for the team.”
Harms leaves the Crimson fifth all-time with 190 saves.
Despite the disappointing fall season, the spring netted some positive results for Harvard. The Crimson maintained a tradition started last year, taking on the Haitian national team in Harvard Stadium on April 22, while also adding a friendly against the Cape Verde All-Stars that same weekend. Harvard lost to the Cape Verdeans on penalty kicks, 7-6, after drawing 1-1 in regulation.  But against the Haitians, the Crimson was victorious, 1-0, off an 86th minute goal from freshman Hiroki Kobayashi.
“The spring season has been a lot of the same stuff that we did last spring in terms of conditioning and strengthening,” Friedman says. “There’s no question that everyone has made gains physically—40 [yard] times, squats, all of them are [better] across the board, and that’s showed in our games. Against the Cape Verde team those guys were all bigger, faster, stronger than us, and we still held our own. Then we played the Haitian national team, and I really credit that victory to our conditioning and the preparation that we had for those two games. Hopefully, that can translate to next fall.”
Joining Friedman and Schmoll in returning next season will be the rest of the top-six point getters—juniors Brian Rogers and co-captain Scott Prozeller and sophomores Obiajalu “AJ” Agha and Connor McCarthy. Despite the poor results of 2011, Harvard once again has reason for optimism heading into the summer.
“Throughout it all, they were definitely a great group of guys and a great support system to have here,” Linden says. “You learn a lot about yourself and your teammates, and that’s what it’s all about—having a positive experience that you’ll never forget. I want only the best for these guys moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third time in four years, the whistle signaling the end of the Harvard women’s soccer team’s regular season also meant that it was time to hoist up some hardware.
As the Crimson defeated Columbia, 1-0, it completed a season that consisted of the team’s best overall record since the 1999 fall campaign.
“It was really, really surreal,” sophomore Peyton Johnson says. “I wasn’t expecting it to feel quite as unbelievable as it did. I’ll never forget lifting that trophy and screaming. It was something special.”
The game’s most climactic moment occurred in only the 21st minute of the opening period, when freshman Lauren Urke knocked in a shot past Lions goalkeeper Lillian Klein. The goal, Urke’s second of the season, would be the only scratch on the scoreboard that day, and Harvard (12-5-1, 6-0-1 Ivy) took the low-scoring match.
“Trying to get the outside-back involved more offensively was something that we had been stressing all season,” explains co-captain Melanie Baskind regarding Urke’s goal. “And it’s always nice to see a freshman step up, especially a defender. You just get that much more excited, rally around her that much more.”
It was a big day all around for rookies as Urke’s classmate, Bethany Kanten, played all 90 minutes in goal, saving her 39th and 40th shots on goal of the year in order to secure sole possession of the Ancient Eight title.
Despite the fact that the Columbia match was on the Lions’ turf, the Crimson’s success this season almost exclusively occurred on its home territory of Soldiers Field. Harvard went 10-1 within familiar Cambridge while putting up a 2-4-1 record when it was the visiting team.
The first five games of the year were a sample of this dual-play. After losing the season-opener at Long Island, 2-1, the Crimson responded in the next two weekends by winning three consecutive games on its home field against Elon, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Against each of the first two opponents, Harvard scored goals within the last three minutes of the match to break 1-1 ties and keep its early-season momentum alive. In its next away game, the Crimson fell victim to the thriving offense of Boston University and lost, 3-0.
Two days following its defeat at the hands of the Terriers, Harvard suffered its only home loss of the season. This time the opponent was Hofstra and in the Crimson’s highest-scoring game of the season, four goals proved insufficient as the Spirit tallied five and earned the W.
After one more loss, a double-overtime match that lasted two hours and 20 minutes, against Rhode Island, Harvard upped its play and, for the next 49 days, went without a single loss, recording one tie and nine wins.
“[Right before the Rhode Island match] we had a big team meeting,” Baskind says. “We just took a moment to collect ourselves, remind ourselves of what was going to make us successful. From that point on we just rallied around each other and just played our best soccer. That was definitely the turning point for us.”
The spearheads of this streak for the Crimson were none other than Baskind, who tallied six goals and four assists in this ten game period, and Johnson.
On Sept. 23 against Penn, Baskind sunk two shots, both off assists from Johnson, into the back of the net. Two days later, the offensive firepower continued as the team dropped New Hampshire, 4-1, in a game in which Baskind nabbed two assists. In the first game of the next weekend’s doubleheader against Yale, it took a 93rd minute penalty kick from Johnson to attain the overtime victory for Harvard.
After a non-league victory over Fairfax, the Crimson turned back to the Ancient Eight for its meeting with Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. Despite a goal and assist from junior Aisha Price and five saves from Kanten, Harvard was unable to break the 2-2 tie following a late Big Red goal in the 88th minute.
The next match-up featured another non-Ivy opponent, Siena, who was downed in a quick fashion by the Crimson. But Brown was not so easy to dismiss. It took two goals within a five-minute span from Baskind and freshman Mai Le to earn a come-from-behind win over the Bears.
Against Princeton, a week later, the duo of Baskind and Le once again proved detrimental to Harvard’s counterparts as the two scored back-to-back goals once more to take a decisive lead and ultimately, the match.
In the Crimson’s game against Dartmouth, though, it was all about Johnson. The score was tied at the 89:50 mark, 1-1, when the referee’s whistle blew, calling a foul on the Big Green. Seconds later, the ball was in the back of the net as Johnson drilled a free kick from 20 yards away only moments before regulation ended. With that shot and that win, Harvard clinched at least a partial share of the Ivy Championship and a bid to the NCAA tournament. It would be Johnson’s fourth and final goal of the season.
“I think for 15 minutes straight afterwards I couldn’t say any words, I just screamed. Anybody would say my name, and I would just yell,” Johnson says. “We were all numb, I put on my jacket afterwards, and I couldn’t feel it on my arms. We were just dancing in the locker room, numb and pink-skinned. I’ll never forget that. That was really just this season in a moment for me.”
Following Urke’s goal in the dramatic regular season finale against Columbia, the Crimson’s next destination was the first round of the NCAA tournament against Boston University, a team that they had lost to earlier in the season. But that is where Harvard’s journey would end in 2011 as the offensive prowess of the Terriers dominated and, once again, was able to give the team a 3-0 victory over the Crimson.
Baskind was unanimously named Ivy League Player of the Year and earned All-Mid-Atlantic honors, while Johnson and co-captain Lindsey Kowal were elected onto the All-Ivy First Team. Senior Becca Millock and freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby were named to the second team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This season, the Harvard men’s track and field team saved its best performance for last.
Behind stellar outings from its throwers and freshman competitors, the Crimson finished in third place at the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships—a feat that it had not accomplished since 2002.
“We really came together as a team,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky says. “There were a number of events that didn’t go our way, but the way that we bounced back and were able to rally and compete said a lot about our character and our resolve. That, to me, was the most exciting part of this track season.”
But the Crimson did not always enjoy the kind of success that it had at outdoor Heps.
Instead, the squad spent much of the indoor season struggling to find its identity. In spite of strong outings from the squad’s most competitive athletes, Harvard was unable to put together a complete team effort to reach its collective potential.
“I think we felt that there was something missing [in the indoor season],” Saretsky says. “There was something that we were looking to see.”
Two months and 15 tune-up events after Harvard finished in fourth place at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships, the squad tallied 92.75 points at outdoor Heps to earn third place. Though it finished only one spot higher than at indoor Heps, the Crimson was able to separate itself by over 20 points from fourth-place Brown to cap off the outdoor season.
The team’s throwers were dominant at the outdoor Heps as they had been all season long. Harvard racked up a combined 42 points in the javelin, hammer throw, shot put, and discus.
Freshmen throwers Dean Sullivan and Ben Glauser contributed 26 points to the Crimson’s total. Sullivan, who trained with captain javelin thrower Nick Farnsworth throughout the season, won the Ivy championship with a mark of 63.68 meters.
“We would constantly push each other and push ourselves at practice,” Sullivan says of training with Farnsworth. “I think that all culminated at Heps. Everything just went well for us.”
Sullivan is just one of Harvard’s group of first-years that was expected to make key contributions this season. The Crimson men boasted a recruiting class that was ranked fifth in the nation—the best in Ancient Eight history—by Track and Field News.
On the track, rookie Jarvis Harris made some noise early in the year by breaking the school record in the 60-meter hurdles. At the Battle of Beantown, which was held at Gordon Indoor Track, Harris completed the race in 8.11 seconds to top an 11-year-old record.
And though Harris’ prowess earned him a spot in the record books, junior pole vaulter Nico Weiler took history-making to a new level this season.
Weiler, the school’s record holder in the pole vault (5.38 meters), was a force for Harvard in 2011-12. Except at the outdoor Heps—where in a shocking disappointment he failed to clear a single jump—Weiler was the top collegiate finisher at each of the Crimson’s outdoor meets, even when matching up against vaulters from some of the best track and field programs in the country. At every regular-season outdoor meet, Weiler topped the clearance made by Stephen Brannon ’95 (5.13 meters), who stands at No. 2 in Harvard history.
On the women’s side, the Crimson was unable to put together a performance akin to the men’s at outdoor Heps. The Harvard women also finished in fourth place at the indoor championships, but faltered at the outdoor meet,  where they finished in sixth with 71 team points.
Co-captain Meghan Looney excelled for the Crimson during the indoor season in the 800-meter run. Looney captured the individual league title in the event with a time of 2:10.35.
In the outdoor season, Looney joined freshman Erika Veidis and sophomores Alaina Murphy and Natalia Paine on the 4x800 meter relay team. At the largest meet on Harvard’s schedule, the Penn Relays, the team rose to the occasion and finished in first place, crossing the finish line in 8:53.95.
In spite of the women’s finish to the season, Saretsky remains optimistic for the future of the Harvard track and field program.
“We can compete with the best programs in the league,” Saretsky says. “And if we can do that, we can also be competitive at the national level.... The potential that we have on this team is ready to be turned into reality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is all about the numbers. Number one school in the country with 6,400 undergrads, 3,500 courses, three million volumes in Widener, 12 undergraduate houses, and 41 Division I sports teams. One basketball NCAA tournament run, two Winklevii, three women’s soccer Ivy League championships in the past four years, and a handful of 2012 Olympians.
But despite what the College emphasizes, Harvard and Harvard athletics are more than just numbers.
There are two moments that have defined my experience at Harvard—one as an athlete and one as a member of the Crimson sports board.
Last year at this time, I sat where I’m sitting now, on the dock at Red Top in New London, Conn., preparing for the Harvard-Yale regatta, the oldest intercollegiate competition in the United States. I was coxing the combination eight, a mix of third varsity and second freshman guys, for the second year in a row, and we were excited to face a respectable Yale boat. But as has become the norm for Harvard combis, we managed to come back from an eight-seat deficit, beating the Elis by 12 seconds. While it was an amazing feeling to pass the infamous “H” painted boulder at the finish line well ahead of Yale, what felt even better was the support our teammates showed. Even though we weren’t the top boat, and even though our win meant little in the big scheme of things, to win with those eight guys was by far the greatest experience because they were all-around great guys who earned the chance to sit in the spotlight for a moment.
This year began with my 21st birthday, which I celebrated at The Crimson. Every season, The Crimson produces a supplement dedicated to one of the major sports at Harvard. This fall, the basketball supplement fell on my birthday of legality. While I wasn’t ridiculously giddy to celebrate my 21st in a room full of grammatically correct individuals, it turned out to be a blast. People I didn’t even know wished me happy birthday, and after being kidnapped by friends to get my first legal drink, my Crimson brethren surprised me by eating all of my crab rangoons. And by letting me joyfully sleep throughout the entire production process. And by potentially letting me win in Super Smash Bros. The night was my Harvard career in a nutshell: chaotic and exciting, with lots of work and a hell of a lot of fun and friends.
During both of these experiences I came to realize that I will not in fact remember how many books Harvard owns, or even the papers that I wrote in class. What I will remember are my teammates, housemates, and the writers at The Crimson. It’s the people here that make being an athlete and all-around student at Harvard so much fun, and what makes covering Harvard athletics an honor.
Harvard is Harvard because of those who walk in its hallowed halls—or at least on its linoleum floors. It’s not just the nationally-recognized piano player in your house but also the walk-on skier from Montana sitting across from you in the dining hall that matters. And the prestige, exemplary performance, positive attitude, creativity (shout out to baseball), and dose of humility that the University holds so dear are just amplified in Harvard athletics.
Take for instance Jenna Gregoire. In one year, she has won two Ivy League championships on two different Division I squads: first with the swimming team before turning her attention to rowing and winning Radcliffe’s first Ivy League title since 2003. But when you meet Jenna, you wouldn’t know it.
She is just one of a handful of athletes and students that I have had the chance to meet and who I will remember after I graduate. While I have neither the space nor time to honor them all, there are some who have requested and/or deserve a shoutout:
To the rowers of all genders and sizes, congratulations on four years of great racing and sometimes great skits. For all of the old men 3v, including my match12 wannabe crush David Paresky, thank you for some very interesting and amusing times. Catdaddy forever. To the savages of the senior class, you are all legends. I will truly miss you all, including you...Sam.
To my Crimson friends, I’m going to miss falling asleep on the couch, the Sportstalk thread, and Scott Sherman’s always pleasant and loving remarks. To my co-seniors Dennis, Campos, and C, thank you for four years of amusement and for all of your hard work. You guys were the real reason why a Sports section showed up in The Crimson everyday. Particularly to Campos, my partner in crime for two sports beats and five quality stories, Sopos will be missed.
But most importantly, I want to thank the 41 Harvard sports teams. Thank you to the women’s basketball, women’s water polo, men’s squash, softball, and swimming/diving teams for being good sports as I covered your wins and losses over the last four seasons. Special shout out to the women’s soccer team and Coach Ray Leone. Now that I no longer have to be unbiased, it’s been a pleasure covering your Ivy League championships. Coach, I apologize on behalf of Campos and myself for trying to impress you with our ball skills after every. single. game. We still think you should have put us in.
Ending my Crimson career with 89 stories and having watched almost every team go through the sweat and work that defines Division I athletics, I graduate not only with a Harvard degree but with a million memories and friends as well. And those are the numbers that really matter.

After 23 wins, three losses, and three different titles, the Harvard men’s tennis team had completed its best regular season in recent memory. The Crimson went 23-3 and 6-1 within league play, the latter mark earning it the Ivy title for the first time since 2008.
Harvard’s freshman class helped it emerge as a dominant force in Ivy League play. With four out of the six starting singles players in their first year on the squad, its effect was immediate and sustained throughout the season.
For both the freshmen and the upperclassmen, the name of the game this year was consistency, as both its singles and its doubles play boasted high winning percentages—.667 and .672, respectively.
Within singles play, the rookies reigned. Other than senior Jonathan Pearlman on court No. 1 and sophomore Christo Schultz, who spent his time flipping between courts No. 2 and 3, the rookies dominated the courts and the wins. In the dual season, freshmen Denis Nguyen, Shaun Chaudhuri, Alex Steinroeder, and Henry Steer played 88 combined singles matches for the team and won 69 of them.
In doubles, there were two consistent lineups for the team: co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster as well as Nguyen and junior Andy Nguyen. The former of the pairs went 22-10  on the year whereas the latter achieved a 25-9 record.
“Doubles play was definitely a very important part of our success,” Felton says. “I think we worked on our doubles more than other teams, and we also have some really great doubles coaching. That really gave us an advantage in all our matches.”
After breezing through its first three matches of the dual season, the Crimson’s first challenge came against Vanderbilt. It took freshman Nguyen saving five match points, taking the lead, and ultimately winning his individual match to seal the day’s victory.
“It showed me that the match is never over till it’s over,” Nguyen says. “You always have to keep fighting no matter what the situation is. It gave us as a team, as well as myself, individually, confidence that as long as we give it our best, anything is possible.”
After a rough next day at Indiana, where the team lost, 5-2, it was smooth sailing for Harvard until its second conference matchup. During that span of time, the Crimson defeated 13 straight opponents, including Virginia Tech, Boston University, and Butler. The team handily won the ECAC championship, as well, by defeating Brown, 4-1, in the finals.
After ECACs, Harvard traveled west to participate in the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic, in which it pulled off the stunning upset by not only making it to the final round but also defeating the University of San Diego, a team then-ranked 16th in the nation, 4-3.
The Crimson won four games in a row following the competition and seemed to have found its stride entering Ivy play.
Columbia, though, stopped the streak. In a surprising 5-2 loss to the Lions, only Nguyen managed to put a point on the board for the Harvard singles.
“I think the Columbia game could’ve been a result of people wanting to keep our almost-perfect season going,” Steinroeder says. “We were a little tight. Instead of going out and trying to beat our opponent, we were just trying not to lose.”
The setback did not last long. The Crimson breezed past Penn, Princeton, Yale, and Brown, with the last of those clinching at least a share of the Ivy title. Those victories set the scene for the drama of the next match, played against Dartmouth, in which a Harvard win would give the Crimson an outright title while a loss would lead to a share  of first place with Columbia and the Big Green.
Thanks to a performance from Nguyen in which he came back from a 1-0 deficit and, in three long, dramatic sets broke the three-all stalemate between the two teams, the Crimson was able to take sole possession of the Ivy title.
“A theme of our season is that although we’ve been winning so many of our matches, barely any of those victories have come easy,” Felton says. “We’ve had to battle really hard for almost every win. We knew that we had to be tougher, physically and mentally, than whoever we play. And because of that, every time we stepped on the court, we were such a difficult team to beat.”
Three players earned league honors for Harvard: Pearlman was named to the All-Ivy First Team while freshman Nguyen was placed on the second team. The doubles pair of Felton and MacMaster was placed on the All-Ivy doubles team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 4, Jeremy Shu-How Lin stepped onto the floor of Madison Square Garden. It wasn’t his first time—he had been claimed by the New York Knicks off waivers on Dec. 27, 2011 after stints on the Golden State Warriors, the Houston Rockets, and in the NBA Development League. But this time was different; this time was special.
Not only had the the Knicks lost 11 of their last 13 games, they had an injury-depleted roster and limited options at the point guard position. Lin started the game against the New Jersey Nets relatively quietly, tallying just a rebound and an assist in the first quarter. But as the second quarter started, Lin found his rhythm, dishing out three assists and scoring three baskets of his own to bring the Knicks within two points heading into halftime.
The Madison Square crowd, sensing something special, cheered on Lin as he finished with a final stat line of 25 points on 10-of-19 shooting, seven assists, five rebounds, and two steals in a 99-92 win.
Over the next 11 games with Knicks superstars Amar’e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony spending time on the bench with injuries, Lin led the Knicks on a seven-game winning streak and a 9-2 record, all while averaging 23.9 points and 9.1 assists. It was official, “Linsanity” had hit the Big Apple and captivated millions worldwide.
Almost overnight, stores were invaded and overwhelmed by fans that wanted to get their hands on any and all kinds of Lin-related paraphernalia.
The Palo Alto, Calif. native was added to the Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend by popular demand and received all sorts of media attention including a selection to Time Magazine’s 100 “Most Influential People in the World.”
The internet boomed with Jeremy Lin puns and fans all around the world debated how long Linsanity could last.
And then, just as quickly and unexpectedly as Lin had become a global phenomenon, he disappeared.
On March 24, Lin reported that he had a sore knee after a game against the Detroit Pistons, and on March 31, the Knicks announced that Lin had chosen to have knee surgery for a meniscus tear and would miss the rest of the season.
“It’s just so funny how since he got hurt, how quickly people forget what he accomplished this year,” says Lin’s high school coach Peter Diepenbrock. “I’m looking forward to him basically showing everyone that it wasn’t just a two-month deal.”
Although Lin’s season is over, he has made a significant impact in New York, at Harvard, around the Ivy League, and around the world because of his multi-dimensional appeal.
“Jeremy has so many layers to him,” says Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker. “You peel back one, and there’s another. There are so many wonderful stories about who he is.”
LASTING IMPACT
One of the many layers to Lin’s story is his association with Harvard, both the basketball program and the University as a whole.
Lin arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2006 as a 6’3” point guard from Palo Alto High School. While Lin’s first year at Harvard passed without event, by the time he was a sophomore, he quickly refined his game. And, by the end of his sophomore campaign, hadaveraged 12.6 points and was named to the All-Ivy Second Team.
“He did great things for us here, but he didn’t just drop out of the sky; I know that’s how most people view it,” Amaker says. “From day one, he has had a tremendous impact from how he’s conducted himself, how hard he’s worked, and certainly his performance.”
Lin would only get better. As a junior, he was the only player in NCAA Division I men’s basketball to rank among the top ten in his conference in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, and three-point percentage.
And as a senior, Lin was a unanimous choice for the All-Ivy First Team and led Harvard in scoring. One of 20 finalists for the John R. Wooden award for the national player of the year and one of 11 finalists for the Bob Cousy award for the nation’s top point guard, Lin completed his Harvard career as the only player in program history to record 1,450 points, 450 rebounds, 400 assists, and 200 steals. While Lin received publicity as a senior, it has grown exponentially since his time with the Knicks.
“The masses now know that Jeremy Lin went to Harvard and played at Harvard,” Amaker says. “He did tremendous things for this program, and he made an incredible name for himself in the Ivy League. Now that he’s moved on from Harvard and gone on to the professional ranks, the notoriety, the exposure, the attention has certainly helped us because usually they don’t mention [Harvard basketball] in any shape or form, whether its interview, print, or even television. [Harvard and Jeremy Lin] are somehow already interrelated and that’s just an amazing phenomena.”
While it is hard to fully gauge the effect of Lin’s success on the Harvard basketball program, Amaker hopes that Lin’s example will give the program credibility and increased exposure, which could help with recruiting.
“The impact he’s had has given us credibility for the fact that a young man such as himself has come through Harvard, has come through our program, has come through the Ivy League,” Amaker says. “I think there are certainly hopes of being able to present our program to kids who have dreams of being an NBA player. Maybe that in itself will give us some traction with regards to recruiting. That in itself is worth its weight in gold.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 says that the impact from Lin’s exposure will not be limited to Ivy League basketball.
“We [look at demography], looking five, ten, 15, 20 years out. That’s really what our time perspective is,” Fitzsimmons says. “When you think about the effect that that type of publicity can have both here in the United States and abroad, there’s no question that [Lin’s] example and all the wonderful things in the press could well have a very positive effect for Harvard really for years to come.”
Fitzsimmons sees Lin’s impact as a very positive thing for Harvard admissions in both the short and long term, in the United States and all over the globe.
“It’s one thing to see and hear numbers about Harvard,” Fitzsimmons says. “It’s another to see, in some sense, Harvard personified in such a positive way. In some respects it’s very much the American Dream.”
AROUND THE IVIES
The focus on Lin’s successes has spread to other points in the Ivy League.
Yale senior center Greg Mangano has been following Lin’s success in the NBA during his own period of NBA recruitment.
“It’s definitely helped,” says Mangano, a two time member of the All-Ivy First Team. “I followed [Lin] really closely because I knew it was going to help having him and anyone else who is trying to play at the next level.”
NBA Director of Scouting Ryan Blake suggests that scouts have been following the Ivy League for a while, even before Lin’s recent successes.
“We pretty much scour the earth, and we do our best to find players that have professional ability,” Blake says. “We definitely don’t ignore [his success], but it’s not in terms of ‘now we have to go scout the Ivy League,’ because we already cover it. “
Penn senior guard Zack Rosen—the 2012 Ivy League Player of the Year—agrees with Mangano that Lin’s success certainly can’t hurt his chances.
“It decreases the inhibitions of the people who say, ‘Ivy League, smart kids, not really capable of playing in the league, period,’” Rosen says. “What it does is it introduces the fact that that guy can play and get it done at the next level. For me, obviously, it’s a great time because he’s done a lot. He’s been through the Ivy League. A lot of people told him no, he kept telling himself yes, and that’s a good example for anyone.”
TRAILBLAZER
While his Ivy League education is undoubtedly a significant layer to Lin’s story, there is another, deeper layer to his journey to NBA success: his Asian-American heritage.
“I think that he happens to be in the NBA and is an Asian-American,” Amaker says. “That’s another layer because it’s different. He’s a trailblazer in a lot of ways.”
The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Lin’s basketball career has been undeniably linked to his Asian-American roots from the start. Race has appeared to be an obstacle for Lin at several points in his career.
As a high school senior, Lin led his Palo Alto High School Vikings to a 32-1 record and a CIF Division II championship date with perennial California basketball powerhouse Mater Dei. Lin carried his Vikings to a 51-47 upset, shocking a Monarchs team that had eight players who went on to Division I basketball programs.
While Lin sent his resume and recruiting information to Cal, Stanford, UCLA, and all the Ivy League schools, only Harvard and Brown offered him guaranteed spots while the Pac-12 schools asked Lin to walk on.
At Harvard, Lin again faced pressure from opposing fans, who would hurl derogatory racial insults, and jeers during games. Lin’s focus and perseverance in such an environment has been inspirational to both Asians and non-Asians alike.
“He’s providing inspiration, and he’s providing living proof that if these kids work hard and keep at it, that opportunities will be there,” says Robert Nakamae, president of the San Jose Ninjas, an Asian basketball organization from the Bay Area. “I think a lot of the kids, especially the Asian-American kids, look up to him as an example of what hard work and perseverance can do for them. It doesn’t have to be in basketball or sports, but if they can follow his example and apply it to whatever it is they are doing, especially in school or their jobs, hopefully they can find the same kind of success that Jeremy has found in their own respect.”
Nakamae finds that he can use Lin’s story to inspire and excite children not just about basketball but also about the values of hard work, persistence, and relentlessness.
“My daughter plays [basketball], and we have told her that Jeremy was not an overnight success,” Nakamae says. “Before this season with the Knicks, he spent a lot of time in the offseason conditioning and then working on his shot with Doc Scheppler from Pinewood, [Calif.]. It didn’t just come naturally to him. He put a lot of work, a lot of time into developing himself into a better basketball player. That’s really the message we try and give our kids too: you have to put time into this, whatever it is, basketball, baseball, or school.”
Harvard junior Uggi Lee seems to agree.
“I think his real impact really comes at the younger level for kids who look up to him and are able to see that professional sports is something they can aspire to,” Lee says. “I think it’s incredible the kind of energy it has created in the Asian-American community, and I hope that it’s something that can be followed up on by other Asian-American athletes.”
Lee would like to see more people in the Asian-American community follow Lin’s lead and achieve success.
“It would be really sad to see Jeremy Lin being the only Asian-American athlete in this decade or this generation,” Lee says. “It would be really nice to see people take his lead and really change sports into something Asian-Americans can pursue so that they can feel sports is something that Asian-Americans have had success in in the past.”
Lin’s stories of persistence as an Asian-American athlete live on through New York University sophomore guard Ryan Tana, a fellow Asian-American basketball player from the Bay Area.
“I basically grew up with [Lin] because I played with his brother Joseph in AAU. It’s given me and a lot of other Asian-American players confidence in basketball and the things that they can get accomplished,” Tana says. “It makes me proud to be playing basketball at such a high level. You hear so much about it. Just this past season, on road trips the fans would call me Jeremy Lin and stuff like that, so you’re exposed to it all the time.”
Tana, a guard who excelled in both athletics and academics at Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, Calif. admits that race may have been a factor during his college basketball recruiting process.
“There are definitely stereotypes about Asians, and coaches see them. I think that definitely plays a part in recruiting in terms of all Asian-Americans who are trying to play basketball at the next level,” Tana says. “Besides the coaches, other players would also not really see me as a legitimate threat. They would not really take me seriously. I had confidence that I could play at the D-I level, but that didn’t really happen, you could say, because I’m Asian.”
While Tana believes that there is still a long way to go until Asian-Americans are afforded the same respect during the recruiting process, he is heartened by the increasing prevalence of Asian and Asian-American athletes at the collegiate level.
“At my school, at NYU, they are starting to recruit more Asian players,” Tana says. “This year we have a freshman from Hong Kong, Adam Zhu, and next year we have a Korean player coming in. On our level, there are definitely more Asians. But there’s a lot more work to do. America in general has a long way to go in terms of race relations and how we perceive different people.”
LEAP OF FAITH
Yet another layer of Jeremy’s story can be found in his devotion to Christianity. Much like New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow, Lin has very publicly and adamantly expressed his faith.
Sophomore Harvard College Faith and Action member Terrance Moore thinks that Lin is within his boundaries to express his faith on the professional stage.
“I feel like [Tebow and Lin] are doing exactly what we are called to do,” Moore said. “God put certain skills, certain distinctions and gifts, for us to use it for His purpose on earth. They are being very bold in that, it takes a lot of courage. It takes a lot of faith and trust to get all that money and all that fame but still remember what your purpose is.”
Lee seems to agree with Moore’s sentiments.
“For me, I see Jeremy as a role model as a Christian athlete more than as a role model as an Asian-American athlete,” Lee says. “It’s really encouraging for me personally to see someone who can hold on to their identity as a Christian so strongly as a professional athlete, in a place where I assume it is easy and tempting to be someone different.”
Harvard sophomore and HCFA member Christopher Cleveland is equally inspired by Lin’s expression of his Christianity.
“I don’t see any difference in expression of faith between professionals and any other individual who expressed their faith,” Cleveland says. “I think the more people who are open about their faith and the more people who live by the things they say they believe helps me be equally strong in my own faith.”
LINSPIRATION
Lin continues to be a positive role model and example for many different communities and groups of people as a multi-faceted individual on the biggest stage in basketball. Different people want to see Lin influence and impact the world in different ways.
“There aren’t too many players like him as far as in the way he carries himself, his ethics,” Diepenbrock says. “I would like to see him as a really positive effect on his colleagues and for him to have a tangible influence on NBA players and how they conduct themselves.”
But perhaps Amaker sums it up best.
“Jeremy is who he is, and he sets an example for himself,” the coach says. “He makes other people better. But he has a way of not trying to force who he is or what he believes in on others. He’s been able to galvanize folks; he’s been able to lead folks. But he has a way of doing it in his way. And that’s the best way because that’s who he is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing singles on the No. 2 court at any point in college signals that you are one of the most skilled players on the team. As a freshman, it’s almost unheard of—and just that much more impressive.
That is the case for Denis Nguyen, a rookie out of Anaheim, Calif., playing for the Harvard men’s tennis team. On the year, Nguyen has played all but one match in the No. 2 singles position, winning almost 80 percent of the time.
“When Denis came in, we saw that he had the potential to be a great player for us this season,” co-captain Alistair Felton says. “He’s really put the hard work in and stayed focused in order to fill his potential this year. Most impressive, I think, has been his poise and calmness in tight situations.”
One of the first showings of Nguyen’s importance to the team came on Feb. 3 in a 4-3 win over Vanderbilt.
It was the Crimson’s opening road trip of the winter season, and the team was facing a possible first loss of the year. The match was tied, three apiece, when Nguyen began to take control.
After dropping the first set, 5-7, Nguyen began to mount a comeback, point by point. He won the second set, 6-4, and, after saving five match points, was able to take the lead in the third and the eventual win, 7-5.
On April 28, a win against Dartmouth and the Ivy title all came down to the freshman in a similar manner. Nguyen, on that day, broke a three-all tie when he rallied back from that same 5-7 first-set loss that he faced against the Commodores. Over two and a half hours after singles play began, Nguyen brought home the championship for his team.
Throughout the season, Nguyen has been one of only three players on the team who consistently took part in both singles and doubles play.
He has spent much of the season paired up with junior Andy Nguyen (unrelated), and together, the duo has gone 25-7.
The freshman attributes much of his success this year to his growing strength and agility.
“I definitely think I grew physically,” Nguyen explains. “In both the weight room and conditioning, we worked really hard. It helped me improve my overall game, and, [in doubles], especially my net game.”
And since Jonathan Pearlman, the current holder of the No. 1 position, is graduating, it looks as if both Nguyen’s play and court number will be even higher next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight year, the Harvard men’s tennis team defeated Dartmouth, 4-3, to close out Ivy League play. This time, though, the Crimson was not playing for a third-place finish—it was going for the title.
With its spot in the NCAA tournament secured, Harvard did not disappoint in the first round, topping Virginia Tech, 4-2. But the Crimson could not solve its second-round opponent, Florida, and a 4-0 loss to the Gators ended what had been a historic season.
In 26 matches, Harvard won 23 times, giving it a winning percentage of .884, the best mark of any Crimson team since 1968.
“Our record this year was certainly something we’ve been really proud of, especially compared to the last couple of seasons when our record was maybe not as good as we would’ve liked,” co-captain Alistair Felton says. “This season has just been incredible. A number of tight matches that we’ve somehow managed to get through have enabled us to set this record.”
The first sign of the team’s arrival onto the elite Ivy tennis scene may have been its Feb. 3 victory over Vanderbilt. The Commodores, at the time, were ranked 34th in the nation, and, perhaps indicative of the season as a whole, it took a Crimson freshman to propel the squad past its opponents.
“I think that win was certainly a catalyst for us,” Felton says. “It gave us belief that we could beat teams that are some of the best nationally. Also, to win the first really close match made us more comfortable when we got into tight situations in the future because we could look back and not think, ‘Oh no, this is going to be like that match where we lost 4-3.’ Instead, it was more like, ‘We’ve been in this position before, and we got through it, so we can get through again.’”
For the next two months and four days, Harvard lost only once—to Indiana, a team then ranked 27th nationally. During that stretch of time, the Crimson not only won the ECAC title but also the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic, a spring break tournament in which it upset No. 16 University of San Diego to win the championship.
Harvard’s winning streak reached 13, a number two less than its win total in 2011, one less than its victories in 2010, and tying the amount of wins it had in 2009.
“Even during that time, our mentality stayed the same,” freshman Denis Nguyen explains. “It was to play like a strong, mentally tough team out there every time we compete. That goal has always worked well for us.”
And, despite one league loss to Columbia, the Crimson finished Ivy play with a 6-1 record, earning its first Ivy title since 2008.
The championship-clinching win against Dartmouth was largely thanks to the clutch performances of Nguyen and fellow rookie Alex Steinroeder. The freshmen won consecutive matches to bring the Crimson back from a 3-2 deficit to take the match and sole possession of the Ivy crown.
“We really didn’t want to have to share the title with two other teams,” Steinroeder says. “Even though we technically would’ve been Ivy League champions still, this was a much sweeter way to earn that title.”
The championship marked Harvard’s first since 2008, meaning that none of the current players had won a league title prior to the Crimson’s 2012 run.
The addition of rookies Steinroeder and Nguyen, along with Shaun Chaudhuri and Henry Steer, meant a complete transformation in the starting six for Harvard. Though it is rare in itself to have four freshmen make the starting team, it is even rarer to have them be some of the most consistent players throughout the season. In singles play, the four starting freshmen went a combined 112-36 on the year, a winning percentage of over .750.
“The freshmen really changed the team this year,” Felton explains. “Not only with their level of play but also with their attitude towards training and the game. What is really great is that they are such a tight knit group within the team so that they have really supported and pushed each other all throughout the season.”
As the team has officially broken out, next year will be all about keeping the fire alive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the last three seasons, the Harvard men’s water polo team had missed out on the CWPA Eastern Championship. The season-ending tournament had been just out of reach for this year’s senior class, but they were determined to make this year different.
After a nail-biting, 11-10 overtime win against MIT in the first round of the CWPA Northern Division tournament, that goal was finally realized.
“I think it was the guys really working hard all season,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis says. “They stayed focused on the goal. When we had some losses early in the year, we didn’t dwell on it. They stayed persistent with [their] work ethic.”
Despite finishing 10-20 overall, Harvard improved on its 2010 performance, going 5-9 in CWPA Northern Division play—up from 2-5 last year.
“[The 2010] season wasn’t as successful as we’d hoped for,” co-captain Kevin DiSilvestro says. “But this year, everyone came in from the summer in the best shape they’d been in, and everybody was completely focused.”
The Crimson kicked off the 2011 campaign with a pair of matchups at the MIT Invitational in Cambridge, taking down the hometown rival Engineers before falling to No. 18 Cal Baptist. Harvard’s senior goaltender Alexandre Popp recorded 13 saves in the latter game, but the Lancers’ offense prevailed to get the win.
Popp and the rest of the senior class, motivated by the goal of making it to Easterns, led the Crimson throughout the year. Popp had a season total of 244 saves, while co-captains DiSilvestro and Luka Babic contributed a combined 55 goals. Classmates Mike Katzer and Evan Zepfel, who is also an inactive Crimson sports editor, added 24 and 14 more, respectively.
Following the MIT Invitational, Harvard continued the season with trips south to the Princeton Invitational and the North-South Tournament, in Annapolis, Md., where the Crimson picked up three wins and four losses in a seven-game stretch against conference opponents.
One of Harvard’s wins came in an overtime thriller against George Washington in which the Crimson built up an 11-6 lead only to see it dwindle as the Colonials went on a 6-1 run in the final period to put the game into overtime.
But junior Max Eliot, a member of the All-CWPA Second Team and Harvard’s leading scorer with 44 goals on the year, put in a game-winner in the second overtime period to secure the win, 13-12.
After narrowly falling, 10-8, to Navy in the last game of the North-South Tournament, the Crimson went on a six-game losing skid. But Harvard finally put an end to the streak when it beat conference foe Connecticut College, 16-7, in the Crimson’s first stretch of home games at Blodgett Pool.
Rookie Evan Ramsey led Harvard with five goals, three assists, and two steals in the game, part of the impressive season that earned him a spot on the All-CWPA Northern Division Second Team along with Eliot.
But while it found some success against conference opponents, Harvard came up empty when it made its annual midseason trip to the West Coast to face off against five nationally ranked California teams in three days.
“That roadtrip is always really fun because most of the guys on the team are from California,” DiSilvestro says. “It was just great to see that we could play with teams that were ranked much higher than us, and then it was awesome to be able to look up into the stands and see a bunch of family and friends in Harvard gear.”
The trip’s highlight came as the Crimson got its chance at redemption against Cal Baptist in the first matchup of the roadtrip.
The Lancers gained a one-goal advantage in the first period, and although they maintained a lead for most of the game, Harvard kept the score close, and DiSilvestro scored one of his three goals on the day in the last frame to force overtime.
But unfortunately for the Crimson, it could not complete the comeback, as the Lancers scored two more goals to finalize the score at 12-10 and send Harvard home empty-handed.
“We definitely didn’t get the wins we would have liked to get because we played such good teams, but the lessons we learned and how much we grew as a team were important,” Minnis says. “It was definitely the springboard to the Easterns.”
The Crimson regained momentum when it returned to Blodgett Pool, handing Cornell and Columbia losses in the Ivy Championship before heading to the CWPA Northern Division Championship.
Facing MIT once again at the Engineers’ home pool, Harvard needed just one win to achieve its goal of making it to the Eastern Championships for the first time in four years.
In another hard-fought overtime battle—this time with their postseason fate on the line—the Crimson’s seniors stepped up their game yet again. Katzer put three goals past the MIT goalie—two of which came in overtime—to earn Harvard its biggest win of the season.
With a spot in the Eastern Championship secured, the Crimson went on to drop its next four games, but finished the tournament and the season with a win over Iona to capture seventh place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time all match, the Dartmouth fans were not screaming at the top of their lungs. All that could be heard were the thwacks of the racquets and the umphs from freshman Denis Nguyen and the Big Green’s Michael Laser.
But, with one final swing from Laser, the ball collided with the net. Dead silence filled the Baren Tennis Center for three, two, one. And then a final, unifying yell came from all those clad in Crimson.
With that shot in the net, Harvard won a come-from-behind victory that not only gave it the 4-3 win over Dartmouth, but also earned it the title of sole Ivy League champions.
“It was a pretty indescribable feeling,” freshman Alex Steinroeder says. “We were all so happy that after all the hard work we’ve put in and the long season, we were finally able to show that we were the best Ivy team and could finally grab that title.”
It was not an easy match for the Crimson, though. The team trailed early after dropping two consecutive tiebreakers to lose the doubles point.
Following Nguyen and partner junior Andy Nguyen’s 8-1 win the troubles began.
“It was hard not to be nervous,” co-captain Alistair Felton says. “You try all these various techniques to focus on the game and not think about the score, but it’s really difficult, especially when you are playing for the whole team, and it just comes down to you. That’s where it is especially nerve-wracking.”
In both of the doubles matches that Harvard lost, the Big Green had to make up deficits. In senior Jonathan Pearlman’s and sophomore Christo Schultz’s contest, the Crimson duo was up, 4-2, before the Big Green came storming back to take the 9-8 victory. Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster went down similarly as they relinquished an early 5-4 lead, and a late 8-7 lead, to eventually fall, 9-8.
An hour and a half of doubles play led to zilch on the scoreboard for the home team, and a plus-one for its counterparts.
And, after Harvard nabbed a short-lived lead from two singles contests, Dartmouth came storming back and took control of the match, 3-2.
At that point, two individual matches were left in play, both of which featured Crimson freshmen against Big Green seniors. On court No. 2, Nguyen battled Laser, as Steinroeder took on Chris Ho on court No. 5.
“I was pretty frustrated at the beginning of the match because I was playing so badly,” Steinroeder explains. “I knew it was such a big match, and I didn’t want to lose for the team. I just never gave up. I started playing a little bit better, which put a little more pressure on my opponent.”
After dropping his first set, 6-1, Steinroeder battled for 90 more minutes to come back and earn the “W” for his team. At 5:45 p.m., three hours and 45 minutes after the day’s competition began, Steinroeder took down his upperclassman opponent, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
“The feeling after was just pretty much relief,” Steinroeder says. “Relief and excitement.”
With the overall match at a draw, Nguyen’s individual match was just warming up. Nguyen followed Steinroeder’s lead, as he avenged a 5-7 loss in the first set with a 6-0 win in the second.
The freshman’s first two points following Steinroeder’s win were consecutive aces, tying the third and deciding set at 2-2. Four points later, a sliding shot from Nguyen tied it up at 30-all and led the way to wins in two consecutive games. After Laser rebounded to decrease his deficit, 4-3, Nguyen fought back and took the next game without losing a single point. Only a minute later, though, Nguyen’s Dartmouth counterpart once again seized control. With that game, the score was 5-4.
Nguyen took the next two points to take a 30-0 lead. After the rookie double faulted, momentum swung momentarily back to Laser, who tied it up at 30 apiece. But thanks to a shot that sliced down the line, crosscourt from where Laser stood, Nguyen retook a slender lead. The game was 40-30. The next shot was match point.
Nguyen served the ball and, after a short rally, the ball was in the net and the match was won. Though Harvard trailed, as a team and individually, it only took a couple of freshmen to rally and earn their team the thing that it had been fighting to reclaim since 2008: sole possession of the Ivy crown.
“It obviously would’ve been less nerve-wracking if we hadn’t have had that final situation, but I think it showed that we are able to fight through adversity and come together as a team,” Steinroeder says. “That match just culminated everything we’ve stood for this season, as we came together and proved that we were the strongest team mentally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Setting out to build on its first winning season in six years, the Harvard women’s water polo team fought its way to its second straight winning season under the leadership of coach Ted Minnis and co-captains Devan Kennifer and Shannon Purcell.
“I was really happy with the way the women played this year; we had some big wins,” says Minnis, whose squad went 17-12 overall and 4-1 in conference play.
The season was highlighted by a victory over No. 20 Hartwick at home on Senior Day. The win was Harvard’s first over the Hawks in the last 27 matches between the schools, a streak dating back to 2001. In a game that went into overtime, it was the senior Purcell who scored the winning goal.
“The win on senior day was huge,” Minnis says.
Right before the season kicked off, the team went on a training trip to Hungary. Specifically traveling to the cities of Eger and Budapest, the Crimson scrimmaged local teams and held a few training sessions, while it quickly learned how prevalent water polo is in Hungarian culture.
When not in the pool, Harvard took advantage of the vast history, tastes, and sites of Hungary and experienced all that the country had to offer.
“You don’t think of Hungary as being a vacation spot, but water polo is huge there,” Minnis says. “It was a great opportunity for our kids.”
Besides being a great experience, the Crimson’s expedition to Hungary provided invaluable experience heading into its 2012 campaign.
“The trip in Hungary really prepared us better than anything else could,” Kennifer says.
Coming back to America, the Crimson enjoyed several close wins, though it also had some tough losses to ranked teams throughout the season.
The squad had two five-game winning streaks for the season, and it ended the year with a seventh-place finish after being seeded seventh in the CWPA Eastern Championships.
“We showed that we were a team that would never give up,” Kennifer says. “We came from behind in a lot of games.”
The women faced some of its toughest competition when it took its annual spring break trip to California in March. While the trip to the Golden State brought more than half of the team home, it also allowed the Crimson to match up against top teams. The Crimson went 1-4 on the trip, but Harvard kept many contests close, falling by one to UC Santa Barbara and two to Cal Baptist.
“We learned some great lessons from that trip and playing against the tough teams,” Minnis says.
With a spot open in goal to open the season, a freshmen stepped up to the plate. Ariel Dukes spent the majority of the season in net, earning three Southern Division Defensive Player of the Week awards along the way.
While Dukes will return next season, the Crimson will lose four seniors: Kennifer, Purcell, Lizzie Abbott, and Monica Zdrojewski.
“I think we, as a [senior] class and as [a team], have been building toward this point for a while,” Purcell says. “We have grown a lot in the past year, and we have been building on our improvements from previous years.”
Until this year, the Crimson had not boasted a winning record in back-to-back years since the 2004 and 2005 seasons.
“We brought the program further than any other year during my time here at Harvard,” Kennifer says. “And I think we left the program with great momentum going into the following years.”
“We have four seniors who have done a lot for the team and the program,” Minnis said after the final game of the season. “This will go down in my mind as one of the best teams of all time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton led the way for the Harvard women’s tennis team in 2011-12. The pair finished second in the Ivy League Doubles Tournament and received All-Ivy recognition for their work on the singles court.
“Hideko and Kristin are both very special players and extremely hard workers,” Crimson coach Traci Green says. “Not only are they co-captains for the second time [next season], but they just bring so much energy and are a big part of why this team has become tremendously close—the closest team I’ve ever been a part of.”
Despite the performances of the dynamic duo, Harvard finished just 4-3 in the Ancient Eight, and 11-7 overall, good for a third-place tie with Columbia. If the Crimson is unable to capture the title next season, the class of 2013 would be just the second since 1983 not to win at least one Ivy League title.
“This will be the last year for Kristin, Camille [Jania], and I to win the Ivy League, so we’re going to be taking that very seriously and hopefully drive everyone to succeed,” Tachibana says. “The fact that this tennis program has had so much success in the past will give us even more incentive to do well.”
Green, who has been at the helm for five seasons—including the last Ivy League champion team in 2009—noted that the roster certainly had the talent to make a run at the conference title this year.
“Obviously we would have loved to have been able to compete for the Ivy title, and I think we had the ability to,” Green says. “But things didn’t quite go our way at the end of the season. We definitely had the opportunity, and that’s all you can ask for.”
All three in-conference losses came in a seven-day road trip from April 14 to April 20, as Harvard lost at Penn, Princeton, and Yale. The loss to the eventual champion Bulldogs was not close, but both matches with the Killer Ps ended 4-3, with the home teams narrowly edging out the Crimson.
But Harvard rebounded from the three-game skid to close the year with consecutive conference wins.
“After our very last match [against Dartmouth], our whole team was excited and pumped up for next season,” Green says. “That just speaks volumes to their character and willingness to put the work in preparation.”
Harvard has good reason to be excited for next season. Yale, which went undefeated in conference play, will certainly return as the preseason favorites, but the duo of Tachibana and Norton should prove formidable.
“Kristin is so enthusiastic and just pumps people up, and then Hideko is super talented and just plays with a will to win,” Green says. “You look at them playing, and they’re an immediate energizer on and off the court.”
The only senior lost to graduation is Samantha Gridley. Gridley, a five-star recruit out of high school, leaves the Crimson with a 41-38 career singles record and a 39-27 mark on the doubles side.
“Samantha brought so much focus to our program, and without her we would not have been able to do anything this season,” Green says. “She really brought a confidence and resilience to the team and definitely helped move our program to a better place.”
Only losing one senior and welcoming a talented freshman class, morale is high in the Harvard locker room.
“Samantha has been a huge inspiration to all of us,” Tachibana says. “I haven’t known Harvard tennis without her, and we’re all definitely going to miss her. She’s been an integral part of our team, and it’s going to be sad to see her go.”
“But we have four great incoming freshmen, and they won’t be able to replace her, but hopefully we can try and pick up where she left off,” Tachibana continues. “We ended the season with a really unified foundation that can only help us next year.”
Moving forward the team will continue to look towards a solid foundation of friendship as a basis for motivation and success.
“Everyone worked very hard, and they became a tight-knit family,” Green says. “They eat off each other’s plates—which I think is a bit weird—but they really feel like a family and it speaks volumes to how far we’ve come and how far we can go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the season ranked as the sixth-best freshman in the nation by Golfweek Magazine, Tiffany Lim immediately justified the lofty expectations in her first three collegiate tournaments.
Lim tied for first place at the Yale Invitational, finishing +2. The freshman won the Princeton Invitational with an even more impressive score of -3, and her score of +7 at the Nittany Lion Invitational was Harvard’s best, helping the Crimson to a ninth-place finish.
Lim had previously seen success throughout her pre-college career. She was named a 2010 Rolex Junior All-American and qualified for the U.S. Women’s Open in 2010.
This high level of achievement transferred over to Lim’s play in the Ancient Eight, where she was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“She is really good at motivating the team to practice harder,” captain Christine Cho says. “She has put in a lot of time throughout the whole year with the team and the game. Her getting Rookie of the Year was no surprise.”
For Lim, practice included changing her technique mid-season.
“I worked really hard over the winter on some fundamental swing changes,” Lim says. “I was a little rusty coming out of the winter break.”
Even with what she said she believes was a tougher spring, Lim’s single-round score of 75 (+3) helped Harvard top Nova Southeastern during the team’s spring break trip. In both the Rebel Intercollegiate and the Roar-EE Invitational, Lim placed 14th with scores of +8 and +11, respectively.
Lim also contributed to the team achievement of winning the Ivy League Championships for the first time in three years. Lim played a vital role in the victory, coming in ninth place individually. She posted a total score of +25, with the single-round score of 78 (+6) being her best during the championships.
Lim capped off her breakout collegiate season by anchoring Harvard at the NCAA Central Regional with a 23rd-place finish.
“As a freshman, to play the way that she did is fantastic,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads says. “She was seventh of individuals that weren’t on the top eight teams, and she was only five shots out of qualifying for NCAA finals on her own.”
Lim and freshman teammate Brenna Nelsen will represent Harvard in a partner tournament this summer.
“I’ve started getting back into a competitive mode,” Lim says. “I think it’s going to show this summer and next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a year that had very few individual or team victories, the Harvard wrestling team (5-10, 1-4 Ivy) performed considerably better in 2011-12, sending four grapplers to the NCAA tournament—the most since 2007—and posting its best head-to-head record since the 2008-09 season.
Junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, who had a national ranking as high as No. 4 during the year at 157 pounds, and junior Steven Keith, who ranked as high as No. 9 during the regular season in the 133-pound weight class, led the Crimson on the mat, both placing eighth at the NCAA tournament.
The eighth-place finishes earned the two juniors All-American status and marked the first time two Crimson teammates made the podium at the NCAA tournament since J. P. O’Connor ’10, Louis Caputo ’09-’10, and Max Meltzer ’07 did so in 2007.
Also competing in the NCAA tournament were co-captain Corey Jantzen and freshman James Fox. Jantzen, who played with an injured shoulder, began his final NCAA bout with a 10-8 decision over Cam Tessari of Ohio State at 149 pounds. While Tessari went on to finish fourth, Jantzen dropped his next two matches against the No. 7- and No. 4-ranked opponents to end his college career.
“Corey is one of the hardest workers I’ve ever met,” Keith says. “Unfortunately, he fell short of his goals, but he was a huge impact to the team and really carried guys through and really pushed people to their limits to make them the best wrestlers they could be.”
“It’s heartbreaking to see him go out the way he did,” Peppelman adds. “But with an injury-plagued career, he made the best of what he had.”
Fox, Harvard’s final wrestler in the tournament, did not win a match in the 197-pound class, but his two close matches seemed to prove him worthy of his at-large bid. Unranked, he dropped a 12-8 decision against the No. 8 seed before falling, 4-1, in the first round of Wrestlebacks. According to his teammates, the freshman also set a strong example for the Crimson’s future rookie grapplers.
“Fox kind of paved the way for the other freshmen, proving that even though it’s your first year in college wrestling, you can have a great season,” Keith says.
NCAAs were not the first time Harvard wrestlers had performed well in tournament matches. To start the year, the Crimson had six on the podium at the Binghamton Open. Sophomore Paul Liguori paced Harvard, finishing second in the 149-pound class, while Peppelman and Keith both finished third. Fox and sophomore Cameron Croy (184 pounds) each gained fourth-place honors, while freshman David Ng placed sixth in the heavyweights.
The Keystone Classic was one of the Crimson’s most successful bouts all year. Peppelman won a tournament for the first time in his college career, Keith and Croy earned silver, Fox took bronze, and Liguori and Ng both placed fifth. Freshman Joe Barbato, in one of his few competitions of the season, rounded out Harvard’s performance by taking sixth place at 125 pounds. As a team, the Crimson placed fifth—its best team finish all year.
While the next tournament—the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational—saw Peppelman go down with a knee injury that would keep him out for a few weeks, Keith placed third and Fox took seventh in their respective weight classes.
“I think that the tournament in Vegas in December…really proved to me that I belonged on the podium at the NCAA tournament,” Keith says.
Keith continued his winning ways at Harvard’s final tournament until the EIWAs at the end of the spring, finishing eighth at the Midlands Championships. Though other Crimson grapplers won a few matches, Keith was the only one to earn a medal.
The beginning of Harvard’s 15 dual meets in the spring looked promising. In its opening match against Rider, the Crimson registered four decisions, a major decision, and a fall en route to a 22-15 victory.
Though Harvard lost, 33-12, later that afternoon against Rutgers, the Crimson showed promise that day. Having to take the fall semester off due to injury, Jantzen returned to the mat full-force, pulling an upset against previously unbeaten and No. 3-ranked Mario Mason of Rutgers. Peppelman, meanwhile, pinned his two opponents, adding to his current career total of 27 falls that ranks him third all-time in Harvard’s history.
The Crimson went on to only win four more team matches—including a 43-0 shutout against Millersville—but still managed to merit a No. 22 national ranking before heading to the EIWA Championships.
There, then-No. 6 Peppelman and then-No. 12 Keith recorded their best EIWA performances yet, finishing second and third in their weight classes, respectively, automatically qualifying them for the NCAA tournament.
Then-No. 5 Jantzen recorded a major decision and fall at 0:36—guaranteeing him sixth place and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament—before dropping out due to a medical forfeit. In their respective weight classes, Croy finished sixth and Fox placed seventh, putting them in positions to earn at-large bids to the NCAA Championships, though only Fox ended up getting the call.
“We’re a great team; we’re a great family,” Peppelman says. “I’m really proud of what we’ve done and what we’ve accomplished, from having the second-best GPA in the country this year to organizing and coming together on National Coming Out Day to putting four guys in the national tournament. I think overall we had a really productive season, both on and off the mat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the first intermission of the Harvard men’s hockey team’s game against Quinnipiac on Feb. 3, Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 realized he needed to change things up.
Freshman Steve Michalek had surrendered a trio of goals in the opening period to put the Crimson in a 3-1 hole. With a 6-5-8 record at that point, the netminder had enjoyed a solid rookie season, but he wasn’t doing enough to help turn those ties into wins and get his team over the hump.
So Donato replaced Michalek with Raphael Girard, a sophomore who had barely played as a freshman and had struggled in a pair of early-season appearances.
The left-handed goaltender took his place between the pipes as the second period began. By the end of the night, Donato had found his spark, as Girard saved all 26 Bobcat shots fired at him over the final two periods to help Harvard escape the hostile road environment with a 6-3 win.
“I just kept working during practices, even though at some point it was hard to find motivation because Steve was playing so well,” says Girard of his season before replacing Michalek. “It was hard sometimes to find a way to push myself, but I kept on doing that. Maybe that was why I ended up playing against Quinnipiac, because my coach knew I kept working in practice, and that if he put me in there, he had confidence I could make some saves.”
Upon getting his chance, the sophomore did just that, and he continued to make clear over the following month that his hard work had paid off.
Though Donato decided to give Michalek the start in the squad’s next game, the first round of the Beanpot against Boston University, the freshman gave up three quick goals to put Harvard in another early hole. In came Girard, who for the rest of the contest was perfect again—saving all eight shots fired at him by the then-No. 1 team in the country—and Michalek would not get his job back for the rest of the season.
Following that game, Girard sparked the Crimson—which had been picked to finish dead last in the ECAC Preseason Media Poll—to a 3-0-2 record down the stretch, propelling Harvard’s surge up the conference standings.
In two must-win conference home games during the regular season’s final weekend, Girard saved 31 of 32 shots in Harvard’s 4-1 victory over St. Lawrence and 27 of 29 shots in its 3-2 win over Clarkson to help the Crimson earn the No. 3 seed in the ECAC playoffs. With that came a vital first-round playoff bye and home-ice advantage in the quarterfinals.
For his efforts, Girard was named ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Month in February, in which he had registered a 1.75 goals-against average and a .944 save percentage.
“The guys in front of me really helped me perform well,” says Girard, who finished the regular season with a .933 save percentage, tied for fourth-best in the country. “It’s always encouraging to see guys who put the team’s success in front of their individual success. I was pretty pumped up when I saw guys blocking shots and giving all they could.”
Then came the playoffs, when the goaltender was at his absolute best.
The Crimson lost Game 1 of its first-round playoff series against Yale, 2-1 in overtime, despite Girard saving 42 Bulldog shots. But in the subsequent pair of must-win contests, the sophomore willed his team to victory, refusing to let his team’s season end on its home ice.
In Game 2, Girard stopped 48 of 51 Bulldog attempts, making save after save as the game rolled into double overtime. Sixteen of those stops came in the first extra period alone, when any slip-up by the goalie would have ended Harvard’s season. During that stretch, the sophomore shut the Bulldogs down on two power plays, making seven saves in man-down situations to keep the Crimson alive until sophomore Dan Ford was able to score the game-winner in the second OT.
“[Girard] was outstanding,” Donato says. “His performance, especially in game two in overtime, was incredible.”
Building off the momentum provided by the sophomore’s spark, the Harvard offense scored eight times in Game 3 to make things easier on the goalie, who nonetheless made 39 saves in the Crimson’s series-clinching 8-2 win. The Harvard offense continued to feed off of Girard’s energy in the semifinal, as the netminder denied 18 of 19 Cornell attempts in the Crimson’s 6-1 upset of the No. 13 Big Red.
“You need a goalie that can make saves under pressure,” Donato says. “He made some huge saves. His confidence, his ability to play the puck out of the net, those were all key aspects of the success we were able to have down the stretch.”
All of a sudden, the sophomore who had started the year as a backup had become a star.
“There were a lot of guys that were very happy for him,” Donato says. “He’s a great character in the locker room; he’s liked and respected by his teammates; and he definitely has a little bit of flash and confidence to his game that were a big boost of confidence to the team itself.”
Girard’s stunning run finally came to an end in the ECAC championship game. The goalie was brilliant through two periods, saving all 27 shots he faced from then-No. 6 Union to equal his Dutchman counterpart Troy Grosenick—who would be named a first-team All-American after the season—even though Grosenick only needed to make 10 saves over the same span.
In the third period, Union—a future Frozen Four participant—finally got to Girard, registering two goals to put an end to the Crimson’s season with a 3-1 win (the final score was an empty-netter).
“I really love our seniors,” Girard says. “[In the playoffs] I knew every game could be my last game with them, so I just wanted to [extend their careers] as much as I could. I wish we had made it to the NCAAs just for them, because they deserved it.”
Though it fell just short of its first tournament bid in six years, the Crimson had finally found an answer between the pipes in Girard, who finished 6-3-1 over his final 10 appearances and whose postseason save percentage of .947 was the best in the country.
“We definitely had a good end to the season,” Girard says. “I wish I could’ve played like that the whole year, but we’ve all got our ups and downs.”
But following his breakout performance, from now on, it would appear that Raphael Girard’s career is exclusively on the way up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference two weeks can make.
In a 14-day span in September, the Harvard men’s cross country team seemingly changed its identity in the Ivy League. Once an inexperienced squad that was simply too young to be anything but a non-factor, the Crimson appeared to be a legitimate contender in the Ancient Eight.
“We had a ton of talent and we were in great shape,” sophomore James Leakos says. “The first couple of races, we crushed it.”
On Sept. 17, the squad cruised to a 23-34 victory over Yale at the annual Harvard-Yale dual meet. Two weeks later, the Crimson toed the line against some of the nation’s best teams at the Paul Short Invitational in Bethlehem, Pa., and put together its best performance of the year, finishing in ninth place out of 45 teams. In those last two weeks of September, seemingly everything went right for Harvard’s young harriers.
But unfortunately for the Crimson, the cross country season does not end in September.
“Right after [the Paul Short Invitational], everything just started going wrong,” Leakos says. “Unfortunately, literally, like, our entire team got hurt. And that was pretty much that.”
All five of Harvard’s scoring runners from the Paul Short Invitational sustained injuries following the meet. Both Leakos and freshman Billy Orman, who had been the squad’s No. 1 and No. 2 runners, respectively, at Harvard-Yale and Paul Short, were unable to compete at the team’s next scheduled race.
Just two weeks after its resounding performance in Bethlehem, the decimated Crimson squad competed in the ‘B’ division at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational. Going into the Heptagonal Championships, the once competitive team was back at square one.
Led by junior Jakob Lindaas (28th) and sophomore Aaron Watanabe (32nd), the team finished in seventh place at Heps. Placing four runners in the top 10, Princeton took home the men’s team title. Columbia and Dartmouth, which narrowly edged the Crimson at Paul Short, finished in second and third place, respectively.
“Injuries certainly curtailed the potential that we had, in terms of where we finished in the final [Ivy] League standings,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky says.
Leakos indicated that the squad’s training after the Paul Short Invite might have played a role in causing the ensuing slew of injuries.
“We had a great opportunity to do some really cool stuff, and we knew that,” he says. “I think we just got too excited…. The next couple of runs [after the Paul Short meet], I straight up crushed. I took very little recovery days, and I just really hammered the next week or so.”
Going into the year, a lack of experience and leadership was a major concern for the Crimson, which fielded a roster of mainly sophomores and freshmen. Having graduated Dan Chenoweth in the spring of 2011, Harvard entered the season without a clear No. 1 runner.
“I think a number of guys saw that opportunity and were maybe a little over-eager to fill those big shoes that [Chenoweth] left,” Saretsky says. “I think it was a real learning process for the team, and we’ll be in a much better situation come next year.”
While the Crimson men suffered from inexperience, the women’s team boasted a veteran squad led by seniors Jeanne Mack and Kailyn Kuzmuk.
After a disappointing third-place finish at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, the Harvard women followed the lead of the men’s squad and had their strongest outing at the Paul Short Invitational.
Kuzmuk led the seven competing runners at the invite, covering the six-kilometer course at Lehigh University in 21:51. All seven of the Crimson’s competitors finished within a 40-second span, allowing the squad to finish in 14th in the deep 45-school field. Some of the best programs in the country took the top spots in the women’s standings—Providence College and Villanova University earned first and second place, respectively, and eventual national-champion Georgetown finished in fourth place.
At the Heptagonal Championships, Mack (13th) and Kuzmuk (21st) once again paced the Crimson. Following the veterans was a trio of fresh faces: freshmen Viviana Hanley and Alaina Alvarez and sophomore Morgan Kelly. The squad earned sixth place in the Ancient Eight, with Cornell topping Columbia to take home the Ivy title.
“I think the cross country season had some really outstanding highlights,” Saretsky says. “I was really proud with the way that some of our younger athletes stepped up when they were called upon to run in the major championship races as we got to the end of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the 2011-12 season, the expectations couldn’t have been much lower for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Pegged to finish seventh in the 12-team ECAC in one poll and dead last in another, the Crimson, it seemed, had been written off before the puck was dropped in the year’s first contest.
Instead, Harvard finished one win away from an ECAC championship.
After fighting through an injury-filled regular season, when the team set the NCAA record for most ties in a single season while simultaneously boasting the nation’s top power play, the Crimson finished third in the conference and earned a first-round bye.
“I think the ties actually say a lot about the team,” junior defenseman Danny Biega says. “We always found a way to come close and do what we had to do to stick with any team in the league.”
After the team’s bye, the Crimson quickly found itself on the brink of elimination after falling to Yale, 2-1, in Game 1 of the three-game quarterfinals series.
But then, things started to click.
After taking Game 2 in double overtime, 4-3, Harvard cruised to back-to-back wins over the Bulldogs in Game 3 and Cornell in the semifinals, beating its two fiercest rivals by a combined score of 14-3 to advance to the ECAC Championship final for the first time since 2008.
In the process, the team earned a top-25 national ranking.
“Really, towards the end of the year, we started stringing together wins because we got more confident and players started feeling more comfortable,” Biega says. “With wins comes more confidence, and I think those two are definitely correlated.”
But the magic ran out there. A tough Union squad proved too much for the Crimson in a 3-1 loss, ending Harvard’s hopes of an NCAA berth.
Offensively, Biega and senior forward Alex Killorn led the way all year long, tallying 46 and 35 points, respectively, en route to First Team All-American selections.
But perhaps no one played a more important role in the team’s late-season run than sophomore Raphael Girard, who replaced freshman netminder Steve Michalek between the pipes near the season’s end. The sophomore’s defining performance of the year came in the second playoff game against Yale, when he stopped 48 of 51 shots to keep the team’s season alive.
“The play of Raphael Girard at the end of the season gave us some outstanding goaltending and gave the team another level of confidence,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says.
Thanks in part to the play of Girard, Biega, and Killorn, the Crimson defied preseason expectations, both with its bold run through the playoffs and by becoming the first Harvard team in four years that finished with more wins than losses. In doing so, the Crimson may have shut the book on a series of painful and underperforming seasons and officially turned the corner.

Where to start with the 2011-12 Harvard men’s hockey team? The Crimson set an NCAA record with 11 ties, skated at Fenway Park, the TD Garden, and Atlantic City, made it all the way to the ECAC Championship game, and—at one point in the season—had the most effective power play ever.
But perhaps it’s best to begin where everything got started for Harvard (13-10-11, 8-5-9 ECAC): with first-team All-Americans senior attacker Alex Killorn and junior defenseman Danny Biega.
“They elevated their game at the end of the season and were absolutely sensational,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 says.
Killorn, who was third nationally with 0.68 goals per game, and Biega, who was second nationally among defensemen with 1.06 points per game, were the first All-Americans to play at Harvard since Noah Welch ’05 made the first team and Dov Grummet Morris ’05 made the second team, both in 2005.
Killorn is currently making strides towards a professional career with the Tampa Bay Lightning, while Biega was recently named the 120th Crimson captain for next season.
“[Killorn] had a tremendous year, going from being a very good player to a guy who night in, night out was a threat,” Donato says. “With Biega coming back to lead the defense, there’s a lot of optimism and a lot of excitement.”
But the story of Harvard’s season goes well beyond the two Quebecois. With sophomore goalie Raphael Girard starting in goal for the last month of the season, Harvard finally found its stride, going 6-3-1 in its last 10 games. Thanks to the late charge, the Crimson earned a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs, home ice in the quarterfinals, and advanced to the conference championship against eventual national runner-up, Union.
“I think it was great to get back to the championship game,” says Donato, who until this season had not reached the title game since 2008. “It was a group that was resilient and hadn’t experienced a ton of success over the last couple years, but we set our sights on trying to get home ice and ended up making a run of it.”
2011-12 marked the first winning season since 2007-08 for a program that boasts 12 Frozen Four Appearances and 21 Ivy League titles in its illustrious history. Despite the strong finish, the Crimson extended an unfortunate streak during the regular season, failing to win the Beanpot for the 19th year in a row.
But Harvard did manage a couple key late-season victories over traditional Ancient Eight opponents.
“That taste that we left in our mouths of having some success and beating a couple very good Yale and Cornell teams, two of our big rivals—that taste of success is one that I think our guys recognize and are hungry to improve upon this upcoming season,” Donato says.
The Crimson bested the Big Red in the semifinals, 6-1, after beating the Bulldogs in a three-game ECAC quarterfinal series, which saw two games go to overtime. Harvard went to extra time in 14 of 34 games over the season and tied an NCAA record 11 times.
“There is certainly a mixed bag of feelings with ties,” Donato says. “We had a good many of them on the road, and getting points on the road is very important with securing home ice in the playoffs. So I think you can look at it [as], ‘Ah geez, we were that close to winning some of those games and having a more impressive record.’”
“But on the other side,” Donato continues, “you had an incredibly resilient group that defensively played in an intense environment and rose to the occasion. It built poise under fire for the group that really paid off at the end of the season.”
The challenge will be carrying that resiliency over to next season. Harvard has made a habit of starting slowly. The Crimson went 5-6-8 to start the 2011-12 season and 3-15 the year before. With nine of its top 11 scorers and Girard and freshman keeper Steve Michalek returning, the Crimson has reason for optimism going into next season.
“At the end of the season we established a new identity as a team and really finished off the year on a positive note,” Biega says. “It’s important to continue on that path and build off of it next year. This is a building block for the future of Harvard hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team turned over a new leaf this season. Despite losing two of its top four scorers, the squad squeaked out its highest win total since setting an NCAA record for consecutive wins in the 2007-08 season.
The Crimson (22-9-1, 17-4-1) first showed its grit on Jan. 14 when it responded to an early 3-0 deficit against Rensselaer.
Harvard scored five unanswered goals in the final 25 minutes as it went on to defeat its opponent and improve its postseason prospects.
“It was symbolic of our season,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey says. “We didn’t always have our best, but we worked hard, gritted it out, and never went away.”
Climbing as high as No. 7 in the national rankings, the squad only got stronger as the season wore on. Between the pipes, junior goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded six of her seven shutouts in the new year.
The outstanding individual effort corresponded with increased pressure on the other side of the ice. Dempsey led the charge with 2.1 points per game, and the Crimson won eight of its final 10 contests.
“As the year went on, the forwards really began to click,” junior alternate captain Josephine Pucci says. “If we can stay in the offensive zone, there is that much less we have to do on the defensive end, so that was huge.”
The squad saved its best all-around performance of the season for a pair of one-sided affairs against rivals Yale and Princeton, surrendering just 24 combined shots.
On Jan. 27, Harvard skated all over the Bulldogs in New Haven, scoring two unassisted goals in the first five minutes en route to an 8-0 victory.
Eight days later it returned home to thrash the Tigers. After losing to Princeton earlier in the season and allowing an early goal, the Crimson unleashed its fury, scoring seven goals in the second period alone.
When it was all said and done, Harvard was on top, 10-1.
“I’ll always remember [the Princeton] game,” says Dempsey, whose five goals came just one shy of tying the NCAA record.  “They scored in the first shift and that put us on our toes right away. [For us to score 10 unanswered goals] was something that I didn’t even think could actually happen.”
The team’s triumphs did not end there. Three players—Dempsey, Pucci, and freshman defender Michelle Picard—continued to build off of the season’s momentum by contributing to a United States silver medal at the 2012 IIHF Women’s World Championship coached by the Crimson’s own Katey Stone.
Since 1998, 20 former Harvard skaters have represented their respective countries in the Olympics.
Bellamy, whose 1.86 goals-against average was good for seventh nationally, also received recognition for her performance this season with two ECAC Goaltender of the Week awards.
But with all of success’ sweetness came some bitter moments.
Perhaps the most disappointing results of the season fell under the bright spotlight of the 34th annual Beanpot tournament. For the first time in five years, the Crimson failed to reach the finals of the four-team single-elimination tournament.
Harvard fell to Boston College, 4-2, in the consolation game after losing, 5-2, at the hands of Boston University.
“Unfortunately, we biffed against BC and BU,” Pucci says. “Those games showed us where we needed to be.”
The Crimson also came up short in the postseason. Harvard finished second in the ECAC during the regular season but bowed out to fifth-ranked St. Lawrence in the conference semifinals.
In what would prove to be the season’s final game, the Crimson outshot the Saints, 30-27, and had seven power play opportunities compared to its opponents’ three in the 2-1 overtime loss.
But with the core of the team returning, Harvard is hopeful for the upcoming season.
Despite its early postseason exit, the Crimson showed it could hang with the nation’s best.
In its first of two losses to eventual national champion Minnesota, Harvard fell by a single goal, 2-1.
“To lose to them, 2-1, is kind of a good feeling in that we were right there and we know we can play with them,” Dempsey said. “That [result], in addition to many other things, means that we can very much be national champions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It ain’t over till the fat lady sings.
There may or may not have been fat ladies present at the NCAA Championships in Montana, but on the last weekend of the skiing season, the Harvard ski team finally broke its ninth-place streak in Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association competition thanks to strong performances by its two top athletes, sophomore alpine skier Rebecca Nadler and junior Nordic skier Alena Tofte.
Nadler’s national title in the giant slalom was, of course, the headliner, but Tofte also posted strong results with a 27th-place finish in the individual start 5k skate and 35th in the 15k classic.
“I thought that this year during the season compared to last year, [Tofte] had a lot of strong, consistent results,” Nadler says. “We never actually got to see her racing in season, but I did catch her race when we were out there [in Montana], and I was impressed.”
“She had less than a day to adjust to the altitude…and she works so incredibly hard,” she adds. “It was awesome to see. I felt really proud to be her teammate.”
The duo, the Crimson’s only skiers at the event, gave Harvard a 15th-place finish overall that was seventh among EISA schools at the NCAAs. The EISA once again made its case as one of the nations more dominant conferences in the country despite competing out west, led by the University of Vermont, which became the first East Coast school to win nationals since Dartmouth in 2007.
“I think it was really great to see an Eastern team win the overall title,” Nadler says. “The West has been a seemingly stronger division. But in the giant slalom, four of the top five individuals were from the East, and the guys did well, too. It’s cool to know that maybe you’re racing against top racers in the country, and it definitely was exciting to see an Eastern school take home the championship.”
Over the course of the season, Harvard saw breakout performances from several other athletes, most notably sophomore Chris Stock, who took fourth in the 1.2k sprint at the UNH Carnival. Junior Esther Kennedy finished 12th in that same event and finished her season with a 17th-place finish in the 5k skate race at the EISA Championships, and freshman Akeo Maifeld-Carucci took 15th at the EISA Championships in the 20k classic mass start, and fellow rookie Cate Kister led the alpine women in the slalom event, taking 16th.
“In terms of the team as a whole, there was a lot of improvement,” Nadler says. “We had some fourth-place and fifth-place finishes on the women’s team, which is good and something we can build on for next year. The men’s team is also improving and working in the right direction.”
These breakout performances were not consistent enough to allow the Crimson to move past the ninth-place pole during the season, especially with the men’s alpine team often set  back by injuries and all of the teams boasting relatively small rosters compared to their powerhouse competitors to the north.
But while the team may not have had the depth to go toe-to-toe with the top teams in the region, it did boast two skiers in Nadler and Tofte who could compete with—and, in Nadler’s case, beat —athletes from the strongest schools in the nation.
“I’m excited for our team to keep building and improving,” Nadler says. “I’ve been here for two years, and a lot of times have had conversations where I say I’m on the ski team and the other person says, ‘We have a ski team?’ I hope I’m going to be having that conversation less and less.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A two-point victory had never tasted so sweet for the Harvard women’s basketball team. The Crimson ran out and celebrated, forming a huddle directly over the “H” of Hofstra on the opposing team’s midcourt.
The jubilation was the result of a 73-71 win over the Pride in the first round of the WNIT tournament, a game that culminated a record-breaking year for Harvard. The victory was not only the first WNIT win for the Crimson but also in the history of the Ancient Eight.
Though Harvard (18-12, 10-4 Ivy) fell late to a surging Temple team in the next round, a stand-out performance from co-captain Brogan Berry, with key shots from juniors Emma Golen and Victoria Lippert as well as sophomore Christine Clark, turned the game into a near-upset. Berry led the team with 21 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and 60 percent shooting from beyond the three-point line.
“I’m very, very proud of them,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith after the game. “I wish they could have been rewarded with a win. I thought we were mismatched…but I thought we outplayed them. I just couldn’t be prouder of everyone.”
And only weeks after this narrow defeat, the work of the team was acknowledged as Berry and Clark were named to the All-Ivy First Team and junior Victoria Lippert was named to the second team.
The season did not start out quite as promising, though. After losing both games in the Hawkeye Challenge, including a matchup against Iowa in which the Crimson gave up a late 14-point lead, the ball club headed back to the Northeast for a Rhode Island two-step. Harvard lost the first to Providence but won the second against a struggling Rhode Island College team.
The following five games were up and down for the Crimson, as it went 3-2, including an impressive 62-57 win over Boston University.
But all of that was just a lead-up to Dec. 22 when Harvard took on Big East powerhouse St. John’s. Against the team that would eventually make it into the NCAA tournament’s Sweet Sixteen, the Crimson not only put up a fight but took control of the game and ended up with a 63-56 victory.
The contest came down to a diving steal and two pairs of clutch shots from the charity stripe.
“It was definitely very exciting to be able to get over on a team that has a lot of respect and is from the Big East,” Lippert says. “It’s really satisfying knowing that we executed to the best of our abilities and were able to overcome an opponent people thought we would be unable to beat.”
After a loss against Hartford the following week, Berry guided her team to three straight wins, nabbing a double-double and an induction into the Ancient Eight’s top 10 all-time scorers along the way.
The streak featured victories against UMass, TCU, and, in the squad’s first league game, Dartmouth.
Next up was its last regular season non-league opponent, North Dakota. The game seemed out of reach early in the second half for the Crimson, as it faced a 12-point deficit.
But, a key steal by Lippert and shots by Lippert, Clark, and Berry cut the lead to three going into the contest’s final moments.
Following a missed free throw by the Fighting Sioux and a rebound by junior Miriam Rutzen, Harvard had a chance to send the game into overtime with a three-pointer. It was not meant to be, though, as Clark’s attempt came up short as the final ticks went off the clock.
At that point, league play began in full. Despite a loss to Yale at the front end of a back-to-back game weekend, the Crimson won four out of its next five Ivy matchups.
As a product of increasingly efficient shooting from the free-throw line as well as an upsurge in points from Berry, Clark, and Lippert, with Lippert scoring her 1000th point in a matchup versus Penn, Harvard was able to take these victories handily, winning by no less than eight points during the 12-day period.
Rutzen attributed her team’s success at that point in the season to the close-knit nature of the group.
“We’re a family, and when you’re a family you don’t want family vacation to end,” Rutzen says. “So we just wanted to keep playing, winning, and having fun as long as possible. It worked out.”
A 28-point blowout loss to Princeton, though, quickly stopped the streak. The skidding lasted into the next weekend, as the Crimson could not make up a 14-point deficit late in the second period and fell to a Brown team that it had defeated only three weeks prior.
In its next few matchups, Harvard, had success against its Ivy foes with, once again, the exception of Princeton. The Crimson took down the Quakers, Columbia, Cornell, and Dartmouth in an orderly fashion, needing those wins in order to clinch its bid to the WNIT tournament.
And clinch it did, paving the path to its record-breaking defeat over Hofstra and near upset of Temple.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dec. 22, 2003 was the last time the Harvard women’s basketball team had beaten a Big East opponent. Eight years, to the date, had passed. Two thousand nine hundred and twenty-two hours had gone by. Seventy thousand one hundred and twenty-eight minutes had ticked off the clock.
But on Dec. 22, 2011, when the Crimson took on St. John’s, it all came down to the last thirty seconds.
It took a trap, a diving steal, four clutch free throws, and eight years, but when the final buzzer finally sounded, Harvard escaped with the 63-56 win over the Red Storm.
“It definitely showed what we are capable of and how we can get over tough opponents and really play to the best of our ability,” junior Victoria Lippert says. “It’s just indicative of how much talent and potential we do have and that we can compete with anyone [when] we step on the floor.”
That game eight years before was against Providence, a team that went 4-23 overall and 0-16 within its conference. The Crimson defeated the Friars 73-59 in a contest in which Providence shot only 34.4 percent from the field and 57.1 percent from the charity stripe.
This season, Harvard’s Big East opponent was a little more impressive. St. John’s amassed a 24-10 record on the year, going 13-3 within one of the most competitive conferences in the nation.
Not only did it make it to the NCAA tournament, the third-seeded Red Storm reached the Sweet Sixteen before eventually losing to No. 2 Duke.
In order to beat its talented guest, the Crimson relied on an evenly balanced attack. Co-captain Brogan Berry, juniors Emma Golen and Victoria Lippert as well as sophomore Christine Clark each scored 12 points, while Clark grabbed nine boards and both Berry and junior Miriam Rutzen dished out five dimes.
Harvard started out the game with the momentum, taking advantage of its hot shooting to gain an early 14-4 lead. But, as would become somewhat of a common theme throughout the season, the Crimson slowly let the Red Storm creep back into the game, and, at halftime, Harvard held only a three-point lead, 32-29.
The second half followed a similar pattern as the Crimson pushed its lead into the teens before St. John’s instigated a full-court press and stole its way into a tight game going into the final few minutes.
And then the adrenaline kicked in.
“I just remember being excited, thinking, ‘Cool, we’re going to get this one; let’s go out and finish as strong as we can,’” Rutzen says. “I think that physically showed on the court at that point.”
With 30 seconds left and a 59-56 Harvard lead, a Crimson trap enabled Clark to run the lanes and pick off a telegraphed Red Storm pass. After diving for the ball, the Harvard guard signaled to the referee for a timeout. When the break was over, Clark inbounded the ball to Berry, who was quickly fouled and sent to the line for two shots.
The senior sunk both attempts and, from there, the game was all but over. After another failed attempt from St. John’s and two more successful free throws from the home team, the Crimson’s first win over a Big East team in eight years was officially complete.
Immediately following the game, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith attributed her team’s victory to its composure throughout the contest.
“I just loved our poise, [and] I loved our teamwork,” Delaney-Smith said. “We have the tools to do it, but sometimes we panic, and we did not panic [today].”
After mid-December only five teams defeated the Red Storm. Along with the Crimson, Marquette, Duke, UConn, a No. 1 seed at the NCAA tournament, and Notre Dame, another No. 1 seed who went all the way to the NCAA championship game, also defeated St. John’s.
For Berry, one of the biggest benefits of the win was its positive effect on the rest of the season.
“It was definitely a huge confidence booster for us,” Berry says. “We knew that if we could play with a team like St. John’s, we should be able to play with any team in the Ivy League…. It came at a great time in the season, and we really hit our stride going into league play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I came back to 14 Plympton Street to write this parting shot because it seemed appropriate. What I didn’t expect was to be enveloped one last time in the legendary LoveSac, a humongous blue beanbag, here for storage, that has been passed on between generations of Sports editors.
The passing down of the LoveSac is just one of the many traditions of the Sports Board. It is perfect timing that I ran into it—it is quickly evoking memories (some of them a little hazy) that I’d like to share.
*****
The first person I think about when I see the LoveSac is its former owner, Loren Amor ’10. I don’t want to flatter him too much, but Loren was one of the biggest reasons why I joined the board. Going into my second semester at Harvard, I was a reckless freshman still trying to find his niche.
A close friend suggested that I check out the Crimson, so I went to my first Sports meeting one sunny Sunday afternoon—according to his parting shot, this, creepily, is the same reason Loren joined the Crimson.
It was a match made in heaven.  I took an instant liking to my comp directors, Kate Leist ’11 and Max N. Brondfield ’11, and fell in love with what the board stood for. Joining the board meant keeping sports as a big part of my life. Like some members, I was a former athlete who just did not cut it at the collegiate level, so writing about sports was the next best option.
Joining the board also meant becoming integrated into its social scene, which sounded like fun—I learned that this was very true at my first comp outing.
But ultimately, joining Sports meant that I would work with a great combination of personalities and characters, and the people were what really mattered to me.
Loren was one of those people. He,  like me,  grew up in Queens, and he supports all the sports teams I like. His sense of humor was compatible with mine, and he and Dixon McPhillips ’10 had the respect of their peers. After meeting a guy who could potentially be a mentor and sharing a couple of laughs with the board, I was certain that I had found that niche that I was looking for.
That sentiment only grew after I got into Kirkland, as both chairs and my eventual co-comp director, Timothy J. Walsh ’11, were also residents of the best house on campus. It seemed like destiny to me.
*****
Max also comes to mind because he inherited the LoveSac after Loren, but you cannot think Max without the K. Kate and Max (K-Max) were a powerful tandem that not only truly shaped the board but were also influential in my life. As comp directors, they taught me everything I know about sports writing. As Sports chairs, they taught me how to lead a board and effect change. Being a comp director and exec under their leadership was the ultimate preparation for my own tenure as Sports chair.
Most importantly, they were great mentors and friends. Whenever they saw opportunities for growth in my writing, they would help me out. Whenever I needed advice about my pre-med classes or my personal life, they would readily give it. Whenever I partied, it was with them and the board.
*****
The LoveSac went to E. Benjamin Samuels ’13 last year since he had space in his room for it. And I feel like it went to the right person since he represents the strides the board has made in the past years. An exec during my time as Sports chair, Ben is now one of the few presidents in the history of the Crimson to hail from Sports, which speaks volumes of the progress of a board that was once comprised of only four members.
But I mention Ben because only two years ago he was one of my first compers, which reminds me that my foot is truly out the door. I have seen him and his classmates grow into fantastic leaders of not only Sports but also the entire building, and I cannot believe that was the doing of the 138 and guards before us.
I have held leadership positions in the past, but it is in college that I realized that one can have a real impact on younger generations, and it is quite evident in this column. Here I am babbling about friends who have shaped my life, and I just hope that the 138 has had that positive effect on the 139 and beyond.
*****
I do not think I can write a parting shot without mentioning my unexpected bromance with Dennis J. Zheng ’12. At the start of our tenure as Sports chairs, Dennis was not even a friend—I had had only a handful of conversations with him, and I found him a little intimidating.
He was a pre-med like I was, but his eye for the minutiae was something that I did not have. He was a strong writer and accomplished editor, but only a few people on the board knew him well. So when we started our tenure, we complemented each other nicely but were unfamiliar with our respective ways.
The Sundays we spent putting the Sports section together helped. We learned about our respective tastes in music, found out that we loved Domino’s a little too much, and shared our personal stories and drama. Maybe old Indian customs have it right—this arranged marriage has truly worked out.
*****
To be honest, I did not know what my parting shot would be about—hence the whole LoveSac theme—but as I started writing, it became clear that I wanted this column to express my gratitude to the Crimson.
I wanted to thank the Crimeds who influenced my decisions and shaped my college career. I wanted to express how grateful I am to the Crimson for the support it has given me on so many levels. Execs and writers, I love you. The friendships I have formed here by performing exec duties, doing Commencement production, or covering a beat—especially the same ones throughout the years, Alex Sopko—are ones that will last a lifetime.
I wish I had more space to talk about the process behind several stories I have written, the time I went to Cornell with a ragtag crew, my random Dartmouth road trip, all the holiday parties and socials, our trip to the NCAA tournament, Commencement 2011, etc. I wish I could mention more people as well—there have been numerous coaches, players, and fellow Sports members who have taught me a lot. But I will leave Harvard and the Crimson with a plethora of memories and feeling that I am the luckiest guy ever, and I cannot ask more than that. Thank you, The Harvard Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Somewhere in a half-asleep doze from Boston to Providence, I realized I was being driven by someone who’d had a very real role in the music industry.
Long before she became an unsung hero of Weld Boathouse, my friend worked for a guitar company. And when a talented music artist, considered by Rolling Stone magazine to be one of the “greatest songwriters ever,” had an injury that could have derailed her career, she was on the crew that helped design a lightweight electric guitar both easy to hold and capable of a range of sounds that can’t be accomplished with acoustic.
Naturally when I ran into my friends, I had to share this story, one no one had heard before.
People don’t win their teammates over by saying how unique they are, how incredible their stories are, or how many obstacles they’ve overcome.
Whether as reporters or as friends, it’s your job to find that out.
I wouldn’t advocate journalism as a guide to friendship in most circumstances. Reporters are expected to keep a certain emotional distance from their subjects, and stories are often told without concern about how they will affect their subjects. As Michael Corleone says in The Godfather, “It’s not personal.... It’s strictly business.”
But reporters are expected to dig deeper into their stories, to ask follow up questions, to see both the good and the bad in people.
No matter how well we know the teams we cover, feature pitches never encapsulate the entire life story of the athletes featured. It’s the writer’s job to find the backstory. Because ultimately, the ability to turn a phrase doesn’t make something a good feature. I can read a literary magazine for that. The best features are the ones that tell a story that couldn’t be read elsewhere.
Just as athletes’ GoCrimson pages shouldn’t represent the bulk of our research, neither should our friends’ resumes be seen as a summary of who they are as people. Perhaps even more than the roles of researcher and reporters, the role of a friend depends heavily on the follow up question. Don’t accept your friends’ one-dimension definitions of themselves.
Don’t accept people’s two-dimensional portraits of themselves either, for that matter. I was proud of myself for uncovering a story about one of my friend’s past life as a guitar fixer when this week my friend mentioned picking up some tomatoes for her because she loves plants. Definitely missed that.
All of us have stories we haven’t told, whether they are accomplishments we’ve humbly refrained from telling, interests we’re sure others will find weird, or fears we’re afraid to express.
Of course the kinds of questions you ask, the pieces of information you seek to probe, are probably different for reporters than they are for friends, but many of the most important lessons I’ve learned can apply to both of them. I learned to let people tell their own stories rather than let my own interpretation cloud out the story itself. In my early stories with the Crimson, I always felt a compelling urge to chime in about how I could relate.
But it’s really not forwarding the conversation, unless you are making note of your own affiliation to a sport few people understand (like rowing). Similarly, in writing, I’ve worked to get out of the way of a story and let it tell itself. But the one of the most important lessons I’ve learned from writing and from friendship is to be dissatisfied with the story at hand. In my time writing features and editing features, I haven’t come across boring athletes—only ones whose personalities and stories were incompletely researched. Similarly, the people I know best are all incredibly interesting, talented, complex people. If I were to offer a piece of advice, it would be to look at your group of friends. Do any of them seem average? You probably don’t know them well enough. Originally, this story had both the name of the music artist and the name of my friend who helped her career.
But for better or worse, it’s all from a conversation I had half-asleep that was later confirmed when she was helping my mom and me load the family car for Christmas vacation. Not exactly an official interview. But maybe the context is part of the lesson, even if it’s a part I’m only learning now in my frustration at not having the perfect article to run as my parting shot. Maybe part of the lesson is to always keep your ears open. I’ve found out some of my information for features from unlikely sources and offhand comments. And I learned some incredible things while part of me wished I were sleeping (oh hey, post-morning-practice classes). You never know when you’ll hear an incredible story about your friend you didn’t know or pick up on a red flag to address with him or her.
People say that the best thing about Harvard is its people. It’s true that telling the stories of amazing athletes and coaches at this school has been my favorite part of writing for The Crimson and that the relationships I’ve built have perhaps been the most meaningful part of my time here.
But I don’t think the wondrousness of Harvard is what we should learn from it. Instead, I leave here convinced that there are incredible people wherever you go. You just have to look hard enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down 15 strokes and closing in on the lead on the final day of the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard men’s golf team hadn’t felt this type of pressure in a long time—the pressure that each shot could be the decisive factor in who wins and who loses the league crown. Team pressure more so than individual pressure.
With leaders Dartmouth and Columbia falling and Penn surging alongside the Crimson, Harvard had a chance to take the tournament for the first time since its only championship in 1975.
But the Crimson’s late surge was unable to overcome its early deficit, and Harvard finished in fourth place, just five strokes behind the victorious Quakers. It was the team’s closest finish since winning the event 37 years ago.
“The big thing this year at Ivies is that we finally felt pressure on ourselves, which was honestly just an unbelievable feeling,” captain Tony Grillo says. “In the past you never had that, and you didn’t know what you were missing. When Coach [Burke] came up to me and said, ‘We have a shot at this,’ all of sudden you have those nerves, and you kind of buckle down a little bit.”
The Ivy League Championship was a culmination of improved play for the Crimson over the spring season, as Harvard sharpened its game with each week coming off its spring break trip in Florida.
“We definitely underperformed in the fall and had a bunch of mediocre finishes,” Grillo says. “But in the spring, these last two weeks, we absolutely pulled together and played good golf.”
Two weeks before the league championships, the Crimson finished fifth out of 14 teams at the Princeton Invitational. The following weekend, Harvard finished second at the Century Intercollegiate, ahead of all other Ivy League teams in contention.
The performance put the team in a strong position heading into the final weekend, but the Crimson was not able to get over the hump. Harvard was a fairly consistent team this year, Grillo noted, rarely shooting very low or very high scores.
“In my eyes, that was the issue with our team this year: We just didn’t really have that jump which we needed at Ivies to overcome that lead,” Grillo says.
The fall was not as strong for the Crimson, as Harvard’s five fall tournaments resulted in mostly middling results.
Its best performance in the fall was a fifth-place finish out of 14 teams at the MacDonald Cup at Yale. In addition, the Crimson placed second out of three teams at the HYP match, eighth out of 18 at the McLaughlin Invitational, 12 of 22 at the Big 5 Invitational, and 11 out of 17 against a tough field at the Windon Memorial Classic at Northwestern.
But a defining mark of the 2011-12 team was the depth it possessed.
With the consistency of Grillo and fellow senior Mark Pollak, a strong sophomore class, and the addition of freshman Akash Mirchandani—who was named second-team All-Ivy along with Grillo—Harvard had a number of players who could compete with anyone in the league.
“We had the deepest team we’ve had since I’ve been here,” Grillo says. “[We] had [sophomores] Michael Lai and Kevin McCarthy, who were playing great golf in the spring. It could have been two or three other people on the team who could have gone [to Ivies].”
Grillo and Pollak ended their careers as two of the top players in recent program history, especially in terms of scoring average and national rankings.  Grillo and Pollak’s averages of 72.53 and 73.33 this year, respectively, along with Grillo’s 73.28 two season ago, were the lowest since 1993-94.
“Tony and Mark’s consistency in tournaments I’ve almost come to take for granted,” says sophomore Theo Lederhausen, who will captain the team next season. “There will definitely be a void next year without them, especially with their leadership on the team.”
Lederhausen also notes, though, that many Ivy League teams are losing key contributors to graduation, so relatively, the Crimson will be just as strong, returning three starters at Ivies in Lederhausen, Mirchandani, and sophomore Seiji Liu.
Harvard plans to build upon this experience at Ivies next year as the team looks to remain in contention for the title.
“We were right there,” Lederhausen says. “And it’s always helpful to be in contention because next year, we’ll use that experience to build on that. I look forward to next year, and hopefully we’ll be one of the stronger teams again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite last year’s Ivy League title for the men’s squad and the NCAA individual foil title for sophomore Alexandra Kiefer, another successful year was never a certainty for the nationally-contending Crimson fencing team. But with a second-place finish by the men’s squad in the Ivy League Championship, a sixth-place finish at the NCAA Championships, and individual silver medal for outgoing co-captain Valentin Staller in the saber, Harvard was nonetheless able to remain in the upper echelons of Ivy and national fencing.
“Given that we won the Ivy League Championship last year, we were a little disappointed with this year’s result,” Staller says. “We didn’t do quite as well in the dual meets as we did last year, but we had a tough schedule. We fenced pretty much all the best teams in the country and no one can say that we didn’t have a great season.”
The men’s squad opened up the season at the Garret Open at Penn State with three fencers finishing in the top 10 in their respective divisions. Freshman epee Peregrine Badger had a memorable start to his Harvard career, medaling in his first collegiate meet by taking bronze in the epee. In the men’s squad return to Penn State for the Penn State Invitational, the Crimson once again turned in a strong performance with the men registering a 5-1 record—the lone loss coming against defending national champion Penn State.
But following this promising start to the season, then-No. 3 Harvard faltered, dropping four out of its five matches at the St. John’s Invitational. The Crimson suffered close defeats to No. 5 Ohio State (15-12), No. 1 Penn State (17-10), and No. 4 Notre Dame (15-12), but were blown out by hosts No. 6 St. John’s (19-8). Harvard’s lone victory came against Ivy-foe Columbia (16-11).
Staller attributes Harvard’s mid-season slump to misplaced expectations and struggles to find a consistent level of team motivation.
“I think we may have placed expectations a little too high,” Staller says. “I think we focused too much on the results and not enough on the process.”
Despite this mid-season loss of momentum, the Crimson men quickly regrouped and positioned themselves for a defense of their Ancient Eight title. On the first day of the two-day tournament hosted by Yale, Harvard opened with a 2-1 record, posting wins over Ivy foes Penn (14-13) and Yale (15-12) while coming up just one point short against Princeton (14-13).
On the second day, the men’s squad rounded out Ivy League competition with dominant performances against Columbia and Brown to close out the tournament with a 5-1 record, good for second place behind the undefeated Tigers.
Although the men’s squad fell just one point short of retaining the Ancient Eight crown, three Crimson fencers—Staller, senior James Hawrot, and freshman Brian Kaneshige—were recognized for their individual efforts and earned All-Ivy First Team honors.
The Harvard men concluded their regular season with a formidable showing at the Beanpot Tournament, sweeping the Boston teams to claim the 2012 fencing Beanpot title. The Crimson carried its momentum into the NCAA Regionals hosted by Boston College.
“We were able to qualify six men and six women for the NCAA Championships—the maximum amount—and I don’t think that too many teams were able to achieve that,” Staller says.
Harvard managed a sixth place finish at NCAAs but the highlight for the Crimson was the performance of Staller, who put together a three-day charge for the saber title, culminating in a championship match against Aleksander Ochocki of Penn State.
But in the end, Staller’s championship came up just a bit short, as he fell to Ochocki, 15-11.
For the women’s squad, the season was similarly marked with early season successes, mid-season doldrums and post-season achievements.
The Harvard women opened up its year at the Garret Open with two gold medals, one for sophomore Alexandra Kiefer in the foil and another for senior Caroline Vloka in the saber. Freshman Emma Vaggo earned a bronze in the epee.
But the women’s squad’s initial successes gradually faded away. At the St. John’s Invitational, the Crimson opened up with a commanding victory over Penn State in its first dual competition of the tournament, but followed that up with a series of losses to No. 4 Notre Dame (15-12), Columbia (15-12) and No. 5 Ohio State (21-6). With a late day victory over hosts St. John’s, Harvard finished the tournament with a record of 2-3.
In the Ivy League Championship, the Crimson women had an almost exact replica of their Ivy-title push last season. The women’s squad concluded the tournament finishing in third place with a 4-2 record after defeating Penn, Cornell, Brown, and Yale, but falling to Princeton and Columbia.
The Harvard women closed out the regular season and entered the postseason with stellar performances at the Beanpot and at the NCAA Regionals. Just like their counterparts on the men’s squad, the women’s squad made short work of their local rivals, sweeping all three local Boston teams by large margins.
After qualifying the maximum number of fencers at the NCAA Regionals, the women’s squad finished its season with a sixth place finish and two All-American performances by Vloka and Kiefer. Vloka finished in fifth place in the sabre, enough for second-team All-American honors. Kiefer, who claimed the NCAA individual championship as a rookie in 2011, finished in 11th place, earning an All-American honorable mention in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team started off its 2011 season on a tear, winning seven of its first nine contests. But in Ivy League play, the Crimson could not keep its momentum going, dropping nine of 14 Ivy League contests en route to a 12-12 overall record.
“We actually had one of the best starts that we’ve had for a while. [In] our preseason tournaments, we did really well,” co-captain libero Christin Wu says. “Then when the Ivy League games rolled around, we just kind of lost that consistency.”
“Also, it was unfortunate we had several injuries [to] a couple of our starters,” Wu adds. “We didn’t have a set lineup for a lot of the season, so that made a big difference in our wins and losses.”
Junior outside hitter Taylor Docter led the Crimson attack, tallying a team-high 331 total points.  Her average of 3.05 kills per set ranked Docter eighth in the Ivy League, and her consistency as an outside hitter earned her second-team All-Ivy recognition.
“She is one of our best hitters, one of our go-to hitters, [and] when we’re down, we look to her to rip us a kill,” Wu says.
Due to her on-court performance and off-the-court leadership, Docter was named captain for next season.
The other rising seniors, setter Beth Kinsella and defensive specialist and outside hitter Olivia Staffon, played important roles for Harvard as well. Kinsella, the top-scoring setter on the team, led the squad with 580 assists in 2011, good for 8.66 per contest. Meanwhile, Staffon’s consistency helped her earn a team-best hitting percentage of .333.
Underclassmen played a large role on a squad composed of two seniors, three juniors, three sophomores, and five freshmen.
Right behind Docter in offensive production was freshman outside hitter Kristen Casey, who finished second on the team in points (287), kills (247), and kills per set (2.71).
In addition to her impressive offensive statistics, Casey ranked third in digs with 245.
Sophomore setter Natalie Doyle also turned in an impressive 2011. Doyle finished second on the squad in assists (366), assists per game (4.02), and digs (257).
But the team will be graduating two of its top players in Wu and middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer.
While Fryhofer finishes her Harvard career with over 700 kills and 250 blocks, Wu will go down as one of the most-decorated Harvard volleyball players in history. The libero ends her career with a total of 1,841 digs, a school record and the second most in Ivy League history, plus All-Ivy recognition in each of her four seasons.
“Our seniors were phenomenal leaders,” Doyle writes in an email. “Christine Wu and Sandra Lynne Fryhofer were both starters and captains and will be sorely missed.”
The Crimson came out of the gate strong in 2011 and sat at 7-3 at the start of Ivy League play. But a three-game losing streak, including two losses against fellow Ivy contenders Dartmouth and Princeton, slowed its early-season momentum.
Harvard quickly rebounded with back-to-back wins at Penn and Brown, but from there, the Crimson struggled in conference play. The team that began its season with seven wins in nine contests then dropped seven of nine conference matchups.
Still, Harvard managed to regroup and completed its season with one of its best games—a four-set win at home against Brown.
Brown won the first game, 19-25, but the Crimson battled back. In the second set, the teams exchanged point after point and alternated the lead repeatedly. Throughout the game, a maximum of three points separated the teams. In a final push, Harvard held the lead and finished the set, 27-25.
The squad handily won the final two sets, 25-16 and 25-19, respectively, thanks to standout performances by its two seniors: Wu, who recorded 24 digs, and Fryhofer, who tallied seven blocks.
While losing these seniors leaves a hole in the Crimson lineup, Docter showed she is ready to fill the gap, finishing the season with a double-double. Her 15 kills led the team and 16 digs contributed to Harvard’s strong defensive showing.
And in addition to the return of much of the team, four promising recruits join the squad in the autumn to bolster the team’s prospects going forward.
“We didn’t see as much success during Ivy League play as we would’ve liked, but I know that they’ll be really good next year,” Wu says. “I’ve been helping coach a little bit this spring season, and they have improved so much already, and they look really great. So I’m excited to see what the team will do next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard University President and current economics professor Lawrence H. Summers sat down with The Crimson to discuss Harvard’s 375th birthday, the importance of virtual learning, and changes the University might face in the years to come.
The Harvard Crimson: I wanted to ask you about your Boston Globe editorial about Harvard’s 375th anniversary from October. You write that Harvard needs to guard against turning inward. What do you mean by turning inward, and to what extent is Harvard doing that now?
Lawrence H. Summers: I think that what is important is that [Harvard] be prepared to think as aggressively as it can be about all the things that are possible to do to maximize its contribution.... But all of those things require measuring the efforts in terms of the magnitude of the problems and the challenges and the opportunities that are out there in the world rather than in terms of what maximizes comfort internally. I was very excited to see the edX initiative, which I think represents the kind of step forward out of traditional categories in a way that I think is going to be very important for the University in the future.
THC: You write that Harvard should risk disruptive change. I had a couple questions about that. First, what kind of disruptive change are we talking about here?
LHS: Nobody seeks to achieve destruction, but inevitably, just as the calculator displaced the slide rule, and the cell phone displaced the payphone, and orthroscopic knee surgery displaced traditional knee surgery, finding better ways of doing things sometimes means that activities that were once right will no longer be seen in the same light. And the most successful institutions are ones that are constantly thinking about what it would look like if they were being invented today rather than taking as a given the full set of inherited priorities and ways of doing things that have been traditional. And so, for example, the divisions of knowledge into departments that were appropriate 50 years ago when the structure of the College was basically set may or may not be fully appropriate today. Boundaries between schools that were appropriate in President Eliot’s time may or may not be appropriate today. The distinctions between what categories of faculty are or the meaning of a library that were appropriate a half-century ago may not be appropriate today.
THC: As of course you know, Harvard celebrated its 375th anniversary in the midst of a worldwide financial crisis and an endowment crash. How does Harvard deal with the economic volatility that we’ve already seen and will continue to see in the future, especially as it makes these changes that you’ve mentioned?
LHS: Harvard needs to be very much aware, as I think it always has been, in its financial planning that markets are anything but certain and that endowments can go up in value in good years and can go down in value in bad years, and therefore needs to make judgments about its spending that recognize the uncertainty of future endowment values and that recognize that we can’t know what volatility will come in the future. I do think it’s important to recognize that preparing for Harvard’s future is not just about preserving the endowment. It is also about putting in place everything from laboratories to modern student social space, from a first-rate faculty to making investments in information technology.
THC: What do you see as your role in producing these sorts of changes and working toward these changes, and is it something you want to pursue further here at Harvard, in the nation, or both?
LHS: I greatly enjoyed my time as Harvard president. I hope in some way that I was able to push things forward on some important issues. That is for others to judge. My main focus at this point has moved back to issues of national economic policy, and I am very careful to extend to the current University administration the same supportive approach that my predecessors extended to me: being available to help out if asked, but other than that, to stay out of University issues.
THC: You’ve talked a lot about the types of changes we need to make regarding technology and some other things. Is there anything else that comprises your vision for what a 21st-century university should be, and what direction do you think higher education as a whole should be moving toward in addition to the things you’ve already mentioned?
LHS: I think you’re likely to see substantial pressure to make much more use of technology. A good rule in life is that things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.... I don’t know just when the moment will come, but I suspect the moment will come when the traditional lecture will come to be just one possible means of conveying a set of material, rather than the dominant one as it is today.... If you think about how much the American population has increased, how much availability has been increased by financial aid, how many more families are prepared to think about sending their child to a school like Harvard, and then you think about the pressure for study in the United States coming from the rest of the world, these pressures are immense. And yet a class at Harvard and most other schools is just about the same size as it was in the 1970s. And so technology is basically, potentially a part of doing things better, a part of doing things cheaper, a part of doing them on a larger scale, and I think all of those are going to be very important in higher education. I suspect whoever leads among the world’s universities in 2050 will lead in a significant part because of what they’ve done with information technology distance learning, and so I think it’s hugely important to be prepared to innovate on those margins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gone are the days when it took a perfectly polished resume and an acceptance letter to gain access to the courses of Harvard’s most esteemed professors.
Earlier this month, Harvard University President Drew G. Faust stood beside Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Susan Hockfield at a packed press conference to announce the creation of edX—an online learning platform that will allow students from around the world to take virtual courses from the two institutions for free.
“Today’s announcement opens the possibility for transformation through education to learners around the globe,” Faust said. “[EdX is] a partnership that will change our relationship to knowledge and learning.”
The announcement grabbed the attention of the national media and prompted a bevy of predictions of radical change in the world of higher education.
“Welcome to the college education revolution,” columnist Thomas L. Friedman wrote in The New York Times two weeks after the announcement. “Big breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.”
But edX is only the latest development in series of moves by universities across the nation to expand the presence of higher education online.
Since 2007, Yale University has offered people around the world the chance to take courses at no cost through Open Yale Courses. Earlier this year, Stanford University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Michigan launched their own free online courses through Coursera, a for-profit education startup.
While many in the media and higher education speculate about edX’s potential to democratize education, technology and teaching experts say that the significance of the new portal lies beyond the fact that it allows elite institutions to offer free courses to the masses.
For them, edX represents an opportunity to advance pedagogy by encouraging research and collaboration between institutions of higher learning, with the support of the influential Harvard and MIT brands.
DEMOCRATIZING THE BRAND?
While virtual learning is nothing new, edX has inspired buzz due to the prestige associated with Harvard and MIT.
“Harvard has a terrific brand; it has a wonderful tradition,” said Ilona E. Holland, a lecturer on technology, innovation, and education at the Graduate School of Education. “When there’s a partnership between two tremendously successful entities, that gathers remarkable attention.”
Students who may be skeptical about the academic merits of taking courses online would likely have some of their anxieties alleviated by the power of the institutions behind edX.
“By calling it HarvardX or MITx, you’re saying that this will be close to the experience of taking a course at MIT,” said Anant Agarwal, an MIT professor who will serve as the first president of edX. “They include all the qualities, the difficulty levels, the pedagogy, and all the idiosyncrasies of what makes a quintessential Harvard course or an MIT course.”
Agarwal expects a wide range of people to enroll in edX courses, from high school students looking for an alternative to Advanced Placement credit to adults hoping to further their education to college students aiming to bolster their learning experience.
“It really gives the opportunity to democratize our education and make it available as a public good,” Agarwal said.
And the attractiveness of an online education offered by a top-tier institution has been proven by the attention garnered by MITx—the platform that preceded and laid the foundation for the creation of edX. The program has had 120,000 students enroll since it debuted in February.
According to Agarwal, a program like MITx or edX markets itself.
“We launched this course and put it up on a couple of websites, and that’s it,” Agarwal said of the marketing strategy for the first course offered by MITx.
The strength of the Harvard and MIT brands also comes across in the excitement over the certificates of mastery that edX will offer upon the completion of some courses. Whereas most other online education platforms offer no university-issued recognition of completion, edX certificates will bear the name of their parent institution—Harvardx or MITx.
These single-course diplomas could play an important role for students looking to impress a potential employer or improve their odds of admission to a top college, Agarwal said. According to Harvard University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Harvard faculty have yet to decide which courses will offer certificates.
But experts insist that even with the Harvard name attached, certificates of mastery will in no way be comparable to a degree.
“A certificate is very different from a four-year degree. The actual deliverable, the actual product, is very, very different,” said Holland.
Because of this distinction, experts said they believe that the offering of free online Harvard classes will not make traditional acceptance to the University any less prestigious. In fact, they said that the potentially widespread reach of virtual courses might only increase Harvard’s name recognition.
EX-PERIMENTAL
While Harvard has touted edX’s ability to reach new audiences, the University also has worked to make the program a paradigm of innovation in other ways.
While online education is far from novel, experts say that Harvard’s will be the first to realize such a platform’s research potential.
One of edX’s strength lies in its ability to not only educate students but also to provide universities with the knowledge necessary to critique themselves and improve their teaching.
Among the many research projects envisioned for edX, scholars might track students’ patterns of watching and rewinding lecture videos or examine correlations between the study methods students choose and their later scores on tests.
“As we do this, we’re going to be collecting enormous amounts of information about how people learn, which kind of assessments work, who signs on. How do people learn differently in India from the way they learn in China and Cambridge?” Faust said.
Steve Hargadon, founder of the education website Classroom 2.0, said, “This is going to be a learning opportunity not only for the students, but for the universities.”
Institutions will be able to collect and analyze enormous amounts of data in a way that has never been done before.
“The research opportunities are just tremendous. That’s what’s really novel,” said Garber.
According to Garber, the information collected from edX will be available to researchers worldwide.
Faust emphasized that this data would improve learning for Harvard students and learners around the world. Professors who put their courses on edX will have access to information about how students learned in their courses, while researchers will be able to examine methods of teaching on a broader scale.
As Martha Stone Wiske, an Ed School lecturer on technology, innovation, and education, sees it, edX “both benefits the education of the elite while at the same time increasing access to quality education for a much broader audience.”
Many of the details surrounding what the program will look like when it launches this fall have not yet been determined. This, however, said Garber, is part of what makes the program most exciting.
“As you can detect, there’s a lot of questions that are unanswered as of today. That’s deliberate,” Garber said when edX was announced. “We need our faculty to be deeply engaged in the shaping of Harvardx.”
The excitement is bubbling despite the fact that MIT and Harvard have yet to disclose many specifics about the platform.
“It’s difficult to know how innovative the online courses are going to be. Before all of that is determined, any excitement about the program is premature,” said Chris Dede, a professor of learning technologies at the Ed School.
But hopes are as high as could be. As MIT and Harvard look to take advantage of the untapped potential of online education, the platform represents a chance for the universities to reaffirm their preeminent positions in the world of higher education.
“Online technology could have the same impact on education as the printing press,” Agarwal said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, Yale University caused a stir with the announcement of an ambitious new project in Singapore—an undergraduate campus co-sponsored with National University of Singapore to be called Yale-NUS. Since then, Yale has been widely hailed as heralding a new era in education, as it is the first Ivy League institution to build an overseas campus for undergraduates bearing its name.
Soon after the announcement of Yale-NUS in September 2010, Harvard University President Drew G. Faust quietly formed a committee called the International Strategy Working Group. Its recommendations, finalized in October 2011, have remained confidential.
But Harvard’s stance on one front has become clear: At a time when some universities are expanding their physical footprint abroad, Harvard remains committed to keeping its undergraduate student body firmly rooted in Cambridge.
In an interview last week, Faust confirmed that Harvard will not look to establish undergraduate campuses abroad, a choice that some think is wise in light of the recent controversies surrounding Yale’s new venture.
“I’m not in the McDonald’s franchising business,” said Jorge I. Dominguez, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs.
But the decision also raises questions about how Harvard should interact with the rest of the world and whether the University has a strategy behind its seemingly ad hoc approach to international engagement.
THE IVY LEAGUE, MADE IN SINGAPORE
In January 2009, President of Yale Richard C. Levin and President of the National University of Singapore Tan Chorh Chuan met for tea in Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum. During the meeting, they dreamed up a plan for a global college, planting the seeds of an idea that would one day grow into the Yale-NUS campus in Singapore.
About eighteen months later, Levin sent a prospectus outlining the plans to Yale faculty. He noted that NUS and Singapore’s Ministry of Education would “reimburse Yale for all costs incurred.” He also emphasized that graduates of the school would receive diplomas from Yale-NUS, not Yale College, and that Yale-NUS would hire its own faculty. While “there is no urgency for Yale to venture abroad with a new campus now,” Levin explained, “we do believe it is inevitable that the world’s leading universities by the middle of this century will have international campuses.”
Yale’s interest in Asia is part of a larger trend in higher education, according to Jason E. Lane, an expert on international education at the Institute for Global Education Policy Studies at State University of New York.
Cornell and Georgetown have established a Medical College and a School of Foreign Service, respectively, in Qatar. “For our leading universities, the world has become a much more important market,” said Lane.
New York University is largely credited with leading the way in undergraduate education abroad. The school opened NYU Abu Dhabi in 2010 and will open NYU Shanghai next year. Unlike Yale-NUS, NYU’s international campuses are fully integrated into the NYU system and grant true NYU degrees. For NYU President John Sexton, the motivation was to become “the world’s first global university” and to make bold moves to compete with the “holy trinity” of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
But the project has not been embraced by all. NYU has been accused of spreading itself too thin across its campuses and of “selling out” to the government of Abu Dhabi, which is underwriting the entire cost of the project.
Like Sexton, Levin has faced his fair share of criticism for Yale-NUS, indicating that there is a lack of consensus in the academic community about the future of global learning in higher education.
THE CRITICS
While some lauded Yale-NUS as a groundbreaking endeavor, many members of the Yale community expressed deep concerns that the liberal arts would be compromised on a campus overseen by a regime which severely limits freedom of speech and even criminalizes homosexuality.
Proponents of Yale-NUS are quick to note that Yale’s agreement with Singapore includes strict guarantees for free speech within the confines of the campus. But opponents insist that an environment of censorship off-campus is antithetical to the principles of liberal arts education.
In recent months, critics within the Yale faculty have gained support. In April—more than a year after the formal announcement of the project—Yale College faculty passed a controversial resolution expressing concern over the “history of a lack of respect for civil and political rights” in Singapore and urged that liberal arts values “not be compromised.”
Because the campus is a project of the Yale Corporation, it never required faculty consent, which surprised and upset some professors.
“The problem is that the places these universities have been going—the wealthy, undemocratic societies that are able to foot the bills—bring compromises as well as possibilities,” said Yale professor Christopher L. Miller. “Our name should not be sold without our consent.”
However, sociology professor Deborah S. Davis, who is co-chair of the Faculty Search Committee for the Social Sciences of Yale-NUS, emphasized that Yale-NUS is distinct from Yale in New Haven. “It has nothing to do with Yale. It’s not a branch campus. It’s not Yale College,” she said.
Indeed, Yale’s expansion abroad may be a way of marketing the university, according to Richard Edelstein, an expert on international education at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, at Berkeley. “There is a business strategy dimension to this that is clearly at play,” he said. “The question is whether it really advances the institutions’ interests.”
Regardless of concern over the use of the Yale name, this question of how the new campus aligns with Yale’s mission remains the focus.
“[Yale’s] mission is not to educate the entire world. The mission is to turn out good scholars and citizens,” said Yale English professor Mark Oppenheimer.
DEFINING HARVARD’S BORDERS
Yale’s pioneering moves in Singapore have led to discussion in both New Haven and Cambridge about the benefits of establishing a physical presence abroad. But while Yale forges ahead with its new campus, Harvard plans to strengthen its existing framework and connections rather than build from scratch.
“We don’t want to just focus on one area of the world and put a disproportionate part of our attention on one location in which we invest a huge amount of our effort,” said Faust. “We would rather support activity much more broadly.”
Dominguez described the opening of campuses abroad a “fad,” and he said that Harvard is not interested in jumping on the bandwagon.
“It simply became clear that it was not just something that we didn’t want to do, but that there were a lot of other, better things we could do,” said Dominguez. He added that pouring resources into a single physical facility may actually limit the range of opportunities for students and faculty abroad.
According to Faust, Harvard’s goals are best achieved by connecting the Harvard community with programs, collaborations, and partnerships abroad. She specifically cited edX—Harvard’s new online learning tool created with MIT—as an example of using technology to cross borders. And while Faust does not support building a full-fledged campus abroad, she has been an advocate of tempered expansion overseas, noting Harvard’s international offices, which serve as a home base for students interns and faculty researchers.
Other University leaders and faculty members have expressed opposition to establishing a campus abroad, which they believe would diminish the meaning of “Harvard.”
Professor Harry R. Lewis, former dean of Harvard College, emphasized that some forms of expansion abroad could undercut the institution’s fundamental values. “I hope that [Harvard] would not follow Yale’s lead in creating a college campus with the Harvard name based in a country that does not hold to the standards of free speech and free inquiry,” he said.
“If you take Harvard out of Cambridge, it’s no longer Harvard,” said Lane. “You risk diluting what it means to be a Harvard undergraduate when you begin setting up campuses overseas.”
However, according to Fernando M. Reimers, a professor of international education at the Graduate School of Education, concerns about diluting the Harvard brand could impede necessary evolution. “Education can and should be reinvented,” Reimers said. “We don’t want people to look at us as the dinosaurs that never adapted.”
Indeed, some remain concerned that Harvard does not have the central infrastructure in place to craft a comprehensive international strategy given the University’s decentralized nature. William C. Kirby, chairman of the Harvard China Fund and former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, noted that while other universities have large offices devoted to global strategy and planning, Harvard only has a small number of people in charge of determining the University’s international strategy.
Dominguez agreed, noting that the office of international affairs is comprised of just two other staff members aside from himself.
“To the extent that there is a legitimate criticism of what we’re doing,” he said, “it’s that we’re understaffed for the hopes that our undergraduates, our faculty, and our students have for the future of Harvard.”
Indeed, with the dissolution of the International Strategy Working Group, the fact that there is no centralized University body or forum for such discussion may be a cause for concern. “Unless there is some sense of where the University as a whole might be going, then you will see a proliferation of small Harvard offices all over the world, with potentially little communication between them, all of them reputationally carrying the Harvard name,” said Kirby. “You can already see that happening, and it’s worth contemplating whether that’s the future of our international strategy. I don’t think it will be.”
Like Yale, Harvard administrators also remain unsure to what extent the faculty will have a formal voice in any process of international expansion.
“It is always a smart thing to talk to faculty and to have formal processes to get their opinion,” said Kirby, “because you’re going to hear their opinion one way or another.”
A GREATER GLOBAL PRESENCE
At the heart of Harvard’s strategy is a philosophy of prudence—a conservative approach that recognizes potential opportunities without throwing caution to the wind. As Krishna G. Palepu, Faust’s senior adviser for global strategy said, “the most important thing we are doing is making sure that we understand our goals before we jump into any actions or initiatives.”
Some have urged Harvard to exercise caution in the wake of Yale’s gamble in Singapore.
“Harvard’s restraint strikes me as wise rather than backwards,” said Miller. “If Harvard can resist the Kool-Aid of empire-building...the institution will be much better off than Yale.”
Indeed, fundamental questions remain over the benefits of physical expansion abroad. According to Edelstein, Levin’s forecast that the world’s leading universities will all have international campuses by 2050 is “a bit unrealistic.”
“It’s not likely to happen in any large numbers, because I think the risks and costs are becoming more apparent,” he said. “You have to do something to be relevant, but what you do remains an open question.”
As the strategies of the nation’s top Universities diverge over the next few years, the advantages of each approach will soon become apparent.
“In the next five, 10, or 50 years, some of these decisions regarding internationalization will have a significant impact,” warned Edelstein. “If there are any leaders that ignore this at Harvard or Yale, they do so at their own peril.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The game’s set-up is simple. One table, a few red cups aligned to form a triangle, and two ping-pong balls are the basics required for college students to play beer pong.
While the rules may not be complicated—players throwing a ping-pong ball into a cup at the other end of the table with the intent of making members of the other team drink—its competitive edge raises questions regarding its place within Harvard’s new alcohol policy.
For the first time in Harvard’s history, the College introduced an extensive alcohol policy in March that prompts stricter regulations on excessive and underage drinking and standardizes the alcohol policy between Harvard’s 12 Houses. The policy is the result of a long tug-of-war between students and administrators over alcohol’s place in the Harvard undergraduate community.
The new policy does not appear to resemble anything that has come before it. Almost mimicking the game of pong, the policy’s language goes back and forth between specificity and vagueness, teetering on a thin line between providing a unified set of rules and leaving room for interpretation.
CREATING THE POLICY
Administrators have said in the past that concerns about students’ health alone prompted their formation of a new policy. Since 2008, admittances to University Health Services due to alcohol-related sicknesses have been on the rise. In the 2010-11 fall semester, admittances had almost reached the total of the entire 2009-10 academic year.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds emphasizes that the policy’s main goal is to teach responsible drinking.
“Our goal is have a policy that helps everyone be responsible to themselves, to their friends and to the community, that reduces high-risk drinking and that complies with the legal drinking age. Every year we’re going to keep working at this, to help people be better educated and to try and support a culture where there’s more responsible and healthy attitudes,” Hammonds says. “Every year we’re going to keep working at this, to help people be better educated and to try and support a culture where there’s more responsible and healthy attitudes.”
In March 2011, Hammonds began her crackdown on underage and excessive alcohol drinking by publishing an op-ed in The Crimson the day before river run—a tradition in which students take shots of hard liquor in front of the House they hope to live in the following academic year. Hammonds then sent a memo to House Masters in March of last year, asking for more consistency in their enforcement of alcohol policy.
A few weeks later the Pforzheimer House Committee canceled its biannual Pfoho Golf event—a drinking game in which students travel to designated rooms called “holes” and drink either alcoholic or non-alcoholic refreshments at each stop. At the time, the House Masters said the organization of the activity did not follow the College’s ID-checking policy for House-sponsored events and promoted drinking as sport.
But one of the biggest shocks to students came at the end of the month when the College announced that hard liquor was no longer allowed at off-campus House formals. Previously, the administration had drawn the line at on-campus House formals only. A year earlier, in April 2010, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson announced the College’s ban on hard liquor from on-campus formals after the Cambridge License Commission stopped issuing all-liquor licenses to students.
The policy change disgruntled some students, including those who found formals to be a safer space for drinking activities than off-campus options. These students argue that ever-more stringent alcohol regulation at college-sponsored events increases the relative attractiveness of final clubs, where alcohol flows more freely.
But because final clubs are outside the scope of Harvard’s jurisdiction, administrators find themselves in a difficult position in trying to fulfill students’ social demands while ensuring that they follow Massachusetts law.
“Students sometimes want to push the limits of how much they can drink, and we want to push the idea that it’s possible to drink responsibly.” Hammonds says.
COMPROMISE?
Hammonds commissioned an alcohol committee headed by Cabot Co-House Master Rakesh Khurana and Nelson. The committee began formulating ideas in November 2011 of what the alcohol policy might look like by hosting seven open meetings for students to share their opinions. Very few students showed up to the gatherings, leading the committee to distribute an online survey for students instead.
Despite the low turnout, Hammonds said that most of the new policy was shaped by student input. House Committee co-chairs and administrators pointed to the reintroduction of mixed drinks at House Formals next academic year as evidence of collaboration and compromise. The inclusion of mixed drinks is considered a pilot program, intended to provide students with a chance to demonstrate responsible drinking. The policy states that the alcoholic beverages must contain mixers and no more than one standard measure of alcohol and must be served by a licensed bartender.
While the new policy creates opportunities for controlled drinking at on-campus events, administrators have taken steps to tighten their grip on alcohol in private settings. Currently, students can find information on the College’s stance on alcohol in the Harvard Student Handbook. The handbook states that underage drinking is prohibited, as determined by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and roughly outlines the steps that administrators may take if a student is caught repeatedly drinking excessively. The amnesty policy, which promises that there will be no disciplinary action against intoxicated students who seek medical attention and those who help them, is also outlined in the handbook.
The new policy specifies the kind of drinking habits that are prohibited on campus stating, “Activities that promote high-risk drinking, such as excessive and/or rapid consumption of alcohol, particularly of a competitive nature, are not permitted.” Hammonds says that the rule is meant to provide a universal guideline to House Masters and tutors for determining what behaviors should be considered infractions. The statement’s broadness, she says, gives House Masters the freedom to maintain the character of their community.
“While administrators across the residential system are working to promote the core principles of student health and safety, I think people are also trying to be very creative and attentive in the ways they incorporate those principles to their own local culture.”  Hammonds says.
But as the policy has yet to be implemented, tutors grapple with how they will enforce the policy once it takes effect. The policy requires students to meet with tutors before they host their first private party of an academic year. A private party is defined as an event in a student’s room or suite where guests are allowed in by personal invitation only. What is entailed in these conversations may vary from House to House, suggesting that the policy may not be able to achieve the standardization it strives for.
“If the College should decide to leave the specific response to a drinking game to the tutor checking in on the party, I imagine the intent would be to enable that tutor to evaluate the situation’s safety in totality, and to keep tutors out of the business of looking for specific infractions,” says Benjamin Rahn, a tutor in Pforzheimer House. Many other tutors declined to comment or did not respond to requests for interviews for this article.
Resident Dean of Adams House Sharon L. Howell says she supports the policy and will actively work to discourage drinking games.
“That doesn’t mean that we’ll be coming down like a ton of bricks on people. Our responses will be temperate and proportional. That’s what the language says,” Howell says.
WINNING
In the first week of April, a total of five students attended three focus groups hosted by the alcohol committee directed to gain feedback on the College’s newly released alcohol policy. As a result, the policy will be presented in its current form to faculty next year. Pending faculty approval, the policy will be added to the student handbook.
In the next academic year, students, tutors, House Masters, and administrators may have to work to find a balance between standardizing the policy while also allowing authority figures to evaluate infractions on a case-by-case basis. As the policy takes effect in the next academic year, administrators and students will be forced to navigate the new rules in an effort to have fun, safely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twice each week, on Monday afternoons and Thursday mornings, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds brings together five of her closest advisers for a policy pow-wow in her University Hall office.
These conversations, Hammonds wrote in an email, allow her to “discuss at a high level” issues that affect student life, like winter break programming and alcohol policy, with divisional heads of the College.
During the early years of her deanship, Hammonds’ Cabinet included her senior adviser, Paul J. McLoughlin II, and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, who both were often praised for their direct engagement with undergraduates.
Now, four years into Hammonds’ tenure as dean of the College, her trusted Cabinet is in a state of flux.
After McLoughlin’s resignation last August and Nelson’s departure this June, Hammonds will have lost two of her foremost advocates for students.
Hammonds, who named “campus community” as one of her top priorities for the upcoming year, said that these personnel changes will not alter the way she runs the College.
“I feel very strongly that the students should feel that they have an ally in any member of the Harvard College staff,” Hammonds wrote.
But in an administration where McLoughlin and Nelson formerly had the most direct contact with students, Hammonds may be forced to take on a more visible role on campus to replace them.
“Dean Hammonds is going to have to up her own ante in terms of interacting with students, now that she’s lost her longtime right-hand man and right-hand woman.” said former Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “It’s just a question of how she’s going to do it, not whether she’s going to do it, given her priorities and her commitment to student voice in College affairs.”
Members of her inner circle suggest she is up to the task. In Cabinet meetings, Associate Dean of the College Joan Rouse said, Hammonds is “a great listener”—a quality, administrators say, that serves Hammonds well in her interactions with students.
But though Hammonds has said she is committed to improving student life, the task may be complicated by the fact that she is trying to listen to a demographic that is not even showing up to be listened to.
A LEARNING CURVE
When Hammonds began her tenure as the first female dean of the College in 2008, she arrived with little knowledge of Harvard’s undergraduate culture.
As a professor, Hammonds had worked primarily with graduate students. Unlike three of her recent predecessors, she did not attend the College.
When she was named to the deanship, Hammonds told The Crimson that she was still familiarizing herself with the details of Administrative Board reform and the College’s alcohol policy, prominent issues of the time.
Hammonds said she convened her Cabinet soon after beginning her tenure as dean.
Interviews with her colleagues and student leaders suggest that since then, Hammonds has become increasingly knowledgeable about student life.
“I would guess that she, as with any faculty member who wasn’t a House Master or something like that, came in with little idea how many student organizations there were or really the whole student life side of things,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, another Cabinet member. “She now knows it inside and out.”
CHANGING THE CHIEF OF STAFF
During his term as UC president, Ebrahim always knew who to go to when he wanted to convince Hammonds to accept a Council proposal.
He would reach out to McLoughlin, who became associate dean of the College and senior adviser when Hammonds took over as dean.
Before meeting with Hammonds, Ebrahim would talk to McLoughlin to fine-tune his proposal and make it more appealing.
“We found that she was much more likely to agree to our initiatives if we ran them by Dean McLoughlin first,” Ebrahim said. “Dean McLoughlin had her ear in a way not a lot of other people did.”
During his time at Harvard, McLoughlin was known as a student ally who worked extensively on social space, winter break, and Opening Days programming for the College. Though not all his ideas, like the creation of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, were popular in the long run, he was a critical peg in carrying out Hammonds’ commitment to listening to students.
In August, McLoughlin stepped down from his role in the College to teach graduate students at Boston University. He has since been named dean of students at Lafayette College.
In November, Hammonds chose Rouse—who worked in administration at Columbia for eight years before coming to Harvard—to fill one of McLoughlin’s two roles, the associate dean position.
Rouse, who had been hired as Hammonds’ executive assistant only a month before she was promoted to associate dean, now serves essentially as Hammonds’ chief of staff.
Speaking of her desire to get to know more students, Rouse wrote in an email, “This is truly the part of my job that I enjoy the most.” She mentioned a ROTC training event where she recently enjoyed interacting with cadets.
Hammonds has not filled McLoughlin’s second position, senior adviser—and she says she does not need to.
Hammonds said that she has many advisers throughout the administration and added that despite his job title, McLoughlin was never her only “senior adviser.”
McLoughlin declined a request to comment for this article.
MS. NELSON IS MISSING
When a group of discontented students were chanting slogans and pitching tents outside of University Hall, the College sent Nelson out into the crowd to be its messenger to Occupy Harvard.
Ebrahim speculated that Nelson was chosen to represent the College during the tense negotiations that night “because we see her as the most genuinely empathetic administrator.”
“It was a testament to the way administrators relied on her even in the testiest times,” Ebrahim said.
During her seven years in the College administration, Nelson was very often “behind the scenes helping others to plan events, programs, and opportunities for students,” she wrote in an email.
In March, Nelson announced her decision to leave Harvard for Colgate University, where she has been named vice president and dean of Colgate College.
Calling Nelson’s departure a huge loss for the College, Ebrahim said, “Whether they bring in someone new or promote internally, no one would have the rapport that Dean Nelson built up with students over seven years of service.”
Harris said he thought that the gap left by Nelson would require other administrators to take over additional job duties. “There are still plenty of people who are staying behind who have expertise and experience.... They will surely be asked to step up a bit, and I am sure they will respond well,” he said, adding that Hammonds has acquired the student life expertise to take on some of Nelson’s work.
NOT MUCH TO HEAR
A UC-sponsored town hall meeting at which Hammonds, University President Drew G. Faust, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith spoke to undergraduates in October was the most visible of University Hall’s many efforts this year to convince students that administrators are listening to them.
In response to feedback from the Class of 2014, Hammonds wrote in a September email, the College extended Annenberg Hall’s hours until midnight to give freshmen a space to socialize. And in December, the College announced a new Task Force on Student Voice to discuss ways to enhance communication between administrators and students.
The College reached out to students throughout the year as it drafted its new alcohol policy and devised plans for the renovation of Old Quincy.
The administration held a series of evening meetings and opened an online comment box to solicit student feedback on drinking culture before releasing a new alcohol policy in March.
Administrators also held a number of informal meetings with Quincy residents to gather input on the furnishings and design of Old Quincy, which will be renovated next year.
Hammonds said she believes that the College’s efforts to engage the student body are leading students to speak up.
“I know that more students than ever before are taking advantage of the opportunity to visit me during office hours,” Hammonds wrote, adding that she is “always available to see any student who wishes to meet with me outside of office hours.”
But despite these many efforts by the administration to seek out student opinion, not all undergraduates feel the need to voice their views on College policy.
The seven alcohol meetings in the fall saw low attendance, drawing about 70 students in total. In April, the three meetings to allow students to vet the administration’s newly drafted alcohol regulations drew a total of five students.
“If you were to ask students what have been the College’s priorities the last few semesters, I don’t know if they could really answer that,” UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said.
For Bicknell, the student body is divided between the “500 students who really understand the College,” and the “6,000 students” who do not understand or do not actively engage with the administration.
Bicknell said he thinks engaging the latter group of students is one of the biggest challenges facing the College.
“Going to meetings shouldn’t be a barrier to entry,” Bicknell said. “You don’t want to build a self-selecting community.”
Many students, Bicknell said, have trouble squeezing the administration’s public forums into their already packed schedules.
Catherine A. Brown ’14, who plays lacrosse and participates in ROTC, is one such busy student.
Brown said that her life on campus is too hectic to attend Hammonds’ office hours or other College meetings.
“I think the College definitely tries really hard to make students welcome in that process,” she said. “I didn’t take advantage of it because I have a lot of other things to worry about.”
Brown said that many of her athlete friends were also unable to attend the College’s various town halls this year.
“If the meeting is at 6 p.m., if you play a sport, you’re probably not going to be able to go, and certainly not commit to going,” she said.
Bicknell said that this issue could be remedied if administrators facilitated more casual interactions with students.
Pforzheimer House Committee Co-Chair Christine J. Hu ’13 said she was happy when she heard that Hammonds came to a dinner with students in her House and added that she would like to see the dean become even more visible on campus.
“If Dean Hammonds were to assume some of [Nelson’s] roles, I’d be really excited to work with her,” Hu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Class of 2012, the banging of heavy machinery and the dust of construction have been a part of everyday life in Harvard Square. Since this year’s graduating class arrived on campus, the Square has received a series of drastic face lifts.
This roadwork and improvement is part of a long-term effort to beautify Harvard Square that all stems from “Polishing the Trophy,” a plan published in the late 1990s for refurbishing Cambridge’s preeminent hub of tourism and intellectual life.
In the past decade, this beautification process has seen collaboration between the city, the Harvard Square Business Association, and Harvard—all acting as what Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard’s director of community relations for Cambridge, refers to as “ongoing stewards of the Square.”
But though these stewards have accomplished much in the past several years, community members have now proposed a still more ambitious plan that would bring the most visible change yet to Harvard Square. If adopted, it will transform Sheldon Cohen Island, the stretch of red brick home to Out of Town News, the Pit, and the MBTA station.
Made public just this week , this project—if approved by the city—would check off one of the last boxes remaining on a list that Cambridge has used to guide its improvement of Harvard Square since 2006.
YEARS IN THE MAKING
The city government, Harvard Square Business Association, and the University have spent the past decade carefully planning the improvement of public space in Harvard Square.
The effort, informally known as the Harvard Square beautification project, was conceived in the late 1990s. At that time, Harvard Square had not seen major construction since the 1980s, when the Harvard Square MBTA stop was redone.
Beautification first became a topic of discussion when city officials began to seriously consider making Harvard Square a Business Improvement District, a designation signalling an area’s need for revitalization.
Though the city ultimately did not designate Harvard Square as a BID, its consideration inspired John P. DiGiovanni, president of Trinity Property Management, and other Square business owners to take a hard look at the Square’s aesthetic and structural deficiencies.
These discussions culminated in the creation of a booklet of plans called “Polishing the Trophy: A Strategic Plan for Competitive Advantage and Asset Preservation in Harvard Square,” which was presented to the Cambridge City Council in January 1998.
“Harvard Square is a trophy, and it is up to those who participate in its daily life to keep it polished,” the report stated. The preliminary plan called for improved streets, sidewalks, and lighting.
After this presentation, the city appropriated $500,000 and appointed a 15-member committee to study the public space in the Square and create a master plan of improvements, according to DiGiovanni.
The committee included business owners, city officials, and representatives from Harvard University, including Lucey.
While the construction projects would directly affect Harvard, the University decided that it would be a collaborator but not a leader in the process.
“We want to be a stakeholder, not the stakeholder,” Lucey says.
From 2000 to 2004, the committee hammered out its plans for beautification and improvement. In 2005, it handed over the reins to the city government, which then spent the following year soliciting feedback from community members.
The series of public meetings concluded with the creation of a document known as the Harvard Square Initiative.
“I’ve been pleased and impressed with the diligence and the detail that was put in those four-plus years of meetings,” says DiGiovanni, who has played a major role in the beautification process since its inception.
“We need to treat it, in my opinion, as good stewards, as the historic, urban, authentic center that it is,” he adds.
BRICK BY BRICK
Thus far, the beautification process has consisted of three phases of construction.
The first phase, in 2006, made the most-needed improvements: the repavement of several busy streets and the creation of a brick plaza in front of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
“Before, that was wide and open. There was no easy access to cross. By adding that island, it helped pedestrian improvement and improved the aesthetics of area,” says Katherine F. Watkins, supervising engineer at the Cambridge Department of Public Works.
Harvard contributed $1.3 million to help jump-start the beautification process.
University leaders felt especially compelled to fund the project during this phase since it significantly affected students’ safety, Lucey says.
After the first phase was completed in the fall of 2007, the second part of the improvement process—the construction of a “super crosswalk” across JFK Street in the heart of Harvard Square—commenced shortly thereafter.
Once the crosswalk was completed in 2008, the city took a step back to consider its next move.
After much internal consulting, according to Watkins, the city launched the most recent phase of construction in 2010.
This third phase, which will be completed in the next few weeks, included the repaving of Plympton, Linden, Dunster and portions of JFK Street. It also features the relaying of the brick sidewalks and updating of street lamps along those streets.
All of these improvements have had to go in front of the Cambridge Historical Commission for approval, since Harvard Square is designated a conservation district.
According to Charles M. Sullivan, the executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, the sidewalks were one of the most controversial aspects of the project, inspiring much discussion about building materials. While bricks do meet all federal and state requirements for accessibility, some advocated for concrete sidewalks.
Laura E. Donohue ’85, the owner of Bob Slate Stationer, says that she appreciates the classic look of the granite and brick in Harvard Square. “It makes the Square look updated and historic at the same time, a vintage, timeless look. I would not want cement sidewalks. I love the bricks.”
She and her fellow brick advocates eventually won out.
Sullivan says that the update of Palmer Street just off of Brattle Street, which was part of the first phase, was also a hot-button issue. City planners wanted to replace the street’s bricks and cobblestones with decorative pavement designed by a New York-based artist, a plan that gained approval only after much discussion.
Cambridge officials have been mindful of keeping the community apprised of the construction projects. Regular emails have informed local residents and business owners of progress and plans.
“I feel like they’ve done a great job at achieving more of a balance then they’ve done in the past, keeping interest for residents, not everything geared to tourists,” says Robyn Culbertson, executive director of the Cambridge Office for Tourism.
PLANNING FOR A PIT STOP
With three phases of construction complete, Cambridge will continue street improvements but also take on larger public spaces left untouched by the beautification process so far.
In phase four of the plan that has long been in progress, the city will improve the portion of Mount Auburn Street between JFK and Holyoke Streets by repaving the street surface and laying new sidewalks.
In the past year, members of the former planning committee have also convened again to devise the most ambitious beautification project to date: a complete overhaul of Sheldon Cohen Island.
This new plan—the brainchild of DiGiovanni, Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson, and other community members—would realize goals set down by the Harvard Square Initiative, the 2005-06 document issued after a year of community meetings.
The Initiative proposed the creation of a high-tech visitor center and called for “an interactive and automated digital display in a central Harvard Square location that provides visitor and event info.”
The current proposal recommends that the Out of Town News kiosk be converted to a glass-walled information center with interactive features like those laid out in the earlier document.
The plan also suggests that the Pit be spruced up with stadium seating, shrubbery, LED floor lights, a flat-screen display, and patio tables and chairs.
The new plan, if adopted, will bring much-needed attention to an area that has not seen major improvement in the past two decades, Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy says.
“That’s a focal point of Harvard Square that needs some sprucing up,” Healy says.
Though the plan’s developers have approached City Council members, the city has yet to officially adopt the proposal or set aside funding for it, according to Healy.
Despite the major construction projects ahead, Harvard Square stakeholders have said they do not expect the essence of Harvard Square to change dramatically.
“It’s like Harvard. It doesn’t really change,” Donohue says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 26 months since its passage, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called “Obamacare,” has revolutionized healthcare and insurance practices across the nation and triggered rancorous political debate. Although most of its provisions have yet to take effect, both health care providers and employers have scrambled to comply with the requirements of the act by the time each requirement becomes operative within the next few years.
But for Harvard, the act does not spell chaos or upheaval. In fact, Harvard’s own healthcare services and insurance programs will hardly require any retooling at all, because the University is already in compliance with Massachusetts’s 2006 healthcare reform law, which overlaps substantially with the act.
Nevertheless, the act has provided an opportunity for students and researchers at Harvard to examine existing healthcare regimes and the state of public health in the United States, shedding light on the flaws and advantages of the sweeping reforms ushered in by the Affordable Care Act.
AHEAD OF THE CURVE
Since the Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama, it has implemented policies aimed at reducing costs and increasing care for seniors, preventing discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions, expanding coverage for young adults, and lowering healthcare premiums.
During the height of negotiations, John E. McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health, was in the eye of the storm. While assisting the Senate from 2008 to 2010 as a policy adviser, McDonough helped to fine tune the act in the run up to its passage in March 2010.
McDonough describes the goal of the Affordable Care Act as striving to create “comprehensive reform of the U.S. health system, to improve access to health insurance, to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care, and to control the rising rate of healthcare costs.”
Next year, the act will provide more funding for state Medicaid programs and children’s health insurance. In 2014, the act will eliminate annual limits on services, provide tax credits, and mandate individual coverage. In 2015, it will tie physician payment to quality of care.
For many institutions across the country these changes will require considerable administrative reorganization. But for those based in Massachusetts, the required changes will be relatively minor.
The Massachusetts healthcare reform law, enacted by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2006, improved access to health care by creating a state-operated health insurance exchange and providing subsidies for middle- and low-income individuals. It also required all adult residents of the state to have insurance. Compliance with this existing law has allowed for a smoother transition to the Affordable Care Act for employers and healthcare providers across the state.
Michael E. Chernew, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, described Massachusetts as already “far down the road” in complying with the Affordable Care Act requirements.
“Whatever one thinks about the Affordable Care Act, it is probably less relevant to Massachusetts,” Chernew says.
By virtue of its geographic location and its previous policies, Harvard also is far down the road in terms of compliance, steering clear of most of the reorganization that will take place at many other healthcare institutions.
CHECKING THE BOX
Although many Harvard students have engaged in heated debates about the act, they are unlikely to be directly affected by the legislation in their capacity as Harvard students.
The Harvard University Student Health Program will not require significant alterations to accommodate the changes mandated by the act because it is a self-insured student health plan, meaning that it provides both insurance and health care services to Harvard students.
By acting as both an insurer and a healthcare provider, Harvard University Health Services avoids many of the bureaucratic obstacles faced by institutions that play only one of those roles. However, members of Harvard’s federal relations team had to inquire with Washington policymakers to seek clarity about what the act would actually mean for institutions of higher education, according to Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.
Many of the requirements of the act—which include providing preventative care at no cost, accepting individuals with pre-existing conditions, and eliminating lifetime or annual dollar limits—were already in effect in the Harvard University Health Student Program before the act became a law, according to Lindsey Garofalo, communications officer for HUHS.
The Student Health Planning Committee had voluntarily made changes that were in line with the requirements of the act well before its passage, Garofalo wrote in an email. However, students may feel the effects of the act after graduating from Harvard.
The act expanded coverage for young people, allowing individuals under the age of 26 to remain on their parents’ health insurance plans. For young adults in Massachusetts, who are already required by law to be insured, this provision means that they will no longer be required to purchase individual health plans for several years after graduating from college.
Many Harvard professors agree that the act will have only minor effects on the University, both in absolute terms and compared to similar institutions in other states.
According to Meredith B. Rosenthal, professor of health economics and policy at HSPH, the act was “politically designed to have modest effects on everyone other than the uninsured.”
Rosenthal says she believes that the most noticeable effect of the act will be the elimination of co-pays in recommended preventative care. Before the act, individuals were expected to pay part of the cost of the treatment.
“Many of the changes are subtle, but cumulatively, it makes a difference for a lot of people,” Rosenthal says.
THE ACT UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
Despite the limited repercussions at the University itself, many professors at HSPH have recently focused their research on the implications of the act, putting Harvard at the forefront of the academic debate about the act.
Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at HSPH, released a paper last summer showing that increased access to Medicaid resulting from the act did not decrease costs, but rather caused them to increase. This finding contradicted claims made by proponents of the act, who believed that an increase in preventive treatment would result in lower total spending by reducing the number of emergency room visits.
Although the price of care rose significantly, Baicker found that people were reporting improved health and fewer financial strains associated with healthcare costs.
Rosenthal’s research has examined the shared savings program for accountable care organizations, an initiative that links pay to quality of care rather than number of visits. Rosenthal says that the delivery system and payment reforms stipulated by the act will improve management and quality of health care.
“I shudder to think that that could be annulled,” Rosenthal says, referring to the pending Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the law.
Many of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and depending on the political climate, they may never be enacted. In addition to the Supreme Court’s consideration of the act, Congress may also pose a threat to its continued existence. With the fall 2012 election on the horizon, the Democrats’ position in congress is precarious. With enough votes, Republicans may be able to repeal the act before many of its provisions come into effect.
Chernew admits that the Affordable Care Act requires a “considerable federal investment” and says that it is not clear that the country is willing to finance it.
“Although it’s certainly not clear that people have a better alternative,” Chernew says.
Aside from their individual research, Harvard professors have also been involved in ongoing discussions about implications of the Affordable Care Act. In March, the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative, a public policy forum for experts overseen by Harvard professors, debated the potential consequences of the act for the healthcare market.
According to HSPH professor and former dean Barry R. Bloom, academics can offer a more nuanced and objective perspective on healthcare policy than politicians and mainstream media outlets. But Bloom stresses that individuals should educate themselves about the subtleties of the act.
“[With] the idiocy that goes on in the public debate...It wouldn’t hurt anyone to know something,” Bloom said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard introduced its new Core Curriculum, then-University President Derek P. Bok tried to express the difficulty of overhauling the way Harvard educates College students.
“Changing undergraduate education,” he griped to the Washington Post, “is like trying to move a graveyard.”
That was 1979, and in the succeeding decades, that Core Curriculum too managed to become deeply rooted at Harvard. Then nearly thirty years later, administrators decided it was time to lay the foundation for a Harvard education anew all over again.
The resulting curriculum was the Program in General Education, which took full effect for the Class of 2013. The seniors graduating this year passed through Harvard just as the College shifted from a framework that focused on course content to one that emphasized learning methods instead. This class and the previous one had the option of fulfilling the requirements for either the old or new curriculum.
With the graduation of the Class of 2012, the Core is officially dead. But students have not quite grasped how the 56 percent of the senior class that chose Gen Ed is differently educated from their peers who stuck with the old formula. And professors still struggle to articulate the differences between Gen Ed and the Core, saying that the financial crisis that hit the College just as Gen Ed launched has hampered the new program’s potential for radical pedagogical change. As Harvard tolls the death knell of the Core, the community questions whether the College actually moved the graveyard all over again or just polished and rearranged the headstones.
TEACHING FOR THE REAL WORLD
According to Program in General Education Associate Director Anne Marie E. Calareso, the Gen Ed curriculum seeks to give students skills in “linking the arts and sciences with the 21st century world.” It was intended to enable students to leave college with skills to process information rather than with a specific body of knowledge.
“Gen Ed came in a post-September 11 moment of fear of how to handle the real world,” said Marc F. Aidinoff ’12, who wrote his Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on general education at post-war Harvard.
The eight required course categories of Gen Ed, geared toward preparing students to face the challenges of globalization, include Societies of the World, United States in the World, and Science of the Physical Universe.
“The resulting [Gen Ed] course list is eclectic, but the courses all center on a form of intellectual empathy, learning to think like someone who thinks very differently,” Aidinoff wrote in his thesis.
The Gen Ed curriculum aims to teach students “to connect academic work with the real world,” said Anne Harrington ’82, director of undergraduate studies in the history of science department.
In her Gen Ed course, Culture and Belief 34: “Madness and Medicine,” she discusses ways that psychiatry connects to beliefs, politics, and U.S. and European history.
“I’m very interested in connecting to these things far beyond the narrow medical sense,” Harrington said. She added that she feels “liberated...to be more directly engaging” in a Gen Ed class than in a departmental course.
Calling Gen Ed “an incubator,” she said that the institution of the new framework was an “ambitious change.” But she said that the effect of that change on professors’ teaching methods cannot yet be determined.
“Exactly how it will work, I think we’re at the beginning of that conversation,” she added.
THE APPLE DOESN’T FALL FAR
When asked about the reasoning behind their decision between the Core and Gen Ed, most seniors speak not of pedagogical distinctions but of practical considerations. Most chose the program that allowed them to take fewer courses to complete their requirements.
“I had fulfilled most of my requirements anyway. It wasn’t a great hassle to continue with the old curriculum,” said Catherine W. Yang ’12, who remained on the Core. “In terms of actual education, I don’t get the impression that it changed that much.”
“Honestly, they’re making very pragmatic decisions,” Aidinoff said.
The study cards of students who chose Gen Ed often looked quite similar to those of their peers on the Core. Not all Core courses were approved as Gen Ed classes, and many had to revise their syllabi to gain approval under the new system. But Calareso wrote that the Program in General Education ensured that every new course that was approved for the Gen Ed curriculum also received a designation into one of the categories of the Core.
A course might fit Gen Ed’s Ethical Reasoning requirement as well as the Core’s Moral Reasoning, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning as well as Quantitative Reasoning, Culture and Belief as well as Foreign Cultures. But not necessarily vice versa.
With such similar names and a concerted effort to ease the transition by making the same classes count for both plans, students find cause to question whether the students in the Class of 2012 who chose Gen Ed received a meaningfully different education.
FLIPPING THE CLASSROOM
Though students’ course selection might not look very different under Gen Ed, professors have seen a more significant set of options open up to them over the past three years of Gen Ed.
Under the new program, they are encouraged to try experimental teaching methods in order to win the Gen Ed stamp of approval for their classes. So far, those methods have included case studies and interactive activities to supplement the traditional lecture format.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that an education focused on methods of learning rather than specific bodies of knowledge is better suited to a rapidly changing world.
“This is a time of experimentation,” Harris said. “What does it mean to teach students who look at screens much more than they look at pages?”
“Gen Ed is a nice place for faculty to experiment,” he added. “For example, some have adopted elements of the flipped classroom, where lectures are posted online and classrooms are for discussion.”
Harris said that the Standing Committee on General Education, which approves courses for Gen Ed, will look to clarify the program’s requirements in the coming years based on the success of early Gen Ed courses.
“Did we frame some of these categories with the precision that we should have?” he asked.
Harris said he believes that the program’s transformative effect on undergraduate education has been muted by the economic downturn that coincided with the creation of Gen Ed and slowed faculty hiring.
“There are [faculty] searches going on all the time, but it’s mostly replacement. It will take a little bit longer than we had hoped to really develop,” he said.
While current faculty members have been encouraged to reinvigorate their teaching methods, Harris said, more new professors would be able to adapt faster to the mindset of the new curriculum and offer more Gen Ed classes.
Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said that he hopes to introduce livestreams of lectures and online sections in his course Culture and Belief 12: “For the Love of God and His Prophet: Religion, Literature, and the Arts in Muslim Cultures.”
“Lots of students don’t come to all the lectures,” Asani said, noting scheduling conflicts and time constraints. Because of Gen Ed, teachers “are not stuck to term papers and finals,” so busy students are “learning better.”
“I think the Gen Ed program, from my personal experience, is far superior to the Core,” Asani said.
“I’ve been able to implement better pedagogical approaches,” he added. “I think it helps people learn at a deeper level, with more personal engagement with the material. I see this in the [Q Guide] evaluations. Because of the new pedagogy, they find it personally transformative.”
Asani, at least, is confident that if the vision of Gen Ed is carried out to its full extent, real educational change will result.
“I would say they learn better,” he said. “It’s sort of obvious.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In March 2011, about 150 students from across Massachusetts flocked to Emerson College in downtown Boston for the annual College Democrats of Massachusetts convention.
On the second afternoon of the weekend-long summit, the undergraduates filed into a large lecture hall, awaiting the convention’s headliner, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren. As the U.S Senate candidate took the podium, the excited crowd erupted in applause.
Six months after declaring her candidacy for U.S. Senate and four months since taking a leave of absence from the Law School, Warren was back in the classroom—kind of.
Pacing back and forth at the front of the large lecture hall and gesturing to students in the audience, candidate Warren seemed more like Professor Warren on this afternoon. The lecture was politics 101, with great emphasis on how a smart girl from Oklahoma grew up to become a self-professed “fancy pants” professor at one of the world’s top law schools and later decided to run for U.S. Senate.
For those following her campaign, the story is now a familiar one. But Warren’s own telling leaves something out. Glossing over the time between her teenage years and Harvard, she neglects almost completely her meteoric rise through academia that landed her, in 1995, at Harvard and at the peak of her profession.
The road from professor to candidate has been a long one, filled with controversy and success. But by tracing her stepping-stones, the likeness between Warren today and the aspiring law student of 30 years ago becomes clear. As the 62-year-old has swapped out lectures for campaign speeches in recent months, the fixation of Warren the academic on bankruptcy and commercial law has become the Senate candidate’s platform to reclaim the middle class dream and a seat on Capitol Hill.
BREAKING THE MOLD
Academics like Warren are no strangers to politics. As advisers and appointed officials, professors often lend expertise to a perpetually fluctuating brain trust that waxes and wanes with the fate of each party. They are the force behind many of the commissions and agencies that make the government run.
Very few, however, actually run for office. In the past 100 years, the list of prominent professors who ran and won national office is brief, and the list of those who ran and lost is not much longer.
But if the nature of her profession alone makes Warren’s decision to run unique, her decision to build a campaign around the ideas that fueled her career has even less precedence.
Those professors who have run in Massachusetts, most notably H. Stuart Hughes and most recently Robert B. Reich, did so with little carry-over from their academic work and with little hope for victory.
The problem is that academia is notoriously difficult to translate into terms that non-academics can understand. Hughes largely side-stepped the issue by running for Senate as a candidate of the “New Left” in 1962 instead of as a professor. Reich embraced his academic past to a degree, but his political history was a stronger claim to legitimacy.
“People want to know relatively simply and straightforwardly what are the major points. You have to take the stuff that you would do as an academic and translate it into ways that are useful,” says G. Eric Brunstad, Jr., a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School who has co-authored with Warren.
According to professors who have worked with Warren at various points during her more than 30 years in academia, the skills and message Warren brings to the table is a useful one. Her experience, they say, does in fact lend itself to translation.
Warren is different from most of her Harvard Law School colleagues: She is one of only a handful of Ivy League professors who were not educated in the Ivy League themselves.
“Where she went to school, who she identifies with, her Oklahoma background—Liz is very much one of a kind,” University of Texas law professor Julius B. Getman says, adding that these distinctions may allow her to break the barrier into elective politics.
FIGHTING HER WAY UP
In 2009, when Warren was invited by her students to speak at Harvard Law School’s Class Day, she took the opportunity to state explicitly a message that she said was of utmost importance: Find work that you love. That message is, at least in practice, a defining aspect of Warren’s life, former colleagues say.
“You will spend a huge part of your life working,” Warren said in her speech. “The choices you make about the work you do will be the choices you make about who you are.... The work will shape who you become.”
Warren’s ascent to the ivory tower was long and meandering and began on the lowest rung. The daughter of working class parents, she worked hard through high school and at age 16 earned a scholarship to George Washington University. She took time off from college but eventually graduated from the University of Houston in 1970. She went on to study at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, where she was editor of the law review and found her first teaching position.
From Rutgers she moved to the University of Houston Law Center and then, in 1983, to the University of Texas, where she earned her first full tenured professorship and national clout.
As evidence of her growing reputation, in 1987 the University of Pennsylvania lured Warren and her second husband, fellow Harvard Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, to leave Texas. In 1995, Harvard recruited her from Penn. In less than 20 years, Warren had essentially climbed to the top of the tower. Those who worked with her along the way say she did it largely on her own.
“[W]hat was apparent from the beginning, she was a fighter,” Getman says. “Academics is filled with big and little battles, and it was clear Elizabeth Warren was a fighter.”
“You can tell people who are born to be law professors,” Warren said in a 1993 interview with The Crimson. “They think argument is the highest form of entertainment.”
Warren’s tough beginnings shaped the professor and researcher she is, says Texas law professor Jay L. Westbrook, who has co-authored several books on bankruptcy with Warren.
“I think it has made her an enormously well-rounded human being,” Westbrook says. “Even a lot of professors who are very concerned about the average person, it’s all from a distance, and for Elizabeth Warren it’s not. She really has a powerful sense of being an ordinary person who had opportunities and took them.”
A HARD LOOK AT REALITY
If Warren’s path to the Ivy League is unorthodox, so too has been her research in the fields of bankruptcy and commercial law.
Warren is an empiricist, who places more emphasis on the actual data than economic theory, something former colleagues say is quite rare. Even less common, Warren has made it her mission to make her findings accessible for those outside her cloistered profession.
“Her academic work is distinguished by actually looking at reality,” says Getman, who helped advise Warren’s research at Texas. “She was an empiricist before empiricism was cool, and she was a kind of empiricist who looked into the lives of everyday people.”
This kind of work, Brunstad says, flushes out much of the otherwise untested commercial theory favored by bankruptcy scholars. Often, the results are not what those scholars expected.
“There are some people who do it, but it takes a lot of time and a lot of resources. You never know exactly what you’re going to get when you strike out to do empirical work,” Brunstad says. For that reason most academics avoid empirical research.
With the help of Westbrook and others, Warren penned articles, textbooks, sourcebooks, and several popular self-help-style finance books. She became an expert on the middle class and the challenges facing its continued existence. Her approach to studying people was novel and her resulting work became the groundwork for legislative reform starting in the 1990s.
The work also planted the initial political seeds in Warren.
She saw a financial crisis coming for America’s middle class long before 2008. When that crisis came around, her background earned her a job with the Troubled Assets Relief Program and gave rise to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“She has spent so much time and effort trying to figure out what’s actually going on for the average person,” said Brunstad. “It’s the average guy that she’s the champion of, not any sort of elite group or something like that.”
A career identifying problems and injustices has led to a second career trying to fix them.
“She really understands commercial law. She really understands how it works. She really understands what the consequences of what legislation would be,” Brunstad says. “If you’re having Congress pass laws it would be incredibly useful to have someone in detail understand how they work.”
MAKING THE JUMP
Even for professors like Warren whose work lends itself to the political process, the jump from academia to election politics is not easy. Warren’s transition has not been perfect, political analysts say, prone to the same mistakes made by first-time candidates.
“I see in her campaign the same problems that I see in every first-time candidate,” Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman says. “Unlike when you are selling a book and you are out there with a single issue, there’s nothing fair about campaigns.”
Political analysts and former colleagues say Warren’s teaching background may give her a leg up in overcoming the first-time hurdles. Warren’s role as a teacher is the essential style of her campaign, they say.
“She is a terrific teacher, and politics, for all of its downside, is in many ways a teaching process, trying to persuade people how things work in the world,” Westbrook says.
“There’s a huge connection between teaching and politics just in terms of being fully present, connecting with people, engaging, listening,” Kennedy school lecturer M. Marty Linsky says.
Warren’s teaching style is highly Socratic, built to engage students. When teaching first-year contracts classes, she employs a teaching assistant whose sole job is to make sure she calls on every student in the class at least once. That style, analysts say, works well on the campaign trail, and by all accounts Warren is good at it. At nearly every school she has taught, Warren has won the top teaching award. At Harvard, she has won it twice, which is unprecedented.
“She is certainly a natural teacher....The skill of explaining things to people in a way they understand it and get it, that is what brings together her teaching and her candidacy,” Getman says. “Most academics imagine that all you have to do is state something and people will understand it. Liz does not have that.”
Warren is more practiced in translating her work into clear and simple language than most academics, Linsky says, but she has still operated within a relatively cloistered world, and in almost every situation she has been the authority figure in the room.
The struggle to move beyond that authority—the interplay between her two identities and the transition from one to the other—will likely define Warren’s campaign and her chances of unseating Republican Senator Scott Brown.
“This is the part about running for office that’s so amazing: Running for office is an act of optimism,” Warren says. “To do this, I have to believe that change is possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two-and-a-half years before allegations of vomit omelets and waste-filled kiddie pools at Dartmouth fraternities made national headlines, Chris was vomiting cat food into a trash can in a dark basement in one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs.
As a newly selected member—called a “neophyte,” or “neo” for short—Chris would not be fully inducted into the club until he endured several weeks of initiation activities.
On that particular night of heavy drinking, Chris and 20 to 30 other neos were each given a can of cat food and told to finish it—no matter how many times they had to throw up. As the neos chugged beers, the older members stood behind them, spitting on them and yelling, “Keep going; don’t stop.”
Chris, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy, said he never felt demeaned by the process and he believes that initiation activities like these—which neos can theoretically opt out of—help to promote bonding among new members.
“I think people should know that hazing doesn’t happen at Harvard just for the sake of making kids do disgusting things,” Chris said. “The system we have in place does its job in creating strong groups of men and in creating strong friendships.”
All final clubs are different, with different initiation practices. And Chris’ experience is not representative of all clubs, or of the experience of all members.
But it is hard to know what activities clubs subject their members to. At Harvard, initiation processes at century-old final clubs are kept quiet, hidden behind locked doors, fifteen-foot fences, and the premise that secrecy reinforces exclusivity.
On the whole—among student organizations, athletic teams, Greek organizations, and even final clubs—hazing does not appear to be as central to campus culture as it reportedly is at other institutions such as Dartmouth, Cornell, Boston University, and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, all of which have seen major hazing scandals lead to damaging headlines and in some cases student deaths and arrests in the past 18 months.
Nevertheless, hazing quietly exists at Harvard, hushed up by students who have been told to keep mum. More than 75 students did not return calls or emails requesting interviews for this article, and an additional 30 student members of a wide range of organizations and clubs declined to comment.
The pervasive silence raises a number of troubling questions about the rites of passage taking place behind closed doors—and what power administrators have to preserve student safety if they cannot collect honest accounts of the rituals endured by new members of organizations every year.
HAZING, DEFINED
Every student organization, athletic team, and social club has its own initiation practices.
When he became a writer for the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, Michael was not allowed to leave the organization’s castle on Mount Auburn Street for a week during his initiation ceremony. Michael told his girlfriend his email password so she could send made-up excuses to his professors for missing class.
Michael, whose name has also been changed, said that he did not consume any alcohol during the entire week of initiation. Instead, he described the Lampoon’s initiation as “a mind game” and a form of “psychological hazing.”
“They’ll ask you your deepest, darkest secrets, then ridicule you based on what you told them,” Michael said. “It comes back to haunt you; the more they know about you, the more damaging it can be.” He said that during his week in the castle, he was prevented from sleeping for days.
Michael said that while other new members enjoyed it, he did not.
When asked about Michael’s experience, Lampoon President Owen T. L. Bates ’13 was vague about the nature of his organization’s initiation practices. Though he said the Lampoon tries to make the process “as positive an experience as possible,” he said the organization strives for “an equal blend of the Dartmouth initiation and the come-as-you-are initiation.”
According to Massachusetts law, hazing comes in many forms: everything from forced consumption of any food to isolation to lack of sleep. Massachusetts code defines hazing as “any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person.”
According to Marc Edelman, a law professor at Barry University who specializes in sports law, Massachusetts hazing laws are particularly stringent in comparison to other states.
For example, in Massachusetts, consent cannot be used as a defense; an action may be considered hazing even if a student agrees to partake in it. Massachusetts is also unusual because state law holds individuals responsible for failing to report witnessed incidents of hazing.
Thanks to these state laws, Harvard “needs to take far greater efforts to make sure its student body is aware of the legal implications of engaging in hazing activities,” Edelman said.
THE GOOD AND THE BAD
In September 2010, Chris received an envelope  under his door inviting him to participate in the several-month-long process known as punch, in which prospective final club members schmooze with current members in an attempt to curry enough favor to secure a spot in the club.
In November, after a series of punch events, club members arrived at Chris’s door after midnight, woke him up, and took him back to the clubhouse. Chris had been selected to join the club; he was no longer a punch, but now a neo. The members offered their congratulations and invited him to chug a few beers in celebration. It was a relatively tame start to a process that would intensify in the run-up to the final initiation dinner the following month.
Over the next few weeks, Chris was told to chug beer mixed with human dandruff and pubic hair, eat gin-soaked hamburger buns, and drink a soupy mixture that included hot sauce, raw eggs, butter, and milk. Some of the ingredients were gathered from House dining halls.
Chris’s initiation also included more benign but embarrassing activities, like wearing a dress for a day. But on a typical weeknight of initiation, Chris would drink about twenty beers in three or four hours. He frequently blacked out.
When a member of the Fox was asked if his club practiced any of the traditions that took place during Chris’s initiation, he said that the Fox does “nothing like that, ever.”
The presidents of the Owl, the Porcellian, and the Delphic declined to comment on their club’s policies regarding hazing. The presidents of the A.D., the Fly, the Fox, the Phoenix, and the Spee did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Chris said that he completed his initiation willingly and that the activities were safe.
“You just have to be careful and just look after your buddies and know when it’s a time to stop,” he said. He added that the older members did not play a harrowing role but a supportive one.
“These guys aren’t there to be an asshole to you,” Chris said. “They’re there to get you through the whole process.”
Many students emphasize that initiation activities serve to bring new members together.
“Little things, silly embarrassment is a great way to build community and get close to each other,” said Marissa C. Friedman ’14, a member of CityStep. According to Friedman, new CityStep members are asked to go on scavenger hunts, figure out riddles, and perform “a funny dance” in the Pit in Harvard Square at night.
CityStep co-directors Siva S. Sundaram ’13 and Todd G. Venook ’13 wrote in an email that community-building is “one of our highest priorities” in the process.
But even the “little things” are banned by some clubs.
All three of Harvard’s sororities are held to strict hazing standards by national sorority organizations that sometimes outdo the College’s regulations. While the Office of Student Life recommends scavenger hunts as an alternative to hazing on its website, Kappa Kappa Gamma forbids them explicitly.
But an official of one sorority said that she believes that some of the banned activities might help to build community.
“In some ways I wish my sorority did more hazing-type things,” as long as the activities would not endanger any of the participants, the official said.
Many other groups use their initiations as an opportunity to acquaint new members with the history of the organization.
Crimson Key, which coordinates campus tours and Freshman Week activities, requires new members to complete a scavenger hunt using clues drawn from Harvard’s history. At The Crimson’s Grand Elections ceremony, new staff members are quizzed on the newspaper’s history. Sigma Alpha Epsilon asks each new member to have meals with older members, attend weekly meetings about the chapter’s history, and bond through sports and other activities.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said that he draws the line at activities that make students feel uneasy. “You might be asked to wear scanty clothes and a strange hat all day or be asked to go sing songs on the steps of Widener. I wouldn’t characterize that as dangerous, but I think it can be demeaning and make you feel uncomfortable in a community where we would hope that you would feel fully at home, safe, understood,” he said.
CRACKING DOWN
In recent years the administration has attempted, with moderate success, to bring hazing to light by cracking down on both recognized and unrecognized student organizations.
Other universities—including Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania—leverage formal university recognition and real estate on campus to discourage social organizations like fraternities and sororities from hazing.
But at Harvard, where many of the offenders are unrecognized organizations, the negotiation process is more complicated.
In 2007, the Faculty Council voted to hold student organization leaders accountable for hazing and alcohol-related incidents that occurred at events hosted by the organization.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said that as long as alleged hazers are students, the University can hold them responsible for their actions.
This semester, the OSL relaunched a page on the hazing section of its website that allows students to confidentially report hazing. The reporting site, however, has received fewer responses than the traditional reporting mediums of email or in-person conversations, three administrators in the OSL wrote in an emailed statement.
Student group leaders of both recognized and unrecognized organizations are required to submit a non-hazing attestation form to the OSL by the end of September each year declaring that they have informed members about hazing law. The OSL also offers annual hazing prevention workshops to help student leaders design initiation events that do not violate hazing law.
In determining whether to discipline a student leader for a hazing incident at his or her organization, the OSL will consider the student’s participation in these workshops and other anti-hazing initiatives as “mitigating factors” that might reduce punishment, according to the statement by OSL administrators.
When Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson receives a report that an organization has violated hazing laws, she calls student leaders into her office to discuss the incident. Sometimes the conversation ends there, but it can lead to sanctions against the organization. If the report of hazing appears to be a violation, the case is passed to the Administrative Board to investigate.
According to Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, reports of hazing are “very rare.” If the Ad Board determines that hazing did occur, it reports the case to the Harvard University Police Department. HUPD in turn chooses whether or not to report the violation to the District Attorney’s Office, which may or may not prosecute the case. According to Lake, only serious instances of hazing—ordinarily only those that result in death or significant bodily harm—make their way to prosecutors.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said he would like to see the conversation directed toward helping students develop a strong sense of self-respect that would empower them to walk away from hazing.
“I know in my own day, if somebody had said, ‘You have to do this, that, or the other thing to be a member of this group,’ forgive me, I would have said, ‘Go screw yourself,’” Harris said. “That’s what I would have done and that’s what I expect students to do—you can’t be hazed unless you’re willing to be hazed.”
Harris said that hazing is not an issue that can be resolved by “threatening and disciplining” unless students stand up for themselves.
“The University has been doing this for a hundred years, and hazing has stayed here,” he said.
CLOSED DOORS
Chris, now a senior, said he has actively participated in initiating subsequent generations of neos. He has asked them to do his laundry several times, in addition to continuing the traditions from when he was a neo.
“This is the way things have been going on for so many years. It’s a tradition that we have, and it’s probably not something that’s going to change in the near future either,” Chris said.
Though Dingman said he thinks the College has made “huge headway” in educating students during Nelson’s tenure, he said that students often “aren’t particularly forthcoming” about hazing.
“I don’t know that we get as much good information as we would like,” Dingman said, speculating that some students may be reluctant to report incidents because they do not want to be disloyal or jeopardize their chances of becoming a member.
Prompted by a question from The Crimson about how the College educates incoming freshmen about hazing during Opening Days, Dingman said that he would reexamine the program to make sure that it sufficiently addresses the issue.
As of press time, Dingman had added a discussion of hazing education to the agenda of a staff meeting for members of the Freshman Dean’s Office this week.
As fraternities at Dartmouth and other institutions have recently had the doors pried open, baring their initiation rituals for all to see, their universities have been forced to try to mitigate public relations damage and address the underlying issues.
At Harvard, student leaders and administrators say they hope that they will not find themselves in a similar position.
“You know, knock on wood,” Dingman said, pausing to rap his knuckles against the wooden arm of his chair. “It’s always risky to suggest that we’re immune from these problems. I mean, something could burst at any point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Resting atop a piano in the Lowell House Junior Common Room is a pair of purple velvet Versace slippers that once belonged to the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes.
Every time Jonathan L. Walton, a resident scholar in Lowell and the newly appointed Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, walks by these slippers, he is reminded that he will never fill in the shoes of Gomes, both literally and figuratively.
“Here I am, wearing my white Adidas,” Walton says, lifting his seersucker slacks ever so slightly to reveal pristine white sneakers. “There will never be another Peter Gomes.”
Instead of trying to be the next Gomes and “being a fool in the process,” Walton says he—as a minister, a scholar, and a father of twins with a third child on the way—hopes to integrate the religious community into Harvard at large.
“I have the vision of Memorial Church as the Sanders Theatre of moral and ethical question, a place where our doors swing on welcome hinges,” Walton says. “Everyone may not belong to Memorial Church, but Memorial Church belongs to everyone.”
SOUTHERN ROOTS
Walton greets everyone he meets as brothers and sisters, shaking their hands with a firm grip and flashing a huge, genuine smile.
“It’s a Southern thing that extends from my Evangelical roots,” Walton says. “It is how I view the nature of humanity. I see all human beings as siblings under the parenthood of God.”
Walton graduated from Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta before attending Princeton Theological Seminary.
He previously served as the officiating pastor at Memorial West United Presbyterian Church in Newark, N. J., and guest-preached in Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, which was once led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.
At Harvard, Walton says that he hopes to convey the message that individuals should make “commitments to causes bigger than ourselves.”
“Love, justice, and service are not just abstract concepts and feel-good platitudes,” he says. “They are principles of a meaningful life.”
A RELATABLE LEADER
Walton’s interest in academic research and passion for interacting with students pulled him back to the ivy-covered towers of academia in 2010 as an associate professor at the Divinity School.
According to Memorial Church Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz, who first met Walton in 2010, Walton charmed him not only with his willingness to talk to undergraduates about faith, but also with his ability to engage with the students.
“There is a lot to say about his faith, but also about things that extend far beyond faith,” Katz says. “He left an impression not just on me and my colleagues, but also on the students.”
Indeed, as a scholar, Walton says he relates to students’ anxiety about academic achievement.
“Students are anxious about grades and papers; I am anxious about my papers being accepted to a journal,” he says. “They are anxious about graduating and getting a job; I was anxious about getting tenured and keeping a job.”
Beyond his scholarly life, Walton is also a family man. His eight-year-old twins are named Elijah Mays and Zora Neale, after two admired figures: former president of Morehouse College Benjamin Elijah Mays and author Zora Neale Hurston. Walton says that he and his wife, Cecily, have decided to name their third child after novelist James Baldwin.
Having young children around changes the dynamics of his work and personal life, Walton says.
One Sunday, while shaking hands with the congregation after church, Zora was standing next to him, playing and ducking under his robes. In another incident, Walton and Katz went to a Harvard men’s basketball game against Brown in February, and Elijah tagged along.
“He is a great dad,” Katz says. “I would certainly love to have a dad like him.”
PATH TO THE PULPIT
Following Gomes’ death last year, President Drew G. Faust assembled an committee to search for a new minister. Walton originally served on the committee before he stepped down following his nomination for the post.
On April 25, Walton received a phone call from Faust asking him to come to her office. Walton thought that they were going to discuss someone else’s candidacy and that Faust was seeking his advice.
But Faust announced that he had been chosen for the position, and Walton’s mind just went blank, he says. “My face had to be like something from the Publishers Clearing House.”
In a statement, Faust said that Walton would “bring new life to spirituality and religion at Harvard.”
“He is among the country’s foremost scholars of African American religion, a powerful preacher, a thoughtful pastoral presence, and a wonderful human being,” Faust wrote. “His scholarly and ecclesiastical callings are mutually enriching in the best traditions of campus ministry.”
Katz echoed Faust’s sentiments about Walton enriching the church.
“I was tremendously pleased that he was ultimately selected,” Katz says. “Professor Walton is interested in finding ways to place the Memorial Church at the heart of campus life.”
After the initial excitement, Walton says the enormity of the position has humbled him.
“This is such a special community of faith within higher education,” he says. “I just have an enormous task in front of me.”
For Walton, the new position blends two things that he is passionate about: practicing ministry and pursuing religious scholarship.
“I can remain committed to the expansion of knowledge and also think out loud every Sunday with a community of faith about pressing concerns,” he says. “It is a perfect blend, a perfect hybrid.”
The job, however, does not come without challenges.
“My appointment can be a moment of mourning for many because it confirms the fact that Professor Gomes is no longer with us,” he says. “To move forward means to acknowledge the loss.”
Because Gomes has had such a long tenure, Katz says he recognizes that adapting to the different dynamic at church might be difficult for some congregants.
And to those who compare Walton and Gomes, Katz says that Walton was not hired to be Gomes. “We are hoping he will come in and be Jonathan Walton,” he says.
GROWING TALLER
Despite praise for the appointment from officials across the University, Walton’s twin children were originally hesitant.
“They asked, ‘Does that mean we have to leave Lowell House?’” he says. Indeed, Walton and his family will soon move in to Sparks House, which was previous occupied by Gomes.
Though Walton says that he will miss the Lowell community that he has become a part of, he is excited by the prospect of meeting the broader Harvard community.
He says that he is uncertain whether to continue the Wednesday teas at Sparks House, a tradition started by Gomes in 1974 to offer students an opportunity to mingle with the church community. But regardless, he says that his doors are always open.
“I am a milk and Oreo kind of a guy,” he says. “But whatever it is, I want everyone to feel welcomed.”
As he prepares for a journey ahead of him, Walton remembers a quote that Mays used to share with his students: “Morehouse holds the crown over your head and challenges you to grow taller to wear it.”
“I honestly feel that Harvard has held this crown of Memorial Church over my head,” he says, “and I am hoping that, with the community’s support, I will be able to grow tall enough to wear it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 24, 2012, at 10:40 p.m.
0n April 3, approximately 25 students, including members of the Student Labor Action Movement, union organizers, and Harvard employees, gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall to celebrate Harvard’s decision not to reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts—a hotel chain that had come under fire in recent years for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations.
Five months earlier, many of the same students had spent the fall campaigning against Harvard’s holdings in HEI with the Occupy Harvard movement, which listed non-reinvestment in HEI among its original demands drafted in November 2011.
But while student advocates had been pushing for Harvard not to reinvest in HEI because of ethical concerns, Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo stressed that HMC’s decision had been based purely on financial considerations.
“Importantly, this decision was based on factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs; not on concerns about HEI’s practices,” Mendillo wrote an email to University President Drew G. Faust.
The discrepancy between Occupy and HMC’s reasoning on HEI is emblematic of a deeper disconnect that exists between the investing philosophies of activists and of HMC portfolio managers. While many students are pushing for Harvard to embrace socially responsible investment standards, HMC insists that its primary responsibility is to generate strong returns for the University, not to advance social change through the markets.
Over the past year, the push for SRI—which encourages the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance concerns into a company’s evaluation of investments—has gained momentum on Harvard’s campus, culminating in the founding of a new group called Responsible Investment at Harvard. RI members say HMC, which is tasked with overseeing the investment of Harvard’s $32 billion endowment, needs to create a transparent and consistent policy that more closely reflects the University’s values in the educational sphere.
Mendillo says the group already “integrates sustainable investment considerations into all of its investment decisions.” But RI says that given the company’s limited transparency, it is impossible to judge the degree to which Harvard considers responsible investment factors.
Despite the increased focus on responsible investment, there remains a lack of consensus among activists and University administrators about what it would entail for Harvard to be socially responsible or sustainable in its investing strategy. And because HMC is reluctant to share information relating to its investments, the University’s current approach to investments may be more socially conscious than advocacy groups realize.
DEFINING RESPONSIBILITY
As Occupy Harvard firmly planted itself in the Yard and tensions between protesters and University administrators mounted, the idea for Responsible Investment at Harvard began to form.
“People just started talking about these ideas,” said Senan Ebrahim ’12, former UC president and one of the group’s founders. “Our class has a certain perspective that we can be agents for a positive change in the world.”
RI was founded in the fall with the goal of “changing the way Harvard manages its money.” Since then, 32 student groups have pledged support for RI’s mission. Building on this wave of support, RI launched the Fair Harvard Fund, a campaign for a Social Choice Fund within Harvard’s endowment that would be invested with an eye toward social good. As of mid-May, the fund had raised almost $10,000 from more than 400 donors.
Faust says the University will look into the possibility of creating a fund similar to the one requested by RI “for those who wish to donate in that way.”
“We just have to figure out what the various pros and cons are,” she says.
But determining the pros and cons—and crafting a responsible investment strategy in general—might be easier said than done. Among activists and experts alike, there are inconsistencies in the definition of “responsible” or “sustainable” when it comes to investment policy.
“To be a responsible investor requires transparency, accountability, and consideration of [extra-financial] factors when making investment decisions,” says Samuel F. Wohns ’14, one of RI’s founders and a Crimson magazine editor.
Graduate student and member of RI Justin A. Junge writes in an email he thinks a responsible investor should aim to “do no evil” and “attempt to do more good.”
But experts on responsible investing say the definition of what constitutes a responsible investment can vary from company to company. Steve Lydenberg, a senior research fellow at the Hauser Center’s Initiative for Responsible Investment, says that he prefers to think of responsible investing as “knowing an investment,” which involves “not only knowing the financial implications of an investment but knowing the social and environmental implications of an investment.”
The issue is further complicated by the fact that a company may invest in another company, which invests in another company. Peeling back the layers of an investment can be difficult, and as investors are shielded from potential ethical violations by several degrees of separation, the line of responsibility is increasingly blurred.
Although the standard used within the financial community is generally two degrees of separation, RI has not yet settled on a set policy, according to RI member Collin A. Rees ’12.
Eventually RI will be forced to define its standards, but doing so will require finding “something that works for Harvard,” Rees says.
The uncertainty about where to draw the line for Harvard may stem in part from a larger disagreement about the purpose of Harvard’s investments.
While RI sees socially responsible investing as a method of effecting social change, Mendillo looks at Harvard’s investments as a means of supporting the University’s primary educational mission. Mendillo says the potential for Harvard to impart social change lies less in its investments than it does in the areas supported by the returns generated from those investments.
“Harvard’s biggest impact is really through education and research and its financial aid policies,” Mendillo says. “Our job is producing strong long-term returns that allow Harvard to fulfill its important mission.”
CHECKS AND BALANCES
HMC says that the nature of their investment strategy, which prioritizes long-term returns, requires it to consider sustainable investing in its decisions already. In the process of conducting due diligence on its investments, HMC considers issues related to the environment, labor practices, and corporate governance because, according to Mendillo, “investments that fall short in any of these areas are unlikely to generate the strong long-term returns we require.”
“If there’s a concern...we are not going to be interested in the opportunity because we want an investment that we can sustainably grow for a long period of time,” Mendillo says.
HMC also stands by its policy not to invest in certain industries, including cigarette companies and the businesses that provide packaging and filters for tobacco products. Harvard has also promised to steer clear of PetroChina since its 2005 decision to divest from the company because of its connection to the Sudanese government.
But instead of non-investment or divestment, Harvard mainly relies on its power as a shareholder to influence companies’ practices through proxy voting. Two committees are charged with evaluating the companies’ proposals. This checks and balances systems was integrated into HMC’s money management system after the University came under fire in 1972 for its investments in Gulf Oil, which allegedly aided the Portuguese government in fighting rebels in Angola.
In response to student outrage, Derek C. Bok, who was University president at the time, created the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility. Tasked with reviewing “shareholder resolutions raising issues of social responsibility,” the groups were created to ensure that Harvard’s publicly traded investments be subjected to a degree of ethical scrutiny.
The ACSR, which includes four faculty members, four alumni, one undergraduate, and three graduate students, meets annually over dinners at the Harvard Faculty Club to discuss the issues that require shareholder approval. It reports its recommendations to the CCSR, a three-person subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—which ultimately decides how to vote on each issue.
Although the CCSR is not required to follow the advice of the ACSR, their views align the majority of the time. According the CCSR’s 2010-11 annual report, the Corporation subcommittee agreed with the ACSR in 29 out of the 38 cases reviewed that year.
RI hopes to reform the ACSR and CCSR, insisting that the two committees have lost influence and relevance since their founding 40 years ago. Changes in the structure of financial markets have led Harvard to put less of its money in publicly traded equities, reducing the portion of Harvard’s investments that are actually reviewed by the committees. According to the annual report, the number of proposals voted on by the University dropped from 111 in 2008 to 19 in 2009 “due to changes in asset allocation.”
Though Rees says the ACSR and CCSR are good in theory, “in reality [they] don’t have a lot of power and need to be reformed.” Rees and other advocates argue that the University should allow the committees to review a larger portion of Harvard investments and consider opening their meetings to other members of the Harvard community, increasing the transparency of an otherwise secretive review process.
TRANSPARENCY
HMC’s opaqueness has become a point of contention between students in RI and University administrators, and may account for the widespread misconception that Harvard ignores social factors when making investment decisions.
Students acknowledge that the University may already be engaging in what would in their opinion constitute an acceptable amount of responsible investing. But they say that so long as the Harvard community is left uninformed about any steps the University already takes to invest responsibly, advocates will continue to question HMC’s investment strategy.
While RI recognizes that Harvard cannot release all information regarding its investment portfolio, group members say that Harvard should release a list of its previous investments either months or years after they are made. They point to schools like Columbia University that adhere to such a policy as proof that disclosure need not harm investment returns.
“Transparency ideally would be the next step, but I also think we can’t sit around and wait for Harvard to become more transparent when it’s been run un-transparently for the last 300 years,” Ebrahim says.
Without more openness regarding how HMC manages its money, RI says, there is no way students can gauge how responsible an investor the University really is.
“I believe that [HMC is] following some of these processes. That’s what HMC says and I believe that’s true,” says Rees. “But we believe that a more codified set of rules or more stringent guidelines, including more transparency, is something that can really help us get rid of all the bad [investments] and something that can serve as a model for other universities and endowments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each year, tens of thousands of high school seniors around the world await an email from Harvard College. Over the last five years, the number of students receiving bad news has been increasing. And those receiving good news have become rarer and rarer, as acceptance rates for the College drop lower with each passing cycle,  dipping below 6 percent this spring.
As Harvard’s admission rate tumbles into the low single digits, some are wondering when—or if—the trend might reverse.
Some question whether by becoming too exclusive, Harvard and other ultra-selective colleges might eventually discourage qualified applicants from even bothering to apply. When the odds of admission are so low, the chance of seeing a “yes” in that long-awaited email might sometimes seem as likely as winning the lottery.
MORE APPLICATIONS WELCOME
As the admissions office tries to cast its net wide to attract ever-more-qualified applicants, its outreach efforts encourage a vastly higher number of students to apply to Harvard than can ever be accepted.
The fastidious employees at 86 Brattle Street who must evaluate all these hopeful students’ files say that their intention is not to drive up the number of applicants when they send students and admissions officers on recruiting trips, send mailings to high school students, and make phone calls to targeted prospective applicants.
“We are not looking for more applicants. We are not looking for a lower admission rate,” said Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. “But we are trying to get the best people we can get from every economic [and] every ethnic background, and as you do that, more people will be interested in applying.”
But some say that universities have an interest in convincing as many students as possible to apply, even if there are no spots in the freshman class for them.
Sandra J. Eller, a college admissions consultant in Rochester, N.Y., points out that national rankings often use lower acceptance rates and higher yields as criteria in their evaluations. Colleges that turn more applicants away rank higher in magazine listings.
“Many talented students will receive letters encouraging them to apply to schools like Yale, Stanford, Harvard, and Dartmouth,” Eller said. “This can raise students’ hopes of admission, but with so many qualified applicants, the admissions decisions can be really disappointing. I sometimes find myself reminding students that schools have their own priorities. The more applications they receive, the more selective they appear.”
According to Eller, studies have shown that maintaining a high ranking in publications such as U.S. News and World Report influences alumni giving.
Fitzsimmons said the Office of Admissions tries to “hone the message” in order to keep students who are clearly unqualified from applying. But Harvard admissions, for the most part, has maintained at least one tradition. “Harvard has been hard to get into for a very long time,” Fitzsimmons said.
AGAINST THE ODDS
Admission rates have been dropping at Harvard for seven consecutive years; this year’s overall acceptance rate was just 5.9 percent.
For the first time since 2007, this year’s high school seniors had the option of applying to Harvard through an early action round. With 772 spots already filled in December, the regular decision applicants competing for the remaining acceptances in the spring faced an even lower number: a stunning 3.8 percent acceptance rate.
Though record-setting acceptance rates have become the norm at Harvard and several of its peer institutions, this year’s new low was surprising. For the first time in five years, the College had received fewer applicants than it had the previous year—and yet it still accepted a smaller portion of them.
The caution in the admissions office was the result of the revived early action policy, and it paid off—the 81 percent yield this year was the best turnout Harvard has seen since 1971. But regardless of the reason behind the paucity of acceptance letters, the seemingly ceaseless plummet in the admission rate may be alarming to would-be applicants.
Pundits have cried out about the frustration and seeming arbitrariness of the process. This year, just after Ivy League schools announced their acceptance rates, a professor penned an editorial in the Chronicle of Higher Education called “Harvard by Lottery,” stating that a truly random system would cause less stress for students and indeed be more fair.
Others worry that talented prospective students might decide not to risk the $75 application fee if they believe their chances of acceptance are too minuscule.
But Susan Case, a former faculty member at the Harvard Summer Institute on College Admissions, a program organized annually by the College Board and Harvard, said that she has not seen low admissions rates deter her clients in her educational consulting business.
“They see it a bit like buying a lottery ticket. It is worth a try,” she wrote in an email. “But I serve, for the most part, a fairly sophisticated population who can afford to take a risk. I worry that those students Harvard is trying to attract from different parts of this country and from the larger world will be put off by the odds and not even consider applying.”
Eller agreed that even in light of extremely low acceptance rates, the chance to attend a top-ranked university will always appeal to high-achieving students. “Very small admission rates will not deter such students. Low rates of admission to Harvard and other top schools are here to stay,” she said.
BEHIND THE NUMBERS
Fitzsimmons attributes the perenially falling admission rate to several factors, starting with Harvard’s focus on recruiting talent from communities around the world.
“Students coming into Harvard today come from a much wider range of economic backgrounds,” Fitzsimmons said. “Harvard is much more of a national institution and much more of an international institution. The Harvard I attended had very few students of color and very few international students.”
The Class of 2016, drawn from a pool of 34,302 applicants, indeed reflects Harvard’s commitment to diversity. In the incoming freshman class, 10.2 percent of the students are black and 11.2 percent are Latino. Ten percent come from outside the United States.
Fitzsimmons emphasized Harvard’s very generous financial aid as a factor driving students from all backgrounds to apply.
“There may be some people who are discouraged by the lower admissions rate, but the reality is that the reason for the lower admission rate is that people all over America and all over the world now see Harvard as accessible and affordable,” he said.
Increased use of the Common Application, which allows students to apply to multiple schools from one website, has also contributed to lower admission rates at schools nationwide over the past several years, Eller added.
“With the push of a button, students can apply to additional schools. This can dramatically account for the surge in applications year after year,” she said.
Though dauntingly low acceptance rates may worry students, the admissions office is focused on the bigger picture—the fact that students are applying at all.
“People now see Harvard as possible, and people are applying, and this is a very, very good thing,” Fitzsimmons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people ask me to describe how I think I’ve changed at Harvard, I like to say I’ve become more game. I say “yes” to things—an impromptu trip to the North End, a walk along the Charles on a sunny day, a Celtics game. Making a conscious effort to be spontaneous and adventurous has made all the difference to me in deriving enjoyment out of a place that I know can be stressful, high-pressure, and demanding.
For me, saying “yes” is about trying to take advantage of every opportunity offered to me, unless I have a strong reason for saying “no.” It’s not necessarily about being especially upbeat or positive—it’s about not closing the door on something that could potentially enrich my life in some way.
My freshman year was exciting, scary, and unbelievably overwhelming. In the fall I took a history class with 300 to 400 pages of assigned reading a week. I felt like I had to be constantly reading or else I would never get through all of it in time—and I know that many of my peers felt the same way about their endless problem sets and midterms. There were so many things I wanted to do, but I frequently found myself saying no, I have work to do.
That first year flew by, and I realized that I had just three more years to appreciate the amazing place that Harvard can be. I came to see “I’m busy” or “I have work” as less than adequate excuses to go explore a new part of Boston, or to see a new exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, or to go to a friend’s party. Academics are challenging here, and extracurriculars are extraordinarily demanding, which means that almost every Harvard undergraduate can honestly say he or she “is busy” or “has work” pretty much all the time. At a school like this, I realized that I never really had “free time”—but I could make time to do things outside of my established commitments.
Since that revelation, I have said “yes” a lot more than I would otherwise. When a friend proposed a trip to go apple picking in the fall, I went. When I heard about an interesting person coming to speak at the Harvard Kennedy School, I got a ticket. When my blockmates got tickets to a Red Sox game, I went—and I asked a lot of questions because the rules of baseball really confuse me.
Of course, I can’t always say “yes.” A paper due the next day, a volunteer shift at the Boston Medical Center, or a late night at The Crimson have all been good reasons to say “no.” I also gave myself a pass for being sick. I have tried to be sparing with excuses like “I just don’t feel like it,” or “it’s too far away.” In essence, saying “yes” is not about hard and fast rules. It’s a mindset that says that when offered the opportunity to enjoy a valuable new experience, or to enrich a social relationship, I will try to prioritize such an opportunity.
I’ve learned to say “yes” not just to experiences, but to people as well. A considerable number of my closest friends are individuals with whom I share little in common on paper. We have radically different interests, political convictions, religious inclinations, and personalities. I think our friendship survives not because we have especially compatible characteristics, but because we are open to the possibility of being friends. Our friend circle is made strong every time new people are incorporated into the fold.
Saying “yes” prevented my senior thesis from being the only thing I remembered about this year. I visited Plymouth Rock, I went skiing over J-Term, and I cheered on the runners of the Boston Marathon. I participated in nearly every Quincy House event, and I showed up at every Senior Bar. I played in a C-league intramural basketball game, even though I can’t shoot or dribble and my friend had to explain the rules to me right before it started. My main contribution was being there so that the team had enough females to avoid a forfeit.
Looking back on the past four years, I think there are some things I could have done differently. I could have been more focused in my academics and extracurricular pursuits, and I recognize that when people around me have been too busy to do anything that isn’t on their Google Calendars, it’s been because they were doing important things like research with a famous professor or working on an important social issue. For a lot of students here, Harvard is a stepping-stone to bigger and better goals, and these take priority over everything else.
As for myself, I don’t really know where I’m going at the moment, and I have little idea of how my time at Harvard is going to connect to the next thing I do in the future. Harvard is not some mark on my resumé that is going to get me into my dream graduate school or set me on a path to a six-figure salary. I didn’t come here just to get somewhere else. I came to Harvard for the experience of being at Harvard, and it’s been one amazing ride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Harvard Class of 2012: Congratulations! Four years later and we are all slightly older versions of ourselves. (Fuller heads, perhaps.) Now is the time when all the people we’ve met start feeling like too many marbles in our hands, marbles about to drop and scatter everywhere. Serendipity alone first brought us together, but crossing over to the Real World is no longer laughable or avoidable. It is as real as life without dining halls and dorm crew; as real as visas, leases, and taxes. So what are you doing? Why are you here? Where are you going?
Freshman year, I learned in Moral Reasoning that all creatures, man or beast, have first order desires: I want to get out of bed; I want breakfast; I want to go medical school, and so on. These are the thoughts that occupy most of our waking life. I also learned, however, that what makes us human are our second order desires: wanting to be a certain way, which may or may not be the way we already are. From there we work to become how we want to be, for these second order desires go beyond New Years’ resolutions. Rather, they are the fabric and foundation of how we make decisions. They give our lives meaning and direction. So I ask, again: Why do you do what you do? I believe that every Harvard graduate should have an awareness of this question and their own answer to it. Such answers, in my opinion, should extend beyond one’s personal comfort.
I would bet that many students made it to Harvard through some fortuitous blend of perfectionism and masochism. This blend, I find, bubbles into a certain culture on campus best described by the “I Am Fine” Crimson piece published last year. In my opinion, Harvard has an ethos of judgment that can become rather toxic; it truly doesn’t surprise me that Facebook began here. People seem to focus more on the people around them—their accomplishments, event attendance, number of contacts, etc.—rather than appreciating themselves in a vacuum.
Where does this lead us?
Students measure their achievements by their reception and competitive value, rather than their absolute value. Personal worth and self-esteem become tied up with success. Organizations as much as social structures thrive on the juicy nectar of exclusion: What better way to ensure that you win the game of life than denying your peers the chance to join you? And what about those people who aren’t fine? Well, they find some way to escape their surroundings. But more often than not, they hide their feelings, which to them feel like blemishes, dirty little imperfections. Repeatedly, voices on campus champion “opening up to others” and “reaching out to your classmates” as the panacea for these problems, but as far as I can tell, nothing changes.
My dear classmates: In order to grow, you have to believe in your heart that every person is just like you, in some way or another, and that every person has something special and beautiful to offer the world. You have to believe that every human is worth something, not just another measuring stick to stand against. People are not statistics that you tweak in order to maximize the bottom line. People are individuals, with real histories and valid opinions to share. Conversations should not feel like waiting for your turn to speak. When you believe all this in your heart, you will be free.
Because once you are free, the Real World stops being a terrifying place where food doesn’t cook itself and we pay our own bills. Rather, it becomes an exciting, thrilling, dangerous, and unpredictable place, filled with billions of people with trillions of stories to share with you. Some of my more memorable conversations at Harvard had little to do with Harvard itself: I’ve talked about the global economy with Louie (of Louie’s), the Arab Spring’s aftermath with a cab driver, and American politics with security guards much more well-read than I. You see, our education is not a golden ticket that lets us bypass the lives and problems of everyone outside the Yard. Allston and Mission Hill are not fly-over zones between campus and Boston’s clubs and museums. What is the point of everything we’ve learned if we keep it all to ourselves?
So please, reach out, explore, connect. Open your minds and your heart, as much as possible, before you become shackled to some comfortable ride and predictable future on the road more travelled. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Ask yourself what you would do if you woke up tomorrow with not a single cent to your name. Eleanor Roosevelt said that “You must do the thing you think you cannot do.” She also said that “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” After graduation, whether you consider yourself on the edge of the diving board of life or slowly sinking in a cesspool of uncertainty, remember that your freedom is all you have. What are you so scared of?

Financial aid is one of Harvard’s greatest recruiting tools—and also one of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps’ biggest draws. As Harvard celebrates its first commencement in nearly 40 years with an officially sanctioned ROTC program, it should take steps to mitigate the extent to which its generous financial aid undermines the military’s ability to recruit Harvard students to ROTC. The University should marshal its resources and apply some of the financial aid money that ROTC cadets forgo to enhance their four years at Harvard.
With the official repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” this past fall, Harvard and other top colleges including Yale, Columbia, and Stanford officially recognized ROTC for the first time in four decades. In the words of University President Drew G. Faust, this move “affirms the vital role that the members of our Armed Forces play in serving our nation and securing our freedoms.” Faust is right—the University should support those who make the courageous decision to serve their country after graduation.
Yet the elite campuses to which ROTC is returning are dramatically different than they once were. Perhaps the most striking difference is the socioeconomic diversity attributable in large part to dramatic expansions in financial aid. Nowhere is this truer than at Harvard, which spends $166 million dollars annually to fund one of the most generous financial aid programs in the world. Next year, families with annual income below $65,000 have no expected parental contribution, and families with incomes up to $150,000 have an average expected parental contribution of less than 10 percent of their income.
Yet for all of the many virtues of the College’s generous financial aid, it undermines one of ROTC’s greatest draws: a scholarship providing full tuition support as well as allowances for books and fees in return for four years of military service. Harvard treats ROTC scholarships as any other non-Harvard scholarship: it first reduces students’ term-time and summer earnings expectations and uses any remaining funds to replace Harvard grants. For many families, the net effect of an ROTC scholarship is still positive, but the financial benefit of ROTC is far smaller than at institutions without such generous financial aid. Students with Harvard aid packages who are interested in military service might find it more flexible to pass on ROTC and either enlist or attend Officer Training School after graduation—if they are still interested.
Harvard should take the lead among top colleges by using its institutional resources to reward students who forgo Harvard financial aid for a ROTC scholarship. While giving students cash would be against the spirit of financial aid, Harvard can still do a great deal to encourage ROTC service.
For starters, Harvard should expand financial aid “extras” for ROTC cadets—from funds to attend campus activities to winter coats. These types of extras are typically not fully covered by the military stipend. More broadly, the University should consider other ways in which an ROTC scholarship should be treated differently from a standard outside scholarship.
Harvard should also create a program that funds internships or international experiences during the summer or J-term for ROTC participants. Such a program would be along the lines of the Presidential Public Service Fellowship Program, which supports 10 undergraduates and graduates to pursue public service for a summer, or the Institute of Politics Director’s Internship Program, which uses Harvard’s connections in the public and non-profit sectors to offer undergraduates unique summer internships. In short, such a program would use the University’s connections and financial power to enable ROTC students to do something unique that they might not otherwise be able to do in their four years at Harvard and make lasting connections that pay dividends over a career of public service.
There are many alumni—particularly those with connections to the military—who would be happy to help place and support ROTC students during the summer or J-term. And given the current size of Harvard ROTC—in the last two years there were 15 ROTC graduates—the cost of the program would be minimal compared to Harvard’s financial aid budget and vastly outweighed by the money financial aid recipients save Harvard by accepting an ROTC scholarship.
Expanding support for ROTC students at the margin may not induce many low income students to join ROTC. However, financial support would make many more students at least consider ROTC and help change the standing of ROTC on campus. More importantly, it would send a very visible and clear signal that Harvard supports ROTC, intends to expand it, and is doing its part to make sure that it does not undermine the incentives for students to join ROTC. Harvard’s leadership would also have ripple effects at other institutions.
Some may argue that ROTC scholarships should be treated the same as other non-Harvard scholarships. But ROTC scholarships are different. They come with a quid pro quo of four years of military service that makes them a singular recruiting device for a unique form of service the University has deemed particularly honorable.
In welcoming ROTC back to campus, President Faust said that official recognition “broadens the pathways for students to participate in an honorable and admirable calling and in so doing advances our commitment to both learning and service.” If this is the University’s position—and it should be—then Harvard should do more than simply “broaden the pathway” for students who forgo University financial aid to participate in ROTC. Harvard should do its best to make sure they are rewarded for their service and sacrifice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-two years after becoming Harvard Law School’s first tenured black professor, Derrick A. Bell Jr.’s hairline was receding and his patience wearing out. He wore round glasses and a gray suit, holding his notes in both hands and speaking into a half-dozen microphones.
Signs at the protest bobbed up and down, all handwritten. “Shame on HLS,” one of them read. “Is the United States 95 percent male and 91 percent white? Harvard Law School is,” read another.
At the time of this protest—one of many he held at the Law School between 1986 and 1991—there were five tenured female professors at the Law School, and three tenured black professors, all male.
So in 1991, Bell took a “leave of conscience.” He would return only when the 107 female black students were represented by a tenured faculty member.
But Bell was not just protesting the lack of a female black professors, according to Law School professor Kenneth Mack. Bell initiated a conversation about the value of diversity in the classroom—through diversity in legal scholarship. He was also one of the founders of critical race theory, a body of legal scholarship that examines the relationship between race and law.
Bell would never return to the Law School—the leave evolved into a dismissal. After two years of leave, a Harvard professor must return to teach in order to maintain tenure. But after two years, the Law School had not hired a female black professor. Since Bell did not return, he was fired.
In October of this year, Bell passed away at age 80. According to Mack, “he was one of the voices in the many conversations that collectively change the Law School.”
Though Bell would never return to Harvard, his actions two decades ago were part of a larger debate that would grip—and ultimately transform—the Law School, making it a community more inclusive of diverse theory and experience.
CHARGED CAMPUS
As Bell was having a crisis of conscience about teaching among an overwhelmingly white faculty, the overwhelmingly white faculty was having a crisis of its own. The ideological differences that sharply divided the faculty were making national headlines.
In an article that was published in 1993, GQ Magazine dubbed the Law School “Beirut-on-the-Charles,” describing a campus that “pitted faculty members against faculty members, faculty members against students,” and students “waging holy war on one another.” As a union of liberal and conservative students, the Harvard Law Review did not escape the tension that seemed to permeate the campus.
“I’ve worked at the Supreme Court; I’ve worked at the White House; I’ve been in Washington now for 20 years. And the bitterest politics I’ve ever seen—in terms of it getting personal and nasty—was on the Harvard Law Review,” said Bradford A. Benderson in a documentary produced by Frontline, “Dreams of Obama.”
These emotions spilled over into Bell’s protest.
“Professor Bell made people who disagreed with him angry,” Mack said. “There were professors and students who were very caustic.”
Benderson, along with Mack, was an editor of the Law Review when Barack Obama was the president of the publication. Obama spoke at one of Bell’s protests, alluding to the kind of compassionate pedagogy that set Bell apart at the Law School. A young Obama, wearing a blue button-down shirt and khaki pants, spoke with his hands in his pockets.
“I remember him sauntering up to the front, and not giving us a lecture, but engaging us in a conversation. And speaking the truth,” Obama said of Bell in his speech at the time.
GROWING DIVERSE
The conversation that Bell started continues to play out at the Law School today.
The Law School faculty is significantly more diverse. In 1990, only five tenured professors were women and three tenured professors were black. In 2011, there were seven senior black professors, and 20 percent of all professors were women, compared with 12 percent in 1990. There were also three Asian senior faculty members, one senior Latino professor, and one senior Native American professor, presumed to be Elizabeth Warren. The first tenured black female professor was Lani Guinier ’71, who received tenure in 1998.
Growing a faculty takes decades, according to a Morris Ratner, a former student at the Law School who completed two years as a visiting professor. But a more diverse faculty translates to a more diverse learning experience, he added. “Faculty members’ life experience shape what they teach and how they teach, so we thought having a more diverse faculty would bring more diversity to the classroom,” he said.
He continued that being able to relate to faculty members is important for students.
“Back when I was in law school, if you were a gay student, there was no openly gay faculty member that you could identify with on that very basic level of identity,” said Ratner. “It was that much harder to walk into office hours.”
‘THINK LIKE A LAWYER’
When Mack was a student, he said the Law School taught students how to “think like a lawyer”—in a very particular way.
“There was a sense in the ’80s that we were sorting good lawyers from bad lawyers, and that the mission of Harvard Law School was to teach—or perhaps impose—that on the student body,” Mack said.
Part of Bell’s departure was fueled by his belief that the scholarship produced by women and minorities was devalued by the Law School, which at the time opted for a prescribed, hierarchical conception of law and legal education.
But in the decades since Bell left, the faculty has diversified ideologically.
“More conservative faculty have been appointed in the last decade, and that’s a good thing,” said Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a professor at the Law School and director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice.
Mack said that these recent hires show that the Law School has become more inclusive.
“I think that we are now much more humble about [the Law School’s] ability to define the rest of the world,” he said.
But while the Law School is more diverse than it used to be, the faculty still does not reflect the make-up of the U.S.
“I think there’s a long way to go,” Mack said. “One simply has to look at the faculty members and count” to see that the picture is not yet complete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12, the immediate past president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, ran their campaign in 2010 on the promise of changing the status quo by amplifying student voices. The hallmark of their platform was a grand vision of a meeting for students from all schools of the University to present their grievances on any issue, big or small, to the University’s top leaders. They called it the Forum for Change.
In the months since Ebrahim and Cao left office, after holding one session of a modified version of their forum at the end of their term, the Forum for Change itself has seen more change than the University.
The idea of the open forum has been scrapped in exchange for a committee called the Task Force on the Student Voice. Of its 16 members, half are students. It does not discuss issues per se, but how to eventually hear students’ thoughts on those issues.
The evolution from the confrontational forum to the cozy committee is emblematic of a new approach on the part of the UC’s 2012 leaders, President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13.
Bicknell and Yalamanchi profess a belief that often, the best way to acheive students’ goals is not to fight administrators but to befriend them.
EASING THE TENSION
During the thirty years that the UC has existed, its relationship with College administrators has swung from combative to cooperative and back again repeatedly.
This semester, Bicknell said, members of the Council have worked on extending an olive branch to College administrators, an approach that he believes has worked. He said the UC has earned more respect from campus officials.
“The UC has gone a long way to being more credible with the administration: going deep on big issues, having conversations that are necessary,” he said.
David H. A. LeBoeuf  ’13, the outgoing UC Rules Committee chair, advocated for a combination of antagonism and accord. But he said that the balance of that “healthy tension” shifts each time that new leaders take over the Council.
In his view, the incumbent leaders, Bicknell and Yalamanchi, whom he campaigned against as a vice presidential candidate in the fall, have pursued a more cooperative relationship with College administrators than he favors.
“I personally would like to see a bit more pushback, but the current leaders are more collaborative,” said LeBoeuf, who is also an inactive Crimson news editor. He said that he trusted that Bicknell and Yalamanchi’s decision to engage with administrators cooperatively was a strategic choice to further their goals for the UC and the student body.
Bicknell said that creating mutually respectful relationships did not mean that the UC would indiscriminately cooperate with College leaders. Instead, he said the ties established now will allow the UC to maintain a good working relationship even when differences in opinion arise.
“Sometimes the administration isn’t aligned with the students,” he said. “But it’s important to maintain respect and understand the motivating factors and stakeholders. As UC reps, our motivating factors are students.”
A COLLABORATIVE AGENDA
Council leaders have backed up their belief in friendly relations through several cooperative ventures this semester.
In January, UC representatives attended a Leadership Intensive Program to learn about the structure of Harvard’s bureaucracy from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, and others.
With top College leaders on a panel in front of them, representatives asked not about their pet issues for improving student life but about the deans’ tips for leadership.
The Task Force on the Student Voice has taken on a similar focus—not on how to fix grievances but on how to talk about fixing them.
Samuel F. Wohns ’14 criticized the committee for its narrow scope that, in his opinion, prevents the UC from engaging in meaningful projects.
“It is important that the students have a say in student life, but that is not enough,” said Wohns, who is also a Crimson magazine editor.
But Bicknell said that such initiatives do lead to action on student life. By improving the UC’s image among administrators, he argued, the Council has opened up new avenues to addressing student needs. He said that administrators and University departments—including Harvard University Information Technology, Harvard University Dining Services, and the Committee on Undergraduate Education—have approached the UC with proposals for joint projects this semester.
He said that he envisions these collaborative initiatives becoming easier to accomplish in the coming years, if dialogue continues to become warmer between the Council and the College.
“By building a foundation and establishing these relationships, these things might not happen this year,” Bicknell said. “But we can start to make them happen.”
Bicknell’s administration has tried one of the oldest tricks in the book to woo administrators—they take them out to lunch. At the Lunch with a Dean series launched this semester, groups of students have dined five times in College dining halls with adminstrators, according to UC Representative Matthew R. Marotta ’14.
“It’s always great to talk over a meal, because it comes with the realization that the other party is a person too,” Yalamanchi said in March. “This is meant to be an informal, less intimidating way for students to speak to top College administrators and build relationships.”
AN UNEQUAL PARTNERSHIP
Despite the cooperative gestures this semester, critics charge that the relationship is fraught with problems on both sides. Administrators have proven generally unwilling to bend to student demands, some say, while Council leaders have been reluctant to pester them about contentious issues.
LeBoeuf pointed to instances this semester when the Council hesitated to pass legislation that might ruffle administrators’ feathers.
While Bicknell celebrated the UC’s endorsement of the Fair Harvard Fund—an account created by the student activist group Responsible Investment at Harvard to funnel donations into a socially responsible pot—LeBoeuf said that it took many argumentative meetings to secure that endorsement.
“There was a lot of discomfort with taking a stance like that,” he said.
LeBoeuf said that two freshmen hoping to use information from HUDS for a nutrition calculator also faced resistance.
“People asked why we should ask the administration to give that information out,” he said, theorizing that the UC’s noncombative stance has created an institution wary of opposition.
This replaces a more adversarial pattern in which students made more demands but Harvard’s leadership often did not assent.
When he was trying to establish the Forum for Change, Ebrahim called on students and alumni to urge the administration to participate in his initiative or a comparable forum for discussion.
In total, supporters sent more than 300 emails to University President Drew G. Faust before she agreed to attend a UC meeting alongside Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
Despite the Council’s friendly outreach, two outgoing UC representatives said that student opinion still carries little weight in University Hall.
“It’s preposterous that the Dean of the College doesn’t interact with College students,” said outgoing Pforzheimer House Representative Justin Lanning ’12. LeBoeuf agreed, “I don’t think the administration takes the UC as seriously as it could.”
This summer, the Task Force plans to issue a recommendation to Hammonds on heeding the student voice. Hammonds will take up the proposal at her discretion.
And Bicknell said he sees further collaboration ahead, listing plans to cooperate on freshman social space, late-night programming, and more lunches.
“At the end of the day, we don’t want to burn bridges that already have gaps,” Bicknell said

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology together introduced a global online education platform, EdX, earlier this month. The idea is that lectures at these two world-renowned universities will be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It’s been heralded as revolutionary. In a piece modestly entitled, “The Campus Tsunami,” David Brooks wrote, “What happened to the newspaper and magazine business is about to happen to higher education: a rescrambling around the Web.”
To see how this might play out, one need only to look to Stanford, where last year 160,000 people in 190 countries registered for the online course Artificial Intelligence. The student corps bonded rapidly, forming Facebook study groups and offering translations of course materials in 44 languages. EdX is free, for now.
Does this cheapen an Ivy League education? Far from it. The biggest value of a Harvard degree is not the pedagogical experience itself, although I think that if you take a wide variety of courses and stray out of your comfort zone this place will make you a lot smarter. The value of a Harvard degree is that that it means you got into Harvard.
The biggest value of a Harvard degree is not the pedagogical experience itself, although I think that if you take a wide variety of courses and stray out of your comfort zone this place will make you a lot smarter.
To society, it signifies that the gatekeepers of the intellectual aristocracy deemed you worthy of admission. The brand is fueled by exclusivity, and open admission courses will always remain on the fray of this.
But despite the caution that intellectual and social mobility do not go hand in hand, if EdX runs smoothly, it promises to be one of the best things to happen to the University—and to fundamentally transform our role in the world.
Right now, Harvard benefits society mainly in the forms of admitting students from underprivileged groups, storing knowledge, and preserving the academic process and the trickle-down effect of its research. Are these goods equal and opposite to the immense concentration of wealth and power here? Probably not.
Universities are not engineered to play all the roles that this one does. They are conceived to provide instrumental educations, not to be sociopolitical forces. But because of the fortunes of history, many American universities—and foremost Harvard—find themselves in the awkward position of effectively being small welfare states without all of the political and international corrective mechanisms that actual countries have. Their reach as institutions has escaped their grasp as colleges.
This is what makes something like EdX so important. Nearly the only thing that can justify this privilege is a massive public works project like EdX. Wikipedia serves as an example of the potential of accessible self-education. Learners around the world use Wikipedia as an essential source of information. It has vastly increased the amount of knowledge publicly available to the average person. We may joke about trusting a site that anyone can edit, but the recent furor over the Stop Online Piracy Act demonstrates most clearly how important it is.
EdX can be Wikipedia times a hundred, with many times its impact and reach. When a software engineer in Tanzania wants to learn a new computer language, they will not have to buy a costly book or wade through the Wild West of current internet self-education—he or she will simply use EdX. When a middle schooler in America gets bored of her math classes, she can go to EdX and take accelerated courses. The most valuable courses of all could be English classes—ways in which writers and rebels worldwide can sharpen their tools of rhetoric and self-expression.
Harvard is especially well-positioned to take on the role of organizing online self-education because it has such a trusted name. The Chinese government may sporadically block Google and Facebook, but would its population stomach obstructions to a free Harvard education? In this vein, educating the world in as non-dogmatic a way as possible is a heavy responsibility. To execute this well would prove to the world that we are worthy of its respect and that our wealth is deserved.
We are lucky that, in this time of economic austerity, our local and national communities have tolerated Harvard’s privilege so well. To be honest, the quiet acceptance likely comes in part because loyal Harvard graduates are in positions of power. But sooner or later the general public will begin to ask, first in soft whispers and then in open cries, why is Harvard so rich while we suffer? When this happens, we should have an answer ready—and that Harvard is making a good-faith effort to create a free, worldwide educational platform is a very good one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few months into my freshman year, I was eating a meal with an older student when she launched into a tirade against the Administrative Board. Growing more and more passionate as she spoke, she described a number of friends’ experiences with the disciplinary body, each more secretive and nightmarish than the last. But just as her diatribe was reaching its climax, she did a strange thing: She leaned back in her chair, sighed, and said, “But I do love Harvard!”
This was my introduction to a strange tendency of Harvard students: No matter how unhappy we are, we are extremely unwilling to decry Harvard or our undergraduate experiences. Over the years since this meal, I’ve spoken to students with much bigger gripes than my friend—students who have quietly admitted to hating their social and academic lives—and they have nonetheless insisted that they, too, love Harvard. It’s no great secret why. We are well aware of Harvard’s miniscule acceptance rate, and the fact that students all over the world would gladly take our spots. To admit unhappiness, then, would seem wildly selfish and ungrateful. So we convince ourselves that the problem isn’t with our day-to-day lives—it’s with how we are looking at them. We tell ourselves that we love Harvard. We lie.
But as we don our robes and prepare to enter the world, I’d like to make the case for a kind of “grateful hatred” of Harvard. I’d like to suggest that for some students, it is best both to acknowledge the wealth of opportunities afforded to us by a Harvard education and yet to allow ourselves a little bit of ill will toward the institution itself.
To be clear, there are many students who loved their undergraduate years, and if you did, then this article is not for you. But as we begin the process of constructing a narrative of our time at this university, as we synthesize our often-overwhelming experiences into a story for our own telling, some of us will face the fact that the past four years were fundamentally unkind. And in choosing antipathy over self-deception, we can do much more to ensure our happiness in the many years after Harvard. For my part, I have concluded that Harvard was simply not a good environment for me—but in acknowledging a grateful hatred for this school, I have learned how to seek out a better life.
Perhaps the most important thing I’ve learned is something of a tautology: To be happy, you have to be happy often. Harvard students are talented at crafting narratives in which “learning valuable skills” or “meeting amazing people” somehow offsets a general day-to-day melancholy. I know that I embraced this idea, even when I knew that I was academically and socially dissatisfied on most days that end with “y.” But happiness only at parties, or in the twenty minutes after you turn in a problem set, or when you get to meet Mark Zuckerberg, is not real happiness. A happy life is one that is enjoyed in the living of it—one that we take pleasure from not because it is an “exceptional” life, but because we actually wake up every morning with a sense of hope and anticipation. Crafting such a life is an incredible challenge—but I think I’m better equipped to do so by acknowledging the reality of my undergraduate discontent.
Second, allowing yourself to hate Harvard can be a useful way to discover your values. For me, the problem of Harvard has boiled down to a desire for a lot more friendship, love, and sincerity. Though I fit many of the Harvard stereotypes—sardonic, competitive, ambitious—it took me years to admit that I struggled with Harvard’s unsupportive environment. Problem sets took precedent over friendships. Leadership positions superseded relationships. In the mad dash toward a good job and a bright future, hearts often got left out in the cold. And in many ways, it seemed that Harvard asked us to root for ourselves or to root for each other, but not both.
Some people are motivated by that kind of environment, but it wasn’t the ideal place for me to get my undergraduate education. I can make much better choices about my future career knowing this fact. And I never would have realized it, and would have kept on telling myself that I thrived in such a ruthless place, without allowing myself some real hostility.
Wherever we go after today, we will carry our Harvard experiences with us. And for some people, that will be a heavy load to bear. But if a change in perspective can turn four years of disappointment into a four-year lesson on how to live your life, then maybe that load can be made less burdensome. A little bit of grateful hate can go a long way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We wanted it to be special. During Commencement Week last year, while eating lunch together, we wondered: “Why doesn’t Harvard have a Sex Week?” Yale’s first Sex Week was held in 2002, and Sex Week started at Brown in 2009. At that time, Yale’s Sex Week wasn’t yet the subject of media controversy. Sexual health had not yet become the topic of politically charged public debate. Sex Week seemed like a great idea. What better way to learn about ourselves and our relationships than to provide a space for self-reflection and community-based discussion? When we first wrote an open letter explaining our hopes for Sex Week at Harvard, we had no idea what we were in for.
In terms of student initiatives and activism, Harvard always seems to be behind our peer Ivy League institutions, though this is not due to apathy on the part of students. There is plenty happening at Harvard, from the Student Labor Action Movement and Occupy Harvard’s demands for Harvard to divest from HEI Hotels & Resorts to the creation of the Fair Harvard Fund. This academic year saw the creation of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, a resource which, like the Women’s Center, which opened in 2006, was the result of student advocacy and protest. Where sexual health is concerned, the Radcliffe Union of Student’s Female Orgasm Seminar has been attracting huge crowds for eight consecutive years, and the Students for Choice’s 2009 Students Stop Stupak campaign received national coverage for its outspoken message. We admired the programming that was already occurring on campus, and we wanted to ensure that Sex Week would compliment pre-existing resources in a meaningful way.
To achieve this, we reached out to everyone we could think of, from the Office of Student Life to unrecognized social organizations. Along the way, we learned that there was an astonishing amount of support for broadening the public and intellectual discourse on issues of sex and sexuality. We collected dozens of student, faculty, and alumni statements of support. More than 40 student organizations and Harvard offices signed on to help with Sex Week in some capacity, including groups from Harvard Law School and Harvard Divinity School. Sex Week would not have been possible without the hard work of all of our sponsors and co-sponsors.
Planning Sex Week wasn’t all smooth sailing. We were continually asked if we were planning an orgy (the answer was no). We learned that the key to outreach is following up, following up, and following up again. We discovered that anything that happens at Harvard is national news. We found, to our bemusement, that every reporter wanted to know what our parents thought about our actions. (Many were shocked to learn that a parent had personally hand-sewn a vulva costume for the event!) Most pressingly, we found that the idea that students can decide on, initiate, and promote our own sexual health education was much more contentious than we thought it should be.
Walking into a room of strangers—but also potentially our friends, acquaintances, classmates, and teammates—to lay bare our lives, particularly those parts that we hold to be private, secret, shameful, embarrassing, and sacred, is scary. During Sex Week, we provided a safe space for vigorous introspection and interrogation of the interplay between sex and religion, racial stereotyping, BDSM, abstinence, and asexuality, among many other topics. Despite media reports to the contrary, as we learned from sociologist Lisa Wade, who spoke at Sex Week thanks to the support of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response, students are hooking up less than our parents did in college. This may be because we realize that having choices in our sexual lives does not automatically grant us freedom, equality, transcendence, happiness, or whatever else we may want. And that’s fine. We’re young—we are still discovering what is best for us.
We know that to understand our own lives and to make sound choices for ourselves, we need accurate information that necessarily takes a balanced view of human sexuality and relationships and speaks to our beliefs, values, identities, and communities. And we also know that we aren’t dependent on mainstream media, pornography, or the Internet for our sex education. We can educate ourselves. Sex Week at Harvard proved to us that college students are mature, intelligent, and brave enough to engage in a public discourse about sex, sexuality, relationships, and intimacy and to arrive at deeply personal understandings of their needs and desires.
It’s been a year since we decided that it was time to educate ourselves, and we don’t plan to stop after the first time or after leaving Harvard. Although we won’t be students enrolled in college forever, health, wellness, love, and intimacy should be lifelong pursuits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Commencement, we are naturally told to look backward and to celebrate what Harvard has been for us. We are continually reminded of the privilege inherent in being Harvard students, perhaps this week more than ever before. I, like many of my peers, feel immense gratitude for all that Harvard has given me: the knowledge, the personal growth, and the appreciation for powernaps.
In the midst of all the nostalgic reflection, I have found a few moments to also imagine what it might be like to be at Harvard another century from now. Notwithstanding the continued use of printed study cards, much will certainly have changed in a hundred years. The Harvard I know never settles; we will always strive to move onward in the right direction. But for this next century, I feel we must evaluate and experiment at a whole new level to find and pursue that direction.
Change begins from within: We must critically examine our institution in its present and historical state before designing its future. In a challenging world where nearly every profession is increasingly specialized, the Harvard education continues to fulfill its purpose of preparing students for technically focused careers without sacrificing broad knowledge across fields. Today’s multidisciplinary Harvard reflects the vision of Charles W. Eliot, its 21st President, one of the boldest innovators Harvard has known. Around 100 years ago, he led the infusion of Harvard’s largely classical liberal arts curriculum with practically-oriented technical courses, thereby endowing Harvard with the best of both worlds.
A century later, many Harvard teachers continue to innovate boldly to take the already stellar Harvard education to the next level. Computer Science 50 is one extremely successful course that relies heavily on peer-to-peer learning; the introductory global health class Societies of the World 25 demonstrates the power of multigenerational teaching and learning by using student-generated case studies as instructional materials. Generous alumni gifts continue to encourage such innovation in teaching, a reassuring commitment to keep Harvard at the forefront of university education.
But in the next century, Harvard will permanently transform more than in any previous era, meriting reform that transcends pedagogy. The roles of professors, students, advisers, administrators, workers, and alumni will evolve, synthesizing a new kind of Harvard community. So it is now time to craft a new vision for our university, the development of which should have a part for all community members. While we will always need strong executive leadership to chart the course, our destination should be determined by consensus.
A unilateral vision for the next century will invariably be weaker than one which is informed by the views of many. Even Eliot, the luminary who shaped modern Harvard through his 40-year tenure, could not get it all right on his own. For instance, although he was ahead of his time in revolutionizing the Harvard education, overhauling American university research, and advocating for racial equality, his opposition to organized labor inadvertently contributed to the poor treatment of Harvard workers, a trend shamefully persisting through the end of the century. Eliot’s top-down approach that epitomizes Harvard’s corporate culture may have worked for past centuries, but it will not sustain a vibrant university community in the twenty-first.
The Harvard Corporation, inertial by nature, has thus far invested little in the kind of institutional flexibility that will pay dividends in the next century. Anyone in the administration will acknowledge the glacial pace of progress at Harvard; faculty members are frustrated by the rigid, expansive bureaucracy; students leave frustrated with their initiatives stalled in proposal mode. Looking forward, a more participatory approach incorporating the diverse insights of many talented individuals would undoubtedly serve our institution better.
We must ultimately transform Harvard—first in our minds and then in practice—from an organization whose primary service is education to a community of thinkers. Based on our interactions with our mentors, our peers, and the world around us, the current generation of students certainly envisions Harvard as such a community. The Class of 2012 reflects this new level of engagement with our alma mater, having launched a comprehensive initiative for social justice and founded the Fair Harvard Fund; we will hopefully be surpassed in our efforts by the Class of 2013 and beyond.
If any community can successfully redefine itself for the 21st century, I believe it to be the one we enjoy at Harvard. Unlike in previous centuries, the question of what our university shall be will not be answered by one person—or even by a handful of people. It will be answered by all of us—women and men—studying, learning, teaching, working, and serving here. So, what’s next, Harvard?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2008-09 academic year kicked off in the midst of exceptional growth: The campus had expanded with the successful construction of Northwest Laboratories only a year before, and school budgets were quickly growing to accommodate more faculty.
But just a few weeks after students returned to campus from their summer vacations, the American markets crashed. And as stock prices slipped, so did Harvard’s endowment. Between the University’s direct holdings of financial securities and assets managed by external financial institutions, the endowment dropped by nearly 30 percent, tumbling from $36.9 billion down to $26 billion.
Fast forward to today. The University is approaching the end of its 2012 fiscal year. Saddled with reduced income from a still-depressed endowment, the University is currently managing increased budget responsibilities while wading through the continued ripples of the financial crisis that struck nearly four years ago.
“We have a smaller endowment and larger obligations,” University President Drew G. Faust said. “Those are very real challenges for us.”
A TEAR IN THE HULL
As Harvard’s endowment posted losses of nearly 30 percent in late 2008 and early 2009, deans and department administrators scrambled to cut budgets. Across the University, 275 workers were laid off, and hundreds were given reduced work hours. According to Wayne M. Langley, higher education director for Service Employees International Union Local 615, which represents many service employees at Harvard and other institutions in New England, unionized service workers at the University lost on average five hours of work per week.
“That may not seem like a lot,” said Langley. “But for people who are low-income workers, that makes a big difference.”
Harvard was trying to trim as much as it could. In order to pay for their budgets, schools in the University collect incomes from the endowment, annual donations, federal funding, and student tuitions. Normally, this revenue covers the total expenses of each of the schools.
But 2008 was not a normal year. As the University’s endowment tanked, donations, net tuitions, and other sources of incomes slowed to a drip, too. But by the time the market collapsed, the Harvard Corporation, the highest governing body of the University, had already approved the University’s budget through June 2009.
Pressed by reduced income to pay for their annual expenses, schools cut budgets to varying degrees.
BAILING THE WATER OUT
Starting in the winter of 2008-09, the Business School turned down the thermostat a few degrees at night to save at the margins. Administrators encouraged community members to shut down their computers at the end of the day and installed new, energy-efficient windows. But even as the financial outlook for the University has improved, the Business School has not gone back to its old habits.
“We thought to ourselves at the end of the recession, ‘Do we keep this in place?’” Business School Chief Financial Officer Richard P. Melnick said.
Administrators have  appreciated the new challenge of paring their respective budgets, enjoying the new efficiency the focus has granted the departments. Most of these tune-ups are here to stay, even as the University recoups its endowment’s value and respective distribution increases.
“All of those kinds of scrutiny and efficiencies that came out of questions we asked in the wake of the downturn—we will continue,” Faust said.
For example, administrators and staff members at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs realized they could cope with fewer workers. According to Patrick McVay, director of finance for the Weatherhead Center, several staff members were leaving or retiring as the center was searching for ways to trim its budget. Now a few years out, the center has not refilled those positions.
“We’ve never returned to our previous staffing levels,” McVay said. “People sort of come together and you kind of muddle through, and you learn to do things that other people used to do. And I think we did that pretty well.”
Even across the river in Boston, at its offices on the 16th floor of the Boston’s Federal Reserve Building, the Harvard Management Company has rebooted its investment strategies. HMC, which manages the University’s endowment, has placed an increased preference on liquidity, thereby boosting Harvard’s access to quick cash. This access to greater liquidity, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said, will allow the University to manage risk better.
RIGHTING THE SHIP
This September will mark four years since the financial crisis shook the American markets and dragged Harvard’s endowment down. In that time, Harvard has recovered $6 billion from the $11 billion loss that the endowment weathered. But some schools are just emerging from recovery mode.
Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, recently won approval for two faculty searches. And this fall, after initial slowdown because of the limited available resources, Asani was even able to collect resources from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to establish a new Modern Middle Eastern Studies concentration track.
“Things seem to be easing up,” Asani said.
FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan projected that the FAS deficit would likely be closed by the end of Fiscal Year 2012, this June 30. “The good news is that we’re slightly less endowment-dependent than at the beginning of the crisis,” Kirwan said.
This upswing is not just at FAS. Administrators at the Divinity School and the Law School said that their respective schools have proliferated in numnber of programs. At the Business School, faculty levels this year will likely increase to their pre-2008 number.
But for workers, the mood is still gloomy. Jerome J. Leslie was laid off from his job as web content manager in the Division of Medical Sciences at the Medical School in July 2009. Even though he was the only person in the office laid off, Leslie said that after the financial crisis, the workplace environment changed.
“No one really felt safe,” said Leslie, who was re-hired in October, just a few months after being laid off, by the Harvard Press Office.
The recent trend in staffing is, overall, positive, according to Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Director Bill Jaeger, who said that 150 of the approximately 250 HUCTW jobs lost in 2008-09 have returned.
“I think, over time, the staffing levels are going to come back,” he said.
Jaeger pointed to growth-oriented initiatives, such as the House renewal project and a new plan for Allston, as signs that the University is getting over the effects of the recession.
“The University is on the way back and is entering growth mode again,” he said.
SAILING ON
As Faust said, the challenge of paying for more with less has not yet disappeared. Even as some schools begin to show improvement, volatile capital markets at home and abroad have led some administrators to admit that it might be some time before Harvard’s endowment returns to its pre-2008 levels. “A world in which our revenues are more constrained than our costs is likely in the near future,” Kirwan said. “There’s a lot of natural growth in expenses, but little natural growth in revenues.”
Kirwan said that FAS had cast a hopeful eye toward the University’s impending capital campaign for paying off some current debt. The current fiscal year seems like it will be a modest one for HMC’s annual returns. The S&P 500, an index of the 500 most valuable publicly traded companies, has stayed roughly flat from the start of the 2012 fiscal year, July 1, through the middle of May. And Harvard is still trying to manage the additional burden from the 2008 financial crisis.
“We are still feeling the effects,” Faust said. “We will be feeling the effects for a very long time to come.”

To the 2012 Graduating Classes of Harvard University,
Congratulations! Today you receive one of the most hard-earned and enviable degrees in American education. I hope you know what it’s worth.
I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, most of that time on welfare.Though everything was broken—the schools, sidewalks, playgrounds, families—we were blessed to have a strong community and nobody ever told me I couldn’t make something of my life. Like some of today’s graduates, I was the first in my family to go to college. The whole process of applying was unfamiliar to me and totally foreign to my family. When I got the letter saying that I was admitted to the college I most wanted to go to, I called home and got my grandmother on the phone.
“Gram,” I said. “I’m going to college next year. I’m going to Harvard.”
Schooled no farther than the third grade herself, she cried out with joy and carried on telling me how excited and proud she was. Then she paused and asked, “Now, where is that anyway?”
At first I was embarrassed, even a little indignant. In time I realized it wasn’t the prestige she was excited about. It was the opportunity. So, in the same spirit, my congratulations to you are not just for achieving the prestige of a Harvard degree, but for being on the brink of opportunity. I want you to make the most of it.
I hope you will consider staying here in Massachusetts. We need you. With one of the most active venture capital communities in the world and the premium we place on intellectual capacity, our Commonwealth is one of the best places in the world for innovators and entrepreneurs. Be a part of the largest biotech and life sciences super-cluster in the world, or the explosive clean tech, information technology or financial services sectors. Start a company of your own or jump onboard one of our many start-ups. We are one of the top states for job growth—over 130,000 open positions in April alone. Opportunity is everywhere.
If you’re looking to continue your education, we have the highest concentration of learning opportunities in the world: medical schools, law schools, business schools, doctorate programs, research opportunities.
Whether your orientation is toward the private sector or the not-for-profit sector, we have graduate programs to support your interests and expand your understanding.
With opportunity comes responsibility, and I urge you to bear that in mind today and beyond. Each of us is charged with a generational responsibility, that old fashioned notion that we must do what we can in our time to leave things better for those who come behind us.
Earlier generations did no less for us. That’s why we have a T to ride and the Charles River Esplanade to stroll along. That’s why we can receive care in world-class hospitals and catch a game at Fenway Park. That’s why we can listen to Brahms at Tanglewood in the Berkshires and fly to the far corners of the world and back from Logan Airport. Heck, that’s why we have Harvard University and other great institutions to prepare exceptional graduates like you. We have this and more because an earlier generation made choices not just for their time and person but for tomorrow and others.
Deval L. Patrick ’78 is the 71st and current governor of Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, Senior Week represents a bridge between childhood and adulthood, filled with activities ranging from picnics and amusement park trips to gambling and the reliving of epic college nights. The week leading up to graduation is a time for seniors both to remember the experiences that defined childhood and reflect upon how views of the world have evolved during these formative years.
 
 As Harvard students, we have each sought to have our voice heard in our own way. For some, this has meant redefining course expectations through high academic achievement or setting athletics records during games or tournaments. More often than not, this has also meant taking upon a campus issue, local initiative, or global concern and channeling that passion into change. Of course, whatever avenue of “voice” students choose, a common obstacle is the presence of leadership that dismisses youth as inexperienced or rebellious.   
Yet, as you have proven, these stigmatized, “immature” views have the power to influence and impact society on a variety of levels. In this past semester alone, peers have launched Sex Week to raise awareness of sex and sexuality, created a socially responsible investment campaign—the Fair Harvard Fund—to inform Harvard Management Corporation’s investment strategies, and organized Harvard for the Horn to address the famine and humanitarian crisis in Northeast Africa. By volunteering, organizing, rallying, protesting, occupying, and now graduating, you have repeatedly demonstrated the ability of youth to address societal problems and to work with adults to produce collaborative solutions. Your work, as well as the work of youth before us, has exemplified the importance of youth engagement in policies that directly affect us.   
 
 In his Day of Affirmation speech, Robert F. Kennedy ’48 stated, “This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure of the life of ease.” As you venture outside Harvard’s gates and join the ranks of world leadership, do not forget the fresh perspective and passion that defined your time within the gates. Your views will naturally evolve with the experiences and opportunities that await you, so continue to complement your youth views with graduate, real world perspective.  
The real world needs not only the qualities of the youth, but also adult decision-makers that actively listen to the youth. When new perspectives fall on deaf ears or are simply dismissed with a “wait until you’re older,” they fail to produce the innovative, collaborative solutions we seek. Therefore, we call on all of you to make a commitment to your current selves. Incorporate the voices of youth into decision-making processes. In your positions of leadership across the globe, remember how you had to fight to be heard during your college years. And, as you walk back through Harvard’s gates at class reunions, remind yourself of the need to engage young people to create innovative solutions to shared challenges.  
 After Senior Week, the graduation ceremonies in Tercentenary Theatre, and your House courtyard, society will accept your diploma as a pass to leave Harvard’s gates and enter the real world. However, this real world won’t be broadcasted on Music Television. You only live once, so seize the imagination of those who are still in the “best years of their lives” when you are past your own. Take a minute to record and instill in your mind the fire and passion that defines you today. Seek out that same spirit in the youth of tomorrow.   
 
 Until then, keep reliving your childhood experiences, appreciating all that you have gained from obtaining your degree, and ruffling feathers with elders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He just wanted to move a door.
The request was simple: A faculty member needed more space for a new graduate student. But when he wrote to the administrator he thought would be responsible for that, he was redirected to another administrator. He tried again; he was kicked to another administrator. And finally he got an answer back: It would be expensive, and it would take time.
So with two graduate students, the faculty member went to work himself. In 20 minutes, they unhinged the door. It had cost nothing.
This is the anecdote of one professor, who wished to remain anonymous to maintain his relationship with the administrators involved. But it is also part of a larger story. Over the past ten years, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has seen a proliferation of its administrative positions that has outpaced the growth of tenure-track faculty. While this growth has led to greater efficiency and focus, it has also created a complex bureaucracy at Harvard’s largest school.
This “corporatization,” as many faculty members and even some administrators call the trend, is not unprompted. With more federal demand for research oversight and a once-quickly growing faculty, the school’s office workers were finding themselves with more paperwork on their desks, larger facilities to maintain, and an institutional reputation to protect.
But by the time FAS found itself with more than 3,000 administrators and staff, the transition had changed the culture of the school, according to many faculty members. They suggest that communication between professors and University Hall has diminished. There is a new door between faculty and administrators, and with every new assistant or associate dean, that door closes just a bit more. On one side are the hallways of a traditional, open academic institution. On the other lie the offices of FAS, Inc.
NEW CHIEF OFFICERS
When William C. Kirby moved into his corner office on the second floor of University Hall as the new dean of FAS in 2002, departing FAS Dean Jeremy R. Knowles left him some advice. Managing the school’s more than 600 faculty without much intermediate support was too much for one dean—especially when the school desperately needed to hire more faculty. Before he joined as dean, Kirby remembers, one department in the life sciences had failed to attract nine of the last ten of its search candidates for senior faculty positions.
“For some time the governing boards had been encouraging the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to expand,” Kirby says. “There was a strong perception that we were in danger of falling seriously behind in several important fields.”
And so FAS expanded, and quickly. The school began multiplying its number of ladder faculty at the end of Knowles’ tenure as dean, and Kirby accelerated that hiring spree. From 2001 to 2008, 100 tenure-track faculty were added to the previous core of 619 professors. Initially, a single faculty dean presided over the entire operation. The Corporation, FAS administrators, and even faculty realized that this might no longer be practical.
“My sense was that too much rested on a single person in the form of the dean,” says Carol J. Thompson, former associate dean for academic affairs.
“You can’t  have a single dean doing this,” says linguistics professor Jay H. Jasanoff ’63. “It requires competencies that most people don’t have.”
So Kirby decided early in his tenure to create a new network of deans that would operate below him: faculty divisional deans for the humanities, social science, life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences. Kirby hoped that these faculty deans would bring personal knowledge of research and teaching into the administration and also serve as ambassadors for the administration to their peers in departments.
Current FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, a tenured professor in computer science himself, meets weekly with the Academic Planning Group, composed of school and divisional deans; these faculty leaders regularly check in with their own department chairs. Smith says the communication between each layer of the administrative organization allows suggestions, thoughts, and concerns to ultimately make their way to him.
But the new divisional deans would foreshadow a slew of non-academic administrators in FAS.
ADJUSTING SUPPLY TO A SHIFTING DEMAND
In 2006, the federal government launched an investigation into the possibility that Yale University researchers inappropriately used more than $3 billion in grants from over thirty federal agencies. The university eventually settled for $7.6 million, but the incident showcased the need for greater administrative oversight over research and scholarship at academic institutions.
This episode was a “major factor” in Harvard’s decision to open Research Administration Services, a new office that now employs 29 people to oversee federal research compliance, according to Associate Dean for Research Administration Patrick W. Fitzgerald.
“Our priorities at this level are to facilitate what faculty do, but to get them to comply with rules and regulations,” Fitzgerald says.
In this way, Fitzgerald—and other administrators like him—provides support to the faculty. “One of the reasons for staff growth is to relieve the administrative burden on faculty,” Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 says. Kirwan, who is second in authority only to Smith in FAS’s governance structure, is the highest ranking non-faculty administrator in FAS.
In addition to expanding the base of administrators to manage greater external pressures, FAS leadership has also created new positions to help respond to student demands. When senior exit survey results indicated that students wanted more advising, for example, offices were created for academic support and advising, according to Jorge I. Dominguez, government professor and vice provost for international affairs.
But as administrative ranks swell with middle managers and support staff for hundreds of administrators—there are 69 with “dean” in their title and many other directors and executive assistants—faculty members say there is a new drag in the school. Implementing innovative ideas and getting answers to questions can now take longer.
“It’s not a structure that’s agile and can move quickly,” says Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.
“Because of the large increase in the administrative apparatus, necessarily things have become more formal,” says Henry S. Rosovsky, who served as dean of FAS from 1973 to 1984. “Greater formality may make it less interesting or desirable for faculty to participate.”
According to some faculty, a rigid system of delegating responsibilities down a chain of command is gradually replacing the open dialogue among peers that has traditionally characterized academic institutions. Faculty members communicate more with department chairs than with the upper-level administrators who often wield the most authority.
“The relationship has a corporate kind of structure,” says Eric N. Jacobsen, chair of the chemistry department.
PASSING MEMOS
When Jacobsen petitioned FAS to authorize a new faculty search earlier in May, he placed his report on the divisional dean’s desk. Beyond that point, he says he does not  necessarily know how the decision to say “yes” or “no” will be made.
“These critical decisions that impact the future of the department are [now] made behind a closed door,” Jacobsen says.
Smith, however, says that he maintains varied and frequent contact with the faculty. “I am a tenured member of the faculty. I work with faculty constantly,” he writes in an email to The Crimson. “In fact, no major decision is made at the FAS without significant faculty consultation.”
Professors participate in 67 standing committees, and many, including Smith, cite the Faculty Council—a body of 18 elected tenure-track and non-tenured faculty—as one of the strongest forums for dialogue.
But faculty members also confess that their priorities—teaching and research—often come before their desire to participate in faculty governance.
“Faculty have always had a rather odd attitude,” says Rosovsky. “On the one hand they want to influence decisions, and on the other hand, they don’t want to put in the time to change things.”
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC?
Kirby says that professors will get involved if they are included in decisions they care about. And faculty members have not been shy about expressing their frustration when not consulted on such decisions.
Months after leaders of the newly-organized Harvard University Library announced their intention to reduce its workforce, for example, uproar has yet to die down over the lack of faculty input in the library’s transition process. Many suggest that the library, the University’s primary asset in scholarship, cannot be effectively governed from the top down.
“If what has happened to the library is evidence, then it’s not a good thing to be more corporate,” says English professor Joseph C. Harris. “There’s nobody listening when faculty members are talking. There’s nobody listening up there.”
Even the monthly Faculty Meetings do not always provide a satisfactory forum through which professors can engage in spontaneous and frank discussion. Just a few weeks ago, the sudden announcement of the central administration’s decision to close the Financial Planning Group—which provides many faculty members with financial advice and retirement planning services—drew sharp criticism from professors.
At the faculty meeting this May, multiple professors used the question period to challenge Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 on his decision to close the FPG without first consulting faculty. But because the discussion was not part of the meeting’s agenda, an 80 percent majority vote from the faculty would have been required to extend conversation on the matter—a motion that did not pass.
“[The Docket Committee] several times thought about trying to arrange time at faculty meetings for more wide-ranging discussions—we never quite saw a way of doing it,” says Richard J. Tarrant, interim dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a classics professor. “There is some kind of structural problem or obstacle to having that kind of open discussion.”
“It seems to me that the faculty and administration are not communicating as well as they have in the past,” says German professor Peter J. Burgard, adding that those who expressed frustration over the FPG decision are planning a meeting to discuss communication within the faculty and with the administration, along with stronger methods of faculty governance.
Almost all Harvard faculty interviewed for this article said that as a result of being excluded from important discussions, the sense of ownership they used to feel for Harvard and FAS—their University, their school—is dissipating.
“Some colleagues have suggested we might discuss the possibility of a faculty senate or some kind of caucus,” Burgard says. “We have faculty governance, technically. It’s just a question to what degree it happens in practice.”
KEEPING UP WITH THE COMPETITION
Harvard is not alone in witnessing a burgeoning bureaucracy in recent years.
“I think there has been a seismic shift from an academic culture to a corporate culture in universities across the country,” says Michael Shinagel, senior lecturer in English and dean of the Extension School.
According to Benjamin Ginsberg, author of the book “The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters,” the past 25 years have seen a 50 percent growth in the number of faculty at colleges and universities in the United States but an 80 percent growth in the number of deans and provosts. The number of non-academic administrators—whom Ginsberg terms “deanlets”—has exploded by 240 percent.
“The faculty everywhere has looked around and discovered it’s been displaced,” Ginsberg says.
At Harvard, the number of ladder faculty grew by about 16 percent from 2001 to 2008. In the same time period, the number of University-funded staff in administrative or professional roles has jumped roughly twice as much, according to the Fact Book published by the Office of Budget and Financial Planning.
FAS did reduce the number of administrators and staff in 2009, from 3,100 to approximately 2,900, as part of its strategy to eliminate the $220 million two-year deficit caused by the 2008 financial crisis. But the nearly 3,000-strong operation still outnumbers the faculty.
FROM TWEED TO PINSTRIPES
In the Faculty Club, oil paintings hang on the dark wood-paneled walls. Elegant flower arrangements brighten the hallways. And once upon a time, there was a “long table”—a place for faculty without appointments to drop in for lunch. When he was University president, Derek C. Bok would often frequent the long table, Rosovsky remembers. But many faculty say that the drift toward a more corporate structure may be eroding this kind of “meaningful human contact”—interaction that Rosovsky considers critical to Harvard’s values.
That today’s top administrators would frequent the Faculty Club seems “inconceivable” to Rosovsky. “I think President Faust might enjoy that kind of thing,” he says, “but I don’t think it’s really possible today.”
Some administrators are trying to reach across the divide. Gary P. Cormier, director of human resources consulting, recently met the chair of the statistics department at the Faculty Club—for a business meeting, to discuss performance management techniques.
“As FAS has gotten larger and larger...the challenge remains how to get buy-in and vet issues with faculty—you have to remember to do it,” Cormier says. “I think Harvard is such a big place that it’s much easier to work down than sideways.”
But this top-down structure has engendered a malaise through which the faculty and the administration see each other as separate entities.
“Harvard is very special and our job is to keep it special—the faculty and the administration certainly share that view,” says Jacobsen. “Ideally, we should be able to do that without the faculty and administration feeling like we’re on opposite sides.”

The first box was the easiest to fill. Anything could go in it. So went my books from Social Studies 10a, “Lyrical Ballads,” Bellamy’s “Looking Backward.” To fill in the empty space (unlike puzzles, packed boxes still have holes) I jigsawed in thumb tacks, extra tape rolls, foam mounting squares, mint green earplugs from CVS. In a Microsoft word document, yesterday, I typed “Box 1” so as to keep track of it all, and then bent the box' wings and taped them bowed.
I’m not sure yet what number box the mugs holding pens and pencils will go in. I don’t want the mugs to break, see, and I don’t want all the pens to spill out. What do I do with the stack of papers there, now to my right, like they have been all year? And the pirate hat?
Packing is a process of emptying a space that a few months ago I filled. An element of packing is maintaining a certain order of things: books as I read them, shoes and shoes together. “Box 2” holds some American novels; a guide to footnoting and endnoting in Chicago style; more books; “Paradise Lost.” “Box 3” contains books from a tutorial called “Freedom” which, problematically enough, I am interested in selling; paper clips; books about the Constitution; my high school copy of the “Iliad”; and from this last semester, “Ulysses.” The change that had accumulated in a mug from various purchases of sandwiches and coffee is now in a ziplock. The shelves in my room have more visible depth now that their contents are gone.
I read the pages of these books, now in boxes, with varying degrees of urgency and thoroughness, depending on the due date of the paper, or the due date of an article, and, sometimes, how sunny the day was. I missed much of the farming section in “Anna Karenina.” It can be said that I missed much of “Bleak House.” But others of these books I read slowly and with care. In the margin beside Dostoyevsky’s phrase “But there is a Being and He can forgive everything,” I wrote, “backed into ideological corner.” Elsewhere, I wrote “wow,” and circled the word, “forever.”
For social studies, my concentration, all seniors were made to write an “Intellectual Autobiography”—a 1,000-word explication of one’s journey through college. What course led to the next, what idea led one to care about X, why ultimately one ended up writing one’s thesis about Y. In other words: explain why one has the books on one’s shelf that one has. I insisted before writing the thing, in vague rebellion, that I did not have a linear narrative to tell. I started interested in China, I ended interested in George Eliot. Between, who knows. But somehow, when I actually wrote the thing, I realized that in sum, the books on my shelf did have some coherence, some unifying interest, in generosity and sympathy.
A while ago, I wrote an article for this paper about the Depository—a large facility roughly 30 miles from Harvard Yard that contained, as of 2010, 45 percent of Harvard’s books. It was so odd, I thought then, how the books there were shelved not with spines facing outward, grouped by subject or author, but rather ordered by size, aspects of the books’ materiality. The Depository is a storage facility. Then Assistant Director of the Depository Thomas E. Schneiter said of it: “It really is an industrial operation. Our product just happens to be books.” Now, here I am, doing the same: cramming books into boxes, like any other thing that needs to be moved, along with a DVD of “The Sound of Music” and a Lego farmer figurine.
After four years here, it is the things—the change, the books, three green highlighters, five unused spiraled notebooks—that remain and need to be boxed and moved. I do not know what relationship this stuff has with my experience or what bearing it will have on my memories. “Box 4” holds one towel, running spandex, various organizational sweatshirts, long-sleeved t-shirts, and socks. Are they themselves significant?
It is through packing that it has become evident that I am leaving. The empty shelves tell me, unequivocally, that I will be gone. Later today, I will paint over the blue stripes I added to my walls earlier this year. I will roll up my carpet. I will take out my trash and then put in the back of a car the things I intend to keep.
There is a certain arrogance to something that is often said of this college: that we learn more from each other than from our classes. There is of course something to this. I have learned much from my friends, my roommates especially. But I think as well, and not just because I spent yesterday lifting them, that the books mattered a great deal. Not how manifestly heavy they are, but what they say: something that requires the boxes be opened again to see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 16 months and a series of dramatic hurdles, election day for Egypt finally arrives. Today and tomorrow mark the first round of Egypt’s presidential election with the expected runoff between the two largest recipients of votes slated for June 16, 2012. Originally considered a two-horse race between Amr Moussa, former head of the Arab League, and Abdel Moneim Abul-Foutouh, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader, the race has opened dramatically over the last month. Now, at least five candidates seem capable of making the runoff with the three additions of the Nasserite, Hamdeen Sabahi, the Muslim Brotherhood’s official candidate, Mohamed Mursi, and a former minister of former President Hosni Mubarak’s executive cabinet, Ahmed Shafiq.
Under international pressure, President Mubarak held Egypt’s first ever-contested presidential election in 2005. Dr. Ayman Nour, founder of the independent Ghad Party and an activist with a reputation for causing trouble, challenged Mubarak, earning nine percent of the vote in an election plagued by widespread fraud. Predictably, the government locked Dr. Nour into prison on false charges until his eventual release for medical reasons in 2009.
At the start of the Egyptian revolution last January, over 20 percent of Egyptians said they would vote for Ayman Nour, according to one poll. Unfortunately, in April of this year, the Election Committee prohibited Dr. Nour, along with nine other candidates, from entering the election. In Dr. Nour’s case, his “crimes”— agitating the previous regime— prevented his candidacy. Regardless, Dr. Nour remains one of the most influential liberal and secular voices in the Egyptian political scene.
Last week, I interviewed Dr. Nour in his Cairo apartment. Below are pieces of our conversation:
Egypt is one week from its first-ever legitimate presidential election. As someone imprisoned for participating in its first-ever contested presidential elections in 2005, did you ever expect that Egypt would reach this day?
 
Honestly, I was expecting a better day than today and a better situation than this one. This election that is being completed now is really just a half-election. The first half of the election occurred far from the ballot box at the hands of the election committee, which removed 10 strong candidates, including me, from the election. None of us were allowed to return, except Ahmed Shafiq [who was a prominent minister in Mubarak’s executive cabinet].
With the day-to-day coverage, we seem to forget how far Egypt has come in 16 months. How does Egypt of today differ from the Egypt of 2010?
 
If you entered a place that I had recently painted, then, sure, you would at first feel that something has changed. But we wanted to rebuild the country. We did not want to repaint it from the outside. We never reached deep enough to change the structures of the country. We were painting Egypt’s exterior, but we wanted to reform the inside. We want the usual or normal Egyptian citizen to feel like his life was improved by the revolution and he regained his dignity. The demands of the revolution have not been met.
How do you think the failure to write a new constitution before the presidential elections will affect the position of the Presidency after the elections?
 
Yes, it may affect the transition process, but we don’t want to write a constitution that we will be forced to rewrite a year or two later. We should take a year or the appropriate time to write a constitution that could last a century.
You have discussed the role of liberals in the revolution on many occasions. What should be the political role of liberals if a non-liberal wins the Presidential Election? And how can liberals become influential again in the political scene?
 
If a non-liberal wins the election, we will accept the election’s outcome no matter the result because we are democratic people. But we will go back to work in the opposition, since there is still a system we have political differences with. We will go back to resisting all political monopolies like we have for the last 55 years. We were resisting a military dictatorship and we would resist an Islamist version of it for the principle of fighting authoritarianism. We are Muslims and [the Ghad party] has Islamic understandings and we have a good, strong relationship with Al-Azhar and we respect Al-Azhar’s main figures. We do not have a problem with religion. We have a problem with the people who govern in the name of religion. I am not with any monopoly. If the liberals were monopolizing power, then I would be against it. We are forced to go back to being an opposition. It is written in our fate to be in the opposition.
The election campaign in Egypt has been short compared to most election campaigns in the World. Do you think that the campaigns have not been able to fully express in their programs? Are there any issues that the candidates have not discussed adequately?
 
There are many issues.
For instance?
 
The conversation between the military and the civil sphere about the future and the present is a very important issue that should have been clearly discussed in the presidential debates or candidate platforms. We all put our heads in the sand like ostriches. When the military comes up, we all respect the “big, great, and important military institution” or whatever. Those words are just rhetoric. Those words must be translated through a clear vision on our position on the military budget. What’s our position on the transparency on the budget? What’s our position dealing with the laws regarding the military? Will this issue be discussed with them or be agreed upon somehow? Is the military looking for a ruling role or not? What’s our position if the military is looking for that? My opinion is that this subject was never discussed in an honest way. Every talk regarding these questions is just lip service to satisfy the military or compliment it. There are no specific statements. This is a very important point in time because this is the point when the military will either hand over power to a civil elected power or not hand it over. This would return us to the scenario of 1954 in Egypt and other times. I think these are important issues and they require discussion.
Do you think there is a possibility for a second revolution or do you think that, at this point, people are tired and prefer stability?
 
The people want stability, but the people also wont accept the revolution’s defeat. I do not want to predict what will happen if Ahmed Shafiq wins the elections. I don’t want to say that because I’m someone who believes in democracy and the results of elections. But I’m sure that if a person like Ahmed Shafiq succeeds, there are others who believe less in democracy and they will not accept the election’s results. People will go to Tahrir Square immediately to demand the fall of a president who is the same flesh and blood of [President Mubarak]. Anyway, we have fears for the date of Mubarak’s trial, June 2. And we have fears for what could occur after that. And we have fears that the election results will come out in a way that will provoke the passions and emotions of many Egyptians.
Presidents Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak all pursued very different economic policies and each left his own mark in Egypt’s economic sphere. What do you expect from the next President and how will it serve Egypt?
Truly, the next President will face a huge economic problem and his presidency will begin with this crisis at hand. He must aim to face a great number a crises like the water from the Nile, which is an explosive problem. Also, he will have problems with the rates of development. And he will face a problem with the amount of internal and external public debt, which is increasing, and already eating a third of Egypt’s yearly budget. And he will have unbalanced trade and unbalanced spending and he will face a crisis in all sectors of the economy. So there should be a comprehensive agenda to face the economic crisis in Egypt.
Two weeks ago, your political party, the Ghad party, announced that it would not support Abul-Fotouh or Mursi. What do you fear from a President with an Islamist background?
 
No, we have no fears from anyone for their Islamist background, but we are afraid of having a single authority with legislative power and executive power and this would be a kind of monopolization of political power. But we don’t have a problem with the Islamist movement. We are cooperating with Islamists and there is permanent contact and permanent coordination between us. But we are not with a President who represents the Islamist orientation in light of the presence of Islamists in the People’s Assembly, the Shura Council, and the Cabinet.
In the last couple weeks, many public figures, including many liberals and revolutionary youth groups, have announced their support for Hamdeen Sabahi, what do you think about that trend?
Sabahi is a colleague and a friend and I love Hamdeen so much. Friendships like this sometimes lead public figures to support their friends politically. So, in other words, if I did not have a political party or a political movement that I were responsible for, and I could chose with my heart, then I would choose Hamdeen. But this maybe does not translate to real opportunities in the street.
In the last couple weeks, Ahmed Shafiq has finished first or second in some national polls. Since Shafiq worked in the former regime, do you, as someone who was imprisoned by the former regime, think his victory would mean the revolution was stolen or in vain?
 
[long pause]… For 35 years I kept a packed handbag in my house at all times in case I was detained. I have been detained many times since I was 15 years old. Shortly after the revolution, I got rid of the handbag. Before then, there was always a place for it in my house so I could take it at anytime. I expect that if Ahmed Shafiq becomes President, then I must prepare the handbag once again and put it back in its place.
The tone of candidates’ statements on Israel is heating up as the election date nears. What do you expect will happen to the relationship between Egypt and Israel?
 
The relationship is ruled by a lot of considerations. [The relationship] will never get as bad as the people imagine, but it will not continue in Mubarak’s way because his way was a humiliating way. Egypt is new. Egypt is different. There is a new variable in the political equation called public opinion and this needs to be respected. Israel and its friends should take into consideration the new Egypt’s influential public opinion and not provoke or pressure it either. In the end, the decision of the president will be a decision with a big relationship to public opinion. This does not mean that is necessary for the new President to be reckless with this public opinion and I do not think that any President will be ready for a new war in this region. But the relationship between the two countries will freeze and reach a very bad level if Israel does not take into consideration the new influence of Egyptian public opinion, which could pressure the new President.
A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department described these statements as simply campaign rhetoric to rally support. Do you agree?
 
[Silently nods and smiles]
According to Egypt’s state news agency, the Egyptian intelligence apparatus mediated the resolution of the recent Palestinian hunger strike. In general, do you think the role of Egypt internationally, and specifically on Palestinian issues, will grow following the elections?
 
I think the new Egypt will have a wide role and it will not be just a small broker anymore in Israel and America’s political equations. We must understand this very well. The next Egypt will be much stronger than before, more aware of its international role. Turkey, Iran, and Egypt are the regional focal points. Egypt will play this role efficiently with the new elected President.
You described the focal points of the Middle East as Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Arguably, in the last few decades, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt in that triangle. How can Egypt return to its old position while maintaining a stable relationship with Saudi Arabia?
 
Look, since the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia there was a field of competition between [Egypt and Saudi Arabia]. Let me give you an old example. Why is America now changing their traditional coalition from Pakistan to India? We are India. Egypt is India. Egypt has the larger population. [America] went to India because of its large population to place India against China. Egypt represents the same population weight of India so Egypt must be the most important factor in the Middle East equation even if it is a monetarily poor factor. Yet, Saudi Arabia is the traditional ally of America. In my opinion, Egypt is the most important and the most complicated factor in the region’s political equation. The population and geographical weights play a large role. Egypt became politically smaller because the political regime was crippled and weak and constrained by personal problems. [Mubarak] was not prepared to defend Egypt. He was defending his personal presence instead. When Americans were telling him, “Solve the problems of Ayman Nour.” So he was accepting anything they imposed upon him because he wanted to close these files. Today the new Egypt is a stronger Egypt than the previous regime. It will not be better than Mubarak’s regime on the economic level, but it will be better politically because it will have general support and the public opinion, which the government will base its decisions on. I expect Egypt to return to its former political position by virtue of its weight, like India, and also we are seeing that a lot of important factors in the Middle East equation are changing on the other side of the equation. I think the political situations in the Gulf area… I don’t want to say they will change, but they will develop. Actually, they will be changed. Egypt, Turkey, and Iran will be the strongest powers in the next era.
In 2008, you penned a famous letter to then-presidential candidate, Barack Obama. If you were to write a letter to President Obama today, what would be your message?
 
First of all, it was not a letter, but an article titled “Letter to Obama.” At that time there was a debate between [Hillary] Clinton and [Barack] Obama about what would happen if the President received a call at three in the morning about a crisis that threatened American interests in the Middle East and who would be prepared to answer that phone call. If I write Obama a message now, what I would tell him is, “All the phone calls you received at three a.m., four a.m., and five a.m. were never answered.” While Obama and Clinton are in the same administration, and they were originally asking who would take the phone call between them, but in fact the telephones are broken and they never answered any phone calls. From my viewpoint, the threat to the interests of the United States is the threat to the principles of the United States, which happens when freedoms are violated in this region. America made no moves. As a state that respects freedoms and human rights, the threat happened in many regions and is still happening in many regions. And we are still asking why don’t they ask the phone calls that ring at 3 a.m. in an administration with both Obama and Clinton. Obama disappointed us in some issues but Clinton has disappointed us in everything. The State Department always takes a worse position than the White House.
How do you grade Obama’s Administration over the last four years? Are you supporting his reelection?
 
Look, Obama reminds me of a 95-year old story about the American President, Woodrow Wilson, and this man [points to painting behind him], Saad Zaghloul, an Egyptian leader during Egypt’s 1919 revolution. In 1919, the Egyptian people chanted the names of Woodrow Wilson and Saad Zaghloul together. This was because Wilson wrote the “Fourteen Principles” [for the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War]. But, after a period of time, Wilson accepted the continued British occupation of Egypt. The people that previously chanted for Wilson then entered the streets calling for his downfall because he disappointed the people. This is my answer to that question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past four years, we thought that we were saving the world. We negotiated and approved comprehensive resolutions on climate change. We launched ambitious programs to combat small arms trafficking. We monitored the situation in Libya, dispatched peacekeepers to Somalia, and promoted self-determination across the globe. Embracing a deep sense of idealism, we strove to craft solutions to the greatest problems of our time. Armed with bold ideas and persuasive three-point speeches, we simulated the United Nations. My experience at Harvard was defined by my participation in model United Nations. Myself and over 200 other undergraduates organized model U.N. conferences for high school and college students and traveled across the United States and beyond to debate and discover pressing international issues.
Despite remaining a simulation of the real world, model U.N. expanded my perspective on issues beyond our borders and pushed me to be an active citizen in our world. Prior to coming to Harvard, I had never owned a passport, let alone traveled abroad. Four years later, I’ve traveled to China, India, Singapore, Greece, and a host of other countries. I have a couch to sleep on in Taipei, a friend eager to give me a tour of Paris, and a host of dubious business opportunities in Mumbai. Each of these friendships and connections were formed through model U.N. at Harvard. During debates in committee rooms, I defended positions as a country with policies that I might not have agreed with. Yet in the process, I challenged and strengthened my own beliefs as an American and a global citizen. In conversations with delegates at conferences in international cities, I discovered how my limited view of the world obscured my awareness of cultural differences. I eagerly sought to learn more about different cultures and gain a greater respect for the unique customs and beliefs of others. Each of these transformations was made possible through model U.N.
As a leader of Harvard Model United Nations and within the Harvard International Relations Council, I formed lasting friendships with a group of Harvard students similarly eager to discover and embrace an international perspective. Together we organized and attended Model U.N. conferences that brought together students from across the world and expanded not only our own international awareness, but also that of others. At the 59th session of HMUN this past January, we welcomed 3,200 high school students from over 37 countries to Boston for debate and cultural exchange. Committees at HMUN moved beyond the organs of the United Nations and simulated other international bodies of the past or of growing importance in the future. We launched conferences in China, India, and beyond to bring even more students together to explore international issues and grapple with difficult problems of global governance. I take deep pride in being a member of an organization that not only simulated global issues and modeled the challenges of real life, but also inspired greater awareness and excitement in the next generation of global leaders.
While I was active in a student organization that simulated international events and crises, I depart through the gates into a world that is clearly beyond the bounds of any model. The problems we face as an international society and the difficult compromises and challenges required to solve such problems lay beyond the imagination of any Harvard student running a committee on the World Health Organization, the Group of 20, or the Security Council. Yet I leave Harvard with a greater optimism on the ability of the world to come together to propose creative solutions to prominent international issues. I recognize the importance of understanding and exchange in overcoming cultural barriers. I now possess a strong sense of activism and seek to be an engaged American and a global citizen. Thank you to Harvard University and to the entire staff and legacy of model U.N. at Harvard in providing me with this opportunity to explore my beliefs, to reflect on my position in the world, and to answer a call to service in the global community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Class of 2012 first arrived at Harvard on September 6, 2008, a severe rainstorm forced the new freshmen to evacuate Harvard Yard. Our proctors gathered two first-years from every dormitory and brought us to our Ark, the Science Center. The Greenhouse Café was opened for free food. Some students slept on cots in the Malkin Athletic Center. I called a friend from my high school orchestra at 1 a.m., a junior in Quincy House at the time, who graciously hosted me for the night. As a result, I missed the opportunity to play poker with President Faust, who had joined the class for our adventures in the Science Center that evening.
At the time, I didn’t fully appreciate how bizarre the events of move-in day were. But I did have one thought, which was: This event is going to be mentioned in every graduation speech for our class. (As of writing this piece, I await the accuracy of my prediction.)
The metaphor would be perfect. We came to Harvard as naïve freshmen, anticipating four years of intellectual and personal growth. But there would be mistakes, the proverbial storms. Some students would receive A-minuses for the first time. We would all struggle to comp a publication, find blockmates, pick a concentration, and learn what Harvard means, exactly, by comp, blockmates, and concentration. We would eat Harvard University Dining Services. But ultimately, we would learn from these errors; the storm would present obstacles, but nothing that 1,600 enterprising students and a few Alka-Seltzers couldn’t conquer. By senior year, the rain would subside. We would overcome any challenge that came our way. As we recognized the flawless logical coherence of this metaphor, we might even shed a tear, realizing just how much we grew during our undergraduate years.
But the metaphor didn’t quite hold water. In an eerie moment of déjà vu, we were treated to another storm during move-in day our senior year, this time Tropical Storm Irene. From a meteorological perspective, Irene was a bit of a tease, but she still caused flight cancelations and countless headaches. Sure, Irene’s descent upon Cambridge signified that we seniors had come full circle, our years bookended by strange tempests. But it also meant the storm hadn’t exactly passed. Perhaps we were still messing up, even as seniors.
I experienced storms throughout college. One of the first was at the Red Sox game against the Tampa Bay Rays on September 10, 2008, during Freshman Week. Being a local, I had snagged four tickets to the game at Fenway and took three of my new roommates, eager to welcome them to Boston. Though it wasn’t raining at Fenway, the game was its own storm of sorts. When it went to extra innings, I gently insisted that we stay. Little did I know it would drag on for 14 innings. My New Yorker roommate, a Yankees fan, actually started rooting for the Red Sox just so the game would end. It finally did, just after 1 a.m. The Red Sox lost. I had desperately wanted to show my roommates how great Boston was, how great the Red Sox were. But they showed any sign of caring only after we realized the T had already closed.
There have been other storms. For example, I did not get Jeremy Lin’s autograph when he was a senior here. That was dumb. To this day, another mistake has been telling non-Harvard people that I major in social studies. They immediately quiz me on state capitals and the difference between a peninsula and a cape.
If I could redo Harvard, I would study abroad and go to the Schlesinger Library just to browse. I would borrow the dog that is on loan at the Harvard Medical School’s Countway Library. I would take courses on the history of the Arab world or on the science of cooking. As a friend once observed, Harvard’s shopping week heightens the opportunity costs of choosing any one class. But it’s not just courses: Doing one activity over another, sleeping for eight hours a night instead of six or seven, or procrastinating in our common rooms means sacrificing something else, some of Harvard’s other unparalleled resources. Sure, we all messed up this balance somewhere along the way. But from those mistakes we grew as well, learned, and cultivated our friendships.
During the activities fair of my freshman year, a staff person of the Harvard Alumni Association handed me a printed list of things to do before I graduated. I have kept HAA’s list throughout college, using it as an informal guide for my time here. I crossed many things off—rowing intramural crew, seeing the Gutenberg Bible in Widener, and watching the midnight screening of the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Harvard Square cinema. (Horror is an understatement.) But there are many things I regret missing, such as stargazing at the Harvard Observatory, visiting all of Harvard’s museums, and going on a weekend trip with the Outing Club.
These lost opportunities are mini-tempests, why the storm has not passed. We graduate despite the fact that there is so much left to do at Harvard, even though we still make mistakes. But our learning and growing doesn’t have to end now. For as many resources as Harvard has condensed into one campus, there is so much more that the world will offer us. Because we have missed out on great opportunities here, we will better take advantage of what is outside.
That will be difficult. But then again, we’ve braved scarier storms before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2011-12 academic year is a momentous one for its class of seniors. What is momentous for others, for the nation at large? The ongoing recovery from the financial crisis, a topic addressed in greater detail separately by our staff today? The related Eurozone crisis? The beginning of the 2012 general election, with the carnival of the Republican primary and the growing centrality of social issues in the clash between President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney?
Looking back further to the start of the year—the fall semester—one issue looms inevitably large, both for the United States and for today’s generation of young people. This was, of course, the anniversary marking one decade since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
With the events of September 11 now more than a decade behind us, it seems at times as if the wound has scarcely healed. The event itself was a tragedy beyond words, but in retrospect, perhaps it was also a portent of things to come. Indeed, in the decade since September 11, the United States has stumbled from one frustrating war to another and seen its once-robust economy nearly brought to its knees, bringing pain and suffering to millions across the country.
In many ways, the post-9/11 world has also separated the decade-long post-Soviet honeymoon from a far more fraught and challenging time for the United States. The days of unthreatened American hegemony had come to an end. Before the end of this decade, the Chinese economy will very likely become the world’s largest. For all the political rhetoric, there is a very real fear that America’s education system is falling behind; that American workers are no longer the world’s best; that American exceptionalism is merely an illusion; that America will never again regain the place in the world it once occupied.
The Class of 2012 leaves the rather protective sphere of Harvard for this uncertain world. Often, our time at Harvard leaves us in a state of virtual insularity, blinding us to the uncertainty of the outside world. Nevertheless our lives after September 11 have been affected by many consequences, tangible and intangible, that have modified our activities and even changed the way we view our liberties. We are reminded of this occasionally: We have grown familiar with the Department of Homeland Security as we submit to scrutiny at Logan Airport. Likewise, the Patriot Act has permitted an unprecedented level of government surveillance. Yet as citizens, we would do well not to fall into complacence and to guard our civil liberties jealously, as rights rather than privileges.
On another level, pernicious scars of xenophobia and intolerance are also a legacy of September 11. These attitudes are inevitable reactions to a terrorist attack executed by Islamic extremists. However, as the recent popularity of the Tea Party and its inflammatory rhetoric shows, they threaten to take hold in the wider national psyche. This is something we must continue to be wary of.
From a more global perspective, the generation of Harvard seniors that graduates this week represents the first college class to have spent more time in the shadow of September 11 than outside of it. They have come of age in an era marked not by American power, but by its limitations; they have witnessed the horror of Abu Ghraib, the disappointment of Guantanamo, and the endless misery in Afghanistan. They take this knowledge with them into the world, and they must choose what to do with it. Some may cynically choose to view our times as reflective of the shortcomings of human nature. Yet some—and, let us hope, most—will view the shortcomings of these days as a call to action for a better, more humane future.
Thankfully, there are already signs that point to such a future. Osama bin Laden’s death last year, at the hands of Navy SEALs, gave the nation an opportunity to lay a ghost to rest. As the spontaneous celebrations that took place in Harvard Yard, outside the White House, and across the country demonstrated, the wound left in the American psyche by 9/11 had far from healed. It was notable that many of those who turned out were young people, in keeping with the exceptional influence of 9/11 on our generation.
Hopefully, as we argued at the time, bin Laden’s death—now more than a year passed—provides an opportunity for much-needed renewal and a chance to move on from 9/11. From his lonely grave somewhere at sea, he no longer haunts our collective consciousness. His absence has been complimented by a new presence in the New York skyline—that of the new World Trade Center, which just last month became the tallest building in the city. Its presence will not erase the memory of the Twin Towers that came before it, but Daniel Libeskind’s creation has filled a gaping physical hole in the city’s heart and will continue to impress as it is completed. With time, perhaps the gash in the nation’s soul will also come to heal.
As the reconstruction continues, it is clear that America cannot recapture the past. Perhaps its days as the world’s only superpower will soon be over, but the country still has much to give to the rest of the world. Let us remember and honor the achievements of the past and recognize and learn from the mistakes of the present as we look toward the future. Times will certainly be different. But whether they are better—a reemergence, a restoration, even a redemption—depends on us and our ability to emerge from the shadow of 9/11 into a brighter world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each year, the Crimson releases the senior survey to collect and publish a picture of who-does-what after Harvard.
Today, it is estimated that just over 20 percent of graduating seniors will head into consulting or financial service sector jobs at the start of their post-college lives next year. Consulting stands as the most favored career path, drawing over 12 percent of graduates; finance will bring in just under 9 percent. Together, these may seem like big numbers for two relatively narrow career paths.
But consider the statistics from previous years. Ignoring, for a second, the previous year and the two years before it, take 2008: Around 37 percent went into finance or consulting, and 40 percent into “business.” But even that looks insignificant compared to the year before: In 2007, a full 47 percent of graduating seniors went into the two sectors that have become synonymous with a big-bucks Wall Street future. Does this point to a change of culture at Harvard and to the reduced influence of aggressive, for-profit companies’ recruiting tactics on campus?
Perhaps. As we have argued in the past, undergraduates risk going into sectors and jobs because they value safe post-college options that offer transferable skills and transition easily to other sectors. If finance—often used as a byword for working at investment banks—and management consulting have lost some of their luster, this may not all be a bad thing.
Spun a little differently, we could also say that the percentage of seniors entering what have traditionally been the best-paying entry-level positions in the United States’ job market has collapsed by more than half over the past five years. This may be due to a change in culture on campus. But even this change in students’ mentality is inescapably a product of the driving force behind the shifting employment landscape of Harvard graduates. This is the enduring legacy of the financial crisis—on campus, across the U.S., and around the world.
While we are all conscious of the deep, visible psychological effects felt around us and our families by the Great Recession, it is a point less often made that the Class of 2012 has had a rather unique experience with economic crisis. When today’s seniors were settling into their freshman dorms, safely ensconced in the Yard far from upperclassmen concerns like jobs and theses, they were also reading about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. They listened to their parents and to their then-president, who with customary eloquence summed up the situation with the following: “This sucker could go down.” Fall 2008’s freshmen, then, could have been forgiven for being just a little anxious as to what the world might look like when one day in the distant future they too went on the job hunt. All around, predictions were dark. The end of capitalism was forecast. Democracy would soon be under threat in several countries. The way of life to which American 18-year-olds had all more or less become accustomed was under threat. Excessive debt, faulty mortgages, and runaway capitalism were—and still are, if you believe many in the media—ruining the American dream. If you believe Mitt Romney, on the other hand, then it is clear that under Barack Obama, the U.S. has remained in dire straits.
It is true, to a certain extent, that the U.S. has still not recovered from 2008-09. Official unemployment remains far above historic figures for the American economy, at over 8 percent. Other estimates, which count the full percentage of the working-age population out of work—as opposed to just those actively looking—place the true figure at above 11 percent, and as high as 17.5 percent at the height of the crisis. For young Americans, the picture is mixed. While college graduates have a far lower unemployment rate than the work force as a whole, the prospects for young people without an undergraduate degree are far worse and not completely rosy even for those possessing one.
Of course, it would be wrong to paint too dark a picture of Harvard graduates’ employment prospects. 2012’s senior survey reveals that 68 percent of graduating seniors already have jobs, down from pre-recession highs of 73 percent in 2007 but far better than at the height of the financial crisis. This figure is encouraging for today’s graduating seniors.
That students earning a degree from a college as prestigious as Harvard should be well-employed is hardly surprising. There should be little doubt that Harvard graduates are and will remain among the most employable young people in the country. Moreover, the last thing any well-educated young person—Harvard or otherwise—should do today is panic. The broader state of the U.S. economy is not quite as gloomy as the Republican Party would have us believe; gross domestic product growth of roughly 2 percent a year, while not stellar, hardly qualifies as a crisis.
The real problem, and one that does affect Harvard graduates as much as it does every person living in the U.S., is that long-term prospects for the United States’s role in a still-globalizing and fast-shifting world economy are more uncertain.
Now that we are all left with the memory of the worst recession since the Great Depression, it is hard not to worry that another crisis could be just around the corner. Similarly, will young Americans today enjoy the same standard of living and, to put it bluntly, ease that so many of our parents’ generation have? Will the future leaders of our generation of Americans also be the most powerful and influential leaders of the world?
Being poised to become influential in the United States may no longer carry quite the same global caché as it has in the past. The country in which Harvard is a leading institution, and from whose success Harvard has benefited so much, stands in a more uncertain global position—in large part because the financial crisis is considered to have accelerated the convergence in strength and size of developed and developing economies. Tomorrow’s trend-setters look more and more likely to come from China, India, and Africa than the United States.
Is this cause for panic? Clearly not. What it does mean, however, is that young people graduating from top American colleges can afford less than ever to look inward and define success as a good career at home.
A good many of us are already from international backgrounds. Just as students from abroad are eager to come and be educated in the United States, young Americans should have zero qualms or hesitance about moving abroad to pursue their careers and ambitions to the fullest; many of us may yet have to.
Universities like Harvard, in the meantime, by orientating their campuses and pools of talent more and more to the rest of the world, can play a vital role in preparing the United States and the global community for a future of increasingly shared power.
If that can happen, then young people and universities can help create a brighter and more symbiotic future, and something good may actually come out of the pain of the Great Recession. Though the future for the Class of 2012 is more uncertain than it has been for previous years and generations, uncertainty alone should never be cause for pessimism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Libraries and education change slowly. The professor sitting on the fourth floor of Widener does essentially the same thing that his counterpart did in the second century B.C. in the Library of Alexandria. Sections are taught using variations on the method Socrates used, and Harvard, as a 375-year-old institution, functions essentially the same way now that it did when it was the College at Newtowne. Over the past few years, however, things have been evolving behind the scenes. This year, many of those changes entered the public forum. Harvard has felt the pressure from its peer institutions to become more of a global presence and to expand its reach.
While Yale has partnered with the National University of Singapore in what was a controversial move, due in large part to the perceived incompatibility between some of Singapore’s laws and the ethos of Yale, Harvard has focused the bull’s share of its efforts in cyberspace.
Harvard has attempted over the course of the last year, more seriously than before, to use the Internet to make its prodigious resources more widely available. These changes seem likely to benefit at least some members of the wider public unaffiliated with the University, as well as those of us taking classes on campus.
Harvard’s library system began digitizing its collections in partnership with Google in 2005 in an effort to make its volumes with expired copyrights available to the larger public, a partnership that fell through in 2011 after disputes over Google’s right to scan library volumes still under copyright. These efforts will be reinvigorated, as University officials announced in April that it planned to digitize 12 million volumes as part of the Digital Public Library of America, a project chaired by John G. Palfrey ’94 and with University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 as a director, which aims to digitize every book in the world.
One of Harvard’s most important and increasingly costly resources is its massive library system, and the DPLA will hopefully alleviate some of the expenses associated with the system while allowing Harvard to share its collections with the world beyond its gates.
On the classroom instruction front, Harvard began attempts to open its lectures to public observers on the internet and television in 2009, when a taped version of Michael J. Sandel’s popular class Justice aired in a 12-part series both online and on Boston-based television station WBGH. This change to education was embraced by much of the Harvard community as a step toward a 21st century Harvard that would be able to expand its influence beyond its traditional student body.
Harvard, in conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, revealed plans this month to create an online education portal named edX. The administration announced that the portal will allow people around the world to take Harvard courses free of charge. As an improvement over previous forays into online education, edX is intended to enable students to interact with other students and educational components, including problem sets and exams. Although the democratization of high-quality education through initiatives such as edX is commendable, we are wary of the potential to gain a certificate from such an initiative, as online learning cannot replace the traditional classroom environment.
The ability to export coursework effectively through an online medium is an exciting new development for Harvard. Though many of the specifics of the program have not yet been disclosed, an initiative akin to a more developed version of MIT’s open courseware is an excellent opportunity to make world-class educational materials available to individuals who are motivated to enrich themselves academically for personal gain. Additionally, increasing access to courses in specialized, narrow fields to individuals outside the University will propagate further interest in study in areas of focus that are, due to the sheer number of specialists, limited to a select few locations.
Yet along with the enormous potential for learning through edX, there is a natural desire to have some sort of certification of that learning. Harvard has stipulated that, for an as-yet-unnamed price, it will provide a special Harvardx certificate of completion of coursework to people who enroll in edX classes. While the desire to provide some sort of validation is completely understandable—very few people elect to take a course simply out of intellectual curiosity—we fear that because of Harvard’s brandname there is a high potential that this sort of credit will be sought for the wrong reasons. A Harvard degree—or a Harvardx certificate, in this case, as a lesser representation of the same credentials—is only valuable so long as the accomplishments required to get it are sufficiently valuable themselves. As soon as Harvard begins handing out credentials that, although very different from Harvard degrees, seem somehow similar, we run the danger of diminishing the gravity of what we have been doing for a long time in favor of the novelty of something new.
Moreover, there is value to be gained from a traditional classroom environment that cannot transfer into online learning. In a traditional classroom setting, students have in-person interactions with the professor, teaching assistants, and fellow students that cannot be translated onto the Internet. Although students in an online setting can listen to and absorb material from a lecture, they lack the same freedom to interrupt the professor with questions or to attend office hours after class. Further, there is no similar accountability to that which exists in a traditional environment; students who slack off, doze off during lectures or watch YouTube videos with the professor on mute are not monitored in the same way. Ultimately, the in-person interactions that shape a Harvard experience cannot be mass-produced.
As stirring as it is to be able to watch these changes begin and to observe these plans take shape, the potential benefits of these developments are even more exciting. But a note of caution must be struck—with the potential to redefine many of the basic tenets of a modern education, Harvard needs to protect what it has been doing for 375 years from being devalued by its new experiments. While Harvard arguably has a duty to provide its educational resources to as many people as possible, there shouldn’t be “levels” of a Harvard education, and a Harvardx certificate cannot be allowed to cheapen a Harvard University degree. University officials stressed that plans are still largely in the development stage, and we are glad they decided to roll out what they had for public review. Much has to be added, while some should be discarded. As Harvard’s online infrastructure develops, the University has proven itself once more to be a leader in education worldwide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first came to Harvard as a freshman, I expected the next four years to be a personally transformative, intellectual experience. I expected my knowledge to expand, my beliefs to be challenged, and my worldview to be molded. I expected to sit in classes with brilliant professors and brilliant students, engaging in the kinds of intellectual exchanges I had heard about from friends and seen in countless films. In short, I expected what most students anticipate when they drive through Johnston Gate for the first time as freshmen: an education.
In many ways, my experience at Harvard over the past four years has lived up to those expectations. I did take classes with incredible professors and students, and I gained a tremendous amount of new knowledge and information. But when I think about how I will emerge from Harvard, I realize that I’ve gained much more than an education—I’ve been inspired, and that’s what I’ll be most grateful for as I receive my diploma on Commencement day.
The Latin root of education means “to draw out,” while the equivalent root for inspire means “to breathe into.” The difference is illustrative. Education brings out knowledge that students didn’t even know they had. That’s the basis of the Socratic method: students have a wealth of knowledge, and by questioning them about it carefully, they can answer their own inquiries. As Socrates might have told us, then, the goal of education is to “know thyself” as thoroughly as possible, and to embrace all of the learning that comes with self-understanding.
To inspire students is in some ways a more ambitious goal. It requires not only drawing out what they already have, but also raising them to a new level—not only bringing out hidden knowledge, but also breathing in new life. The late Apple chief executive officer Steven P. Jobs—himself an inspiration to many—summed up the meaning of inspiration when he explained his aversion to market research: “It’s not the consumers’ job to know what they want.” Creating an innovative product is not merely only about satisfying customers’ wants, but also forcing them to question those wants, raising their expectations, and crafting original tools that push the boundaries of market needs. Jobs was suggesting that we should not be held back by peoples’ articulable desires but should take risks to help shape those desires. That’s not just a definition of inspiration—it’s also a definition of leadership.
If the motto of education is to “know thyself,” then the motto of inspiration is to “know others”—to know whether customers will come to accept a market innovation, or to know how far a student can be pushed in the process of intellectual discovery and value formation. The abiding lesson of my four years at Harvard is that education and inspiration form two sides of the same coin—that the goal of knowing myself is not to engage in the abstract pursuit of self-knowledge, but to define my own worldview so that I can come to empathize more with my peers. Knowing thyself is essential to knowing others.
I learned this lesson at the Institute of Politics, where I worked with a group whose mission was to “bridge the gap” between politics and public service—to take political values that I had formed in the classroom and work to impart them by engaging in direct service. I learned this lesson at the Philips Brooks House Association, where my undergraduate research on special education allowed me to pinpoint how I could best help students in a special-needs classroom. I learned this lesson in my house on campus, where I met with a tutor who helped link my academic interest in law with internship opportunities that would expose me to the work of legal practice. And I learned this lesson while writing a thesis during my senior year, when my advisor encouraged me to develop a topic that not only contributed to the academic field in which I was writing—but also to the lives of the individuals on whom my topic touched.
At Harvard, I learned to value learning for the sake of learning, but I learned as well to value it for something more—for its ability to shape others’ lives. Harvard challenged me to question my beliefs and assumptions, and in doing so, it forced me to think more concretely about how I wanted to put those beliefs into practice. My experiences during the past four years drew knowledge out of me, but they instilled too in me something new—a stronger commitment to self-improvement and public service than I had started with. At Harvard, I found not only an education, but also a source of inspiration—and for that, I will always be grateful.

As the late spring brings the full swing of Commencement celebrations to Harvard every year, it also brings the annual opium poppy harvest in Afghanistan. In mountainous fields across the country, thousands of men score and scrape the poppy bulbs to extract the dark sticky resin that will be processed into heroin. Most of the heroin is trafficked across Afghan borders and sold, to be injected into the veins of addicts in the region and farther afield to Europe and the United States.
However as the United States and her NATO allies ready themselves for the 2014 drawdown of forces and transition of security responsibilities to the Afghans, the Afghan narcotics industry cannot be forgotten. It not only causes untold misery for addicts and their families, but also emboldens the insurgency, fuels corruption, and undermines governance and development. Today it remains one of the key threats to peace and stability in Afghanistan.
Elements of the Western media portray the Afghan drug problem as bearded, barefoot men with a few fields of opium poppies. However, in reality opium is a fully-fledged industry with, a complex production chain, sophisticated markets for raw and finished product, a futures market, large scale employment, cross border transactions, and a network of key players from the Government to the narcotics-lords to the criminal gangs and the Taliban. Although the equipment and methods used may be primitive, this is no small village farming operation.
In 2011, Afghanistan produced a staggering 5,800 metric tons of opium grown on 131,000 hectares of land across half of the Provinces in the country. The United Nations recently released preliminary figures on the size of this year’s crop, and the news was not good. The size of the 2012 crop will undoubtedly increase. For the Afghan opium farmer everything points to a bumper season; a plant disease that stunted the crop in 2010 has disappeared and prices are again high.
The farmers, however, will only receive a fraction of what their crop will eventually be sold for. Last year the value of the crop to farmers was in excess of $1.4 billion; by the time it reaches the border the value is in the order of $5 billion. Leaving Afghanistan the risks for traffickers increase exponentially, but so do the profits. It is estimated that importers into the countries of use will pay in excess of $25 billion for the goods, which will in turn be sold to addicts for an estimated $60 billion plus.
In a very poor Afghanistan, it is opium money that assists the Taliban in their operations. The insurgents maintain a symbiotic relationship with the narco-lords. The narco-lords require protection and labor for their operation and the Taliban need money for theirs in order to pay fighters and buy weapons and ammunition. Fees paid for protecting heroin labs and convoys, as well as providing large-scale employment for off duty fighters to help with the harvest, are estimated to be between $100 and $500 million according to the Afghan Government.
The power and money flowing from the narcotics industry is also the lifeblood of corruption, undermining good governance that allows officials to profit from the facilitation of deals, free passage through border checkpoints, and appointment of a key official in strategically important posts.
The issue is complex and the solutions are even more complex. Since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001, it has been demonstrated time and time again that there are no silver bullets able to deliver a short-term solution. The bottom line is that where there is insecurity in Afghanistan there is usually opium cultivation. Moreover, development assistance has helped to break the opium cycle with farmers. Therefore, a comprehensive suite of programs needs to be implemented: alternative livelihoods for farmers, targeted crop eradication, interdiction, institution building, and public awareness. Most of these initiatives are underway, but progress is slow, if at all, and very costly in terms of funding and, at times, lives.
And how long will these changes take? If experience in former opium producing countries such as Thailand, India, and Turkey shows, it can take 20 or more years to drive and implement sustainable progress, progress which was achieved without an insurgency raging and with better established governance.
With fewer international troops on the ground and, potentially, expensive counter narcotics programs being dialed back, the threat of the Afghan drugs industry exploding beyond record levels and unraveling any gains made over the last decade is real. As 2014 approaches it is an issue that the West cannot afford to allow to fall off the radar. Progress is guaranteed to be slow and costly, but necessary in order to prevent Afghanistan from slipping into a state fully owned, run, and funded by narcotics.

Hundreds of dicks flew by me in a whirlwind, flapping in the wind as their owners huffed and puffed around the yard. I watched awkwardly as my classmates bore all, screaming and cheering and inundating the grassy quad with flailing penises and bouncing breasts. Despite the fact that nay a semester ago I had been among the naked masses, insecurities and shyness took over that time and I spent Primal Scream Spring 2009 as a spectator, watching from the sidelines by Weld Hall.
Spring 2012 I ran my seventh out of eight possible Primal Screams. My anxious brain will not let me forgive or forget my egregious freshman spring mistake. I had missed out on my chance for perfect eight out of eight completion.
I go through life with the mentality of a tourist guidebook: In order to live to one's fullest, one must check everything off “the list.” Failure to see a sight while on vacation, attend the party that everyone's talking about, or have an experience that others have enjoyed causes a full-blown anxiety attack. Harvard has several bucket-list items that one must tend to before graduation. Go see the Hasty Pudding Show. Go attend every single lecture with every single famous person. Take Literature and Sexuality with Matthew Kaiser. Pee on John Harvard.
I've failed at many of them. I've never gone on a duck tour, or gone figure skating at Frog pond. I didn't take Computer Science 50 and I've never actually gone to see Yo Yo Ma play. Will I be able to graduate in peace knowing that I never had sex in the Widener stacks?
Graduation has got me thinking about “real world” checklist items as well. The latest obsessive thought to completely consume my brain is that my Peter Pan instinct will take over. I will “miss out” on the things you're supposed to do as a “real person” if I don't take affirmative steps to “grow up.” I will never have a real house, real job, real husband, or kids of my own. The “checklist items” of the real world. I'll die alone with cats. And my family won't be able to visit me to make me feel better, because they're allergic to cats.
There seems to be no clear trajectory of when these life milestones should and will occur. Why are some of my friends making enough to live in posh Manhattan apartments while others are living in parents' basements? What is the age for the requisite “all my friends are married” panic, and when should I give up all hope and get my eggs frozen? I am going to grad school straight out of college, but some people criticize this decision, telling me that I should go “find myself” first. Can't I find myself at grad school? Or is there some “real me” only accessible after a mandatory 12-months romp through Europe, waiting in the depths of some Parisian hostel?
They call it a quarterlife crisis. But is 22 even the appropriate age for that sort of thing?
I consulted the guidebooks. Tears streamed down my face while I searched Amazon and ordered every “quarterlife crisis” book I could find, including accidental multiple copies of the same book. The books were filled with anecdotes. Rebecca, age 22 from Connecticut lives in a house with her husband and two kids. Michael, age 29 from New Jersey, lives in a falling-down apartment with his college buddies. Jessica, age 25 from Pennsylvania has her own business that she started and lives on a comfortable salary. Jordan, age 29 from North Carolina, is still in school and living at home. There was no “job at 25, married at 28, kids at 30, house at 31” trajectory that I had hoped for. Sure, there was a “list,” but there was no clear period of time in which I could or should be able to “check” things. The guidebooks failed me.
Every logical bone in my body knew I shouldn't worry about checking things off the “life list” yet. I'm not over the hill yet or even close to approaching it. But I'm Jewish. So I worry.
“I'm only going to be able to do it seven out of eight,” I told some friends one December night in Pforzheimer House. “But you love Primal Scream!” my friend responded, incredulous that I was once an insecure freshman plagued with doubts and insecurities that caused me to spectate, rather than participate, in Spring Primal Scream 2009.“Biggest regret of college,” I told them. “Now it's too late to ever say I did them all.”
The next thing I knew, we were standing outside on the quad lawn, stark naked, running laps. “That was epic!” we yelled, laughing and screaming as we collected our stuff before Securitas/random tutors could come awkwardly confront and quiet us for the benefit of those who still had finals. Yet there was no band, no audience, no midnight countdown, and no impending exams. Could this count as my eighth primal scream, “checking it off the list?” Had I truly eliminated the obsessive compulsive disorder nightmare of being seven out of eight, just one step away from perfect completion? If a naked run happens in the Quad and no perverts are around to photograph it, does it make a [primal] sound?
For once, it didn't seem to matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost 50 years ago, Robert F. Kennedy created a ripple of hope at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, not far from where I was christened, when he announced to a diverse crowd:
"I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; … a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage.” 
He was referring, of course, to the United States of America.
Kennedy reminded those assembled that Southern Africa had the same ancestral and natural ingredients as Northern America. His words helped me understand my own Euro-African roots as I ventured from the Commonwealth of Africa to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The Founding Fathers’ great American Dream drew me, like generations before, to these promising shores. During the intervening years I encountered the dream’s challenges as well as its opportunities. For all its promises America faces mounting perils posed by unequal incomes and unbalanced budgets. I discovered that The American Dream is to give the next generation a better starting point in life than we were given. The question is then, how to bestow that gift?
Well, South Africa faced this dilemma in 1994 when we had to rebuild a fractured society into a whole Rainbow Nation. South Africa is not perfect by any measure, yet as our unlikely liberation story attests, we pulled together to forge peace and to grow prosperity. With this in mind, I want to share with you a little insider’s story about South Africa’s peaceful revolution.
Two of South Africa’s Founding Fathers, President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who both received honorary doctorates from Harvard, and with good reason), championed the idea of Ubuntu.
This is an age-old African humanist philosophy that was nearly forgotten after centuries of disruptive colonial and post-colonial turmoil. Mandela and Tutu injected its spirit into the public realm just as South Africans grappled for a new national identity. Our tribes, Zulu or Xhoza, British or Afrikaner, embraced the idea of Ubuntu and immediately rallied to resurrect its spirit.
Ubuntu is very hard to define, perhaps because it predates English. It simply means: I am, because we all are.
In other words, you can only become greater in anything you do alongside others, not independently of others. This is an ethos that rings true in today’s hyper-connected world where we all share in the bounty of the expanding Internet, the risk of climate change, and the impact of transformative globally linked democracy movements.
Archbishop Tutu explained Ubuntu as an act of human “inter-connectedness” that makes us open and available to others. It is the knowledge that when we are diminished I am diminished, when we are excluded I am excluded, and when we flourish I flourish. When you pull an all-nighter writing a paper, I’d give you a wake-up call.
President Nelson Mandela, with his characteristic wisdom once explained Ubuntu to youths: “A traveller through a country would stop at a village and he didn't have to ask for food or for water. Once he stops, the people give him food, entertain him. Ubuntu does not mean that people should not enrich themselves. The question therefore is: Are you going to do so in order to enable the community around you to be able to improve?”
Looking back on his words and my experience as a stranger in this “village,” I realize that Harvard has Ubuntu. The Harvard Village has a Chief, elders in robes, proud tribes with coats of arms, and special rights for cows in our very sacred 375 year-old Yard. Today our village has its festival rites; we call it Commencement, when the youth of the tribe are initiated, and pass through these gates fully vested.
I showed up in our Village almost 10 years ago with two backpacks and my loving family an ocean away. The Harvard Village sustained my body and cultivated my mind, and through others I could take the first step toward the American Dream. I am not alone in experiencing Harvard’s Ubuntu. Every year thousands of students, scholars at risk, researchers, and world leaders come to this Village on the Charles to grow and to learn together. They do so to better themselves so that they may one day enable their communities beyond these gates.
When we generate profit, may the community share in that profit, when we champion justice, may that justice serve all equally, when we heal, may that lead to global health, when we design cities, may our efforts serve our planet as well as our people, and when we engineer and experiment, may our breakthroughs bring us all closer together.
I came here to pursue the American Dream, and found it just the same as the dream of my home. We leave today to work for The Dream of Ubuntu!

Oh dear.
You're graduating.
This is terrible news. Now you'll never be Steve Jobs. You won't even be Mark Zuckerberg. I know they want to hand you a diploma, but don't let them! You still have time. Flee. Flee for the hills! Send irate letters to your Teaching Fellows insisting that, in fact, you did not complete the course requirements.
This is the only thing. Otherwise, you're stuck.
Everyone always says that the requirement for success is failure. But look at you, succeeding! Being handed a diploma and clasped warmly by your extended family and called promising! That's the worst thing you can possibly do for yourself right now.
You have spent your life up until the present getting positive feedback on everything. At age seven, you drew a mediocre cricket, and someone put a gold star on it. (I'm sorry, "an excellent cricket." You're right. Please don't cry. It was a great cricket. You're the best.) I tell you this because the instant they hand you that diploma, all this will stop, and you'll be on your own. In the real world, there is no feedback. Nobody rewards you for good performance. You do not get gold stars for cleaning your toilet. In actual life, there is a depressing lack of stickers. Feedback comes in different forms. Are people yelling at you? This is a sign that you are doing something right, except for the times when it is a sign that you are a member of the Westboro Baptist Church.
Of course, I should talk. I write for a newspaper, which is just below Cocaine-Testing Lab Rat on the ladder of Jobs That Give You a Lot of Feedback on Your Performance. Every few days, I get a phone call from an elderly man who is unsubscribing from the paper because of me, or who wants to let me know that "most people who have AIDS have it because they want to have it."
But don't listen to me.
For some reason it has become traditional to pepper graduates with advice.
"I always pass on advice," Oscar Wilde said, "that is the only thing to do with it. It is never any use to oneself."
There is something about a mortarboard that gives otherwise sane and normal people the overwhelming urge to burden you with advice. Some of them cannot help themselves. They were asked to do it by a committee. But one can only take so many pieces of wisdom before they all start to blur together.
So here are some unhelpful bits of advice.
Follow your dreams.
Don't do that. Most of my dreams are harrowing chases through urban landscapes in which I am pursued by my high school history teacher, who is dressed as a bear.
Shoot for the moon! Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.
Fine, if you have a lot of money to waste on your space program and aren't concerned about astronaut life.
Take the road less traveled.
Sometimes a road is less traveled because it leads through a dangerous area of town where people try to open your car windows with hooks.
Nothing is as important as passion.
I would say "competence" actually might be slightly more important than passion. I understand that it is important to feel strongly about things, but give me a competent dentist over a passionate dentist any day, if only because something about the phrase "passionate dentist" is deeply unnerving.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
I feel as though this is how people wind up in committed long-term relationships with Marilyn Manson.
Don't be afraid of rejection.
This is good advice, unless you're a transplanted kidney.
Stop to smell the roses.
Honestly, most roses smell the same. You smell one rose, you're basically set. But "stop to smell at least one rose in the course of your life" doesn't have quite the same ring to it.
Follow your passion, wherever it takes you, no matter the obstacles!
In some states, following your passion is considered stalking, especially if you are following your passion for a number of blocks in a car with the headlights off and the obstacles include "a restraining order."
Do what you love and it won't feel like work.
This is true. In most cases, it won't feel like work because it is not, in fact, work. For instance, if what you love is sitting on your couch all day eating found cereals and watching back episodes of America's Most Wanted, the correct term for this is "being unemployed."
Take risks.
If there is one thing we know about human beings, it is that we tend to underestimate certain kinds of risk and overestimate others. Swimming around in shark-infested waters is comparatively safe. If you really want to take risks, drive a car around your neighborhood to complete routine errands!
Life is short.
These days, thanks to advances in medicine, life is only somewhat short! A better way of putting this might be "Life is never quite as long as you want it to be." But that is true no matter what you do. So make the most of it!
But who am I kidding? You are not going to be in the real world. You've seen this economy. You're going to grad school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A. Clayton Spencer, Harvard’s vice president for policy, has served as the right-hand woman for four Harvard presidents.
She arrived at the University in 1997 during the final days of University President Neil L. Rudenstine’s tenure. She weathered the controversy sparked by President Lawrence H. Summers’ infamous comments about women. After Summers’ sudden resignation, Spencer stuck by President Derek C. Bok when he came out of a nearly two-decade retirement to lead the University during the search for Harvard’s new president. Under President Drew G. Faust, Spencer witnessed the University at its economic nadir after the endowment dropped nearly 30 percent during the 2008 financial crisis.
Through it all, she has been a key figure in Massachusetts Hall. When asked about what Spencer’s responsibilities entailed, Faust responded, “That’s like asking me what my day-to-day duties are.”
But now Spencer will be striking out on her own. She is set to leave Harvard next month to become the eighth president of Bates College on July 1.
According to her colleagues, she will be sorely missed at Harvard, where her contributions have included the implementation of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, the creation of the Crimson Summer Academy, and the integration of Radcliffe and Harvard Colleges.
“Anything good that’s happened in the time she’s been here, there is very little question [whether] she had a hand it in,” says William R.  Fitzsimmons ’67. “If anything that happened that wasn’t good when she was here, you can also be almost guaranteed that she opposed it.”
While Spencer has played a crucial role behind-the-scenes at Harvard, she will now step out into the public spotlight at Bates.
“It was terrific working under four different presidents,” Spencer says of her time at Harvard. “I had the most amazing tutorial in university leadership that anyone could ever have.”
‘THE FAMILY BUSINESS’
Spencer describes higher education as “the family business.”
The daughter of a university president, Spencer grew up in a household where the logistics of running an institute of higher education was a usual topic of conversation at the dinner table.
Spencer says this proximity to university administrators has informed her role in Massachusetts Hall.
“I’ve seen that leadership in higher education is really the intersection of a kind of love for the enterprise, intelligence, data, good decision making, values, sound judgment,” she says. “That’s kind of what I grew up with.”
Born December 1954 in Concord, N.C., Spencer has spent much of her life earning degrees from various educational institutions. She studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, majored in history and German at Williams College, read theology at Oxford, and then returned to the United States to study religion at Harvard.
Spencer says she originally intended to become a traditional academic. “I fell in love with the study of religion, but then I decided I didn’t love it enough to make that my life,” Spencer says. “Then I went to law school.”
She says that even as she worked towards earning her J.D. at Yale Law School, she knew she wanted to enter the field of higher education. In her law school applications, she described her love for academia as her reason for wanting to study law.
“I always knew I wanted to work in the field,” Spencer says. “I was completely agnostic about what particular roles I might end up playing.”
After a brief stint working in a traditional law firm, Spencer moved to Washington D.C., where she found a job that combined her love for the law and devotion to academia. While she worked in the office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, Spencer served as chief education counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and helped to push through a slew of education policies.
In 1997, Spencer left Washington D.C. for Cambridge, where her then-husband was on the faculty of Harvard Kennedy School, and took a job as a consultant and advisor in Rudenstine’s administration.
THE PRESIDENT’S RIGHT HAND
Spencer has quickly ascended the ranks of Mass Hall to become what senior administrators have described as one of the most influential voices in the central administration.
When Spencer first arrived at the University she was tasked with helping to orchestrate the official merger of Harvard and Radcliffe. Though the University had become co-educational decades before, the schools were still technically two separate entities. After the integration was complete, Spencer assisted in transforming Radcliffe College grounds into the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study that exists today.
She also became a member of the search committees for many high-level deans. Rudenstine, who served as president at the time, describes her as one of his two “chief advisors.”
“I knew she would be very, very good,” says Rudenstine. “I don’t think I could have guessed the whole evolution—not because she didn’t have the talent, but because I didn’t know what role she wanted to play.”
In the years that followed, Spencer received a number of promotions and roles of increasing importance. In 2005, Spencer found herself in the role of Vice President for Policy, the position she holds now. In this role she worked on a number of important initiatives that have defined her legacy at Harvard and reputation in the world of higher education.
The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which greatly expanded and simplified Harvard’s financial aid offerings, is perhaps the most well-known of her efforts. Lawrence H. Summers had announced that Harvard would redo its financial aid policies in 2004 and Spencer’s expertise in analytics allowed administrators to crunch the numbers.
Faust says that figuring out how to use data most effectively is an important part of her role, and was a skill that was particularly crucial to HFAI.
“I think I can say clearly that I don’t think that our financial aid initiatives would have occurred in anywhere near the shape or form that they have without her and she was in on the ground floor from the very beginning,” Fitzsimmons says.
With HFAI, as with the many other projects she led, Spencer also played an influential role in winning over skeptics in the faculty and administration.
“Harvard is a very budget conscious place and there were many who didn’t want to spend money on a new initiative and Clayton helped to persuade them that they were wrong—helped persuade them that this was an important investment in Harvard’s future,” says Summers.
Fitzsimmons and others say that this ability to build bridges and get along with a wide range of people is one of Spencer’s most notable strengths.
“There was a relatively small staff so we worked very, very closely together,” Rudenstine says. “She is a person, at least in my view, who is very open, very outgoing, very communicative and a person with whom it is very easy to form a candid relationship.”
Though Spencer insists she is not shy, she acknowledges that she has kept a low profile to allow her colleagues to take the spotlight. Despite several requests, the interview for this article marks only the second time she has granted an interview to The Crimson.
“She is probably the least selfish person I have seen in the academic world or any other world in terms of getting credit for her ideas or her hard work,” Fitzsimmons says. “In fact, she’s always been very publicity shy.”
Even as Spencer prepares to leave Mass Hall, she remains reluctant to take credit for her accomplishments. For example, while Faust and Summers credit Spencer for playing a major role in the creation of the Crimson Summer Academy, Spencer says that she is proud of the project  but insists that “none of the credit belongs to me.”
Despite her modesty, Spencer says that she looks forward to having a position in the spotlight when she takes over at Bates.
“I will get a huge kick out of speaking to the press once I’m the leader in my own right,” she says.
A NEW CHALLENGE
For Spencer, the transition from Harvard’s vice president for policy to Bates’ president will be dramatic. In a month’s time, Spencer will be thrust from the back rooms of academia and into the limelight as the leader of one of America’s most prominent liberal arts colleges.
As the president of Bates, she will be responsible for overseeing a faculty of more than 200. While leading an academic institution will be a new task for Spencer, those who have worked closely with Spencer say she is up to the task.
“The key things in many colleges is that the person be able to work well with the different groups that need attention and also [have an] academic vision, which I think she can provide,” Rudenstine says. “You can’t be at Harvard for the better part of a decade without being saturated with its intellectual activity.”
And her comfort with the world of academia is evident: she opines at length about learning and the future of knowledge.
“The biggest challenges are the explosion of knowledge and the changing shape of knowledge,” she says. “What I would I like to see Bates do, and I’ve got a sense that it would be very fun to do, is [embrace] those forces.”
Spencer also said she plans to use her position as president of Bates to continue her efforts to expand accessibility to higher education. But, at Bates, an institution with only 1,800 students and a $183 million endowment, the task is far different than at Harvard.
“There’s a very strong progressive tradition at Bates that is kind of a model of inclusivity and the notion that everybody deserves an education. It completely resonates with my basic values about access and affordability,” she says. “It will be an absolute priority to bring financial aid dollars at Bates.... We’ll be fundraising against it the whole time and in that sense we’re never going to take the pressure off that issue.”
Even as Spencer departs for Bates, her friends and colleagues at Harvard say they will continue to seek her wisdom.
“You cannot replace a person like her, but I intend to draw on her,” says Fitzsimmons, noting that Lewiston, Maine, where Bates is located, is only a short distance away. “She’s a person who becomes a lifelong friend and will never go away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The afternoon I got into Harvard was the day of my grandmother’s funeral. I had never been to a funeral and my then-boyfriend warned me that time worked differently then, when you were at the service and the before waiting and the afterward not waiting and wishing you were still waiting. I said yes, of course, I understand. But I didn’t. There was lots of crying in the synagogue; there was the part at the cemetery where we all gathered round to shovel dirt onto a coffin in an amorphous part of Long Island. These were expected occurrences, but contained within them was an unexpectedness, a kind of loss I couldn’t describe, because I was about to find out where I was going to college, on the way to understanding a little bit more about who I was going to be, and I wanted my grandmother to know that. I wanted she and I to have each other when I was older, when I was just about to become a person.
At 5 p.m., after the funeral, we were at my grandmother’s house, all of us who had just come back from the cemetery, eating cold cuts from Ben’s Delicatessen, and I went upstairs to a small room that had an old turquoise Mac. My e-mail address, fiafia1989@aol.com, told me that I had gotten into Harvard. I did all the normal things I do when I’m excited, mostly jumped. People downstairs heard me yell. My aunt came up after ten or fifteen minutes. She gently suggested that when more people came for dinner I should try harder not to look so happy.
Everyone should have, I think, at least one saddest-happiest day, because maybe the first part of growing up is accounting for the coexistence of opposite truths.
My grandmother didn’t finish college. She got married at 18 to my grandfather, a man eleven years her senior. Within the year she was pregnant. Her daughter and sons went to college, became professionals. But she didn’t go to college. She read voraciously, watched jeopardy religiously, and always won at scrabble. In the year before she died, I sent her books to read, books that I was also reading. Then we would discuss them on the telephone.
“Heellooo,” she would say with an old-style New York Jewish twang, “I want to talk about ‘The Yacobian Building.’”
Then we would. My grandmother was the kind of woman who got what she asked for, but even then I knew there were things for which she couldn’t ask.
A week before my grandmother died I washed her hair in my bathroom. In the way of old people, her skin was like rice paper. I was terrified I would break her, or cut her, but her body was so empty, almost, that I wasn’t certain that if I did accidentally sink a too-long fingernail into her person anything would come out. I warmed the water and had her sit on a bench while I ran my fingers through what was left of her hair. Then I held a hairdryer, set to low, up and fluffed her white tufts.
“I feel so clean,” she said to me.
I have another grandmother also, one who is coming to graduation. She grew up in Cairo, but spent most of her adult life in Rome, where my grandfather worked for a branch of the United Nations. Now this grandmother lives upstairs from my parents in New York City. She also married young—though she has a college degree, she did not complete her graduate education. She also reads voraciously, always wins at scrabble. I call her Nonna, Italian for grandmother, and she is a constant romantic advisor. She has met all the important boyfriends, providing running commentary on all of them during those first meetings.
A few weeks ago I was on the phone with my mother, discussing plans for my grandmother’s trip to Cambridge for commencement.
“Nonna wants you to know you don’t have to get married right away,” my mother said.  “She wants you to know you don’t have to get married ever, if you don’t want to. She says you should live your life.”
This may be a comment on various complaints I have levied recently about not having a boyfriend, about the several pity parties I have thrown myself.
“Well, I don’t know,” I replied. “I mean hopefully I will get married someday.”
But I was missing the point, of course. The point was that she is proud of me for the person I am about to be becoming.
I failed at writing a parting shot about Harvard, I suppose, but that’s because I wanted to say this one’s for you, for you Grandma and Nonna, but I can already anticipate what they would respond. They would say: No, actually, this one’s for you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I graduated from Harvard a dozen years ago, I thought I had a plan for the years ahead–to work in Washington for a year or so, and then return to Massachusetts for law school.
On September 11, 2001, however, my life, like so many others, was inexorably altered. After watching the images of the falling towers, I drove to the nearest recruiting station and joined the United States Army. Neither retaliation nor anger propelled me to sign up. Though the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq had not yet begun, I sensed that people in our country would soon be called upon to do something in response. I asked myself: “If I don’t go, then who will?” I had been the happy beneficiary of almost every advantage a free and prosperous society offered. It seemed only fair, right, and just that I spend time giving something back to the great country that had given me so much.
I did not grow up in a family with a strong tradition of military service.  During my years at Harvard, the Reserve Officer Training Corps was not allowed on campus. Those who wanted to join had to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Guest lectures by military leaders were rare. Reading the names of the fallen on the walls of Memorial Hall provided my only exposure to the military.
When I entered Harvard Law School this fall after eight years in the Army, six in active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, I was immensely pleased to see how much had changed. At once I was welcomed into organizations that support and celebrate our veterans on campus. I was thrilled to see ROTC cadets walking to class in uniform, delighted to hear military leaders like Generals David Petraeus and Martin Dempsey speak to groups on campus. And most importantly, I have felt, from all levels of the Harvard community, a wellspring of respect for those who serve in our armed forces.
We have quite clearly learned a collective lesson from the days during and immediately after the Vietnam War. We have learned to separate the war from the warrior. There remains, as always, a healthy debate throughout our campus about the purpose of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the prudence of applying military force in far-flung contests around the world. Yet the value of dedicating one’s life to service to our country seems unquestioned.
As I stood in your shoes at my commencement a dozen years ago, I never imagined the path I ended up taking. During my time in the service, I saw more, did more, and learned more than I would ever have thought possible.  I forged friendships in the fires of hardship and trial. I was my honor to serve with such a dedicated group of men and women.
That same call to serve has animated my decision to now run for state Senate in the Third Middlesex District of Massachusetts. Having spent time in parts of the world where government doesn’t work, where on the contrary, it is often detrimental to the people it represents, I am so glad to be back in a commonwealth and a country where history suggests – from the civil rights acts to the GI Bill - that government can play a positive role in people’s lives.
I urge you as you finalize your plans for life after graduation to consider serving our country in some manner – through City Year, Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or the U.S. Armed Forces.  I know from my own experience that little matches the fulfillment that comes from serving others and from making a difference in people’s lives.
Joseph Kearns Goodwin ’01, a member of the Harvard Law School class of 2012, is a candidate for state senate in the third Middlesex district of Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year that saw Harvard strengthen its ties to the military culminated in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps commissioning ceremony for four soon-to-be Harvard graduates in Tercentenary Theatre on Wednesday.
Victoria L. Migdal ’12 and extension school student Nicole A. Unis were commissioned into the Army, Evan C. Roth ’12 was commissioned into the Navy, and Isaiah T. Peterson ’12 was commissioned into the Air Force.
“It’s something I’ve looked forward to since freshman year,” Migdal said as family members and friends gathered around her after the ceremony. “It feels really good to finally be at this point.”
After completing their oath of office and receiving their first salute from a senior officer, the new officers handed a traditional silver dollar to the senior officer.
Harvard recognized Naval ROTC in March 2011, and then recognized the Army’s ROTC this past March in an ongoing process to reinstate the ROTC on campus after a 40-year ban.
Students who complete the ROTC program are commissioned as officers in the armed forces. During the ceremony, University President Drew G. Faust, whose family has a long history of military service, reiterated the University’s renewed commitment to the armed forces.
“We must ensure that Harvard students understand military service as a choice to consider and honor even if, and perhaps especially if, they pursue other paths,” Faust said. “And we hope that students from Harvard will dedicate themselves to military service in increasing numbers using their remarkable talents to play a significant part in the responsibility and the privilege of defending our nation.”
Secretary of the Navy Ray E. Mabus, who delivered the keynote address, lauded the graduates for their dedication and diverse skill set. “We have the full range of our military ability, sitting on stage right here,” Mabus said.
At last year’s ceremony, three Harvard College seniors were commissioned into the armed forces.
Migdal said she was pleased to be commissioned in the first ceremony after the Army formally returned to campus. “I’ve worked with my cadre with since freshman year to get it recognized, so it’s definitely nice to see it back on campus,” Migdal said.
Peterson, who said he would like to see the Air Force formally recognized on campus, echoed Migdal’s sentiment.
“I’m really glad to be part of this class because President Faust has reached out to us so much and we’ve made so much process with ROTC the last four years,” Peterson said. “I really like how the relationship between Harvard and the military is improving.”

Christine M. O. Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, spoke about seizing leadership opportunities in a changing geopolitical world order in her speech to graduating students at Harvard Kennedy School’s Class Day on Wednesday.
A  former lawyer, an Olympic synchronized swimmer, and an international figurehead for her influential role in the realm of global finance, Lagarde was introduced by Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 as a “rock star” before she took the stage. He added that, as the first female finance minister of France and the first female managing director of the IMF, she is “someone who understands intimately the complexity of challenges facing our world today.”
Her speech was a combination of hopeful well-wishes and bracing realism.
“You are now ready to bring your incredible talent and enthusiasm to bear on the world,” Lagarde said. However, she tempered her praise, challenging the class, “Will you have the courage to desire and even demand a better world to leave to your children?”
She echoed the words of John F. Kennedy '40, the namesake of the school from which the students are graduating, by declaring this time to be “a special moment in history for a next Great Generation to emerge.”
She urged the graduating class to use their social networking skills to move forward together on longstanding problems. When she mentioned equal opportunity for women, she received enthusiastic applause and cheers.
“It won’t be easy,” she warned, “but it will be impossible if we don’t stand and act together as global citizens of this world.”
Despite the fact that members of the audience would be pursuing different career paths after Commencement, Lagarde said that she was optimistic that all of them would make efforts to better the world around them.
Whether they would be working in the public or private sector, Lagarde said, “All in [their] own way would be advancing the public interest.”
Saurabh Saluja, a student at the Kennedy School and the Medical School, said that he appreciated that Lagarde’s speech applied to graduates going into a wide range of fields.
“You can expect that interconnectedness and global confrontation even inside a New York hospital” like the one that he will be working in this fall, he said.
“It was a great speech, reflective of both her life journey and our journey ahead,” said Asim Jahangir, a graduating Kennedy School student. “We were presented with the challenges that we’ll face and [made] excited about them, something that really resonates with Kennedy students.”

After discussion earlier this spring, the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations has decided to offer a new concentration track beginning in fall 2012 focused on the history, politics, and cultures of the contemporary Middle East.
The introduction of the concentration follows the creation of a secondary field on the same topic in May 2011 and is accompanied by a new joint concentration between the history and NELC departments.
“We’re expanding in the world of Islamic studies,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, a Jewish studies professor. “What part of the world is more interesting, more volatile than the modern Middle East?”
The modern Middle Eastern studies concentration, which allows study of the region since the 1800s, will serve as the fourth track within NELC, adding to existing offerings of Middle East in antiquity, Jewish studies, and Islamic studies.
A new course, Modern Middle East 100, has been created as a gateway course for all students considering the concentration.
The curriculum for the new area will pool new and existing courses.
“Basically what we are doing is that we are restructuring the undergraduate program,” said NELC department chair Ali S. Asani ’77. “It’s a big change in the direction of the department.”
Though concentrators will be required to take a sophomore tutorial and complete two years of study in a Middle Eastern language, the track boasts “a great deal of flexibility,” Asani said.
“People don’t have to restrict themselves to what NELC offers,” he said, adding that concentrators can select classes in related departments in order to shape their curricula. “NELC will be the home base.”
In addition, NELC has also partnered with the history department to host a pre-approved joint concentration that combines the study of the Near Eastern languages and literatures with the study of Near Eastern and Middle Eastern history.
According to history professor Ann M. Blair, the joint concentration is modeled on a similar partnership between history and East Asian languages and civilizations, which has been “considered a good success by the students and faculty.”
Some students interested in the Middle East praised the creation of the new concentration option.
“In essence, that was what my concentration would have been,” Renee C. Motley ’14 said, adding that she applied to Harvard with the intention of studying the modern Middle East. She is currently concentrating in economics and pursuing a secondary in the modern Middle East.
“I think it should encourage more students to concentrate in NELC,” Motley said,

Under the shade of the Holmes Field trees, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urged the Harvard Law School Class of 2012 on their Class Day to pursue public service after their graduation.
Holder, who is the nation’s first black Attorney General, emphasized the importance of leading, serving, and giving in his address.
“You and your classmates will fan out across the world, trying to make a difference, trying to make your mark,” Holder said. “Exactly how do you plan to get there?”
He told the students that they are “in pursuit of an elusive ideal, not merely to serve clients, but to do justice.”
Students noted the theme of public service throughout Class Day.
“The tone of the entire ceremony was about giving back,” Law School student Yonina E. Alexander said.
In keeping with that theme, the Law School also conferred awards on students and professors during the ceremony for public service and community leadership efforts.
Law School professor William B. Rubenstein received the Albert M. Sacks-Paul A. Freund Award for Teaching Excellence, an award bestowed by the graduating class.
“Professor Rubenstein is fantastic. He was definitely one of the best teachers. His speech was extremely moving,” said Law School student Daniel B. Saver.
Rubenstein, who teaches courses including “Civil Procedure,” spoke about the students’ role in justice and the capacity of the law.
“The law’s promise was that it too could help ameliorate human suffering,” Rubenstein said.
Commenting on the graduates, their teachers, and the special guest speaker of the day, Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said, “It was really special to have the combination of people who were here today…. Each of these people stood for justice.”
At the conclusion of the ceremony, graduates, families, and guests attended a reception on Jarvis Field.
“It’s a culmination of the years at law school, the final two days before you go into the workforce,” said Jerry Tack, grandfather of Law School student Joshua A. Matz. “It’s honoring people for their work.”
Other students reflected on their own graduation.
“I’m extremely excited. I’m the first person in my family to go to college, so it’s a really big day for everybody,” Law School student Jessica L. Lewis said. “Everybody’s proud.”

As the new interim director of the New England Primate Research Center, Harvard Medical School professor R. Paul Johnson will look to improve animal care practices in the facility that has come under fire for multiple animal deaths in recent years.
Over the past two years, four primates and five other animals—a dog, a goat, a sheep, and two rabbits—have died in several separately registered Harvard-affiliated laboratories. Following two recent primate deaths at the NEPRC, former director Frederick Wang announced his resignation in March.
Since the beginning of Wang’s term as director last September, the NEPRC received multiple citations from the United States Department of Agriculture.
Over the course of the past few months, the center has begun implementing stricter regulation and policies to address the animal safety complaints. According to Johnson, the center has identified areas for improvement and has quickly taken steps to improve animal care.
“We’ve instituted training for a new group of employees who are undergoing training now and instituted a second round of quality control checks on animals,” Johnson said. “We are in the process of hiring additional animal care supervisors, both senior veterinary technicians and assistant animal care supervisors.”
Johnson said that he welcomes feedback from the University community and farther afield as he heads up reform efforts at the NEPRC. “We are continuing to get input from a variety of different resources both within and outside the University,” he said. “We look forward to getting those recommendations and implementing them.”
Though Johnson said that “our first priority is to ensure the quality of care provided to our animals,” he added that he hopes to improve other aspects of the NEPRC as well as he takes the reins. In particular, he spoke of his desire to “reinvigorate” the research efforts at the facility, which currently specializes in studying AIDS pathogenesis and vaccines, cancer, neuropsychiatric diseases, drug addiction, and new treatments for Parkinson’s disease.

Paul J. Finnegan ’75 has been selected as the newest member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, the University announced Wednesday. Finnegan’s appointment is the latest in a series of additions to the Corporation as part of a multi-year restructuring that includes the imposition of term limits and an expansion in the number of members.
Finnegan, who is the co-CEO of Chicago-based investment firm Madison Dearborn Partners, has been an active and visible Harvard alumnus. He currently serves on the University’s Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, and was previously the president of the Harvard Alumni Association. He has also served on a number of councils and advisory boards across the University, from Harvard Business School to Harvard School of Public Health.
“I often marvel at how Paul Finnegan seems to be everywhere,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “It’s remarkable how much he does for Harvard, and how he does it with such enthusiasm, such a thoughtful and probing manner, and such concern for how we can always do better.”
The Corporation, which is the oldest corporate body in the Western hemisphere, announced in 2010 that it would enact the first major structural changes in its history in order to improve transparency and accountability. The plan expanded the Corporation’s membership from seven to 13 members. Finnegan is the fourth appointment since the announcement and the second of the new members to have served on the Board of Overseers, which is the larger of Harvard’s two governing bodies.
“I’m especially pleased to be able to take on this new role at a time when the Corporation itself is in the midst of important changes and when the University is pursuing new approaches,” Finnegan said in the press release. ”This seems to me a particularly interesting moment of transition and possibility for Harvard, and it will be a privilege to continue working with President Faust and others to make the most of it.”
As a corporation member, Finnegan will be responsible for helping make some of the University’s most pressing decisions. Senior Fellow of the Corporation Robert D. Reischauer ’63 cited Finnegan’s knowledge of finance as a skill that would benefit the Corporation.
“Paul Finnegan is one of Harvard’s most devoted, energetic, and accomplished alumni leaders,” Reischauer said in the press release. “He will bring us not only important financial and organizational expertise and a deep knowledge of the University and its governance, but also a broad set of relationships across the community.”
Finnegan’s appointment will begin July 1 and last until 2018, with the possibility of extending his service for a second six-year term.

Chief Operating Officer of Facebook Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 encouraged the Harvard Business School’s graduating class to keep in touch with one another using tools such as Facebook at its Class Day on Wednesday.
Sandberg, who is also an alumna of HBS, discussed the way that social media tools have caused a shift in voice from the “powerful to the powerless” as the world becomes more connected.
“It used to be, in order to reach people, you had to be rich, famous, and powerful,” Sandberg said. “That’s not true today. Now, anyone with access to Facebook, Twitter, and mobile phones has a voice.”
Sandberg also talked about the changing structure of the workforce—“from hierarchy to shared responsibilities, from command and control to sharing and listening,” she said.
Sandberg said that Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria asked her to come speak at Class Day to celebrate the school’s 50th anniversary of admitting women to the full-time MBA program.
Despite some progress, Sandberg said that women still face many challenges in the workplace.
“It is time for women to take their rightful seat at the head of the table,” she said.
During his speech, Andrew D. Sternlight ’06, a member of the Business School graduating class, shared a story about his battle with cancer during his senior year of college.
Through this experience, Sternlight said that he realized the sense of community and purpose.
“What’s important is not scholastic or professional achievements, but the moments I spend with my family and friends...those who gave me elixir that even the best doctors could not provide,” he said.
In addition to being a JD/MBA candidate at HBS and Yale Law School, Sternlight also serves as a tutor in Pforzheimer House.
Nohria also emphasized the importance of community in difficult times when speaking about the death of HBS student Nathan G. Bihlmaier, whose body was found on Tuesday in Portland Harbor.
“What makes our school so special is its community,” Nohria said. “Let’s come together as a family and community.”
Members of the audience wore black ribbons on their chest in honor of Bihlmaier. In light of the community’s support for Bihlmaier’s death, Student Association co-presidents Jonathan R. Dick and Ifunanya “Funa” O. Maduka, delivered a message of gratitude.
“We will continue to be there for each other,” Maduka said. “That is the promise of [the] Class of 2012.”

Harvard administrators have proposed a new plan for the Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons, which would shift the complex’s center across the intersection from its originally-planned location.
At the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Wednesday, Boston Redevelopment Authority officials presented the plans, which Harvard had submitted prior to the meeting, to residents and Task Force members.
The altered plans would facilitate the creation of more “pedestrian pathways,”  said David L. Grissino, a senior architect for the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Grissino added that he thinks that the change “could lead to a richer center for Barry’s corner.” The BRA also gave more specifics about the plan for the plot of land it owns abutting the Harvard athletic facility and the Education Portal, saying that the University is considering building a medium-sized basketball venue on the site.
After the presentation, meeting attendees broke into small groups—an unusual practice for Task Force meetings—so that individuals could discuss questions and concerns about the plan with University and BRA officials.
In their small groups, residents seemed to prefer the newly proposed plan over past ideas.
“I think [the development] has a stronger foundation with this plan,” Cusack said, adding that he thinks the new plan has more potential to bring in helpful retail and businesses.
But the presentation and break out session were preceded by nearly 45 minutes of criticism of Harvard’s planning process.
“I just think we need to be clear that you’re not in fact incorporating the community’s comments, and you shouldn’t tell us that you are when you’re not,” said Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73, “Just be honest.”
Whelan’s comments struck directly at the University’s claims that, as it embarks on its second round of Allston development, Harvard will ensure residents’ voices are included.
In the University’s 2007 Institutional Master Plan for Allston development, the University proposed transforming Barry’s Corner into a “main street” environment. However, Harvard halted its Allston projects when University funding dried up during the 2009 recession. After resuming planning in December 2011, the University has engaged in what it has called a “revolutionary” open process for Barry’s Corner, soliciting feedback from the community while devising plans.
But Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communication, maintained that Harvard has understood and taken into account the community’s concerns while selecting a third-party developer for Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons.
“We definitely heard the community’s concerns and tried to take those into account when developing selection criteria for a developer,” Casey said.
Other Allston residents praised Harvard’s open process, saying the community’s voice does play a role in Harvard’s decision making. Task Force member John Bruno, one of two community members serving on
Harvard’s internal selection committee for a developer for Barry’s Corner, defended the University’s claims of community engagement.
“I walked away with a feeling that there was truly, maybe for the first time, internal cooperation between the University and the community,” Bruno said.
The University plans to announce its development partner in June, Casey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruminating on the origins of the Senior Class Day exercises-the event at which he was speaking- Saturday Night Live cast member Andy Samberg said, “Class day is a terrible name for a day where you don’t have to go to class, ever again. It’s like calling New Years Eve sobriety night.”
After being introduced by Senior Class Marshal Matthew J. DaSilva ’12, Samberg, wearing a tweed jacket and white Adidas sneakers, walked onto the stage in front of Memorial Church to the tune of Adele’s “Someone Like You.” When he reached the podium, Samberg stared into DaSilva’s eyes for several moments before moving in and giving him a kiss on the lips.
The kiss was “certainly not [planned] as of this morning,” said Matthew E. Whitaker ’12, one of the Class Day speakers, when asked whether he knew about the kiss in advance.
During his speech, Samberg, one of the event’s mostly highly anticipated speakers, lived up to his comedic reputation, making fun of Harvard concentrations and their applicability in the real world.
“All of those majors are now useless unless you can turn them into an iPhone app,” said Samberg.
Samberg also jokingly berated Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, who was one of the first to speak at the event, for not offering him an honorary Harvard degree.
“I guess the old saying is true. Never trust Dean Hammonds,” he quipped.
In her speech earlier in the ceremony, Hammonds made jokes of her own as she poked fun at the Harvard Business School’s Commencement traditions.
“They have special cheers and special props,” she said. “The Business School people always throw money in the air,” she added, to much laughter.
Barney Frank ’61-’62, who was one of the day’s other guest speakers, used a similarly light tone to both share meaningful tips with seniors while cracking jokes.
“You will be invited to places where people will want to pay you tribute...by giving you something,” said Frank. “Never throw anything out within one mile of where it was presented to you,” he said adamantly.
Frank also suggested to students that in a time of easy communication through smartphones, Facebook, and Twitter, it is sometimes better to simply say nothing at all.
He advised the Class of 2012  to “never write when you can talk, never talk when you can nod, never nod when you can wink.”
Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12, one of the event’s Ivy Orators, urged her classmates to “take pride in [their] lack of practical skills.”
Rossi took time in her speech to explain the process by which toilet water tanks are filled. “I just said ballcock in front of Barney Frank, twice,” she exclaimed.
In his speech, Whitaker tried to imagine what John Harvard would think of his name having such an influence in the modern world.
“‘Crikey,’ he might say if he were Australian, which he was not,” said Whitaker.
Despite the light hearted tone of the event, the ceremony took a moment of silence in the memory of Wendy H. Chang ’12 who died last month.
Both speakers, “close friends since freshman year,” according to Rossi, said that the event was an important way to bring together the Class of 2012 and reflect back on all that they had experienced together.
“[Class Day] was a great way to feel a connection with the whole class,” Whitaker said to the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Andy Patel, owner of the news vendor located in the historic Out of Town News kiosk in Harvard Square, placed copies of The Crimson on his racks on Wednesday, he was shocked to read the front page. His fellow Square business owners, he read, want to tear down his establishment and replace it with an information stand with interactive glass walls.
The drafters of the plan for a major overhaul of the heart of Harvard Square have presented it to City Councillors and other Cambridge officials, but no one told Patel.
“I never knew about this plan before,” he said.
The 15-page set of artistic renderings, created by members of the Harvard Square Business Association, suggests transforming the Out of Town News kiosk into a state-of-the-art tourist center and installing a 23-foot by 5-foot LED screen and stadium seating in the Pit to model Harvard Square on Times Square.
Patel’s Muckey’s Corp. currently leases the Out of Town News kiosk under a five-year contract which is set to expire in 2013. Whether the lease can be extended an additional five years is at the discretion of the city. The ambitious construction plan, too, must be vetted by city officials including Mayor Henrietta J. Davis and City Manager Robert W. Healy, who both said last week that they supported the idea but have not secured funding for it.
Beautification projects in Harvard Square has been in various stages of completion for 15 years, but the proposal that would spell the end of Out of Town News is the most dramatic yet. Since its release by The Crimson on Wednesday, residents have expressed differing opinions over whether the improvements would bolster the Square’s charm or detract from it.
“I’d hate to see any of the old businesses to leave, but I understand if it’s not feasible for them to stay. Those things happen,” said Chris Kotelly, president of Crimson Corner, the competing newsstand across the street.
BUILDING ON HISTORY
The plan for revamping Sheldon Cohen Island, the stretch of red brick at the heart of Harvard Square, surprised many business owners in the Square.
Sheldon Cohen, the island’s namesake and founder of Out of Town News who manned the kiosk for 39 years, said that he was unaware of any designs for modernizing his former place of business but expressed excitement about the prospect.
“It’s bringing it up to the 21st century, looking at it that way. I think it could work together with historic and 21st century,” Cohen said.
Others, however, were more hesitant to endorse this vision.
“The screen is ridiculous,” said Edward P. VerPlanck, owner of Dickson Brothers hardware store, of the plan’s proposal to place a massive display screen on top of the main MBTA station entrance on the island.
Many of those opposed to the plan took issue with the proposal to put the Out of Town News name on a new structure with interactive tourism information displayed on its glass walls.
“It’s nice to take advantage of technology, but I love the charm and feel of it now. I don’t think there’s any need to put money into it,” said Laura Evans ’13.
The plan’s developers said this idea seeks to remedy a lack of information for visitors to the Square. The current tourism center, a small booth near the MBTA entrance, is rarely staffed.
Robyn Culbertson, executive director of the Cambridge Office of Tourism, said that the number one question the information booth currently gets is, “Where is Harvard Square?”
Travelers are sometimes not able to have this question answered, since the kiosk is manned only sporadically by volunteers.
“A lot of people ask for info, so it’d be nice to have,” Steven Zedros, owner of Brattle Square Florist, said about an information center.
But among those who lamented the potential demolishing of the current Out of Town News, many made reference to the newsstand’s long history.
Charles M. Sullivan, the executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, said that the current building was constructed as a railway stop in 1928. The building then served as an entrance to the MBTA station until Cohen purchased it in 1984 to house the news operation he had been running since 1955.
The kiosk came under the protection of the Cambridge Historical Commission as a national historic landmark in 1979. In order to adapt the structure for reuse as a newsstand, Cohen had to receive approval from the Commission.
The planners behind the new update of Sheldon Cohen Island kept this in mind when creating new designs for the building.
“We want it to maintain the character and the transparency,” said Sullivan, who was aware of the HSBA preliminary plan. From offering a window on the world, the stand might go to literally being made of windows.
But Patel said that despite the decline in print media sales in Harvard Square as in all parts of the country, he would be sorry to see the unusual newsstand, which vends papers from around the world, disappear from the busy gateway point of the Square.
“It should be retail. People come from all over the world and would like to get news from their country,” Patel said.
ROUGH DRAFT
Alumni from the Class of 1962 visiting for their 50th reunion said the island already looks very different from what they used to see, when it was surrounded by two-way streets without safely navigable crosswalks. They said that the construction of the past 50 years has improved the area’s aesthetics and pedestrian security, but many were hesitant about further changes.
“The less electronic application the better. There’s already plenty of that,” said Henry S. Horn ’62.
In addition to the screen, the prospect of stadium seating drew negative reactions from several Square business owners, who theorized that it might prove a place for homeless residents of the Square to sleep at night.
The presence of homeless men and women in the Pit on Sheldon Cohen Island has been on the radar screen of improvements planners since at least 2006, when the Harvard Square Initiative, an older document of suggestions for beautifying the Square, mentioned “the homeless and safety concerns around the Pit at night.”
Kotelly, who owns Crimson Corner, said, “We’ve had some customers complain they felt that walking through the Pit area at night wasn’t the safest venue.”
But he thought the stadium seating was a good idea, since it would come along with other improvements like new shrubbery. “I’m in favor of cleaning up that area and putting some extra seating,” he said.
Though they disagreed on the merits of the proposals like the glass kiosk and the giant LED screen, most Square business owners and city officials said that the area seems due for some sort of facelift.
“The area is old and certainly tired. The street furniture is tired and needs to be redone,” Sullivan said.
Donez J. Cardullo, co-owner of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, also located across the street from the island, said that if the proposed major construction becomes reality, it will inevitably dampen foot traffic for the many surrounding businesses.
But she said that the result—a radically modernized look for the central crossroads of Cambridge’s most touristed district—would be worth the inconvenience.
“We’ve lived through several construction projects, and we just hold our breath until it’s done,” she said. “We support any project that works to beautify the area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2010, University President Drew G. Faust promoted the Harvard Global Health Institute to the status of a permanent institute, declaring that improving the state of global health education on campus was one of her highest priorities. Ever since, Harvard has continued its efforts to respond to a quickly growing interest in global health.
“At that time at least, all the global health courses were General Education courses,” said former Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health Barry R. Bloom and co-instructor of Life Sciences 120: “Global Health Threats.”
According to Bloom, LS120 is one of the few full courses in global health that has prerequisites. It was created specifically to provide a comprehensive class that went beyond general education.
“For students who were majoring in science—that have a real interest in science—there wasn’t that much in the advanced realm in global health for which students were really excited,” he added.
With growing undergraduate interest in global health in recent years, the Harvard School of Public Health has provided support to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences by offering more courses taught by HSPH faculty for undergraduates, establishing a unique relationship between the College and one of its graduate schools.
MEETING AN INCREASED DEMAND
Christopher P. Duggan, an associate professor in the department of nutrition at HSPH, spoke of a similar need to introduce more global health courses to meet the increased demand from undergraduates.
“We felt there was an unmet need and certainly a high interest among the undergraduate students to learn about the concepts of nutrition and how that relates to global health,” said Duggan, professor of Science of Living Systems 19: “Nutrition and Public Health,” about his own course.
Duggan’s course, which was first offered in 2010, saw its enrollment increase by more than 70 percent between its first and second year. It is only one of a number of global health courses that have seen rapid growth.
The School of Public Health is now focusing more of its energy on the College to meet this increased undergraduate demand for such coursework, offering more global health-related courses as the topic continues to grow in popularity across the country. Harvard’s expansive resources across the University have helped it match this demand.
“Lots of schools just don’t have the capacity to meet that interest,” said David M. Cutler ’87, the director of graduate and undergraduate education for HGHI.
“Schools that don’t have a medical school or a school of public health...inherently have fewer people to help out the students,” he added. “We have strong professional schools in these areas that help us out and, just in terms of the resources around here, it’s extraordinary.”
However, the increased interaction between HSPH and the College could lead to a draining of graduate resources as more HSPH professors teach in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Duggan acknowledged that the effort required to teach a course is “not insignificant,” but he said that he does not consider the process to be detrimental to graduate studies.
Many faculty work with undergraduate students, according to Cutler, who describes this cross-school pollination as “one of the most transformative experiences in our students’ lives, when they work with a whole host of faculty.”
Though faculty may now be working with students at both the graduate and undergraduate level, Cutler believes that this splitting of resources is not novel. Figuring out how to accommodate the interest of masters students, undergraduates, and researchers in addition to dealing with the physical and technical difficulties of these interactions are just “structural issues that the University has to deal with.”
Cutler said that the School of Public Health’s mission is to train people who will be involved in improving the health of the world.
“They view undergraduates as one of the ways of doing that,” said Cutler. “I don’t think they perceive themselves as being conflicted in any way.”
FOCUS WITHOUT A CONCENTRATION
Harvard first offered a secondary field in health policy in 2007, but in 2010, the secondary field expanded its scope to become the joint global health and health policy secondary that students know today.
“We bring a lot of intellectual excitement to this area,” said Cutler, faculty chair of the secondary field. “It’s such an important and popular field that the student numbers are very high, and you just have to be prepared for a lot of interest.”
According to Cutler, global health and health policy is one of the largest secondary fields. This year, there are roughly 100 GHHP students in the Class of 2012.
Cutler said that the University must work to create better opportunities for students to study topics in global health and health policy, regardless of whether they simply want to take one course on the topic, follow a program of study by taking several courses on the topic, or pursue international and domestic experiences related to public health policy.
Despite the large interest in the GHHP secondary, Cutler insists that there have not been discussions about promoting the secondary to a concentration.
Cutler said GHHP will focus on expanding the range of its classes rather than on developing into a concentration.
BECOMING ONE UNIVERSITY
As the program continues to flourish, some faculty members believe that even more can be done to support undergraduate interest. The major challenge in developing the teaching efforts on the undergraduate and graduate campuses lies in the funding of faculty salaries.
Though the number of faculty teaching global health courses has increased and the research opportunities available to undergraduates both on campus and overseas have increased, the funding for HSPH faculty to teach undergraduates may not be enough of an incentive to foster a stronger cross-school relationship between the College and HSPH.
“Diverting time from their own personal research to teach undergraduates is a much bigger statement than just to say they’re good guys and some of them want to teach undergraduates,” said Bloom. “I think it’s a big trade-off.”
Still, Duggan points to an improvement in funding over the past few years. “There used to be zero, but now I think there’s a moderate amount of salary support for faculty teaching.”
Duggan said that beyond the funding issue, the physical separation of  the campuses—with the central FAS campus located in Cambridge and HSPH campus in Longwood—will keep students on the medical or public health track at a disadvantage. However, students can still look to the University’s other graduate schools, such as the Business School or Divinity School, for other kinds of global research.
“They may not be doing global health research, but they’re doing all kinds of global efforts in their fields, some of which are very relevant to public health,” he said.
As the University looks to increase collaboration between schools, the increased role of HSPH in the College marks a possible area for continued cooperation.
“With the tremendous interest on the part of undergraduates, particularly in global health, we take that as a mission and obligation,” Bloom said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those in Harvard’s Office for Sustainability have a list of success stories to tell.
To date, more than 75 of Harvard’s buildings have earned LEED green building certifications, more than any other higher education institution. Since 2010, over 60 percent of Harvard Yard’s hot water needs have been provided for by a solar thermal and heat recovery system located on Canaday’s rooftop. And Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track Center will soon become home to the University’s largest solar panel system, providing more than 600 kilowatts of power to the institution.
The current movement to put the University on the path to environmental sustainability began in earnest in July 2008. It was that year that University President Drew G. Faust, after convening the Greenhouse Gas Task Force, announced that Harvard would attempt to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from its 2006 baseline by 2016.
“What is at stake is nothing less than a change in the culture of how we work and live,” Faust said at the time.
But four years later and halfway into its commitment, Harvard has only logged a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions, according to the Office of Sustainability’s website. Having reached the project’s halfway mark, the University is taking time to evaluate its progress and reassess its goals. This fall, a committee will examine what has already been done to reduce GHG emissions and achieve Harvard’s other sustainability priorities.
But before the committee presents its findings and recommendations—which may involve a tweaking of its greenhouse gas reduction goal—much work remains to be done, and faculty, students, and staff members have affirmed the need for more creative methods of reducing Harvard’s emissions.
‘A MOVING TARGET’
Ambitious is a word that many—including Faust herself—have used to describe the 30 percent goal.
“It’s very challenging, but it was intended to be,” said Business School professor Robert S. Kaplan, one of the faculty chairs of the GHG Reduction Executive Committee, an advisory group that regularly meets to devise Harvard’s sustainability strategies.
In its drive to reach the GHG emissions reduction goal, Harvard has focused thus far on ways to reduce the energy used by campus facilities, which emit 95 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted by Harvard.
“The strategy was that we’re going to assess and target all the stuff we can do on campus first,” said Office for Sustainability Director Heather A. Henriksen. “As a community, we agreed to make all the hard stuff—everything we have control over in our energy supply and our buildings—more efficient.”
With that in mind, energy audits were conducted on buildings across the University to determine the energy needs of existing structures, many of which were built over a century ago. To date, more than 800 energy conservation measures have been implemented and 200 more are in the works.
Perhaps the greatest difficulty in reducing emissions is the growth of Harvard’s campus. If the 3 million new square feet added to Harvard’s campus during the last four years are not included in the calculation, then Harvard has already reduced GHG emissions by 18 percent, according to the Office of Sustainability.
Newly constructed buildings are often home to energy-intensive laboratories, which comprise about a fifth of Harvard’s square footage but account for 40 percent of its energy use. But the fact that the Task Force’s benchmark includes growth makes the University-wide effort to reduce emissions “a moving target,” as Kaplan put it.
RENEWABLE DEVELOPMENT
Although schools across the University have undertaken a large-scale effort to improve buildings’ energy efficiency, the University has also begun to utilize more renewable energy sources in order to reduce its impact on the environmnet.
In November 2009, Harvard became the largest single-institution buyer of wind power in New England when it announced that more than 10 percent of electricity used by its Cambridge and Allston campuses would come from a wind farm in Maine. Meanwhile, improvements to Harvard’s Blackstone Steam Plant, which generates electricity for the University, have made it 31 percent less GHG-intensive since 2006. Harvard’s two chilled water plants are now 19 percent less GHG-intensive than they were in 2006.
But the production of Harvard’s electricity is a source of emissions the University has less control over. The University generates only one third of the energy it consumes on-site and purchases the other two-thirds from third-party sources. And according to Henriksen, the New England electricity grid, from which Harvard purchases much of its electricity, has not been converting to renewable sources of energy as quickly as it projected it would in 2008, in part due to municipal budget cuts across the region.
Harvard’s inability to effect more change on this front has proved frustrating for some.
“The [Environmental Action Committee] would like to see more pressure from Harvard on the local community in getting the places it sources its electricity from to adopt more sustainable forms of electricity,” said Daniel Z. Wilson ’14, president of the EAC.
According to Wilson, Harvard will not reach its 30 percent goal without changing the sources from which it derives more than half of its electricity.
A GREEN INTELLECT
Even if Harvard does not make its 30 percent goal, professors said, the University can secure its preemininence in the green movement by focusing on its teaching and research.
“Harvard’s main mission is research and education, and by far the biggest impact we have on the climate problem is through the way we teach our students,” said environmental science professor Daniel P. Schrag, director of Harvard’s Center for the Environment.
According to Schrag, the center is hoping to collaborate with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to offer a new secondary field in “energy and the environment.”
“Ultimately, as a climate scientist, what matters is not getting to 30 percent—it’s getting to zero,” Schrag said. “It’s Harvard’s commitment to scholarship and teaching that will lead the world to a zero carbon economy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As attorneys representing the University of Texas prepare to defend the school’s affirmative action policies before the Supreme Court this fall, they face an uphill battle. Legal experts say that the Roberts Court is poised to rule against Texas’ policies aimed at increasing racial diversity.
The attorneys reporting to Texas are also indirectly defending Harvard, which originally laid the groundwork for affirmative action as it is used today.
Harvard’s efforts to increase diversity have been a model for peer institutions since 1978 when the Supreme Court cited the University’s affirmative action policy as an “illuminating example” of how race should be considered in college admissions.
Since then, Harvard’s holistic approach has been put to the test on a number of occasions. In 2003, the Court agreed to hear a case challenging affirmative action but ultimately voted to uphold the use of race as one consideration among many in the admissions process. And earlier this year, the College faced a complaint of discrimination against Asian-American applicants which was withdrawn.
Though the University’s policy has managed to endure thus far, this fall’s case—Fisher v. Texas—has Harvard worried. The University’s three-decade-long reputation as the standard bearer of increased diversity and accessibility in higher education has come under attack, and this time around the outcome is far from certain.
BECOMING A MODEL
When the Supreme Court heard Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978, the Court had no precedent on affirmative action in higher education. Eager to help define the acceptable means of considering race in admission, Harvard jumped into the debate. Then-University General Counsel Daniel Steiner ’54 convinced the University of California to allow Archibald Cox ’34, a professor at Harvard Law School, to defend affirmative action to the Supreme Court on behalf of the University of California, according to former University President Derek C. Bok.
“Such a delegation of responsibility was unusual, and I’m not sure how Dan managed it,” Bok wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “Archie put together a team of outstanding constitutional lawyers to prepare the brief and then made the argument to the Court.”
The University also filed an amicus curiae brief—a formal legal expression of support—outlining and explaining Harvard’s treatment of race in admissions.
“[R]ace is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity but it is only one factor weighed competitively against the number of other factors being relevant,” the brief read.
The Court was persuaded not only by Cox’s oral argument, but also by Harvard’s brief. Justice Lewis F. Powell’s majority decision cited the College’s admissions policy as the most effective and thoughtful method of considering race while remaining within the bounds of the Equal Protection Clause of 14th Amendment.
“I have no way of knowing what prompted the Court to use our admissions policy as an appendix to the majority opinion,” wrote Bok. “[B]ut I assume that...the Court felt that it embodied very well what the majority had in mind.”
L. Fred Jewett ’57, who served as dean of admissions at the time, interpreted the Court’s decision as sanctioning the College’s practices already in place.
“It’s hard to tell what it’s going to mean in the long run. There may be subsequent decisions, but we didn’t see anything in Bakke to prohibit what we’re doing,” Jewett said at the time.
Current Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, who was an admissions officer at the time, declined to comment on his office’s response to the Bakke decision.
Regardless of Harvard’s immediate reaction, the decision pushed Harvard’s policy into the spotlight. Soon Harvard’s holistic approach became the paragon for affirmative action policies.
“I think Justice Powell was clearly trying to articulate a road map for universities that would work,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. “Harvard was the model that the Supreme Court pointed to, and so that’s what universities sought to do.”
In 2003, when the Court reconsidered affirmative action in the case Grutter v. Bollinger, Harvard again sought to influence the debate by filing an amicus brief in support of the University of Michigan. Though the Court did not cite the document specifically, it upheld Bakke, leaving Harvard’s program as the model framework.
A YEAR OF CHALLENGES
Though it has been 35 years since Harvard helped to lay the legal foundation for affirmative action, diversity remains a controversial topic when it comes to college admissions. In the past year, Harvard has found itself at the center of debate after it was accused of discriminating against Asian-American applicants and after it reinstated its early action admissions program.
As the tug-of-war between supporters and detractors of affirmative actions continues, Harvard has been forced to navigate choppy waters—reaffirming its commitment to diversity while wavering on the means to get there.
In August, an Asian-American student whose undergraduate application had been turned down by Harvard filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education alleging that the rejection was based on race. The Department of Education opened an investigation which lasted several months before the student withdrew the complaint.
When news of the investigation broke, the University defended the legality of its admissions policies using language reminiscent of the majority opinion in Bakke.
“Our review of every applicant’s file is highly individualized and holistic, as we give serious consideration to all of the information we receive and all of the ways in which the candidate might contribute to our vibrant educational environment and community,” wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal in a statement at the time.
Harvard Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said that universities are always vulnerable to attacks from disgruntled applicants.
“It’s always a threat that some disappointed applicants would invoke Title VI,” said Tushnet, referring to the section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination at institutions that receive federal funding. “As far as I know, it’s an effort that has been met with little success.”
In addition to the negative publicity surrounding the civil rights complaint, many criticized the College’s restoration of its early action admissions option, which it had eliminated in 2007, arguing at the time that it advantaged students from privileged backgrounds. This year’s admissions cycle was the first in four years to offer an early action option.
“I thought it was unfortunate that Harvard reversed itself on early admission. I thought it was a step background,” said Kahlenberg, who praised Harvard for its other efforts to improve economic diversity.
Despite this criticism, administrators maintain that early admission no longer detracts from efforts to promote diversity.
When early admission was reinstated, University President Drew G. Faust said that the return of early action had become “consistent with our bedrock commitment to access, affordability, and excellence.”
In fact, representation of racial and ethnic minorities has indeed remained relatively steady in the first class admitted under the revived early action program. Black students comprise 11.8 percent of those admitted to the pre-early action Class of 2015 and 10.2 percent of those admitted to this year’s admitted Class of 2016. The percentage of Latino students declined from 12.1 percent to 11.2 percent.
Still, Kahlenberg maintains that early admission delivers the greatest blow to socioeconomic diversity.
“Harvard should give greater weight to the economicobstacles that a student has overcome in the admissions process,” he said. “The financial aid piece is terrific, but it doesn’t help students to know that financial aid is available if they’re shut out.”
PLAYING DEFENSE
Legal experts agree that the Court will likely rule against the method of affirmative action employed by the University of Texas. Still, the concrete consequences for Harvard are difficult to predict—depending on the wording and nuances of the decision, the ruling could leave Harvard unscathed, or it could necessitate a dramatic change in the way Harvard evaluates applicants.
Even if the Court rules against Texas, universities could potentially consider race using non-explicit means, a system Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg described as a set of “winks, nods, and disguises.”
Harvard Law School professor Richard H. Fallon said this sort of system could be particularly effective at institutions with significant resources like Harvard.
“The elite rich universities and private colleges that are in a position to do highly individualized assessments of individual applications would find ways to continue to seek diversity without asking students to identify themselves by race. But that’s only a guess,” Fallon said.
Fallon said he believes that the Court will rule against Texas, but he also expressed skepticism that the decision would completely eradicate the consideration of race in admissions. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court’s likely swing vote, has stated that he supports Powell’s reasoning in the Bakke decision, according to Fallon.
“Knowing who wins and who loses isn’t going to be enough to give anybody very much guidance until somebody reads an opinion and understands why what Texas is doing is either permissible or not permissible,” said Fallon. “Where will Justice Kennedy draw the line? I don’t know where...but if I were sitting over in Massachusetts Hall I would be very concerned.”
Perhaps for these reasons, Harvard remains invested in helping to defend Texas.
“I think we’re very concerned because having a basis on which to choose students that takes into account a broad variety of factors is extremely important to us,” said Faust of Harvard’s position on Fisher v. Texas.
Faust’s concern has been echoed in the actions of the University and its peer schools. Months away from the Court hearings, Harvard has partnered with six other institutions—Brown, Duke, Princeton, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Chicago—to retain former U.S. Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman ’73 to prepare an amicus brief in defense of affirmative action, according to University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83
“Student body diversity powerfully improves the educational experience of all students and prepares our graduates to be effective citizens in an increasingly diverse society,” Iuliano wrote in an email. “The consideration of race as one of many factors in an individualized review of each candidate helps us achieve those goals by composing a class that is more than the sum of its parts.”
While experts said they understand the University’s concern for its affirmative action program, they believe the worries stem from a deeper anxiety about universities’ freedom and independence.
“I would suppose it is to defend what you might call academic discretion on behalf of all universities, saying that universities ought to have flexibility into taking race into account,” Tushnet said.
The bottom line, legal experts agree, will only emerge when the Court issues its ruling next spring.
“It’s not at all clear,” said Fallon of how a ruling against Texas would affect Harvard. “You just have to wait and see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one of Harvard’s most prominent professors gave a lecture entitled “Rich and Poor: The Economics of Inequality,” students who cared passionately about social justice might have wanted to listen.
But one Wednesday in November, 70 such students chose instead to stand up in Sanders Theatre and walk out of Economics 10.
These students harbored discontent with the principles espoused by the course’s instructor, N. Gregory Mankiw. They said that the Occupy movement that emerged that fall, criticizing conservative economic policies like those taught by Mankiw, had inspired them to demonstrate their frustration.
In a class of more than 700 students, the protesters represented a minority. And according to Mankiw’s account of the protest in the New York Times, at least one student walked out only to sneak back in minutes later so as to avoid missing lecture.
At Harvard, an institution that fosters academic discussion of topical issues, a physical demonstration seemed, to some, out of place.
One week later, an arguably more incongruous sight materialized: a tent city in the middle of the Yard, bearing signs decrying the advantages of the country’s wealthiest 1 percent in a place home to some of the nation’s most educationally privileged students.
Harvard Yard had been occupied.
As domestic unrest spread to more than 600 communities in the United States in the form of the Occupy movement this fall, Occupy Harvard aimed to bring the spirit of the national movement to the Yard.
Harvard’s occupiers embraced some of the frequent demands of the national movement but paired them with Harvard-specific grievances as well.
On those issues, including requests that Harvard not reinvest in a controversial hotel chain, HEI Hotels & Resorts, and that the University heed custodians’ wishes in contract negotiations, Occupy Harvard claimed success.
Yet closer examination suggests that the achievement of Occupy’s goals was a result more of circumstance than of action, as the movement estranged everyone from administrators, to tourists and freshmen trying to enter the Yard, to even those undergraduates who initially supported it.
WHO OCCUPIED HARVARD?
To the core group of occupiers who camped out from Nov. 9 to Dec. 19, protest was far from new. Many students behind the Occupy movement were involved in some form of on-campus activism long before discontented citizens occupied New York City’s Zuccotti Park, termed their encampment Occupy Wall Street, and sparked a national movement.
“[Student Labor Action Movement] members played a pretty major role in Occupy,” said SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14, who described himself as tangentially involved in Occupy Harvard. “SLAM’s interests were very much intertwined with Occupy.”
Some of the students who joined Occupy Harvard had already been protesting at Occupy Boston’s tent city in Dewey Square.
Participants say that Occupy also engaged some students inexperienced with advocacy. The group’s connection to a national movement that addressed big topics—primarily economic disparity and a cluster of other issues of social justice—was, for some, a powerful draw.
Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, one of the organizers of the Ec 10 walkout and an occupier, said that he was excited about Occupy because he “felt that movements in the U.S. had been lacking” since the financial crash of 2008.
“I had never been part of much protesting in high school,” Bayard said. “But Occupy was so big—when it came to Harvard, there was no way I was not going to be a part.”
It is unclear exactly how many protesters occupied the tents in the Yard at any given time. Among the 16 occupiers interviewed for this article, estimates of the number of participants ranged from 25 to 100. But all agreed that the movement was dominated by graduate students.
“I have really not seen, in all my years at Harvard, such an active participation by grad students in protest,” said Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a longtime leader of SLAM and an occupier.
While Narefsky said she was excited about graduate students’ participation in Occupy Harvard, she also acknowledged that their overwhelming presence may have alienated the undergraduate population. She blamed the “disconnect between the way grad students and undergrads understand Harvard” for some of the negative undergraduate reaction to the Occupy Harvard movement.
Whitham agreed, “Grad students definitely dominated the Occupy Harvard movement, especially at the end.”
He added, “I think some undergraduates felt a bit isolated.”
GATED COMMUNITY
One night in November, students supporting the Occupy movement announced a three-hour protest in front of the John Harvard statue.
They found, however, that security personnel had been stationed at all the gates to the Yard to prevent anyone without a Harvard ID from entering. To include Harvard staff, Occupy Boston protesters, and others who wanted to attend the rally, they relocated to the Law School.
There, they decided to attempt reentry to Harvard’s historic center.
For hours, a massive crowd tried to enter at every gate, chanting slogans as they went. Eventually, every protester with a Harvard ID gained access to the Yard, but the guards remained posted at the gates.
They would stay there at their stations for the next six weeks.
Those occupiers who entered the Yard hastily constructed a tent city at the foot of John Harvard statue. The next day, the occupiers released their first set of demands, a list of policies for “a university for the 99%.”
But despite their adoption of the rhetoric of the national movement, many of their goals were specific to Harvard. They called for a fair contract for custodial workers and a commitment from Harvard to not reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts, which had come under fire for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations.
As the weather grew colder and the campus’ patience for the locked gates grew thin, the tent city teetered on the brink of decampment.
Winter break spelled the end of the occupation. In mid-December, occupiers elected to remove their residential tents, leaving only their weatherproof dome and information tent still standing. The ID checks at the gates stopped.
At the time, occupier Summer A. Shafer, a teaching fellow in history, characterized the decampment as a transition into “a new phase of activism.” The protesters called it Occupy Harvard 2.0.
In January, the last physical vestiges of the encampment disappeared. Forty-five-mile winds blew the dome into the tent, causing the tent to collapse. Administrators then removed what was left, out of concern for the safety of passersby.
Looking back, former occupiers said that without an encampment serving as a physical embodiment of their ideas, the movement began to lose steam.
“Occupy lost its edge when it failed to move on from occupation,” Bayard said.
The announcement at the end of January that library workers might face layoffs served as a rallying point for a movement in need of a new focus.
After a series of protests failed to draw substantial attention, the occupiers returned to their namesake tactic—they occupied Lamont Café.
But there were noticeable differences between this manifestation of Occupy Harvard and the original. The group that occupied the undergraduate library was smaller in size and made up almost exclusively of graduate students.
Lamont Café was more isolated; freshmen no longer walked out of their dorms to a daily reminder of Occupy’s ideas. Many former occupiers felt that the new occupation, which seemed to be focused almost exclusively on library issues rather than other concerns of the national movement, held less appeal.
“I think that the numbers have dwindled because of an inflexibility that prevented us from moving on,” said Bayard, who said he was significantly less involved in Occupy 2.0. “The undergraduates that were sympathetic felt that there was no room for them to expand.”
UNWELCOME GUESTS
A tent city, a geodesic dome, and locked gates made one thing certain—Occupy Harvard got noticed. Students and occupiers agreed that the movement was a polarizing presence on Harvard’s campus.
“It got a huge negative reaction, especially in the undergraduate community,” Narefsky said.
For a Statistics 104 final project, a group of students asked 1,035 undergraduates to gauge their impression of Occupy on a scale of one to ten, with ten being most positive. They found that the average ranking of Occupy Harvard was 2.84 out of 10. Many Occupiers attributed the movement’s chilly reception on campus to what some called an “anti-protest culture” at Harvard. They theorized that this mentality was a result of Harvard students’ success within the current system.
“One explanation is that in order to get to Harvard, you have to be very good at playing the game and have a strong belief that the system is meritocratic,” said occupier Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, a teaching fellow in psychology. “That selects for the kind of people who do not look for solutions that are extra-systemic—it’s threatening to have a group come along and challenge that altogether.”
Eric J. Weiner, senior editor and director of communications at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, said that Harvard students do not fit the profile of typical occupiers.
“In terms of Occupy itself, it’s talking about a fundamental unfairness in our global economy that’s real and getting worse,” Weiner said. “Harvard is not necessarily a reflection of that.... It’s hardly a microcosm of the United States.”
Other Occupy Harvard members attributed students’ negative reactions to the University’s lockdown of Harvard Yard, which they say students unfairly blamed on Occupy Harvard.
“They closed the gates, and a lot of students’ gut reaction was to blame the protesters,” Bayard said. “I think that, to a certain extent, the administration did a smart move.”
The administration said concern for student safety, not desire to vilify the occupiers, motivated the decision. In an email to the Harvard community, University President Drew G. Faust cited police reports that some of the protesters attempting to enter the Yard on the first night of Occupy Harvard had engaged in “violent behavior elsewhere with the explicit goal of causing disruption and with little connection to any particular cause.”
Faust’s message, sent nearly two weeks after the occupation began, was the only communication from Harvard administrators to the entire community regarding Occupy.
Despite the University’s assertion that closing the gates was a safety measure, occupiers felt that the increased security violated Harvard’s principles of free speech.
“I was deeply disturbed that my University had locked the gates in order to prevent others in the community, from janitors to sympathetic organizers at Occupy Boston, from joining our protest,” Shafer wrote in an email.
Occupiers also complained that Harvard’s leaders did not engage in dialogue with them as much as they would have liked.
When the protesters first pitched their tents, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson reportedly promised to attend a general meeting of the movement the next day.
“I would like this meeting to be the beginning of a conversation,” Nelson said at the time. But she did not attend the meeting the following day.
Yet despite occupiers’ complaints of lack of access to administrators, many Harvard officials said they wanted to let the protesters voice their views.
“We tried very hard last fall to hear the concerns of the occupiers, to make sure they had freedom of expression to articulate their views and to balance that with the safety concerns for the rest of the campus,” Faust said.
AIMING TO DISPLEASE
Although many of the specific demands that Occupy Harvard issued were met during the occupation and soon after, the extent to which the occupation served as the impetus for these changes seems minimal.
Reinvestment in HEI, for example, was an issue under discussion in the University long before Occupy came to campus.
“This was definitely an issue SLAM was addressing before,” Whitham said.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp issued a statement in December announcing that Harvard would reconsider the controversial investment, a move that occupiers heralded as a victory. But when the Harvard Management Company announced in March that it would not reinvest in HEI, it made it clear that it was a decision based not on the ethical concerns raised by Occupy but rather on the financial viability of the asset.
“Importantly, this decision was based on factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs, not on concerns about HEI’s practices,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo wrote in an email to Faust.
Occupy Harvard also claimed responsibility for the signing of a just contract for custodial workers. But while Wayne M. Langley, the director for higher education at SEIU Local 615, said that union organizers were grateful for the “important presence” of Occupy, they believed that the outcome of the contract negotiations was probably not affected by the movement.
“I think the results would probably have been similar if we had not had protesters,” said Langley, though he noted that he did appreciate the support.
Beyond specific goals, Occupy prided itself on bringing issues like economic inequality to the forefront of the community’s conversations.
“Messaging was really important—it is important not only to say how they feel, but to communicate it in a way that other people can understand and that can bring people together,” Narefsky said.
To some, that message made its mark. Former Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said that the movement “polarized students and administrators [but] opened up the conversation.”
Ebrahim is now involved in Responsible Investment at Harvard, a group of students who hope to influence the manner in which Harvard manages its money, a goal that echoes the ideas touted by Occupy. He said he believes that Occupy Harvard helped spur the group’s creation.
Others said that Occupy could have been more successful at voicing its opinions.
“The most ineffective part of the Occupy movement was definitely communication,” Whitham said. “It definitely hindered how far this movement could go.”
Narefsky agreed, “It’s important for protesters to think about the way they put forth their message. It could have been done more deliberately. It’s always a struggle.”
But even with the iconic dome cleared away and the people who call themselves occupiers at Harvard down to a few diehards, those who slept in tents for their beliefs this past fall see cause to celebrate their lasting impact, however embattled and unpopular their protest was. Because in the end, the aim of Occupy was not to please but to inconvenience.
“It unavoidably disrupted the comfortable image of Harvard as a constant contributor to society, of everybody being happy,” Sheehy-Skeffington said. “It interrupted that for students, professors, the president, tourists—and forced a new conversation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 31 years, Robert W. Healy has been the most powerful man in Cambridge.
As city manager, he has quietly and firmly changed the face of Cambridge from a city of shuttered factory doors to a thriving hotbed of technological innovation and research. Time after time, the City Council has willingly renewed his contract.
Through three decades of skillful maneuverings, mostly separated from the political fray, Healy has weathered municipal ups and downs in his efforts to maintain financial stability and promote human services.
He prides himself on blending conservative fiscal policy with liberal social values. “If you don’t have fiscal stability,” he says, “you aren’t able to provide an array of services.”
Now approaching his 70th birthday, Healy plans to bring his tenure as Cambridge’s chief executive to an close in June 2013.
As Cambridge’s other leaders turn to the task of replacing Healy, the city has begun to take inventory of the ingredients that made the longtime city manager so effective.
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE POLITICS
In Cambridge, the elected City Council hires a city manager, who oversees almost every facet of the municipality.
Since 1940, there have been seven city managers. In the 15 years preceding Healy’s appointment as manager, the average tenure for a manager was just under three years.
Yet over a period almost ten times as long, Healy has made remarkably few enemies.
“Most people that live in Cambridge are grateful to live in such a great city,” says Kathleen L. Born, a former Cambridge City Councillor. “And there’s no way to separate the city from the city manager.”
Carl F. Barron, who for many years served as the president of the Central Square Business Association, lauds Healy’s performance on the job.
“I think that he’s a top-notch, capable executive who is going to be very difficult to replace,” Barron says.
Talk of Healy’s success as the city manager is widespread, but some citizens have complained that the manager—who according to the Boston Globe makes more than twice as much as the next-highest-paid municipal manager in the state—is not worth the hefty cost of keeping him around. According to a report prepared by Cambridge Day and the Initiative for Investigative Reporting at Northeastern University, he made $336,317 in 2010.
Others are critical of the way he handled the years-long controversy over the firing of Malvina Monteiro, a city employee who claimed she was wrongfully terminated by Healy for complaining about racial discrimination on the job.
“I think it’s just indefensible what went on with the Montiero case,” City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 told The Crimson in March, when he voted against extending the manager’s contract. “This is a way of doing business in government that I cannot support.”
But for the most part, Healy has managed to hold onto public favor for more than three decades. Sheldon Cohen, the former owner of Out of Town News who has been called the unofficial mayor of Harvard Square, attributes Healy’s longevity in office to his ability to stay out of the political crossfire.
“He kept away from the limelight,” Cohen says. “He kept away from the politics—for a person to be in a position for 30 odd years, that tells you something.”
Born echoes a similar sentiment.
“Bob is kind of above politics,” she says. “He, insofar as he could, tried to transcend the politics and squabbles on the Council.”
MONEY MANAGER
Most Cambridge politicos consider Healy’s ability to expertly manage the city’s budget his biggest strength.
Sheila T. Russell, a former Cambridge mayor, recalls the city’s shaky fiscal situation when Healy took over, at a time when the state had just implemented a tax code that severely cut down the city’s spending money.
“The finances of the city were not very good,” Russell says. “He was able to bring us up to a triple-A rating.”
Cambridge Mayor Henrietta J. Davis also praises Healy’s ability to place balancing the budget above satisfying the desires of the City Council.
“He’s been unwavering about having a consistent and responsible fiscal policy,” Davis says. “‘If you want the things you say you want,’ he says to the us on the Council, ‘you have to be fiscally responsible also.’”
The financial strength and stability Cambridge has attained during Healy’s time as manager are undeniable. But some argue that the city’s strong economy stems from its good chance to be home to Harvard, MIT, and the vibrant knowledge-based industry that the universities draw to the area.
“The city is fortunate because it has major universities,” Born says. “There are definitely some physical and cultural assets that the city has. But I think what the city manager has done is to provide very, very steady leadership, and he’s helped the city capitalize on its assets.”
When asked about his contribution to the financial success of the city, Healy acknowledges that “it’s always better to be lucky than good.” But he also notes ways that his decisions have helped to shape Cambridge.
He recalls, for instance, the time that Novartis, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, was considering Cambridge as the location of its new global research headquarters.
“Their issue,” Healy says, “was that they needed to be able to occupy in 13 months. They had a timeline. I said, ‘We can do that.’”
Since Novartis picked Cambridge in 2003, Healy says, the company has become Cambridge’s largest private employer.
Healy has also prided himself on keeping Cambridge property taxes low. According to Healy, the tax rate—$8.48 per $1,000 of property value in the 2012 fiscal year—is “really the lowest of any city in Massachusetts.”
SERVING THE CITY
Healy pairs fiscal conservatism—at least relative to much of left-wing Cambridge—with liberal positions on social issues.
“We have a very wide variety of human service programs available for people of all ages and all incomes,” he says proudly.
He also took an early progressive stance on gay rights.
“That might sound like a very ordinary thing now, but it wasn’t 15 years ago,” Born says. “His commitment to those issues is stellar.”
On the issue of affordable housing, his viewpoint comes from personal experience. His family was forced out of their North Cambridge apartment when he was 10.
“The landlord’s daughter was getting married,” Healy remembers. “A nice man, but he just came to us and said, ‘Well, my daughter’s getting married and she needs this apartment.’ So we were out. And long story short, affordable housing in Cambridge was hard to find in 1953. We wound up out in Billerica.”
Healy lives with his wife in Lowell today. One of his sons is a Harvard University Police Department officer and the other is a Boston attorney. But though he has not lived in the city in decades, he has worked to ensure that others who want to live in Cambridge can do so.
He serves as the managing trustee of the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust, which he says has created about 2,700 units of affordable housing to supplement the units offered by the Cambridge Housing Authority.
Even in a city with a $700,000 median price for a single-family home, Healy boasts, “Well over 10 percent of the units in the city are considered or qualify to be called affordable.”
A HANDS-ON HELPER
Harvard University President Drew G. Faust comments on Harvard’s relationship with the city manager. “He’s been a wonderful partner for Harvard,” she says. “It’s been a terrific relationship, and we’ll miss him a lot.”
Christine Heenan, Harvard vice president of public affairs and communications, also stresses that Harvard will be sorry to see Healy go, describing him as “direct, fair, tough.”
Cambridge Public Works Commissioner Lisa Peterson, who has worked with Healy for 21 years, echoes those sentiments, but she also tempers them by emphasizing Healy’s encouraging nature, describing him as “very supportive”.
“When you go and talk to Bob about a proposal, you need to make sure you have all your information and have done your research,” she says. “He’s very fair-minded.”
Though he is an exacting boss, Healy demands an equal, if not higher, standard of himself. “He works very hard to understand the issues, and he has almost an encyclopedic knowledge about Massachusetts government laws,” says Robert P. Reardon, the director of the Cambridge Assessing Department. “He takes the opportunity to listen to everyone and get a full understanding of an issue from all different perspectives.”
Russell adds that Healy, whom she describes as “scrupulously honest,” was also willing to spend time explaining those issues to his co-workers.
When necessary, he pitched in not just in conversation but on the streets.
Peterson recounts that when a water main in East Cambridge ruptured in 2005, Healy plunged in to help instead of just delegating the clean-up.
She remembers Healy wading across the flooded street with rainproof footgear up to his thighs. “He can be a very hands-on person,” she says. “I think he’s really enjoyed that part.”
Reardon seconds that sentiment. “He’s very competent, and he definitely gets involved in the action.”
Noting that Healy “can be quite funny at times,” Peterson says he has an emotional side that is not always apparent while he handles city business. She points to the dedications of the Robert W. Healy Public Safety Building and the Robert W. Healy Scholarship as moments when Healy displayed such emotion, saying he was “enormously moved, enormously touched,” to have his contributions to the city recognized publicly.
Looking back on his tenure, Healy says he is gratified by the city’s current prosperity. “I am proud to say that this really is, I think, acknowledged as a good place to live, a good place to raise children, a good place to retire.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a tough year for the Harvard University Library.
An announcement of planned staff reductions prompted consternation and confusion among library workers. Faculty expressed doubts over the administration’s vision for a 21st-century library. And a number of communications missteps on the part of the University fueled growing tensions with the community at large.
The administration has acknowledged these widespread concerns and has met anger and protest on the part of library workers with greater communication and interaction. But for the most part, these efforts have failed to quell concern. At the heart of the problem, community members—faculty and library employees alike—are unsure what the library’s rhetoric actually means.
“There’s some confusion among our members about where exactly this is headed or what the goals actually are,” said Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents many of Harvard’s library workers.
Faculty expressed similar sentiments. “I think they’re just lost,” said Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. “They’re sort of grasping around.”
Harvard library administrators and countless experts around the country agree that modern university libraries must adapt to increasingly digital, interconnected, and complicated forms of knowledge to avoid irrelevance. Harvard University Library administrators have picked up on that theme, trying to generate excitement for change with talk of sweeping reforms to centralize and digitize the library.
CHARTING THE COURSE
Since talks of large-scale change for the libraries first began in 2009, the University has maintained a consistent message on the impetus behind the library reorganization: In a rapidly changing environment, the Library is in danger of falling behind.
Now is the time for the libraries to look inward to resolve structural weaknesses and inefficiencies, administrators have said.
In March 2009, Steven E. Hyman, who served as University provost at the time, created the Library Task Force, which he charged with charting the future of the libraries at Harvard. It was this task force that proposed that the University merge Harvard’s 73 disparate libraries into one coherent system in a report that characterized the old model as “fragmented and outmoded.”
The report laid out five fundamental recommendations: create a shared administrative structure, revamp information technology systems, revise the library’s financial model, increase collaboration with peer institutions, and improve acquisitions and access.
“We will come out of this process with an organization that is more responsive to the needs of the research and teaching communities across Harvard,” Hyman said in a statement at the time. “The panel will set priorities to tailor the system for the rapidly changing digital information landscape and propose reforms aimed at supporting collecting, preservation, and other core activities.”
Experts agreed that the libraries must modernize in order to stay relevant.
“It’s not just change—it’s transformation,” said Rachel L. Frick, director of  the Digital Library Federation. And for those that are left behind, “I have not been shy to say that there will be places that will still have a library building, but they won’t have a functioning, engaged library.”
University libraries nationwide have become especially focused on two themes, centralization and digitalization.
LEANER AND MEANER
Above all, the Task Force report and subsequent statements by Harvard administrators have emphasized centralization in order to increase efficiency.
This focus on consolidation to foster an improvement in services has been a goal at academic libraries across the country, according to Paula T. Kaufman, university librarian and dean of libraries at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Illinois—whose library boasts the second-largest collection among American universities, behind only Harvard’s—has undergone many tune-ups in the past half-decade. As the library system at Illinois grew over the course of the 20th century, the network began to include many departmental libraries.
“In 2007, we realized that we were not providing service in the best way possible and not making use of the resources in the best way that we could,” Kaufman said.
Much like at Illinois, Harvard’s reorganization seeks to consolidate the University’s currently separate 73 libraries. The Task Force report recommended the creation of shared administrative services, advice that library leadership followed.
Last year, Garber announced the creation of five affinity groups around which the new, unified Harvard University Library would be organized. In a statement at the time, he said that the system would group individual libraries based on collection needs, content, and special activities. Each library would report not only to the centralized library administration but also to the leadership of its group.
“It gives Harvard the opportunity to act cohesively while also preserving the distinct contribution of the schools,” Harvard Library Executive Director Helen Shenton said in an emailed statement. “This will enable Harvard to set an even higher standard for service, leverage buying power, and pursue opportunities that benefit faculty and students University-wide.”
THE LABOR QUESTION
The drive for efficiency led the library to decide to streamline its workforce. On Jan. 19, Shenton provoked confusion and skepticism among library workers when she announced that “the library workforce will be smaller than it is now,” through either voluntary or involuntary staff reductions. Some workers and student activists protested.
Despite the University’s claim that staff reductions are necessary for modernization, observers at Harvard say that the connection between a smaller staff and a modernized library is not immediately evident.
“I don’t see how they’re going to build a new library system with a demoralized staff,” Asani said. “They’ve confused the chain of command.”
Outside experts tend to say more often that updating the staff naturally comes along with updating the library.
Thomas C. Leonard, university librarian at the University of California, Berkeley, said he is thankful that Berkeley has been able to avoid layoffs.
“In any institution, there are people who have been around for a long time and who are wonderful,” he said. “However, it’s in taking on new people with new skills that we probably have the most to gain from.”
Leaders and members of HUCTW, which represents many of the workers in Harvard libraries, expressed concern that staff cuts would be counterproductive to the efforts to improve the library. Reductions would result in negative effects on the quality of cataloging and other services, the union argued in an open letter to the Harvard community released in March.
“There is only one effective approach to such a major reorganizational effort: the process needs to be transparent and participatory,” HUCTW leaders wrote. “If the cautionary cries of library staff about severe understanding and quality concerns are not heard and heeded, the Harvard Library Transition will not be successful.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy said that the library has and will continue to meet with library workers, faculty members, and administrators to talk about the library’s services and needs. University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 declined to comment for this article.
ZEROS AND ONES
The library reform, of course, is not just about cuts. Whereas many of the old features of the library will be consolidated, Harvard plans to expand its digitalization efforts as it strives to establish a new information collection system for a 21st-century library.
“Any smart library really needs to think about this carefully,” said Brett Bobley, who serves as director of the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities. “What we’re seeing is the way the library customers consume information is dramatically changing. Some people think of a library as a place to get books. I think of it as a place to get information.”
In 2011, Harvard joined the HathiTrust, an organization of more than 60 library partners that manages a virtual collection of 10.3 million digitized volumes and spurs institutions to share digital information.
And for the last year and a half, Harvard has been a central leader in the Digital Public Library of America, an initiative to make a massive online library that will strive to host every book ever printed.
But some professors said that they still have a preference for printed materials. “It’s not information for me—it’s books,” said English professor Joseph C. Harris. “Digital stuff just disappears, whereas print is just there.”
He said derisively that digital materials would be central to the libraries of the rapidly approaching future. “The 21st-century library is something like a cafe where you bring your laptop,” he said.
Jaeger said that some proposed technological innovations, such as automated checkout, were not cutting-edge or particularly exciting for workers. And many workers and other community members have been wary of technological change that is either too quick or too dramatic.
“I don’t think the community wants to see a massive shift in investment to digitized holdings if the only way that could be accomplished is laying waste to the bricks-and-mortar part of the operation,” Jaeger said.
SHARING IS CARING
As the volume of scholarly materials in the world forever increases, universities have found that space and resources limit their ability to offer their patrons access to the resources they expect. As a result, many academic libraries are pursuing collaborative efforts like the HathiTrust.
In recognition of this trend, the 21st-century library should facilitate increased collaboration, Leonard said.
“I think we’re going to go from a model from which a local collection of paper materials was a leading indicator of a great library, to where the libraries that collaborate and leverage the best will be seen as the best libraries,” Leonard said. “Now, we have to think of those buildings as nodes in a network. Information flows from one node to another.”
Shared collections in both digital and bound form increase library interdependence and effectiveness, said Joyce L. Ogburn, the president of the Association for College and Research Libraries.
In addition to its efforts in the HathiTrust and the Digital Public Library of America initiative to share digital holdings, Harvard also joined a program last year to facilitate sharing of its physical resources. Harvard was a latecomer to Borrow Direct, a partnership formed among the other Ivy League institutions nearly a decade before to share books across the universities.
Within the library itself, Ogburn said that a more modern library would reserve more space for computers and student collaboration. Books, she said, could be retrieved by a robot.
VISION TEST
Harvard University Library administrators have generally stated goals in line with what outside experts consider important for a competitive university library. But critics charge that library leaders cannot fully articulate their own idea of what the library of the future should look like.
“They just don’t have a clear vision,” Asani said.
Asani and several of his colleagues have said that they fear that the library, long renowned as one of Harvard’s strongest features, will be weakened by this lack of vision. And library workers share the same concern.
“There’s some confusion among our members about where exactly this is headed [and] what the goals actually are,” Jaeger said. He added that workers still hope that the library reforms will in fact lead to an improved and more efficient Harvard library system.
Garber acknowledged that the University’s efforts to create a 21st-century library combine both “catch-up” measures and cutting-edge innovations.
“We’re trying to do both things at once, basically,” said Garber. “We’re trying to, where possible, leapfrog into [the] state of the art.”
But the difficulties communicating may be due in large part to the precarious state of library transformations across the country. With the rapid pace of change, experts say that it has become difficult to chart a definite course and stick with it.
“I think the age of having a 30-year, 15-year plan, that age is over. Even five is pushing it,” said Frick. “When you think about the constant development process, you’re constantly retooling and developing.”
