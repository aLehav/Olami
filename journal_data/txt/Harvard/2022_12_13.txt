Film and television producer Marty Bowen '91 doesn’t shy away from doing new things — and his upcoming musical comedy series “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies” is evidence of the ambitious and adventurous spirit he brings to his work.
As an entertainment professional, Bowen values the collective experience of consuming art over everything else: His ultimate goal when producing TV shows and movies is to get large groups of people to watch, discuss, and appreciate them together. It was these values that led Bowen to “Rise of the Pink Ladies,” a spinoff of the popular 1970s musical — and this same passion for media that propelled him into the industry in the first place.
Bowen’s rise to fame was unexpected and far from linear, as it involved a lot of failure and one large leap of faith. Before he became the prolific producer behind series like “Dave” and “Love Victor,” Bowen was just like any other overworked Harvard student. After long hours of studying, he often watched his favorite TV show and movies to blow off steam.
“It wasn't until I was a junior in college when I realized I can actually make a living out of watching movies and TV shows,” he said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Once I realized that there was a path towards doing that as a career, I took it.”
After deciding to pursue a career in entertainment, Bowen thought his path forward would be simple: He would get an internship, then an entry-level position, then leverage that job for one that paid well, eventually ending up at the job that he really wanted to do all along. But it didn’t end up working that way for him, as he didn’t get that first job in the industry he wanted after graduating.
So, without a job or even an apartment lined up, Bowen decided to take a chance. He loaded up his pickup truck, said goodbye to his parents, and left Fort Worth, Texas, for Hollywood. His leap of faith paid off — he went from being a partner at the United Talent Agency to co-founding his film and TV production company, Temple Hill Entertainment, in 2006.
At Temple Hill Entertainment, Bowen often works on book-to-movie adaptations, like his previous works “Twilight” and “The Hate You Give.” When looking for the next book adaptation he wants to work on, he often takes cues from the publishing industry.
“If a publisher spends a million dollars on a book, it means they plan on really marketing it and trying to get it out there because they believe in it. That's important because publishing doesn't believe in every book, they have more of a volume business,” he said.
In other situations, Bowen would form an ongoing relationship with a particular author, and adapt multiple of their literary works. For example, Bowen has worked on all of the screen adaptations of John Green’s young adult novels, which include the wildly successful film “The Fault in Our Stars” and Hulu miniseries “Looking For Alaska.”
However, his upcoming project “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies” came about in an entirely unique way.
Bowen is a longtime fan of “Grease,” even having played Danny Zuko in a 1987 production of the stage show. He had always been interested in making a “Grease” prequel movie, focused on the summer Danny and Sandy first met — so he went to Paramount with his idea.
“I convinced Paramount to do that as a movie. And in the process of doing [the ‘Grease’ prequel], Paramount Television was like, maybe we should also consider doing a ‘Grease’ TV show. And so we joined that effort as well,” he said. This eventually led to the creation of ‘Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies,’ a show set before both ‘Grease’ films, that focuses on the origin of the Pink Ladies, the high school clique shown in the original movies.
Even though the series is the first musical Bowen has worked on, he didn’t shy away from the musical components of the project, instead seeing music as an extra tool for storytelling. “It is like using a flashback or a dissolve or a multilinear story. All of those things are tools of the craft,” he said. Still, Bowen found it tricky to find a sound that feels simultaneously modern and authentic to the ’50s. So he deferred to others as much as possible to make sure he got it right: With the show having Grammy nominee Justin Tranter on as an executive music producer, it certainly seems like the show is in good hands.
At the end of the day, Bowen aims to create movies and TV shows that bring people together, whichever way that may be.
“That sort of collective consciousness can be found in many ways,” he said. “It can be found from a book that everybody loves and talks about, like ‘Twilight.’ Or because everybody wants to get together and cry, like ‘Fault in Our Stars.’ It can even be a genre project where people love to get together and jump out of their own skin like ‘Smile.’” Whether it’s a horror movie, love story, or a musical, Bowen is drawn to the emotional resonance of the characters and the conflicts they have amongst themselves.

Behind the curtain at the Boch Center Shubert Theatre awaited a serene world where Blackness and beauty converge. Classical music filled the room, but as the curtain rose, Black cultural dances entered. The stage was filled with color and darkness simultaneously. The dancers were dressed in garments with floral patterns with red and yellow dress accessories. Each dancer donned a red eye mask designed by fashion innovator Charles Deacon.
Choreographer Kyle Abraham’s “Requiem: Fire in the Air of the Earth” is a dance performance that disrupts the traditional theater and dance scene. His dance and title is a play on W. A. Mozart’s “Requiem in D minor” which is used within the soundtrack of the performance, designed by music producer Jlin. Abraham's “Gumbo Style,” which merges Black cultural dances with classical ballet techniques, is ever-present within the performance.
The performance’s Nov.18-Nov. 19 run in Boston was accompanied by a dance masterclass taught by one of the dancers. The performance was co-commissioned by the Celebrity Series of Boston — a non-profit that seeks to enrich the community through the arts. The performance was put on by Kyle Abraham and his company A.I.M by Kyle Abraham.
During the performance, one’s eyes were inevitably drawn to the dancers and their movements as they crossed the stage with a fluidity and synchronicity that symbolized Black diasporic solidarity. The classical songs were presented calmly and peacefully, while the hip-hop songs were accompanied by more dynamic dance movements. The mix of ballet and Black cultural dances bridged a gap present within the current performance scene, creating a form of the Black community that spanned the entire dance performance.
The set design was also noteworthy. The stage was set with four small and thin columnar lamp-like lights. A formation of rectangles structured the left and right sides of the background screening, neatly framing the performers.
The centerpiece was a large circle that sat in the middle of the back screen. Outlined with a light fixture that illuminated the stage in colorful light, the circle seemed to represent the divine. Throughout the performance, the dancers engaged with it in reverence, at one point fighting around the circle, and at another looking to it for inspiration as it depicted a butterfly emerging out of a cocoon.
At the end of the performance, the dancers all turned around, sat down or kneeled, and looked up at the circle as it portrayed images of a young Black girl’s face, a baptism scene, and a mother holding a baby.
How does one express pain and suffering present in Black communities while also representing Black freedom and joy?
Abraham’s dance answers this question through telling a story of pain, redemption, and love. Love is treated as a communal infrastructure. There were multiple instances where the dancers would fall down and look like they were severely hurt or dead only to be brought back by the love of the community. Whenever one dancer would try to help them, nothing would happen, but the individual would gain life and energy when multiple dancers entered the scene.
The message of “Requiem: Fire in the Air of the Earth” was one of solidarity. In the face of anti-Blackness, Abraham’s show illustrates how Black solidarity can help those survive the violence of the world. Abraham’s “Requiem: Fire in the Air of the Earth” was a powerful performance displaying the infinite possibilities of the beyond through Black unity.

Allston has more to offer than meets the eye for those seeking an accessible art community. Though many Harvard students associate Allston only with the Science and Engineering Complex or the Harvard Business School, the extension of Harvard’s campus deeper into Allston also brought the Zone 3 initiative, which since 2015 has spread across Western Ave. with the intention of creating a space for Harvard and its surrounding communities to engage with creativity in many forms. One of these ways is through Zone 3’s “Art in Print” program, which invites and pays artists to share their work in the form of 25 cent posters.
Over the course of a few years, over 120 artists have contributed their work to the “Art in Print” collections.
Emily J. Auchincloss is a museum employee and an artist who shifts between paint and textile in her work, making “the structure that the image is” by mixing mediums, in her words. Her poster, though two-dimensional, jumps out with texture. Auchincloss enthusiastically engaged with the poster project, citing the universal experience of engaging with visual art by hanging up posters, especially “when we are young.”
“I love the idea of the poster because it is so democratizing,” Auchincloss said. “We can take an image and put it on our wall and feel a sense of ownership.”
Graphic designer Alex J. Barber, whose poster features his lovable character Calvin, has been working in freelance design since 2016 and was previously involved with Zone 3’s “Aeronaut Allston” project in 2020.
“Zone 3 is taking local artists that are probably working freelance gigs for large companies … and giving them an outlet to do what they like to do,” Barber said.
For Barber, this is bringing people joy.
“I really enjoy just making people either laugh or smile with the stuff that I make.”
Barber also stressed the importance of making art accessible through public art projects or working with museums.
“I’m not one of those punk rock artists that is like ‘don’t sell out’... as long as people are supporting artists I really love that,” he concluded.
Like Barber, artist Julia E. Emiliani has worked with Zone 3 before and said they share a “mutual respect for each other’s work.” The illustrator and designer hopes that viewers see the joy in her poster — a depiction of pancakes dripping with butter.
“The piece also captures a pancake breakfast I made for friends while they were staying with me, so it was really nice to reflect on a sweet memory, and I hope others can form their own sweet memories around this too.”
Emiliani also praised Zone 3 for highlighting local talent.
“It allows a wide range of people to access original artwork and helps inform the general public of just how many artists live in Boston,” Emiliani said.
Sarah C. Egan, an illustrator with a specialization in watercolor and digital, said she had not heard of Zone 3 before this project but quickly grew fond of the initiative. Her piece features a couple of animals in a rowboat, fishing in tranquil waters.
“I created ‘A Day in the Life’ as an exploration of mindfulness and friendship, and my hope is that some of the peace and whimsy I felt when creating it is translated to its viewers,” Egan said. “No matter where they end up, I hope that my posters bring people joy.”
She then commented on “Art in Print” as a whole, neatly summarizing the benefits of Zone 3’s latest project to the area.
“Public art initiatives like these foster a sense of belonging among communities, humanize and beautify our environments, encourage mindfulness, and inspire change and action.”

In her infamous 1968 portrait of Nancy Reagan, Joan Didion described in excruciating detail Reagan’s “interested smile, the smile of a good wife, a good mother, a good hostess.” It was, Didion wrote, “the smile of a woman who seems to be playing out some middle-class American woman’s daydream, circa 1948.” On paper, beaming out from the cover of her new book, Michelle Obama might be described in similar terms. Yet the difference between the two first ladies is intuitive and immediately obvious: When Obama smiles, she crinkles her eyes. Her cheeks dimple, her head tilts in a subtle gesture of welcome. In other words, unlike Didion’s Nancy, she seems real.
It is that realness which buoys up “The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,” Obama’s latest book. In it, she offers “a glimpse inside [her] personal toolbox” for navigating the world. “The Light We Carry” is an eminently undemanding read, accessible to both the mothers who consider Obama a contemporary and the daughters who regard her as a role model. The prose is straightforward — nothing fancy — and personable. It is easy to digest all at once or over several sittings: Each chapter is divided (by a fitting, if slightly trite, sunburst symbol) into short sections, most of which could easily stand alone as an op-ed or, in her less graceful moments, a self-help article.
In “The Light We Carry,” Obama delivers a series of simple maxims, bite-sized (and occasionally meager) fillings wrapped in a thick layer of anecdote. These walk the line, only partly successfully, between simplicity and banality. Sometimes it stretches into hackneyed territory, as when she advises her readers to “see your obstacles as building blocks and your vulnerabilities as strengths.” Ultimately, many of her lessons land; her musings on the importance of gladness — which Obama calls the “extension of curiosity from one person to another” — are especially welcome.
Obama discards entirely the Nancy-esque veneer of domestic perfection. Indeed, by her own admission, she has made “a fairly deliberate effort to blow holes in the myth” of her utopian life in the White House. Of course, that only further bolsters her credibility. But there are still some elements of life in the Obama household which are just too good to be believed, as when she writes: “There is no quicker or more efficient way to obliterate stress… [than] a hard-core, edge-pushing workout.” This sort of vigorous sentiment, in combination with Obama’s trademark optimism, starts to feel dubiously relatable after a few more fitness metaphors. It calls to mind a 2009 headline by that stalwart of satirical news, The Onion: “Happy, Healthy Obamas Out Of Touch With Miserable Americans.”
Writing two books that address the same subject — particularly in the case where that subject is the author’s own life — is a difficult thing to do well, and even more so within a short time span. Didion managed it by confining her reflections to specific people and moments in her life; Frank McCourt, by dividing it up by the era of his life. Obama does neither in revisiting nearly every theme explored in her 2018 best-seller, “Becoming”: her childhood, parents, career, marriage, and experience in the White House, all from a very similar perspective and with a very similar tone. Perhaps the major difference is that in “The Light We Carry,” she tells the reader exactly what lesson they ought to take away from her anecdotes. The effect is slightly grating; only Obama’s immense charisma and obvious goodwill in proffering this advice keeps it from tipping into condescension.
Much of “The Light We Carry” may resonate deeply with readers, including Obama’s reflections on parenthood and friendship. But, over and over, the book runs into the same problem: It feels real, but it doesn’t feel substantial. Nearly every part of the book that is not personal anecdote reads as if it could have been written by anyone (and indeed, taking Barack Obama’s wry “ghostwriter” comment at face value, it might just have been).
Still, “The Light We Carry” is a performance worthy of a First Lady — genuine, easy, intimate, but one which keeps the reader at arm’s length, just far enough to stay real. It lacks the vibrancy of detail and the vulnerability of “Becoming,” but gains a kind of clucking maternal stateliness as a result. The word that springs to mind — despite its stuffy connotations of handshakes between dour men in suits — is diplomacy. And even Didion might not object to that.

On Nov. 14, poet Safia Elhillo performed a reading of poems from her newest collection titled “Girls That Never Die” at the Hutchins Center Hiphop Archive. Elhillo’s poetry reading was organized by Harvard’s Black Arts Collective and Creative Writing Collective and took place in the Hiphop Archives at the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research. Elhillo is Sudanese by way of Washington, D.C. and a decorated poet, having received the 2015 Brunel International African Poetry Prize and a spotlight in Forbes Africa’s 2018 “30 Under 30.” She has also received a Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation, a Cave Canem Fellowship, and a Wallace Stegner Fellowship from Stanford University.
“Girls That Never Die” was published in July of this year, and explores the fearlessness, beauty, and danger that come with Muslim girlhood. In her poems, Elhillo questions her family’s history and culture while reminiscing about the sweetness of her childhood. “Where are my sisters,” she asks in one poem. “Where have they gone?”
Toussaint J. Miller ’25 of the Black Arts Collective kicked off the evening with a performance of an original trumpet piece inspired by Elhillo’s poem “Pomegranate with Partial Nude.” Lana J. Reeves ’23 of the Creative Writing Collective then gave a compelling introduction and welcomed Elhillo to the podium.
Elhillo read 11 poems from “Girls That Never Die,” each as powerful as the next. Elhillo often followed her poems with related comments or anecdotes. “The Cairo Apartments” tells the story of her brother hurting himself after tripping over a brick. “That’s a true story, by the way,” Elhillo said, receiving laughter from the audience. Prefacing a much more personal poem, “Tony Soprano’s Tender Machismo,” Elhillo spoke about her inspirations – the show “The Sopranos” and how it reminds her of her uncles. Although the audience expected a lighthearted poem, Elhillo ended with a chilling verse.
“Its debris includes the stories I kept quiet, / everything that was done to me that I will not tell them. / Includes every word tossed about to name women, / how we all thought they didn’t mean me,” Elhillo read.
The small audience was entranced, clinging onto and appreciating every word. Many members of the audience leaned forward, eyes wide open, while some leaned back and absorbed the poetry with eyes closed, as if in prayer.
After reading her poems, Elhillo opened up the floor for a Q&A. Members of the audience took advantage of this time, asking questions about specific poems, as well as broader questions about Elhillo’s writing style and process. When asked about her creative plans for the future, Elhillo laughed and replied candidly.
“I have never made a plan in my life that I have stuck to,” she said. “I hope to have the freedom to pursue things that interest me as they present themselves to me.”
Many questions were asked by Sudanese audience members, some even in Arabic. These interactions created a deeper, more intimate and personal connection between Elhillo and the audience.
“It’s nice to spend time reading the work to who it was written for,” Elhillo said after the event. “There was something charged in the air that just felt really special.”
This special energy was also felt by members of the audience, including Safa K. Babikir — a Graduate School of Education student.
“It’s so important to me, as a Sudanese person at Harvard, to see representation and inclusivity,” Babikir said. “I think bringing diasporic experiences and disciplines into a space like Harvard that can be very exclusive is really powerful.”
Another student at the Graduate School of Education in the audience, Reem Agil, reflected on the importance of Elhillo’s poetry given the current political climate in Sudan.
“She’s basically paving a path to art and, especially with what’s happening in the revolution right now, people like her are actually at the forefront of keeping the fight going,” she said. “It’s really important that she’s here to show that you can do great things with poetry.”
When the reading was over, the crowd gathered outside of the Hiphop Archives as Elhillo signed copies of “Girls That Never Die.” People could be overheard reflecting on the poems or reminiscing about their childhoods. The dedication at the beginning of the collection reads: “For our younger selves.” That night, everybody seemed to be brimming with youthful excitement.

A stressed dinner host plans the evening’s menu: appetizers, a show-stopping entree, and complementary side dishes. After gathering recipes and finalizing a grocery list, the all-important question crosses their mind: What’s for dessert?
Claire J. Saffitz ’09 has the answer. Her latest cookbook, “What’s for Dessert: Simple Recipes for Dessert People,” contains over 100 accessible, innovative, and delicious recipes to serve as a satisfying sweet treat at the end of any meal. After tasting one of her recipes, The Harvard Crimson Arts board gave Saffitz a resounding seal of approval.
The YouTube star is a warm and welcoming guide through the book’s array of “happiness-inducing desserts,” from simple loaf cakes to elevated soufflés. Saffitz befriends readers in the introduction by inviting them into her home, where the question of what’s for dessert is an everyday occurrence. Through charming personal anecdotes and advice on how to bake with less anxiety, she presents herself as a friend rather than celebrity, adopting an informal tone to offer years of culinary wisdom.
The most unique and useful element of “What’s for Dessert” is its recipe matrix. Saffitz lays out the name of every recipe in the book across two pages, arranging them on an x-axis of total time and a y-axis of difficulty, which extends from very easy to moderate. The tool is perfect for readers who don't feel like flipping through hundreds of pages to find a recipe that fits their needs; they can pinpoint everything from an easy, last-minute bake like her molten chocolate olive oil cakes to a moderate, six-hour recipe like her pillowy beignets without turning a page.
Saffitz remains a constant presence throughout the cookbook, introducing every recipe with a blurb that describes her personal connection to the dessert. Most importantly, her directions are simple and straightforward; “What’s for Dessert” is far from pretentious, allowing beginner and experienced bakers alike to complete the recipes with ease. She anticipates any questions that may arise, ending her recipes with a “Can I…” section that covers ingredient substitutions, whether the dessert can be made ahead, and more. In Disney’s “Ratatouille,” Chef Gusteau tells his fans, “anyone can cook.” Saffitz is the lovable chef’s real-life equivalent, encouraging her readers with the implicit message that anyone can bake.
Putting Saffitz to the test, The Harvard Crimson decided to bake her salty cashew blondies. The recipe was chosen for its minimal ingredients — ideal for college students who lack access to a full pantry — and total preparation time of only one hour and 15 minutes. Instructions for preparing the batter were clear and easy to follow, but still required enough attention and effort to make anyone feel like a bona fide “Great British Baking Show” contestant. The addition of homemade toffee-covered cashews elevated the basic blondie batter to something that, once baked, could be presented with an extra bit of pride.
The final product was distributed at an Arts board production night. Editors mumbled praise between mouthfuls, ranging from “This is really good” to “It’s so fluffy.” They were impressed by the blondie’s crunchy exterior and chewy interior, a rich toffee flavor that didn’t cross the threshold into sickly sweetness, and the perfect amount of cashews — all in all, a sweeping success.
Saffitz’s latest release is a valuable resource for anyone who identifies as a dessert person. She acts as a helpful, instructive guide while leaving room for flexibility, adaptation, and exploration. The book is also a work of art: With bright, colorful food photography, it can serve as a coffee table book as well as a collection of recipes. “What’s for Dessert” delighted the Arts board, and it’s bound to do the same for dessert people everywhere.

Described by the director as a “tale of ambition, friendship, and legacy," the “Queen of Magic” delivers a story that truly captures the complexity of narratives concerning successful women. Co-Created by Andrew G. Van Camp ’23 and Veronica F. Leahy ’23, and directed by Eleanor M. Powell ’25, this musical does not disappoint audiences. The show delicately dissects the ethics of selfish characters who also contribute to a massive social movement in a very selfless manner. At the same time, the “Queen of Magic” considers sacrifices that women often need to make to truly attain success, examining characters who are forced to make tough decisions between their loved ones and their careers. These complex themes ultimately turn into a thought provoking, visually beautiful, and overall emotionally mature production.
When a viewer of the “Queen of Magic” steps into the Loeb Ex for this show, their initial reactions are likely to be ones of shock by how full the small space feels despite the minimalist staging. Packed to the brim with audience members eager to witness this completely original piece, it is easy to feel how personal this performance will be. With a pit consisting of only four musicians — a keyboardist, a drummer, a guitarist, and a bassist — and a stage with only four pieces of furniture — a chair, a rug, a couch, and a basket — the performance urges audiences to see the power that a smaller show like this one can have.
At the core of this story is the life of Adelaide Hermann (played by Cybèle Fasquelle ’25), the real life “Queen of Magic,” and her long lost memoir. Adelaide was famed as one of the first female magicians to be recognized in the field. Set in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this musical details her career and its price, particularly her own experiences and those of her niece Adele (played by Devon N. Gates ’23). It is through the pain that the pursuit of career has brought these two women that audiences are introduced to a central conflict of the plot: The idea that societal pressures and inequalities that women face lead them to have to sacrifice more to reach the same level of success as their male counterparts.
The audience sees the story of Adelaide and Adele through the lens of Adelaide’s memoir, as Adele faces new reflection after she learns that her beloved aunt Adelaide — a woman who has provided her with an outlet for so much gratification and pain simultaneously — has passed. Thus we witness a series of flashbacks which allow audiences to zoom in on this ever complex aunt-niece relationship whose tensions were heightened tenfold by the pressures placed on these women as they try to make a name for themselves.
To Adele, Adelaide has always been a mentor character, one who has encouraged her to do what’s best for her, encouraging her to always pursue what she wants — especially if that thing is pertaining to the world of magic. Adele loves her aunt and even places her on a pedestal at times, being one of the first people to truly call her the “Queen of Magic.” But no matter how amazing she may be as a mentor, Adelaide is just human, and therefore makes very human mistakes. Becoming overwhelmed with her own stress, Adelaide comes to neglect Adele in her time of need, barely noticing when Adele finally decides to quit magic.
The other half of this story is set in the “present day” of our characters, the early 1930s. At this point in time, Adele has a well-established family life, having married the love of her youth, an architect named Charles (William R. Murray ’26), and even had a child with him. Due to the important impact that Adelaide had on her life, Adele feels inclined to tell her daughter about Adelaide’s legacy after her death. However, Charles is extremely opposed to this, not wanting his daughter anywhere near the world of magic that harmed his wife so dramatically. Tensions rise and arguments ensue from both sides, with Charles even becoming overly controlling and burning anything remotely related to magic or Adelaide.
Through these deeply interpersonal conflicts that are inevitably influenced by the patriarchal structures of the time period, this play makes a blatant commentary about the gravity of achieving success as a woman and the pain that inevitably comes with it. This play is not easy for audiences to watch, nor should it be, as it attempts to reflect the harsh realities of the world. However, it does provide its audience with hope, ultimately asking it to find a new better way of thinking, turning the stories of struggle like the one they just watched into something that will create a positive impact for generations to come.

The time-honored tradition of college a cappella was celebrated on campus as The Harvard Opportunes, Harvard LowKeys, and Harvard Krokodiloes got together on Oct. 28 in Sanders Theater for “KrOpped! A Low-Res Jam.” Featuring an exciting selection of hits from each group, the night also saw new members take to the stage, joined by supportive alumni and a bustling audience.
First up were the Harvard Opportunes, which brought the event to a rousing start. Amidst a medley of new mixes, an old favorite stood out as each new member took a solo part in the classic song “Up the Ladder to the Roof (The Nylons)” by The Supremes. It was heartwarming to see Megan M. Chiappetta-Uberti ’26, Rhys Moon ’26, and Gabrielle R. Medina ’26 each take turns at the center stage, belting proudly as the rest of the Opportunes surrounded them and harmonized along.
“I was very impressed with all the different songs they sang,” said audience member Silas D. Camp ’26. “There was a wide variety of genres happening; it was a very beautiful musical moment and I loved it. It was beautiful for my ears.”
The Harvard LowKeys followed it up with a high-energy performance, filled with choreography and upbeat tunes. Covering the stage in a vibrant mix of bright red costumes, the LowKeys introduced their endearingly-named new member “RooKeys” as well: Ethan P. Hsiao ’26, Tiffani A. Mezitis ’26, Madison R. Webb ’25, Cybèle Fasquelle ’25, and Elizabeth A. de Figueiredo ’26.
“Singing was a really invigorating experience. I’ve been here for a whole year and I’ve been singing for choirs and things like that. I’ve been singing all my life but this has probably been one of the most exhilarating performances and I loved to see my friends come out and support,” Webb said.
Webb also elaborated on the amount of preparation that goes into putting on a successful performance.
“We’ve been rehearsing this for only like a month. We rehearsed six to eight hours a week to put on this show. Some of these songs like ‘Love on Top’ we learned only a week and a half ago,” she said.
Last but not least was the Harvard Krokodiloes, who took the stage with a flurry of hijinks like props, costumes, and a healthy dose of slapstick comedy. With little skits in between performances, each song felt like part of a larger comedic narrative that had the audience laughing along continuously. In a stunning moment of unity, a group of alumni took to the stage to perform their alumni song “Johnny O’ Connor.” It was a delightful sight as the alumni perfectly sang and even danced in sync with the current members, filling the theater with bright smiles.
“It was phenomenal,” said former Krokodiloes member Frank A. DeSimone ’09 “It was so great to see so much talent on stage with three different groups tonight. Just a lot of fun, different genres, very impressive all around.”
DeSimone emphasized the joy that accompanied the experience of going up on stage to sing again.
“It’s so much fun, for us, for the alums who are here in the audience it really brings a sense of nostalgia — brings us back to the time that we were undergraduates. It’s incredibly special to share this tradition with the current undergraduates and with the other members who’ve sung in years past.”
Edwards C. Bursk ’54, another former Krokodiloes member, echoed this sentiment.
“It’s such fun. I mean these guys are really entertainers. I mean the voices are good, the harmonies are good, and the arrangements are good but they are really entertainers,” he said.
On the whole, the event was more than just your typical college a cappella performance. There was an overwhelming feeling of joy as each group honored their legacy in a moment of celebration. It was a historic moment for audience members.
This was the first time that Matthew Ciurleo ’23 attended an a cappella show at Harvard, but it was a night he wouldn’t soon forget.
“I’ve always wanted to come to a cappella shows. It’s senior year, I figured it’s something I have to cross off the bucket list so I’ve been enjoying it so far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a wide, warmly-lit room, a circle of leather armchairs faced a woman with a guitar — an auditory accompaniment for a visual feast. Curious people perused the room, leaning forward and straining their eyes to see the diverse and distinctive art that covered every wall and table.
The Harvard Psychedelics Club Fall 2022 Art Show was hosted on Nov. 13 in collaboration with the Signet Society at on Dunster St. The show featured art from Harvard community members ranging from abstract pieces bursting with discordant lines, optical illusions, and bright colors to dark, pensive portraits. In addition to listening to the various musical acts, visitors could also purchase prints of the art displayed for less than $15.
This event has run for the past three semesters, according to Psychedelics Club Co-president Max Ingersoll ’24. He said that the event creates a much needed space at Harvard for pure creativity and artistic expression without judgment.
“The show is really wonderful because it's about celebrating creativity and art for its own sake,” Ingersoll said. “A lot of the creative spaces at Harvard can be very formal and serious and inaccessible to many people. We’re trying to create a space to showcase people who just make art on their own and celebrate that in a supportive way.”
He expanded on the importance of fostering creation without a focus on its use or quality.
“Many people are really scared to make art because they feel like they'll be judged for it or of viewing art from the lens of quality. We try to create an environment where we celebrate art for just the beauty of self expression,” Ingersoll said.
Ingersoll also believes that psychedelics have an important role in the growth of this kind of creativity.
“I think in many ways psychedelics have been so important in breaking boundaries and helping catalyze creativity. So many different artists, from different traditions, and backgrounds have used psychedelics as part of their creative practice,” Ingersoll said. “And psychedelics can really help break down conceptions and ideas and allow for more free thinking, which is really tremendous and inspiring when it comes to art.”
Fiona Weir ‘26 similarly praised the quality of free thinking discernible in the art at the show.
“I love all the different types of art and how they all have a deeper thinking vibe so it's not just a pretty picture — they all have deeper meanings. It’s all really beautifully done,” Weir said.
Ben Fichtenkort ‘25 found personal connections in the pieces on display.
“There's one piece that has a space aesthetic with stars and a person standing in the middle of an empty field. I come from a place in California that's very open and I’ve had some experiences out in the middle of a field looking at stars with no light pollution and that really vibes with me,” Fichtenkort said.
Fichtenkort also appreciated the prints for sale at the show, where students could find work created in the community for cheap prices.
“The show has consistently excellent art. I really like what they have and it's a great place to get dorm decorations with gorgeous art and a great aesthetic,” Fichtenkort said.
Ingersoll stressed the significance of the Signet offering their space as a venue and helping the event succeed. He also was impressed by the work of the Psychedelics Club team that set up the event and the musical acts which helped create the pleasant atmosphere.
“The team that we had put on the show was really amazing. We worked super well together and it was a really, incredibly collaborative effort. We also really enjoyed collaborating with Signet and it was nice of them to host us and to offer their amazing space,” Ingersoll said.
The art show has become a cornerstone of the Psychedelics Club community, and creates a new space for the Harvard student body according to Ingersoll.
“It's become a really wonderful tradition for our community and our club. It is a super special and meaningful thing that we love to do as a club and we are excited to continue to try to bring this creative spirit going forward,” Ingersoll said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two years, Levy has developed tremendously as a musician, learning from those he listens to and his four friends that he is in a music group with. Kyoudai Collective is made up of Levy (Myles Blue), Hiro Sakuma (Romus), Josh Jackson (Jarou), Aman Singh (Cheez), and Hunter Tsao (HTsao). They performed together for the first time in March 2022 at their high school’s talent show. “It went super well to a point where, at the end of it, people started to group us together… even compare us,” Levy said.
“[People] respect us individually and as a group because our styles are so different,” he added.
The contrast in their musical styles has ultimately pushed Levy to grow as a musician. At the beginning of Levy’s career, he focused heavily on lyricism; “When I started making music with [Aman,] who was very much the opposite, he would stress the importance of vibe and his hooks would be something that I never really explored myself,” Levy said. Singh became a strong influence on the structure of Levy’s music and has shaped his sound as Myles Blue.
Currently, Levy’s talent shines through with themes of love and passion. When asked about his lyrics, Levy immediately springs to life, rapping from his original song “Polygon": “It’s in your room to be square like a radical. / Last week my girl called and said we compatible. / Since the time spent multiplying quickly is addable. / Point is I’m moving up, while you move quadrilateral.”
When discussing how he came up with these lyrics, Levy shared a story of struggling with writer’s block. “Everything that I was writing didn’t stick [or] seem cohesive. It felt like I was just pandering,” he said. Levy came up with the lyrics for “Polygon” on the spot. In the song he raps about not having anything to rap about and it was in that moment he turned to geometry. “Polygon” is Levy’s attempt to shake loose a spark of creativity. It ultimately became his favorite song he’s ever written.
Although Levy’s passion for music is strong, it does not stop him from searching for balance in his life. Along with making music, he runs track for the Harvard team and also creates videos. He is currently planning on concentrating in Art, Film, and Visual Studies. But at the end of the day, Levy wants to continue telling stories through music because it most clearly expresses what he believes needs to be said.
“Growing up I had these instances where I would choose to work on my craft and write some music or stay at home doing these things that I love to do instead of going out with my friends or to functions,” he said. “For a long time there was this internal struggle where I used to wonder if this was worth it. Am I really depriving myself of this fun?”
In times like these, Levy turns to music. His song “Been Different” highlights this internal struggle, ultimately stating: “No, this is who I am and doing these things is what makes me me.”
Levy’s work is emotionally honest. His work is a collage of his personality — as if he is using his lyrics as a diary of troublesome thoughts and inspirational ideas. “I’d say [my music] is innovative, meta, new. Any of those three words. I’m actively trying to not do the same thing twice,” he said. “Regardless of the song that I’m making or the verse that I’m writing or performing, at the end of the day they all come from me. My mind, my soul, my heart. I am not just doing it for the sake of doing it.” As Myles Blue, Levy is unfiltered, authentic, and raw.
Reminiscent of Tyler, the Creator and MF DOOM, Levy’s lyricism, rhythm, and sampling of sounds helps him tell a story that connects him to his music and his listeners to him. What seems a constant for Levy is his genuine passion for making unique and mesmerizing sounds. In the future, he is hoping to continue working with Kyoudai and on his own under Myles Blue. Currently, he can be found on all streaming services and he will have more songs and music videos coming out later this year and in the spring of 2023.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is a strange place. It’s a rollercoaster of extreme highs and lows, with some loops in between. A place where it is hard to be alone and easy to be lonely. It simultaneously creates and challenges your values. It advocates for mental health but works you to the bone.
Some time ago, I read Japanese author Natsu Miyashita’s “The Forest of Wool and Steel,” a novel that follows the young piano tuner Tomura, whose journey is one of self-doubt and setbacks. As a pianist and lover of words, I treasure its tender, poetic prose and imagery; as a Harvard student, I value its remedial guidance for how to maneuver through some of Harvard’s greatest challenges.
“What do you think is the single most important thing for a tuner?” Tomura asks his colleagues towards the end of the book. Their answers — courage, resignation, and perseverance — will guide my reflection on the novel.
Courage
In the first few pages, Tomura encounters the piano tuner Itadori by chance when the latter tunes the piano in Tomura’s high school. The “scenery of the sound,” which he connects to the forest of his childhood, immediately enraptures him.
While reading the book, I could not help but connect it to many themes in Hermann Hesse’s “Siddhartha,” a novel about spiritual self-discovery. “Seeking means having a goal, but finding means being free, open, having no goal,” says the titular character of Hesse’s novel. Like most of us, Tomura wonders about his purpose and path in life, but what makes him an interesting character is that he is not a seeker, he is a finder. He has the openness and courage to respond to life in whatever way it unfolds, he finds and accepts his calling even though he does not fully understand it — he can’t even play the piano.
Finding your path at Harvard is simultaneously overwhelming and constrained. There are 50 concentrations, 3,700 courses, 450 clubs, and an infinite number of prospective careers to choose from, yet the academic requirements often limit students’ freedom to explore. It is easy to let external factors pressure you into pursuing what you do not truly enjoy — be it following what “everyone else” seems to be doing, what your parents want you to do, or what you think will bring financial stability or status. I studied Government my first year for all three of these reasons before I finally stopped ignoring the adamant voice in my head nudging me toward studying what I truly love: literature.
Resignation
The common denominator of Harvard’s diverse student body is perhaps the infamous impostor syndrome. Many students here feel like they’re not enough in some sort of way — not as eloquent as that person in section, not as talented as that friend who won international competitions, not involved in enough extracurriculars, not good enough to be at Harvard in general.
Tomura struggles with self-doubt throughout the book: He thinks he lacks both technical skill and inherent talent. Even the piano’s forest metaphor takes an intimidating turn: “Many was the time I felt as though I’d set foot in the forest of my childhood nightmares, the one where if you got lost you’d never find your way back, and sometimes the darkness threatened to overwhelm me.” We all fought to be here, but Harvard can often feel like a suffocating, disorienting forest.
What is most paralyzing about self-doubt is the impression that you can’t do anything about it — you either have talent and intelligence or you don’t. “The Forest of Wool and Steel” opens up a redemptive reconception of the meaning of talent. Rather than being a mystic gift over which we are powerless, the book claims that talent “will out if you really love something. It’s a tenacity, a fight in you that keeps you in the fray no matter what.” Thinking of talent as dedication is not just semantic reframing, it gives one agency and something to hold onto. Though Tomura did not grow up playing the piano, devoted practice and his unwavering love for it slowly but surely transform him into an excellent tuner.
Impostor syndrome feeds on comparison and perfectionism. Giving these up is what Tomura’s colleague means by “resignation.” The Harvard environment, the world of classical music, and capitalist America share their glamorization of hustle culture and competition, the winners of which are measured by external factors like status, awards, connections, and wealth.
Tomura is wary of these conventional ideas of success: “Music is there to help us enjoy life, not as a means to outdo everyone else. Even if you do compete and a winner is picked, “the person who enjoys himself the most is always the real winner.” “The Forest of Wool and Steel” convinces one that it is time to redefine what success and “being enough” means to you. For Tomura, it is the quiet joy in music. For me, it is inner peace.
Perseverance
As said, Tomura becomes an excellent piano tuner by the end of the novel. Yet getting there was “a tremendous, dizzying amount of slow and steady,” he thinks. All I have learned and shared here — letting go of perfectionism, comparison, and other people’s ideas of success — is far easier said than done. It is also not a linear process — perseverance means expecting and accepting setbacks. One day, you may sit on the couch with friends and think how perfectly happy you are. Another day, you may leave Lamont Library at 3 a.m. and realize you’ve fallen back into prioritizing work over health. What’s important is that you keep trying.
Compassion
Lastly, to Tomura’s question, I would like to add my own answer: “compassion.” It is easy to be cynical, judgmental, and impatient towards yourself and others. Compassion means celebrating that person who got the internship you didn’t, it means giving yourself breaks and spontaneously going to the movies even though you have a paper due. It means realizing that healing is a forest we are all wandering through side by side, even though the darkness sometimes makes that hard to see.

Winter here is not for the weak. The 25-degree mornings make it even harder to muster up the willpower to get out of bed to study for finals and finish up papers, and half the time, it’s pitch dark by the time you leave the library in the evening. Lucky for you, Boston is absolutely magical in the winter, and a little trip into the city can be the perfect way to take a break from studying, escape the Harvard bubble, and appreciate Boston’s beauty.
See the Boston Common Tree 
The biggest tree lighting in Boston takes place on Dec. 1. While there’s no way to see the lighting without a time machine now, you can still see the tree and all the other holiday lights in Boston Common. And grab hot chocolate at the Frog Pond Cafe on your way back! If nothing else, we guarantee it’s a good photo op.
Go Ice Skating
Boston Common’s Frog Pond transforms into an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter months of November to March, and every Tuesday is College Night, when college students, a.k.a. you, can get half-priced admission. If you’re feeling less ~mainstream~, other public rinks in the area include Kendall Square and The Rink at 401 Park by TimeOut Market. Go forth and pretend you’re an Olympic figure skater.
Sled at Boston Common
The powdery snow has finally begun to come in, and we’re only expecting more of it. Once enough snow has collected, head over to Boston Common with your sled (or dhall tray) because you can take to the slopes at Flagstaff Hill, one of the top sledding destinations in Boston (besides Widener steps, obviously).
Visit The SoWa Holiday Market
This year is the seventh annual SoWa winter fair, a wonderful Winter Wonderland where over a hundred small businesses come together to spread the cheer and sell fun trinkets, handmade goods, and flavorful food. It runs from late November to mid-December, and it’s just $10 at the door. Thayer Street is just a three-minute walk away, with a beautiful light display on the way to food trucks, toasty fire pits, and open art studios. What’s not to love?
Visit Snowport
From Dec. 12th (yesterday!) to Dec. 31st, Seaport’s little holiday market has extended hours, open from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays, and until 9:00 p.m. on the weekends! Snowport features over a hundred little popup stores selling holiday crafts and gifts, as well as a variety of food trucks, including a bar truck for post-exam shenanigans 👀.
Enjoy the Nutcracker 
The Boston Ballet’s The Nutcracker is one of New England’s most adored holiday traditions and a captivating Christmas classic that tells the story of a young girl’s adventure to a magical land on a sparkling Christmas Eve. It is a must-see production to relive the magic of the festive season through the mesmerizing snow scene and the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The season runs from after Thanksgiving to the end of December, so grab your tickets early because you cannot miss the most magical ballet of the season!
Stay at a Cozy Cabin
You deserve a weekend away, and Airbnb has your back with quite a few cabins around Boston. You can get some friends together and create memories that last a lifetime. Having great company, curling up by the fire, relishing comfort food, and enjoying the scenic outdoors sounds like the perfect way to wind down.
This winter, you don’t have to hibernate in your dorm. For those of us who still have a few days left on campus, there are so many ways to embrace the season with outdoor adventures to cherish the chilly weather and indoor activities to get cozy and festive.
