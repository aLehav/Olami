After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Julia Ducournau is OK with people fainting while watching her movies. At the Toronto International Film Festival screening of her first feature film “Raw” (which also screened at the Cannes Critics Circle), several audience members reportedly left in an ambulance. Ducournau’s films uncover the disturbing and the grotesque in everyday, angry womanhood — in the revenge of a recovering woman with bulimia on her high school bully, or a hazed college freshman with cannibalistic tendencies. Her vengeful anti-heroines do not internalize the pain they experience; they externalize it, in bloody, impossible-to-look-away-from fashion.
Ducournau doesn’t aim to scare per se, but to “shake you to the core,” as she told The Independent. And in pursuit of that goal, her second feature film and Palme d’Or contender “Titane” succeeds in every possible way.
“Titane” follows the metamorphosis of Alexia (played by a mesmerizing Agathe Rousselle), who begins as a child with a titanium plate in their head, only to transform into a sex worker, the long-lost son of a fireman, and, on the side, a serial killer. The film’s cocktail of wild yet emotionally-resonant plot twists are half the fun, so this review will refrain from spoiling anything. Suffice it to say, this film includes a fascinating, ambiguous, and gory exploration of gender fluidity, a murder via the leg of a chair, and one of the creepiest renditions of the “Macarena” of all time.
A deliciously-eerie, hyper-stylized visual landscape lends glamour and cohesion to “Titane”’s many shocking twists and turns. Like its trigger-happy protagonist, the film revels in exaggeration; its contrast and saturation are both turned up to the extreme, and many scenes are intentionally shot in brightly-colored, neon hues. A raging orange consumes the frame during a fire; glowing pink bathroom lights expose a litany of self-inflicted violence against the female body. In a similar vein, much of the film’s score is operatic: Baritones bellow over a sex scene with (yes, with) a car, sopranos scream over a tortured birth. “Titane” is a movie that makes more sense emotionally than it does literally, and its dazzling, almost-glamourous style is a key part of the visceral bodily experience it creates for viewers.
However, “Titane” isn’t just much better-looking than your average horror-thriller. Its wild scenes of violence and gore emerge from a subversive refusal to “play nice” with expectations of gender or male violence. Alexia refuses to let anyone touch them in a non-consensual, disrespectful, or derogatory way; most people who dare don’t live very long. The first time they kill someone, it’s a man attempting to rape them as they leave work — an experience that far too many sex workers and gender fluid people share. Alexia doesn’t put up with smaller acts of disrespect, either: they flinch at any unwanted touch, stay silent and refuse to speak or answer questions unless they want to, and drug a man for patting their head in a condescending way.
This year’s Cannes has been saturated in male violence against women. The film industry is rife with sex scenes where the woman says “no” (that then continue, undisturbed) or gets shoved into a wall. Not to advocate for impaling all would-be rapists with hairpins, but it is a breath of fresh air to see someone who doesn’t entertain, “humanize,” or make excuses for violent men.
“Titane” also undertakes a broader-reaching type of social commentary on gender: challenging not just assumptions about how female-bodied people should respond to men, but about what it means to exist in a female body in general. While Alexia’s gender identity is left unclear, the film’s most extreme violence and gore is very clearly directed against the “feminine” parts of their body. (They use painful binding tape that leaves scars across their breasts, try to cut off their pregnant belly, shave their head, and even break their own nose.) All of these are “perversions,” perhaps, of surgeries undergone by real people with assigned-female bodies: top surgery, sterilization, facial masculinization surgery. Whether these scenes of violence are about womanhood, gender dysphoria, or something in between is left up to the viewer; regardless, they create one of cinema’s most visceral representations of fighting your own female-coded body.
With “Titane,” Ducournau doesn’t just venture deeper into the disturbing and grotesque than most directors would dare. Rather, she breaks every possible rule about how to exist in a female body — and creates a glamorous, gory exploration of gender and gender fluidity that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Iranian director Asghar Farhadi is known for his twisty moral dilemmas. In his acclaimed films "A Separation" (2011) and "The Salesman" (2016) — both of which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film — the audience is asked to mediate disputes between divorcing partners or criminal and victim, left without a clear sense of right and wrong. Farhadi intentionally puts his characters into impossible situations, ensuring that no one can emerge entirely innocent. His latest Cannes entry, “The Hero,” takes that task to the extreme, creating Farhadi’s most elaborate and least realistic maze of impossible choices to date.
“The Hero” follows the winding misadventures of Rahim (Amir Jadidi), a man serving time in a debtor’s prison, desperate to get out to be with his new love Farkhondeh (Sahar Goldust) and take care of his son (Saleh Karimai). The “crime” that led to Rahim’s imprisonment is just one of the film’s many carefully-calibrated games of moral responsibility. Rahim borrowed money from a loan shark to fund his new business, his business partner took off with the money, he asked his then-wife’s father to help bail him out, he and his wife separated, and now he has an angry father-in-law that he can’t repay.
From Rahim’s perspective, he was cheated by a capricious business partner, but from the father-in-law Braham’s (Mohsen Tanabandeh) perspective, Rahim bears ultimate responsibility because he lied about using a loan shark. The disagreements between the two men grow increasingly intransigent when Farkhondeh finds a bag of gold left near a subway stop. Farkhondeh encourages Rahim to sell the gold, but when he finds out that the money isn’t enough to repay his debt, Rahim decides to give into his guilty conscience and track down the bag’s owner. He’s turned into a “hero” for the good deed, splashed across national television and interviewed in newspapers. But due to a mixture of Braham’s determination to bring Rahim down and Rahim’s series of white lies about exactly how and when he found the lost bag, people begin to doubt Rahim’s story, and his hope to return to his family starts to unravel.
Farhadi orchestrates his moral quandaries with impressive precision, constantly forcing his characters to make perfectly-rational choices that are just “wrong” enough to get them into trouble later. Similarly, his thoughtfulness and control are on full display with the film’s sound design, as Farhadi often opts to “turn down” conversation and dialogue and highlight outside noise — the sound of a video game, or the roar of buses on a passing street.
From an abstract perspective, Farhadi has created a near-perfect moral conundrum. It’s hard for the audience to pinpoint a moment at which protagonist Rahim could have made a different choice, and Jadidi’s charismatic and desperate portrayal ensures the ill-fated protagonist remains sympathetic. On the other hand, the cast of opponents determined to discredit him also seem justified in their concern over a story that looks very dubious from the outside.
For audiences looking for a thought-provoking ideological experiment about the malleability of truth, innocence, and morality, Farhadi has certainly delivered. However, in the intricate chess-game of “The Hero,” the director’s presence also seems almost too-visible, leaving each ensuing curveball thrown at Rahim feeling somewhat heavy-handed and contrived. Farhadi’s strength is that he knows how to make audiences uneasy, to force them to face the inherent complexity of separating “right” from “wrong.” But in that complexity, there is also a lack of authenticity and emotional depth, leaving “The Hero” to feel more like an ideological experiment than a real-life story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Eighty is a popstar!” reads the bandcamp bio of singer-songwriter 8485, aka “Eighty.” Though she has yet to release a full album, the self-proclaimed pop star has been busy. She released her first track a mere 18 months ago and quickly joined the collective Helix Tears — a growing group of rappers, singers, and producers who make music at the cutting edge of hyperpop and glitchcore. This year, Eighty has collaborated with producer and fellow Helix Tears member blackwinterwells to release two EPs: “tracing paths” in January and, on April 14, “plague town.”
When the pandemic first hit, many corners of the internet groaned (often self-deprecatingly) about all the trite and overwrought quarantine EPs to come. Despite its pointed title, “plague town” fires on too many levels to remain confined to the time in which it was created: Channeling 8485’s hyperpop sensibilities into an innovative yet radio-ready sound, the EP speaks to the vivid nostalgia and entrapment of suburban youth, the entangled anxiety and resignation provoked by inevitable disaster, and the ever-present struggle for love and connection in the digital age.
The opening song, “hangar,” feels like it was made for driving listlessly around your hometown with the windows down. “This place is suffocating; I’ll still be here in five years / Where I made every mistake, sixteen trying to disappear,” Eighty sings over a pulsing beat, imbuing the cyclical feeling of geographical and emotional stasis with a burning momentum. On the second track, “purgatory,” Eighty slows down and transfers this sense of stasis into the context of an ending relationship. Where “hangar” bursts with all the energy and urgency of the struggle to escape, “purgatory” is a sonic wallow through a thick, warm fog. “I’ll be right here / When you’re leaving,” Eighty sings lethargically, creating a heart wrenching double meaning: I’ll be emotionally present for you; I’ll be left behind.
In “plague town,” relationships appear as desperate attempts to see — and thereby define — one another in a dehumanizing and constantly-shifting landscape. Eighty’s current profile picture on many streaming platforms and social media is itself a picture of her face on a computer screen, already flattened to two dimensions and partially obscured by a reflected light; the extra layer of separation between her and her audience draws attention to the gap that exists between us all. This preoccupation drives the EP’s middle track, “seer.” Eighty sings: “I give all I am, I’m a hologram / But as long as you’ll have me I’ll stay / But I can't see you the way I mean to / You're pixelated, baby, come just a little closer to the barricade.” This desperate struggle toward connection is set against an apocalyptic backdrop. Amid imagery that speaks to rising sea levels, Eighty sings with the eerie nonchalance of someone who knows she’s doomed anyways: “I think the world’s gonna end; I wish someone would say when / ‘Cause I would run to you then; I don’t think I’d complain.”
“Seer” leaves listeners with a nagging question, which Eighty tackles on “pure” and “southview”: If straining toward intimacy won’t save us, can it at least offer meaning? On “pure,” a track with minimal instrumentals that allow her vocals plenty of room to breathe, Eighty faces the impossibility of ever completely bridging the gap between two people. “I’m better on my own / ‘Cause I know what I’m like on the inside,” she sings — but if we believe for a second this is an emotional triumph, she quickly sets us straight: “I should know the way I can make it right. / But I don’t and I’m warm and terrified.” Together or alone, there is no winning. Yet with lines like “There was a time once, I thought I could be like you” and “I don’t like what is left of me,” Eighty finds something worth elegizing: the parts of the self that are lost with an ending relationship.
This sets the stage for the last track of the record, “southview,” which portrays this discontinuity of self as both a blessing and a curse. “I don’t have any friends from when I was a kid and I’m so glad,” Eighty sings, leading into the main refrain of the song: “I haven’t seen anybody I’ve known for a long time / In a long time.” These lines capture the relief of being free of the past iterations of yourself, with nobody left to see you as a continuation of the person you once were. However, at the peak of a building crescendo, Eighty reveals the loss within this freedom in the song’s — and the EP’s — final, mournful lines: “I’ll never see me through your eyes again; it hurts too much.”
In an October 2020 interview with Underground Underdogs, Eighty noted: “One of the overall themes I see in our scene is, ‘How do real people exist in this very futuristic space?’” Sonically catchy and thematically intricate, “plague town” is an identity crisis of an EP perfect for the past year and the present moment. It’s a record for the private apocalypses that take place in our childhood bedrooms and in the blue glow of our computer screens. It’s a record for real people living in an image-driven world where the ability to see and be seen as we desire is our best approximation of intimacy.
