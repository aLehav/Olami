Dancers often describe their inspiration or motivation behind a piece, but rarely does dance have the capability to tell a story explicitly. Shantala Shivalingappa, however, combines movement with narrative in her performance of Kuchipudi, a classic South Indian dance style. This weekend, she performed “Akasha,” her first show in Boston, at the Institute of Contemporary Art.
Kuchipudi is characterized by its narrative style and accompanying music—an orchestra composed of vocals, flute, veena (a plucked string instrument), and percussion. The dance form has two components: pure dance (which is abstract) and expressive dance (which is focused on the story being told). Shivalingappa, who has trained extensively in Kuchipudi since childhood, also adds her own choreographic marks on the traditional dance form. “A classical form like Kuchipudi is alive today because it has the capacity to expand itself. It’s very porous to a lot of influences,” she says.
The performance at the ICA was entitled “Akasha,” meaning space. In general, Shivalingappa uses the titles of her shows as a starting point for composing the pieces; in particular, this collection of dances focused on finding a space that goes beyond what an individual experiences daily. “When the heart is really open, when your spirit is open—and dance and music can really do that—then you have a different experience of life and you can see a different kind of flow of energy,” she says. The performance featured five dances on topics ranging from a fight between Goddess Alamelu Manga and her husband God Venkateshwara to a story of the Supreme God Krishna as a child.
While advertised as a dance performance, “Akasha” was a fusion between dance and music. Focus shifted between the musicians and Shivalingappa. “The dance and the music are really inseparable,” she says.  For example, each piece began with the stage in darkness and a spotlight on the musicians; these instrument-heavy performances would last for minutes before Shivalingappa appeared. Afterwards, the music acted as a background to the dancing. While the melodies of the different pieces were repetitive, the combination of dance and music provided constant entertainment throughout the show. “It’s like the dancer is making music with her body and the musicians are dancing with their music,” Shivalingappa says.
Shivalingappa’s dance was multifaceted; at any instant, her dress, facial expressions, hand motions, and movement across the stage contributed to the performance’s effect. One piece opened with just Shivalingappa’s hands illuminated in shadow; the movement of each finger was as absorbing as if she were dancing across the stage. Her facial expressions, which could convey anger, humor or elation, helped guide the plot of the dances. In one piece, she riveted the audience by dancing on top of a brass plate held in place between her toes. “We use body language, rhythm, hand gestures, and facial expressions to bring alive characters and stories,” Shivalgingappa says.
While Kuchipudi has existed for centuries and has a specific style, there are ways for experienced dancers to implement individuality into their pieces. And it is this potential for artistic liberty which ultimately characterizes this weekend’s performance of “Akasha.” “What’s amazing is that over time you realize and you experience that the deeper you go into that form and the more you master it, it gives you enormous freedom” Shivalingappa says.

On a Friday night in Sanders Theatre, Christian McBride was wearing the widest grin in the room. He was not responding to applause or even playing the weathered, deep-voiced bass with which he has carved out a unique place in the 21st century jazz pantheon. With the bass propped silently on his shoulder, he was enjoying a solo from his drummer, Ulysses Owens Jr. McBride, Owens, and Christian Sands on piano traded chorus-long solos during the encore to an enrapturing hour-long set, and on this particular chorus Owens was playing nothing but a long snare roll, teasing a novel expressiveness from the sound. Following him, Sands humorously imitated Owens’s solo with a deep rumble from the piano’s low register, a slow crescendo which bloomed into vibrant harmony. McBride, still grinning, unsheathed the bow to his bass and followed with a tremolo rumble of his own as the audience erupted into laughter. The entire performance was filled with moments of ingenuity, expressiveness and joy such as these, during an evening that provided a lighthearted look at the strongly beating heart of jazz.
The evening began with a vocal jazz performance from Cécile McLorin Salvant, a delightful singer with a unique poise, almost reminiscent of Monk. A casual, precise use of discord—manifesting itself in anything from a verse bending the slightest bit off-pitch to a short rhythmic disconnect with the backing band—gave the performance a persistent freshness. Salvant also performed with disarming honesty, which showed even in song choice, as she explained that she had often found herself in the situations described in “I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate” and “The Stepsisters’ Lament” from “Cinderella.” Alongside standards and showtunes, Salvant performed some originals, which were characterized by a certain mystery.  For instance, her epic composition “Fog” alternated between moments of near silence and slow, relentless crescendos as her backing band followed that trajectory with shimmering arpeggios. The band, while playing with a technical precision that bordered on stiffness, provided an environment with ample space for the singer’s remarkable vocal acrobatics.
McBride did not hesitate to heap praise on Salvant. He lamented the challenges of following such an expressive vocal act with three instruments often relegated to the rhythm section behind a horn-playing soloist. The trio didn’t have much trouble overcoming that hurdle, however. The set kicked into gear with a fresh rendition of the classic “Down By the Riverside” as Sands tweaked the song’s melody to create a more spunky rhythm, and the band settled into a lively groove.
McBride, who has recorded and performed with the likes of Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Rollins, Herbie Hancock, James Brown, and Sting, is, of course, the superstar of the group. But while both Sands and Owens are significantly younger than McBride and possess less absurdly stacked resumes, neither man seems like a protégé. This trio is comprised of three equals, each with just as much to say as the next. The only way McBride dominated the performance was through his role as a kind of master of ceremonies for the set, introducing each arrangement as the band played it.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the performance was Owen’s soft, precise touch on the drums. In a performance that at one point saw him tapping the snare drums with his hands—no sticks necessary—with his head cocked back and closed eyes, heprovided a dynamic, expressive groundwork to every piece the group performed. During one drum solo, it seemed that Owens had everyone in the theater so engrossed that he had to remind McBride and Sands to re-enter at the right time, smiling and nodding to the two as his eyes opened and he emerged from his percussive reverie.
McBride’s trio began the performance with the intent (announced by McBride) to “bring some Roxbury to Cambridge”—in other words, to express the kind of soulful joy that brought them to their instruments in the first place. The program included such joys as Michael Jackson’s “The Lady in My Life” and the theme to the 1972 movie “Car Wash,” highlighting jazz’s close relationship with pop culture. While they are as technically impressive as any group performing today, what really defines McBride’s trio is its tenacious placement of pure, accessible love and joy in a genre that is often gleefully esoteric.

Starting from Friday, Feb. 27, the 17th Annual Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival, presented by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, will celebrate the creativity of black arts with its wide spectrum of art forms and traditions. Unlike previous years, when the Black Arts Festival was a weekend festival, this year the festival will run as a week-long event with an extensive visual arts component.
The festival immerses participants in the celebration of the history and traditions of the black arts and opens up the conversation to challenging notions of blackness, art, and freedom. “It became clear that the Black Arts Festival...would celebrate the history and traditions of a life-force—the arts—that has sustained America’s most maligned people,” says Phillip Atiba Goff, founder of the festival. The Kuumba Singers puts on performances throughout the year, but the Black Arts Festival distinguishes itself from these show in the sense that it reaches further in terms of community outreach. “Extending Black Arts Festival was a direct result of people needing spaces that validate their existence in the way Black Arts Festival has done and will continue to do,” says Cecilia B. Sanders ’16, Black Arts Festival co-chair.
The entire week features performances, creative workshops, academic panel discussions, and other activities. Sanders believes that the biggest challenge in preparing the festival is legacy. “The Black Arts Festival has a long history: 17 years of celebrating black art, the politics of black art, the diversity of black art, the history of black art,” she says. “The Black Arts Festival has this larger purpose that we have been very conscious of since we started planning last summer. That is an honor, but it has also been a lot of pressure.”
To continue this legacy, the festival seeks to not only exhibit but also analyze the works and performances featured. “Not only does the festival highlight the rich history of black art and music, but it also investigates what the future of black art could be. The festival creates an environment for black artists from different backgrounds to come together to create and share ideas,” Sanders says. Black Arts Festival Co-Chair, Cherline Bazile ’17 agrees: the purpose of the festival is to generate dynamic dialogue about the different conceptions of blackness and the meaning of freedom to the black community. “I would like for people to think about freedom more critically,” she says. “Not as something that is all good or as the solution to everyone’s problems—not as something that was given during the Civil Rights movement but as something that encompasses a reconciliation of how individual black people see themselves and how they are perceived.”
Taking on a revolutionary form this year, the Black Arts Festival is more than a festival for entertainment. It is an unique experience that invites its participants to immerse themselves in the nature of black art and bound to be exciting and intellectually stimulating.

Kanye West’s first song off his still-untitled upcoming album, “Wolves,” describes a settled new phase in his career and life. Since his last album, “Yeezus,” West has become a father and a husband. On “Wolves,” which West first exposed as part of his recent Adidas fashion show, he reflects on his wild past in a somber and introspective way. The track, which features the prolific songwriter and ethereal singer Sia and fellow Chicago rapper Vic Mensa, is haunting and calm but lacks the fire that West has displayed in recent projects. While the song effectively showcases West’s emotional state, it is anticlimactic and overly autotuned.
Notably missing from this track is any rapping. Instead, Kanye sings, though that might be a charitable term. Like the last time he sang in large quantities, on 2008 album “808s & Heartbreak,” “Wolves” is heavily autotuned. This album was widely considered his weakest, and though Kanye has occasionally used autotune subtly and effectively on album tracks since, his overreliance in 2015 is becoming bizarre, and is reminiscent of the dreary 808s. Even artists like T-Pain, whose rise was based around the unique sound he created using autotune, have at least partially forsaken the effect for more natural vocals. One might expect Kanye to use the tool in novel ways, but instead he employs his modulation in the same cloaking manner as those who initially popularized the sound. It is cliché and one wonders what could be so awful about Kanye’s singing voice that he feels the need to coat it in so many layers of production. If natural singing isn’t West’s thing, perhaps he should stick to rapping.
Vic Mensa and Sia make Kanye’s lack of singing ability more apparent by outperforming him on his own song. Mensa is the strongest part of this track, offering genuinely beautiful vocals that show off his smooth, R&B tenor. Sia, one of the most unique pop stars on the scene right now, imbues her first chorus with bursts of palpable sadness that West should aspire to. The second time around, however, Sia’s tone is inconsistent and her voice sounds somewhat strained.
Despite the vocal inconsistencies on “Wolves,” its themes are touching. Kanye mentions his late mother, pondering “if your mama/ knew now”, a show of vulnerability from an often impenetrable artist. The song is packed with genuine emotional moments in which the artists look back on hard times that contributed to their present success. West employs powerful imagery, including an Icarus allusion (“Don’t fly too high / your wings might melt”). Even these sentiments, however, are weighed down by the impersonality of the vocals. The ethereal “oohs” that begin the song are chilling but never develop into a more complex scheme. The instrumental backing sounds like an intro about to build into something more intense. There is a point in Kanye’s verse where a bass-heavy drop appears imminent, but the accompaniment disappointingly goes back to the same minimalist pattern.
In his seeming attempts to craft a more melodic sound and a more vulnerable persona, West loses his typical kinetic wordplay and dynamic production. Further, his recent sexist remarks about Amber Rose and creepy exclamations about the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan make it clear that Kanye’s maturity is illusory. “Wolves” is a lackluster step towards predictability and inauthenticity for the usually versatile MC.

Freshmen, congratulations on making it out of the Blocking Games alive.
For some, logging onto the Residential Portal yesterday was a mere formality for something you’ve had since before Thanksgiving. For others, it might have been a battle with the self, bloody with tensions between your friends and yourself.
Right around this time of year, our campus is abuzz with conversations about something a bit different from the usual. A sociological study of blocking could produce journals full of academic hits on more complex themes such as race, socioeconomics, and much more. But the quick and dirty summary of our conversations at this time of the year is that they are actually about some of the most basic questions of living: Who will we live with, and where?
This is not to disregard that we are still taking the prospect of having a roof over our heads for granted. But it’s not everyday that we are so worried and so insecure about our choices behind a fundamental human need. Isn’t Harvard supposed to be the padding that makes us numb to worrying about “life things” like tidying our bathroom or preparing our dinner, so that we can aspire to bigger and better things?
Harvard students are liberal at the head but not the heart. As we fly to China to teach kids at the end of the summer and organize conferences on social innovation, we are innovators and problem solvers for the public good. The beneficiaries of our empathy are often as far away as the protesters in Hong Kong but never closer than the kids in Somerville.
There is no doubt that this is all good work. When we pride ourselves on alumni that have changed the world, this is what we’re talking about. But do we do this at the expense of empathy due to those directly around us?
I can count on one hand the number of times that I’ve set aside a slot on my Google Calendar to attend my blockmate’s things. On the other, I can count the number of sentences that I exchange with my roommate when I come back to the room after a long day, on nights that we don’t eat together. Although I can’t tell you for sure, maybe I can make an educated guess at my roommates’ mental and psychological well-beings?
This has been said time and time again, only to have all the Facebook likes fall to complete silence after a couple of days. I’ve said it too, although I am clearly guilty of the accusations myself.
This is why all the vulnerability and buzz surrounding blocking sometimes excites me. At least for a couple of weeks, it brings our attention from far, far away back down to the local sphere.
This shows me that we are capable of having both the mental bandwidth and the emotional quotient to build good neighborhoods on campus. I love my community in Winthrop—a special shout-out to our amazing junior class is mandatory here—but in a campus so full of loneliness and anxieties both light and dark, we could be doing so much more for each other.
This starts with making efforts to build emotional and mental homes for each other, starting with your blockmates or roommates but hopefully for your house at large too. A lot of it comes down to investment of time at the end of the day, but it’s also dependent on the disposition that informs your daily actions. Offer some tea to the rest of your suitemates while making some for yourself in the common room. Strike up a conversation in the servery. Ask the grill staff about their kids.
The beauty of blocking or rooming groups, among their many inconveniences, is that it allows for structure in which we can start performing a lot of these actions.
I’ve sucked at all of this too, but I’ve been trying to remind myself again and again: We’re all works in progress.
See you on Housing Day. I hope you’re all good neighbors.
Jenny J. Choi ’16, is a social studies concentrator in Winthrop House. Her column appears on alternate Thursdays.

Words matter, at least according to Harvard’s Undergraduate Council.
On Monday, the Undergraduate Council officially changed the name of what was formerly its HeForShe campaign. The movement, now called “Side by Side,” is modeled after the United Nations' HeForShe campaign, a “solidarity movement for gender equality” that urges men to stand up for women’s rights not simply as passive allies but also as active participants. The UC name change comes in the wake of student and administrative concerns that the “HeForShe” name suggested a binary of men and women, leaving out trans students and others who do not identify either as males or as females.
The UC was right to adapt its program terminology to ensure that every student at the College feels recognized and welcome—the gender equality movement needs full support from all corners of campus, particularly since its ultimate aim strives for inclusivity that promotes overall equality in classes, clubs, and Harvard’s general climate. But actions can mean just as much as, if not more than, words. And though the UC campaign is impressive in its scale and organization, it may fall short when it comes to results. Making organizations go through what seems to be a purely logistical process will not help progress the aims of the campaign; actions are needed. This is a first step, not a final stride.
The Side by Side campaign centers largely on requesting pledges from student groups. These pledges do provide a platform for conversation, but beyond that, there is no guarantee of real change. Many groups may neglect to submit the paragraphs the UC requires, and others who do may never find the time or energy to follow up on their promises. The Side by Side campaign’s success hinges on the good will of the student body—though most groups believe in gender equality in principle, the noblest goals often go unachieved in the daily flood of Harvard students' hectic social, academic, and extracurricular obligations.
The Side by Side campaign, then, needs more teeth to succeed. It needs to seek mandated discussions between Harvard-recognized student groups, freshman orientation trainings, and House-wide conversations. At the very least, it needs to ask groups for updates on their pledges, and to push for progress where it has stalled. And in its ideal form, it needs to bleed into every facet of student life.
Gender equality and inclusivity sit somewhere in the back of many students’ minds, garnering support in theory but not necessarily in practice. Perhaps for some, it might seem like there are other things to worry about, other hot-button issues that race to the forefront of campus discourse (and then quickly recede in favor of something new). There are other, niche movements that inspire some students on a more personal level. The UC’s campaign tries to fix the problem and to rally Harvard behind a unifying goal. They have the words. Now they need to make people listen.

Can science research and the government be best friends? The Obama Administration sure thinks so.
On Friday, January 30th the White House released its plans for Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative, a $215 million effort to propel researchers to develop new, more personal methods to treat patients.  This venture is Obama’s second major health science initiative, after announcing the Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (or the BRAIN initiative) in April 2013.
If realized, the Personal Medicine Initiative has the potential to be as revolutionary as was the mapping of the human genome more than a decade ago, and for this reason, such a decision should be highly applauded.
At the core of precision medicine, an ongoing area of research, is the belief that there are no one-size-fits-all treatments or medications. A treatment approach that heavily relies on the data from personalized genomics, Obama argues, would better treat patients. “The potential for precision medicine to improve care and speed the development of new treatments has only just begun to be tapped,” the White House noted. “Translating initial successes to a larger scale will require a coordinated and sustained national effort.”
The $215 million dollars are meant to be spent helping the National Institutes of Health to develop a one million volunteer research cohort for “open, responsible data sharing” that will serve as the backbone for this project, help the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of National Coordination for Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health to advance database structure, coordination, and privacy, and aid the National Cancer Institute in delving deeper into personalized genomics.
Some skeptics, like Dr. Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic, have argued that the precision medicine effort is misleading–stating that it is perhaps better to spend this money “understanding what it takes to solve messy problems about how humans behave” because “we almost certainly have more control over how much we exercise, eat, drink and smoke than we do over our genomes.” And though this statement is true–we are not the masters of our genetic destinies–it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t spend our resources trying to understand our diseases through a personalized, genetic approach.
Government investment in science is a duty; societal advances depend a lot on the course of research, innovation, and technology. As Obama mentioned, the CDC’s polio eradication efforts allowed the U.S. to be polio free by 1979. Having a government that recognizes the importance of scientific and health endeavors is crucial to our future health. The memories of the 2013 budget cuts that NIH faced and the 16-day government shutdown that October which led 75% of the NIH workforce to put its work on pause demonstrates the negative consequences of governmental budget cuts to science research.  If anything, the $215 million initiative reaffirms America’s dedication to science. Furthermore, during an increasingly difficult time of cooperation between the Democrats and Republicans, having bipartisan support for something like the Personalized Medicine Initiative is highly valuable for the country.
The important thing to keep in mind here is that without looking, we don’t really know what we are missing out on. The personalized genomics approach may well end up proving to be an extremely difficult and resource consuming path to go down, but, if executed properly, it should prove to be a worthwhile investment.

Harvard students collectively mourned the move of the Dunkin’ Donuts at Bow Street and Mass Ave. But never fear: This is an opportunity to step out of our corporate comfort zone and into the world of real, bakery-fresh, down-home lovin’ donuts. I spent a week searching all ends of the globe—or rather, from Belmont to South Boston—to create a comprehensive list of the best spots to pig out on fried dough (in no particular order). It’s okay if you only eat one per day, right?
Chauhaus at the GSD | Cambridge
“Wait, I can buy donuts using Board-Plus? And they taste good?” Yep, you read that right. Chauhaus serves up surprisingly delicious donuts, placed inconspicuously at the end of their salad bar. I try the standard vanilla cake with glaze, but there’s nothing standard about it. The donut is thick and cakey, falling apart with crumbly satisfaction and tasting like something the professionals have made.
Union Square Donuts | Somerville
I don’t even have to travel to Somerville, where Union Square has its two iconic loca-tions, because, like most Harvard students, I am well-acquainted with their booth at the Fall Farmers’ Market. Ten minutes before the market even opens, students start hovering around the creative donut station, and it doesn’t take long for the line to stretch completely outside of the tent. Last fall, I had their most famous pick: chocolate frosting with bacon on top. There was definitely a clash of flavors, something I’m not a huge fan of, but many seem to enjoy the sweet/salty combination. After all, what’s more basic than combining two of America’s favorite foods? I can hear the hashtags now.
Doughboy | South End
Looking more like a fast food restaurant than a bakery, Doughboy is filled with workmen from the enormous T station across the street, wearing neon jackets and talking loudly in thick Boston accents. It’s clearly an old South End stronghold. Most of their donuts adhere to the light and fluffy variety, but the frosted chocolate I have is much thicker. It is excellent, but quite similar to the Chauhaus donut. If you’re in the mood for some good donuts and a real Boston experience, go to Doughboy. If not, the trek to the GSD is much more manageable.
Ohlin’s Bakery | Belmont
These next two spots also require some extra distance, but the 13-minute bus ride is well worth it. Ohlin’s, recently given the Boston Globe’s award for best donuts, is your classic tiny bakery, brightly lit and packed with an overwhelming array of things in addition to their creative donut list (pumpkin, butter crunch, and strawberry frosted honey to name a few). I order the only donut left at my 4 p.m. arrival time, a fluffy one stuffed with blueberry jam, and am not disappointed. Although I usually prefer cake donuts (which they also sell), the blueberry jam is perfect—not too sweet and containing lumps of real blue-berries.
Linda’s Donuts | Belmont
Dedicated to donuts and greasy sandwiches, Linda’s is a local favorite. Just like with Ohlin’s, make sure you arrive early in the morning if you want their full range of pastries. Even though I only get to try the plain and the chocolate cruller, it is enough. The plain donut tastes better than the most fanciful creation Dunkin’ Donuts could dream up. I never knew regular dough could taste so good. The chocolate cruller, my personal favorite, has the same dough but is topped with a thick layer chocolate frosting and stuffed with strawberry jam. This is no breakfast (or midday snack) meant for the faint of heart.

Korean and English syllables mingled in the air, bearing solemn memories of hardship at times and signalling hope for change at others. The overall mood in Ticknor Lounge was light and conversational, but the evening’s subject was serious: life in, and escape from, North Korea.
The event, “North Korea Information Highway: Driving Change in North Korea,” featured three defectors from North Korea, a country that many argue has an oppressive government. The student organization Harvard Human Rights in North Korea co-hosted the event with a Korean human rights group, Woorihana: Youth for Change in North Korea. The event started with a speech from all three guests, continued with a question and answer session, and concluded with a reception.


An audience of over 50 students listened to Eun-ju Kim’s story of hardship and escape. She described her experience witnessing public executions and her father’s death from starvation. Kim defected twice, first to China and then to South Korea.
“I usually say I had a difficult life through China to South Korea,” she said in an interview after the event. “However, my story is one of the normal stories...I mean, yeah, there are extremely good cases and there are some extremely bad cases, but my case was normal.”
Gwang Seong Jung was the next defector to speak. Jung approached his speech with a little levity. “In North Korea, they teach you to hate America, and so we don’t learn English. But we think Russian is very important,” he said with a good-natured chuckle.
Jung also recalled his excitement when he first arrived in the airport in Seoul, South Korea—his parents had arranged his escape through a broker. “I thought it was heaven,” he said.
The third and final speaker, Se Jun Park, a middle-aged doctor who now resides in South Korea, spoke about his education in North Korea during a question and answer session after the event. “After graduating from high school, I went to the military and my mind was set,” he said. “I was going to fight the U.S. And, who knows, maybe one day I could have fought you.... [But] once I left North Korea...my perceptions [had] really changed. And I realized how the government educated us and brainwashed us.”
In his speech, he claimed that there are two sorts of poverty at work in North Korea as a result of the government. The first follows the more conventional definition of economic hardship and starvation. The second is what he calls “intellectual poverty,” which stems from North Korea’s isolation from the outside world. Park outlined his initiative to smuggle USB drives loaded with media content into North Korea in order to alleviate intellectual poverty.
Park fixated on the North Korean fascination with South Korean pop culture. He emphasized that he often loads USB drives loaded with South Korean soaps and movies.
During an interview later in the evening, Park said through a translator that one of his primary intentions was to stimulate “cultural connections.” His organization also adds books, newspapers, and texts promoting free-market economics to the USB drives.
During the reception, Kim prepared Korean treats. She also spoke about the importance of personal stories. “People know North Korea has no human rights, people know they don’t have enough food. But they don’t know what that means. We need to let people know exactly what’s happening through our own stories.”
Kim hoped that the stories shared that night might inspire some to engage in activism in Korea. “We cannot expect the whole audience after hearing our story to be [involved] in the activities of human rights in North Korea,” Kim said. “We cannot expect that....If there is one [person moved by this event], I believe it is a success. One can be 10 later.”
Park sought input from the audience about how smugglers might counteract anti-American propaganda in North Korea. “What kind of content or what kind of media do you think that we could show North Koreans [so that they can] understand...American people?” he asked.
An audience member recommended old sitcoms like “The Brady Bunch.”

Here at FM, we love the old favorites—Felipe’s, Noch’s, Tasty Burger—as much as you do. However, they can get a little boring after eating there 600 times. But they’re cheap, dependable, and familiar, like that hoodie you still have from high school and wear around your dorm room. So we asked Dana Ferrante ’17 and Caroline Gentile ’17, editors of the Harvard-based food blog, The Crimson Crave, to help us find some of the Square’s hidden treasures. With their help, Harvard students just might unleash their inner foodies.
Best Appetizer: Datiles(Orinoco, $7.50)
Crimson Crave Tip #1: Be adventurous, and don’t be afraid to check out hole-in-the-wall joints.
“My philosophy about food: If it’s down an alley-way, it’s probably really good!” Ferrante says. Orinoco fits this description perfectly: It’s tucked away at the end of a narrow gap between Boston Tea Stop and an eyeglass store. The inside is dark and intimate, and its menu has a Pablo Neruda poem on the back. Crimson Crave, which has profiled Orinoco before, recommends the joint for dates, romantic and culinary alike.
The datiles, or bacon-wrapped dates, are savory sweet and unfairly good. The bacon lends a salty smoothness to the gooey dates inside, with more flavor in one bite than in several weeks of HUDS food. $7.50 for four of these heavenly morsels, though, is a little pricey on a college budget. To get around the expense, Ferrante and Gentile recommend coming here with a group and ordering three or four tapas as appetizers.
Best Burger: Double Guinness Burger(Charlie’s Kitchen, $9.50)


Charlie’s is a Harvard Square landmark: As famous as the John Harvard statue, and nearly as old. The place is a genuine dive: Scuffed tables, mismatched Tiffany lamps, and the requisite jukebox. Its patrons tend to be bespectacled grad students trying very hard to look badass in the dim neon light.
Charlie’s also highlights one of Crimson Crave’s pet peeves: polarized Yelp reviews. “Yelp’s like reading the Q guide,” says Ferrante. “You shouldn’t pay attention to anyone who gives a completely amazing or completely terrible review.” When coming up with the initial idea for Crimson Crave last spring, she and Gentile wanted to focus on constructive criticism, commenting on restaurants’ high points while suggesting areas for improvement.Not that Charlie’s needs any such suggestions. The Guinness, juicy with grilled onions and served in a sesame bun, is beauty in simplicity: No frills — just a whole lot of old-fashioned burger.
Best Vegetarian Cuisine: Venezuelan Plantain Sandwich(Clover, $6.00)


Having debated Clover’s merits before, we’re a little hesitant to return for more all-organic “start-up” grub. The Crimson Crave folks, though, have vouched for Clover’s new plantain sandwich, although I had to ask them to define “plantain.” Turns out, it’s a small banana—you learn something new at Harvard every day! We place the order, and ask for some water. “Slick,” the cashier nods, and points to a trio of gleaming taps. “We’ve got CO2 sparkling, 42F chilled, and 64F room temp.” Please stop talking.
The plantain-wich, though, is delicious: Its fried plantain slices, packed into a pita pocket alongside black bean salsa and tangy vegetables, are fresh and crispy. For a place with all the warmth and personality of an Apple Store, Clover seems to be stepping up its culinary game.little pricier than your average Tasty Burger offering, but the premium is worth it to get your hands on this big boy.
Best Beverage: Spicy Monkey Smoothie(O2 Yoga Vegan Cafe, $5.95)


Crimson Crave Tip #2: Keep an open mind. “I like to wander,” Gentile tells us. “I walk around the city, and if I see a place that catches my eye, I’ll go in and try it.” But if we hadn’t been looking out for O2, we might have missed it altogether—it’s actually a yoga studio with a café attached.
Once we walk in, things get weird quickly. We’re definitely not flexible enough—or wearing enough tie-dye and Lululemon—to blend in with O2’s patrons, who are seated on floor mats. Even Crimson Crave’s recommended smoothie, the Spicy Monkey, is a surprise: It’s a blend of chocolate, peanut butter, and banana, but with an unexpected zing of cayenne pepper that makes our eyes water. After a couple slurps, though, we start to appreciate its mix of spicy and sweet—just as a lady walks in with a miniature pig on a leash. Keep an open mind, we keep telling ourselves. It works, sort of.
Best Dessert: Macaroons(Darwin’s Ltd, $4.95 for 3)


We end our odyssey at Darwin’s, a cozy café next door to Planet Records, whose hipster soundtrack seems to be bleeding through the walls. It’s off the beaten path from the hustle and bustle of the Square, and has a peaceful vibe to match. Ferrante heard about the cafe from a friend’s glowing review. “[F]ood is definitely a word-of-mouth kind of thing,” she tells me. “It needs to be described to me; it needs to be an experience.”
The macaroons are incredibly rich, filled with creamy marzipan inside and smothered with powdered sugar. Darwin’s has a wide selection: We had chocolate, lemon, and coconut, but there are flavors for every color of the rainbow. As it turns out, Harvard students have just as many options when exploring the Square’s wealth of culinary options. Be adventurous, keep an open mind, and make that perfect meal.

From Michael Bloomberg to Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates to Al Gore ’69, past Harvard Commencement speakers have left quite the shoes to fill. This year, on May 28, former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will stand up to the challenge. In the past, Patrick has remarked about social media, generational differences, and citizenship. The subject of this year’s speech is unknown to the public, and the suspense is killing us. In the meantime, we drew up a few ideas of our own.
Dwelling in Post Graduation Blues
Most of us will probably be sad to graduate. All in all, Harvard is a great experience. If you’ve done it right, you’ve lost it in the stacks, written some mediocre papers, and built up your alcohol tolerance. Now all that is over, and it’s time to say goodbye. But there’s nothing wrong with getting a little nostalgic in a graduation speech. Why not relive our time at Harvard through the words of our speaker?
Celebrating Things Left Behind
On the other hand, Commencement is a time to celebrate. Now that you’re Harvard graduates and bound for Wall Street, HUDS food, communal bathrooms, and final exams are a thing of the past. It might be nice if Patrick reminded us of all the reasons Harvard isn’t so great—think a monologue on problem sets, bomb threats, and snow storms. That way we won’t be sad when we get those diplomas.
The Practical Speech
In some ways, graduation is intimidating. You have to update your resumes, find a pet to keep you company, and operate not on Harvard time. Imagine cleaning your own toilet and making your own food. There’s no Dorm Crew in the real world, guys. How will you manage? FM knows how. Patrick should teach us everything we’ll need to know in his speech. The former governor can do his taxes (at least, he sure knows how to spend ours), so why shouldn’t he let us in on the secret during Commencement? That way, we can all redecorate.
The Meta Speech
Graduation. What does it mean to graduate? What does it mean to leave college? What is the meaning of college? What is the meaning of meaning? You’ve all heard this one before. It’s the meta speech. Distant relatives and family members will be impressed. They might not know what the heck is going on, but at least it will sound deep.
The Cliché-Ridden Speech
Clichés are comforting. What better way to make a crowd breathe a collective sigh (of relief) than to begin a speech with a Merriam-Webster definition? Seriously, though, how could parents not be at ease after hearing their children are “the future?” These are tried and true phrases—oldies, but goodies. But you go this route, Patrick, then be careful. “Follow your dreams” could easily become an excuse for Uncle John to take a nap.
The Fish Route (a lá David Foster Wallace)
If Patrick is looking to avoid overused sayings and any sort of feel-good moments, this is the method he’s been looking for. Feeling a bit moody and broody, he’ll let you know that the “veritas” you find in the real world is harsh. Your life won’t be a walk in the park—it’ll be a walk to the Quad. Constantly. Everyday. With no shuttles. Ever. You will learn that the world is a drunk, eager freshman and you are its John Harvard statue. But best of luck in life, Class of 2015!
The Cool, Relatable Speech
This works if Patrick wants you to know that he is hip and with it. Expect several references to the “ChatSnap” and be prepared to receive them with smiles. He might even wear black and blue to the ceremony hoping to elicit a white and gold response. Beyond that, he’ll keep every sentence 140-characters or less. We know that our generation doesn’t have the greatest attention span.

Are you a Harvard student craving gritty, breaking news that exposes the dark underbelly of this institution? Are you a seeker of truth and lover of justice yearning for someone to expose the school’s hidden secrets?
Have no fear. Harvardians from the Yard to the Quad know the one source that delivers all this and more: Fifteen Minutes (and its team of hard-headed Woodward and Bernstein-esque reporters).
Today, you’re in luck—FM has been investigating a truly gripping mystery.
What is the deal with HUDS Birthday Cake???
Every few weeks, we students forego the oatmeal raisin cookies or Triple Berry Tea Bread (a mystery for another day), and instead eat actual dessert: “Happy Birthday Cake.” But questions remain. Who bakes these cakes? And whose birthday are we celebrating anyway?
On FM’s behalf, I volunteered to take a closer look.
My investigation was scheduled to begin at the crack of dawn, but after sleeping through three alarms and my Psychology section, I finally roll into the dining hall around 1:15 p.m. I quickly scan the desserts on offer that day: Sugar Cookies and something called Autumn Harvest Treats. No Happy Birthday Cake in sight.
My attempts to learn the origin of the cake prove unsuccessful, and I leave Annenberg with no further information. Either this mystery is way more complex than I thought, or there’s something they aren’t telling us.
Clearly, I need to take my search to the next level; I decide that my best bet is probably the Internet. My first Google hit: the HUDS website. Could the answer have been here, right under my nose, the whole time?
It appears that I’ve struck gold: on the website, I manage to track down a detailed description of Happy Birthday Cake. HUDS prominently displays the lengthy list of ingredients they use to bake the dessert. And I mean lengthy: This is no “eggs, butter, sugar, flour” recipe. HUDS is calling for everything from propylene glycol to soybean oil and xantham gum. Yum.
At the bottom of the webpage, a small asterisked note catches my eye, and I succeed in making one last, shocking discovery: Happy Birthday Cake is vegan.
What?!

I stood behind a microphone in the rickety elementary school gymnasium, clenching and unclenching my sweaty palms as I gazed out at the sea of my cross-legged peers. My elementary school never gave students the dignity of chairs during school-wide assemblies. That privilege was reserved for the teachers and the parents, and even as a fourth grader I felt a healthy amount of righteous indignation about the whole setup. We kids would be taxpayers one day.
The sound of a fifth-grade teacher’s voice snapped me out of my precocious sense of resentment. “Your word is immediately,” he announced. The student body awaited my answer with a dull silence that indicated either bated breath or utter boredom.
“Immediately,” I responded.
Of course I knew how to spell “immediately.” My sister had warned me about “immediately.” My mom had quizzed me on “immediately” as she stirred a boiling pot of pasta with one hand and flipped through a paperback booklet of tricky words with the other. I had typed the word “immediately” in the novels that I used to write, the ones that never reached chapter three. “Immediately” was a softball.
“Immediately,” I said again. “I-m-m-e-d-i-a-t-l-y. Immediately.”
I had worn my fancy velvet pants and lacey pink shirt for nothing—all for fourth place in the elementary school spelling bee. I did not consider participating in a spelling bee again until a couple of weeks ago, when I received an email advertising the Freshman Spelling Bee. I thought about signing up just for the fun of it. But then I remembered that I go to Harvard, so the other participants had probably won international bees before I learned how to read. I decided that I better not sign up.
I made a good decision. The winner, Reed Shafer-Ray ’18, came in second at the Oklahoma Spelling Bee as an eighth-grader. The runner-up, Thomas Dumbach ’18, competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2010. Evan M. O’Dorney ’15, who helped host the freshman bee, won the nationwide Scripps competition in 2007. (Did I mention that I got a really shiny blue ribbon for coming in fourth in the elementary school contest?)
But I still got a kick out of the bee as an audience member. The event was really a hoot—Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Andrew Berry, and lecturer in Chemistry Gregory Tucci served as judges, and about 10 brave freshmen decided that they were up for the challenge of participating. When a speller nailed a word, the audience whooped and cheered. When a speller missed a word, one of the hosts banged a large gong that reverberated with a mighty thud of disapproval. The bee lasted for rounds and rounds of words.
“I realized pretty quickly that all the words for this came from a list that Scripps gives out to prepare for the national bee, so I had studied all of these words in 7th and 8th grade,” Dumbach said.
As the competition progressed, a couple of participants mimed writing their words out on their hands. But don’t expect to see Shafer-Ray using his foot to figure out the spellings a lá “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” “I don’t like psyching myself out,” he said. “I feel like sometimes if you think about it too much you start to psych yourself out, so I don’t really have a routine. I just like to take it slow.”
The playful night was punctuated with particularly lighthearted moments. The definition of “tokamark” included the word “toroidal” (as if that helped). Harvard Hall 201 was alive with “The Sound of Music” twice, once when “fräulein” popped up and again when “edelweiss” made an appearance.
At one point, Berry asked a participant to spell “recalcitrant,” and the speller asked for the defini- tion of the word. “‘Recalcitrant,’” Berry said. “‘Stubbornly refusing to follow rules or orders,’ like many of you.”
When all was said and done, Abby Ducker’18 and Mason Hale ’18 tied for third, Dumbach claimed second place, and Shafer-Ray emerged victorious with the word “cappelletti” (a type of pasta, for those among us who have not yet mastered the dictionary). As prizes, the four winners received celebratory T-shirts, and Shafer-Ray walked away with the coveted bee hat—in the shape of an actual bee—which is sure to be a hit at parties.
And as for me? I was left reminiscing about the not-so-glorious days of fourth grade, wondering whether I still have that shiny blue fourth-place ribbon and reassuring myself that I will never misspell “immediately” again.

I live between a fire station and a church. My window opens onto a plaza filled with a skating rink, food trucks, and a couple dozen tourists. The bros upstairs throw a lot of parties, and the bros next door watch a lot of football. My life is not quiet—and in response, I’ve become a tuning-it-out guru. I narrow my eyes, pop in some headphones, and let all the sirens and bass and shouting teenage boys fade away into a mellow background hum.
Usually, I’m grateful for this skill. Harvard life is frenetic, and putting on acoustic blinders is much easier than going out and finding actual silence. It’s only latelythat I’ve started to wonder: Am I missing out? What’s underneath all the white noise? Does quiet have a sound?
I spent a day scouring campus for silence and answers. Here is what I found.
Fung Library – CGIS Knafel Building
I figure I’m obligated to start my search with a library or two, so I fortify myself with dubious California rolls at the CGIS Café and then descend down two flights of stairs to the Fung Library.
I feel sleepy as soon as I walk in. The room is built like a snug beige tube, and the doors are impressively soundproof. Best of all, I don’t sense even a trace of Lamontian despair. I drop my things on the beige carpet, sit on the beige couch, and close my eyes.
The people scattered around the room are typing spasmodically, creating an irregular pitter- patter that reminds me of rain. A professor in snow pants rustles across the room. The space is saturated with a lazy hum. After 10 minutes, I stop feeling the weight of my bag against my feet and the warm air against my skin.
I shake myself awake. The room is muted, but it isn’t silent.
Harvard-Yenching Reading Room At The Harvard-Yenching Library
The room is lined with leather-bound books and motionless grad students. My boots clatter thunderously against the floor and I feel like a delinquent. I continue to feel guilty until I sit down, stop moving, and hold my breath.
The acoustics here are delicate. There are no rattling heaters, no overly-active CD drives, no mouth-breathers. Instead, real silence graces the library in flashes. Real, because this silence is nearly pristine, untainted by street sounds or motion or visible signs of life. Flashes, because it is ephemeral, punctured every second by the ticking of a dainty silver clock.
I’m occupied by trying to hone in on those slices of quiet when chaos breaks into the room. It could be a new grad student, flushed and breathing hard from the cold. He thumps around looking for a seat, and I resent everything about him until he finally stops moving and lets the quiet heal. We’ve entered into a contract, these grad students and I, and it’s a pledge to preserve the silence. Anyone who breaks the contract is unwelcome; anyone who obeys is embraced.
But this is a fragile peace, and I’m unwilling to leave it in the hands of strangers. I gather my things.
Music Practice Room G35 In The Fanny Peabody Mason Music Building
The space itself is unremarkable. It’s a little cube, just big enough for two or three people yet dotted with about 15 music stands. The walls are bare.
As soon as I close the door, I feel like I am being suffocated by the inside of a shearling jacket. Those walls suck all sound from the room, leaving behind a dense, airless weight that presses itself against the inside of my skull. This is an iron curtain silence.
After a few minutes I start to make out some kind of texture within the oppressively textureless acoustics. My rushing blood makes ridges on the smooth surface; my twitching muscles dent it like clay; my warm skin melts it back from the edges. I sense my own desperation in these observations, and wonder if I’m imagining it all.
Complete silence is a cruel thing.
John Knowles Paine Concert Hall
Paine Hall is filled with light. It is pearly gray like the afternoon, spilling in through the colossal windows. It collects in the high graceful dome, eddying and drifting around. It steeps the room.
I’m the only person here, so I decide to sit two-thirds of the way back and in the middle. Someone once told me that’s the acoustic sweet spot. For the last time that day, I drop my bags and close my eyes.
I hear motion. Rationally, I know that’s unremarkable: It’s a windy day, and there’s no way that this dainty, luminous hall is airtight. Instinctively, I am certain that this concert hall is alive. I hear light, shining across the polished stage. I hear air, ambling through the gallery. I hear music, dormant but present after a century of operas and recitals and a capella jams.
This is a quiet that breathes.

My baby sister Judy and I share one imagination. It’s true, we do. Our favorite pre-bedtime activity is to trundle the comforter under our legs, then shimmy down into the cocoon. We pretend that our bed is flying through the night sky, that a railing around the bed frame prevents us from rolling off, and that the air is so, so cold but we, under the comforter, are so, so toasty. We both sigh and marvel at our contentment, submitting to sleep (real, not imagined) only minutes later. I’ve never gotten a better night’s sleep than with my sister, right after envisioning our bed in the sky together. It must be the solace that comes with knowing a kindred spirit will accompany you into the thick foliage of slumber.
In the morning, while she is still asleep, I pinch her nose and watch her mouth plop open for air. This game must be played delicately, for an extra second too much of nose-pinching will result in a very awake, very grouchy, bad-breathed, prone-to-retaliation morning companion who refuses to make banana smoothies with her sister or battle on Dance Dance Revolution until psychedelic arrows flash behind the third eye or really be agreeable in any matter at all.
In those lazy summers of five or six years ago, when every morning we awoke together ready to take on the backyard, we favored one in particular. I wrote a description of that game, Madame Mademoiselle, in my college application essay. My sister watched me compose the first draft.
“Yes, yes, Madame Mademoiselle,” I singsong in a French accent. Tippy toes support my weight, arms stretch upward to form a chalice. I turn and throw my sister a look of utter arrogance. She shrieks. And around the lawn we traipse, pretending to be Madame Mademoiselles. From behind we put on perfectly distasteful airs, but both our fronts contort into maniacal shatters of glass in the effort not to laugh.
A few months later, 13-year old Judy came to me, shyly, with her submission to a writing contest. She pressed it into my hands and dashed away. She had penned the same Madame Mademoiselle scene in her essay, but from her perspective.
“MADEMOISELLE!!!” she hollers.
Her arms go up and escape toward the ceiling. Her legs split into a perfect A, and my legs instinctively plunge toward the floor. Her fingers wiggle, and my fingers flutter like eyelashes. I prance behind her, perfectly mimicking her every pose as we flounce perpetual laps around the house. My limbs are creaking, and my voice is croaky, but as long as she dances, I dance. As long as she sings, I sing.
Our styles are really quite similar. We both have an affinity for the word “perfectly,” for the fixation on the movement of an eyelash flutter (a fixation that, I can guess, stems from childhood butterfly kisses whose tufts and cheek grazings we’ll always remember), for fleeting images rather than a concrete plot.
But the substance is different. I have emphasized the “we” aspect of the ritual. She has focused on her role as “follower,” as “obedient.” She characterizes her actions in Madame Mademoiselle as if she were compelled past any of her own “creaking” and “croaky” objections. This surprises me. In my retrospection, her part was never fixed, and certainly we played with no rules. At any moment, she could have inverted origination and imitation by marching ahead of me. To a baby sister, though, that step ahead must have seemed so transcendent of natural order that it barely touched her mind. That characterization pervades the rest of her essay. In another vignette, she writes “I long to come into the light. I long to shine in the purest of me. Without her towering over me like a baobab tree.” The baobab tree starts as a peewee, harmless weed, but if left to grow, will extend into such monstrous proportions that it splits the planet into two. A baobab must be uprooted immediately upon sight.
And so, how do I even have the right to give her advice? When my very presence suffocates her, I should reconsider any effort to mentor her.
I hand the essay back to my sister and tell her, “I have no edits for you. It’s great the way you’ve written it.” She is shocked at my lack of suggestions, which only magnifies my sense of the sudden strangeness that has snaked between us, the sense that we’ve been peering at each other through warped crystal all along. She has been hiding these revelations, and I feel cheated out of an earlier truth even if I had been doing part of the cheating.
The year I leave for college, when I do finally uproot myself, our family moves to China. The distance between my sister and me becomes 7,300 miles, and we do not keep in touch as I had thought we would.
The first winter break back home, my par- ents quickly deduce that their older daughter’s prized virginity has been lost. In the kitchen, between the chestnut wood cabinets, under the anemic burn of the evening light, as I unconvincingly tried to explain why I had thought it was the right decision, through tears, as my mother rounded on me with the vicious voice of someone who speaks with love but also with the pressure of her upbringing and thousands of years of conservative sex culture, as the oven rung again and again aloud its readiness, my sister came to my rescue.
She pushed back against our parents’ concerns and patriarchal shaming more articulately than I ever could have. After the passage of four months, I barely recognized her, this woman who is not only physically, but emotionally stronger than I am.
Judy was not mine anymore—no longer predictably familiar in her cute infantility, no longer the baby sister of my memories—mine to expect from, mine to store remnants of childhood in, mine to tender or whatever it means to possess another human being. I didn’t know if I liked it. But I also did not have a choice.

It’s February. It’s cold. It’s early enough in the semester that your BoardPlus shouldn’t have run out. I have $108 left due to overwhelming self-discipline. It’s time to cozy up in a café. Luckily, Harvard’s campus is in the midst of a coffeeshop renaissance. Barker Café is an explosion of black turtlenecks; Lamont Café zombies are bursting with overpriced sushi; Greenhouse is the site of a new Manhattan Project. With an abundance of options, it can often be hard to decide exactly where to take shelter from the slush and the snow. Never fear—FM will help you figure out your vibe, and where you’ll be sipping brew.
01: Where are you on a Thursday night?
a) Brooding over a glass of red wine.
b) P-setting until the sun rises or the coffee runs dry, whichever comes first.
c) Chasing down your escaped lab mice.
d) Pondering the future of Bolivian socialism.
02: What’s your café purchase of choice?
a) A $13 sandwich produced in an Etruscan bakery shipped on a sailboat from
Venice.
b) Triple shot caramel macchiato with whipped cream.
c) Pizza. All of the pizza.
d) Any three things off the dollar menu.
03: Why head to a café?
a) Your spurned lover is visiting to read their newest book of poems.
b) You’ll see everyone you know.

c) Whether to order 01100011 01101111 01100110 01100110 01100101 01100101 or 01110100 01100101 01100001.
d) Whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man (Socrates).
If you answered mostly:
A’s: Barker Café—You’re a hopelessly dissatisfied intellectual. Bond with your fellow future unemployeds.
B’s: Lamont Café—You have a meeting with your proctor in an hour about last week’s busted pregame.
C’s: Greenhouse—The results are still at the lab. But FM is positive that you’ll enjoy Greenhouse.
D’s: CGIS—You didn’t vote for it. We chose it for you. Undemocratic? Yes. The right thing to do? Unfortunately, also yes.

“The best thing was the days of the Hippie Times. Sandals, pocketbooks, belts, everything. Even this buckle; it was from the Hippie Time,” says Christos Soillis, the garish belt-buckle dropping from his calloused hands back into its box with a loud clang. Soillis lets out a chuckle at the memory of a Harvard Square overrun by hippies and their worn leather sandals.
Nestled between Gnomon Copy and Zinnia Jewelry, Felix Shoe Repair has been in business for over 100 years. Soillis bought the shop in 1969 after having worked there for six years. In ’69, there were seven shoe repair stores in Harvard Square. Today that number has been reduced to just two. But Felix is never without work, and the shop garners consistent attention.
Going by the online archives, this will be the fourth Crimson article written about Soillis’s shop (unfortunately, there was absolutely no way to top the headline “Felix the Cobbler Heals Broken Soles”). The septuagenarian acts simultaneously as historical artifact and historical resource, recalling the Harvard Square of years passed with surprising clarity.
As Soillis begins telling us about his childhood in Greece, the bell above the door chimes. A customer enters. He shows Soillis his hipster-inspired, brown leather boots and asks how much it would cost to get the salt cleaned off of them. Soillis reassures him: “That’s alright. This is very easy—you [can] do this by yourself.” He walks over to the display of shoe cleaners and brushes, and demonstrates the pros and cons of each option. Cost versus efficiency, convenience versus longevity. The young man leaves with products in tow, and Soillis’s story resumes.
Born in the Greek village of Kyparissi in 1936, Soillis comes from humble circumstances. He walked an hour or more to school—shoeless, ironically. When he was 11, he walked three and a half hours to the town of Logganiko “to find a life.” There, he stumbled upon the local cobbler by chance and was taken in. The moment of truth, he recalls, was when the cob- bler asked him, “You gonna be a shoemaker?” Soillis makes a brief dusting off gesture with his hands. “And that’s when I became a shoemaker,” he says. His family paid for his apprenticeship in olive oil.
Soillis moved to America in 1963 with his wife Maria. Before purchasing Felix Shoe Repair, he worked four jobs, putting in 18-20 hours a day, seven days a week. The decades of labor are worn into Soillis’s hands: There are weathered lines, marks of polish, and thick muscle built from a lifetime of craftsmanship.
“The first job, I was paid 79 cents an hour,” he says. Behind him on a wall, $600 Italian heels await his attention.
Soillis has a few points that he circles back to throughout the interview. Among them are his love and gratitude for America: “We are the luckiest people to live in America,” says Soillis. “I am the richest person in the world.” He says this with earnest sincerity.
Pictures of Soillis’s family adorn the shop; Soillis says his work and his loved ones have always been enough to sustain him. Though he speaks fondly and extensively of his grand- children, he admits he can’t identify with their upbringing.
“My kids, my grandkids...they have everything. My grandson is 15 years old, and I have a telephone as [old] as he is.... He’s got a telephone, $400,” he jokingly gripes.
Things are changing in Harvard Square, too. The hippies of the ’60s have been replaced with hipsters, cobblers with Urban Outfitters.
One thing is for sure: Felix Shoe Repair will be around at least until Soillis isn’t.
“I’ll die in this shop,” Soillis says with a grin.

The fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center is under construction. Right by the elevator, a crew of workers guts and reinforces the ceiling. A few steps down, by the end of the hall, the staff of the Advising Programs Office is in the midst of building next year’s Board of Freshman Advisers.
The stream of candidates includes: a professor of Comparative Literature; the director of undergraduate studies in Chemistry; a senior associate director of athletics; a postdoctoral fellow in Stem Cell Biology; an alumni affairs officer; and a Divinity School administrator.
The BFA is a diverse body composed of about 400 resident and non-residential advisers from all parts of the University. The Advising Programs Office and its small staff of six is responsible for coordinating and overseeing Harvard’s formal advising system, which guides first-year students through the maze of courses and requirements that compose Harvard’s undergraduate education. Though students arrive on campus with a pre-appointed network of peer and residential advisers, the academic adviser is billed as the point person for students entering the curricular labyrinth.
Freshman academic advising at Harvard has undergone a complete rethinking in the past decade, with changes to its administration and philosophy. There has been a marked rise in the number of non-residential academic advisers and a serious investment by the University in advising oversight.
Stories from students reveal that, despite ramped up efforts and investment from many places within the University, some problems with the advising system persist. Many advisers are able to give the time and attention to students necessary, but others are too busy with their full-time jobs; either way, advisers face challenges guiding students through a vast curriculum on which no one has complete expertise.
‘WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME WEAKNESSES’
Problems with advising at Harvard are not new. In 2002, then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences William C. Kirby initiated the first major review of Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum in three decades. Three years later, after intensive research conducted by eight committees focusing on individual issues, Kirby’s office released the Curricular Renewal, which delivered recommendations on areas from pedagogy to Wintersession. The Review’s longest report, at 44 pages, came from the Standing Committee on Advising and Counseling.
On the subject of advising, the report’s conclusion was clear: Advising at Harvard was in need of repair. The Standing Committee “identified some weaknesses in the first year advising experience,” which ranged from ineffective adviser training to disparate interests between advisers and their students.
Then, as now, academic advisers came in the form of non-residential faculty and staff members, or residential proctors living in freshman dorm entryways. At the time the report was written, the 62 proctors carried the bulk of the advising load, each assigned to 20 to 30 students. There were 232 non-residential advisers, averaging two advisees each. In total, about three quarters of Harvard’s first-year students went to their proctors for study card signatures.
In the early 1990s, Glenn R. Magid served as a proctor in Thayer Hall. During his time as a proctor, the number of students he was required to advise was so large that he felt it detracted from the time that he could dedicate to each student.
“We were the advisers for sort of all the students in our entryways,” Magid says. “[Proctors] had a much greater advising load, and it was insupportable.”
Until 2006 there was no singular office at Harvard dedicated to advising; the recruitment and matching of academic advisers to advisees was coordinated by the Freshman Dean’s Office. Many other elements of the present freshman advising program simply didn’t exist. There was no “Advising Fortnight” or “Professors and Pastries” to help guide first-year students into a concentration or introduce them to faculty in a casual setting.
The report’s largest structural recommendation was to create a so-called “Office of Advising” that would serve not as a place where students could go for guidance, but as one that would “help to improve the effectiveness of all our advising.” The imagined office would fulfill roles ranging from adviser coordination and training to evaluation.
Following the release of the Curricular Review, freshman advising underwent several key changes. The report’s recommendation for the creation of an Office of Advising was realized in the form of the Advising Programs Office, which would take on many of the FDO’s former tasks, including selecting and assigning advisers.
Almost 10 years later, the office now has six staff members that work year-round finding and training advisers, managing the Peer Advising Fellows program, and coordinating various events throughout the year.
Gregory Tucci, a co-director of undergraduate studies in the Chemistry department, served as a member of the Standing Committee on Advising and Counseling. He says he believes that the creation of the APO was successful in institutionalizing advising as “not adjunct to the student experience, but part of the student experience.”
“It’s really quite amazing how in this past decade, advising has just changed so radically at Harvard,” Tucci says. “When we started this Advising Programs Office, it really helped to infuse advising into lots of conversations around here....I don’t think it was valued as much in the past.”
In addition to the new office, Harvard committed to lessening the burden placed on proctors by increasing the number of non-residential advisers. The Board of Freshman Advisers—made up of all proctors, as well as faculty and staff who serve as freshman academic advisers—has since grown by over 100 people. The number of proctors has remained relatively stable, but there are now close to 360 non-residential advisers.
This increase has significantly lowered the advising load on proctors, who now average approximately six to eight advisees. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, a former proctor himself, says this change has been positive in that it reversed a system in which proctors were overloaded and “students would get cheated.”
UNDERSTANDING THE APO
Magid, the former Thayer proctor, takes his job very seriously. Wearing a dark suit accompanied by a thick beard and a deep baritone voice, Magid sits in his office on the fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center and discusses his passion for his responsibilities. He now works as the director of the Advising Programs Office, but his time as a freshman entryway proctor almost 20 years ago still helps color his philosophy on advising today.
And in an office that’s less than a decade old, with six staff members responsible for coordinating close to 400 freshman academic advisers and about 190 peer advising fellows, the system won’t function without complete buy-in at the top.
A holistic view of advising prevails at the APO, and Magid sets the tone. In both recruiting academic advisers and pairing them with students, he looks for a dedication that reflects his own.
“We want people who are really dedicated and who are very, very clear on what the expectation is—and it is an intensive expectation,” Magid says. “What is the priority for us is that we have excellent people who understand what the freshman experience is about, who know advising, who have dedication to the role. If that balance of people happen to be all faculty, fantastic. If it happens to be all staff, so be it.”
However, Dingman says it’s also largely a function of who has the time and motivation for the entirely voluntary—and unpaid—position.
“Frankly, it’s who is available and who wants to take on this role,” Dingman says. “Our experience has been that folks in those areas have to overcome, maybe to a greater extent, the stigma attached to the role. But in fact, some of their scores [on the APO’s annual advising survey] are very, very solid, so it’d be too bad to throw them all out because they don’t have the right academic label.”
Magid says the APO wants to engineer meaningful connections between students and advisers, but not based one-to-one academic matches. In his time as a proctor, Magid felt overloaded by the number of students he was expected to advise, and feels the current system with fewer students per adviser allows for closer relationships. Both incoming students and advisers fill out questionnaires detailing a range of interests, both academic and social, and from there Magid and his office work very deliberately to make pairings.
Matching over 1,600 freshmen and nearly 400 advisers may seem daunting, but fortunately Magid has help in his office from someone with dedication similar to his own. Brooks Lambert-Sluder ’05 is an assistant director in the APO, as well as a proctor in Apley Court. His first job after graduating from Harvard was helping to work on the Curricular Renewal report, and he plays a key role in overseeing the PAF program and running the BFA matching and training processes.
SETTING THE BAR
“Expectations for both advisers and advisees may be unclear or confusing.”
- Curricular Renewal in Harvard College (2006)
When Lambert-Sluder goes through the recruitment and matching processes, he looks for someone who buys into the APO’s holistic vision. He also looks for advisers who will help their students not only in academics, but also in navigating Harvard as an institution.
“We’re in the business of making sure all of our advisers are invested in advising all of our students with a lens for holistic advising and that’s something that’s constantly improving,” Lambert-Sluder says. “Harvard is also a very complex place; there are a lot of resources, and a big role in advising is making sure students can navigate those resources well.”
When adviser matches are made, oftentimes the determining factor is a common hobby or geographic background. Some advisers deliberately choose countries or cities whose students they prefer to work with. Lambert-Sluder says this is about creating a spark between student and adviser without having to start from scratch.
Drawing on the multi-faceted approach of the student-adviser matching process, the College envisions advisers as serving a variety of roles. They are meant to be consultants for academic matters as well as resources for extracurricular life and members of a larger advising network.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who serves as an academic adviser himself, says the relationship is meant to serve as an introduction to the Harvard College experience, and to help students when they confront the “firehose” of opportunities that the University presents.
“It’s to have an opportunity to work with somebody who has a few years ahead of them at Harvard and who can act as a sounding board and help students think through their aspirations,” Khurana says. “I always tell my students you can do everything at Harvard, you just don’t have to do it all at once, and it is about getting them off to a good start.”
In addition to trying to select individuals with common dedication to advising, the APO expects freshman advisers to have a minimum baseline of curricular knowledge. Magid says this includes information about overall degree requirements, concentrations, the General Education program, and additional advising services.
Many current and former members of the BFA recognize that the role of the academic adviser does not stop with knowledge about the in-classroom experience at Harvard. David F. Elmer ’98, the director of undergraduate studies in the Classics department and a former freshman adviser says, “freshman advising frankly centers on questions that are not strictly about course selection…there’s a much broader range of issues there.”
Anya Bernstein Bassett is the director of undergraduate studies for Social Studies and a freshman adviser, and says she views the role as covering more than just formal academics.
“With freshmen, my job is to help them acculturate to Harvard both academically and socially,” Bassett writes in an email. “Sometimes I act as a mom to them, asking about their sleep habits, making sure they are getting regular exercise and finding balance in their lives.”
When it comes to academics, advisers conceive of themselves not as the ultimate sources of knowledge but as directors of the large and often overwhelming amount of resources at Harvard. For Tucci, who has been an academic adviser since 2002, advisers are there to “help students synthesize all of the information that they have out there.…And then see how they can use that information to make a decision.”
On helping students come to answers, Tucci says, “I try not to be prescriptive. I try as hard as I can not to tell people what to do. You have to let students make their own decisions because if you’re telling them what to do you’re taking away all their agency and all their ability to grow and develop.”
Twice a year, one week into each semester, advisers and advisees must meet in order for students to get their advisers’ signatures on study cards. At minimum, the relationship is one in which advisers must sign off on the courses chosen by their students. However, the curricular review included an advising calendar, which recommended that advisers meet with freshmen once or twice before signing their study cards and email or meet with them periodically throughout the semester. These continuing interactions would ideally cover topics like add-drop, midterm review, and final exam preparation.
DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS
“Quality of advice is too variable.”
- Curricular Renewal in Harvard College (2006)
In practice, the APO’s aspirations for a large team of voluntary dedicated advisers able to holistically guide first-year students through Harvard doesn’t always play out. Some students express a dissatisfaction with the amount of information that their advisers are able to provide. Harvard’s curriculum is inherently complicated and vast, and for freshmen encountering Harvard academics for the first time, they may be frustrated by unmet expectations of advisers who can provide all the answers.
Additionally, many students report a lack of outreach and time commitment on behalf of advisers, while others found their advisers weren’t helpful in providing advice, academic or otherwise, and thus turn elsewhere for help.
When Gabriella A. Germanos ’18 arrived on campus this past fall, she had no idea what she wanted to study. She came to college with a general interest in the humanities, but hoped that in navigating Harvard’s nearly 3,000 courses offered to undergraduates, she needed some help. However, she says she’s resorted to looking up requirements and courses herself.
"I’m very disappointed by the lack of advising I’ve received,” Germanos says. “I am well aware of the requirements I have to complete, so I tend to just spend hours on my own deciding what classes to take. But in terms of just knowing what kinds of things I should get done by freshman year or what kinds of things are good or bad, it’s more just talking to upperclassmen and my PAF and perhaps my proctors.”
Germanos wasn’t alone in reaching out to other advising resources out of a lack of faith in the academic advising system. Aisha Bhoori ’18 says she has developed a network of upperclassmen to whom she can go to for advice based on their shared experiences in the First-Year Urban Program or at the Institute of Politics in lieu of the formal advising system.
“I trust my FUP mentors and my IOP mentors…a little bit more than I trust institutionalized advising, just because they know me, they know my interests,” she says. “It’s a little less bureaucratic and more just personal.”
Janice Y. Jia ’17 arrived on Harvard’s campus a year ago similarly undecided on what she wanted to study. However, her issue with the advising system is not about frequency of meetings, but whether advisers are simply able to provide the kind of information that makes those meetings useful.
“I’m not sure how much direction they can give to the advisers and how much they know about the most popular classes, the best professors,” Jia says. “What I’m looking for in a great adviser is someone who gives me more information. So I come in with a list or something and they tell me, ‘Oh, this professor is really awesome,’ or, ‘This program is really great.’ Because I have the basics down. Maybe that’s just expecting too much.”
Not all students report that they’ve found the system to be unhelpful. Victor Domene ’18 says that as a Brazilian student, he shares the same academic adviser as many of his fellow countrymen. He says that he’s had a positive experience in being matched with an adviser who has knowledge of his background.
‘LABOR INTENSIVE’
One challenge to meeting students’ expectations may be that most academic advisers, while passionate about their relationships with students, have other jobs that take precedence over advising. Being an adviser is a secondary concern as an unpaid non-residential position, making it difficult to devote a lot of time away from advisers’ primary responsibilities.
“I loved it, but because I have so many other commitments, I had to give it up,” says Caroline Light, a former academic adviser and current director of undergraduate studies for the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. “It’s very labor intensive.”
Light further says the sheer scope of academics at Harvard contributed to the difficulty of the job. “Learning the curriculum was the hardest part for me,” she says. “I think that was harder than advising.”
The time crunch at Harvard affects many advisers, especially those that work in academia. Although they may volunteer to be an adviser out of personal interest, Dingman says there are certain institutional barriers that may hold them back.
“It’s tough especially for faculty, because faculty, once tenured, aren’t used to reporting to anyone, and they work very hard. There’s a lot on their plate, from publications to conferences in their disciplines,” he says. “Some I think just find it hard to make the full commitment.”
The rise of non-residential advisers over the past decade has played a part in underscoring the significant obligations that advisers have to each advisee. From the perspective of proctors, all of whom are also academic advisers, the academic aspects of freshman life are inseparable from more general well-being. Living alongside students in the College’s 61 first-year entryways, proctors are the primary College staff members with whom freshmen interact.
Lisa Frankel, a proctor in Matthews Hall from 2004 to 2006, says she often dealt with the social and emotional issues of her students.
“Academics kind of blended in with that together,” Frankel says. “I definitely had one kid who I pulled out of Lamont and made him go to sleep during finals.”
Non-residential advisers may be less able to dedicate as high a proportion of their time to advisees as proctors can. “A lot of the advising would happen in the halls or they’d knock on my door. It was all the time,” Frankel says. “They had access to an adviser when they needed it.”
However, Tucci says the lack of time and quick pace of life at Harvard affects not just faculty and staff, but the students they advise as well.
“I think Harvard is a busy place, so it’s always hard to get people to sit down and have a conversation, from the student point of view and the faculty point of view,” Tucci says. “One of its challenges is always going to be the busyness that we all have and trying to find a way to slow us down and sit down and get together and have conversations.”
ACCOUNTABILITY
“Advisers are not…accountable with regard to their performance.”
- Curricular Renewal in Harvard College (2006)
When it comes to holding advisers accountable, the APO has one important tool; its annual midyear advising survey has a participation rate of almost 90 percent among first-year students, offering a robust set of data for administrators to analyze. The survey measures students’ satisfaction with their advisers, and the information is used by administrators to identify advisers who may need extra guidance.
According to Jasmine M. Waddell, the freshman resident dean for Elm Yard, freshman resident deans receive a list of underperforming non-residential advisers, and Waddell says she arranges meetings with every individual on her list. Waddell says that oftentimes, advisers who receive the worst marks are trying very hard but are not what students are searching for in a match.
However, in cases when an adviser receives consistently low scores, Waddell says that “sometimes advisers are encouraged not to return.” What remains unclear is if advisers are ever explicitly told they may not come back. Magid declined to comment on that question, as did Lambert-Sluder.
In fact, though Lambert-Sluder called the participation rate “awesome,” he says that, because the sample size of students rating a given adviser is fairly small, the data is not as representative as it seems.
The role of accountability in the academic advising system is also colored by the fact that academic advisers serve in a voluntary capacity, and don’t receive compensation for their time, as opposed to PAFs, who receive a $1,000 stipend, and proctors, who are compensated in the form of room and board.
Illana Rosen, who worked in the admissions office at Harvard and served as an academic adviser from 2002 to 2004, says she would skip meals to meet with her advisees, and that the lack of financial compensation did not affect her motivation. However, she says that because academic advisers are volunteers and not professional advisers, they need intrinsic motivation to commit to the role.
Referencing the distinction between proctors who serve as academic advisers and non-residential advisers, Frankel worries that by virtue of their different positions, non-proctor advisers may be less dedicated.
“If you’ve got a proctor as your adviser, that person is already by default extremely committed to ensuring that freshman have a really good first year experience. It’s a priority for them to begin with,” Frankel says. “I don’t know if that’s always the case with someone else.”
On the other hand, many people think that the non-professional nature of Harvard’s advising staff is a positive for the students, and doesn’t affect advisers’ ability to be held accountable.
“Some institutions pay their advisers an extra stipend...maybe that provides more accountability,” Dingman says. “I’ve never felt—well, my role [as Dean of Freshmen] is different—I never felt I needed some accountability, I wouldn’t [serve as an academic adviser] if I didn’t feel like the relationship should result in something that’s useful.”
The make-up of the BFA staff stays the same from year to year, according to Magid, and he says that he gives serious consideration to advisers who are not performing up to expectations.
“The relationship is a two-way street. If students are not responding to advisers then that’s another consideration in the fray. But if it is the case, and I don’t doubt that... when it is the case, that advisers are not fulfilling their responsibilities, that’s something I regret deeply and take very seriously,” he says.
MOVING ON
In 2006, as part of the changes proposal Curricular Renewal, the deadline on which students had to declare their concentrations was moved from freshman spring to sophomore fall. The shift added an extra semester in which students no longer have extensive freshman advising networks; nor do they have official departmental advisers. Instead, they have sophomore advisers—staff associated with upperclassman Houses.
While sophomore year more fully integrates academic guidance and residential life, sophomore advising is not always an improvement on the year before, according to some students. Jia says she wishes she had gotten more advice on course selection sophomore year. “I was like, ‘I’m shopping 10 classes,’ and then I disappear for a week. I come back and then she signs the paper.”
The Standing Committee on Advising and Counseling, anticipating that the date of declaration would be pushed back, recommended that students have the same advisers for freshman year and sophomore fall “as often as possible.” The suggestion, however, was not adopted by the College, leaving some students with the sense that sophomore fall is a semester of limbo.
“I’d like to see more connection between freshman and sophomore advising,” says Gaby Ruiz-Colon ’16, a PAF. “Freshman year is a transition that everyone expects. Everyone knows that the switch from high school to college is going to be tough. Sophomore year is extremely different from freshman year. Sophomore year comes with reconciling these new identities: your House, your concentration.”
Whether the structure of advising will change such that freshman advisers continue to serve into their students’ third semesters at college is not “an active discussion” within the APO, according to Lambert-Sluder.
Once students declare their concentrations, advising resources are primarily found within individual departments. Tutors, professors, and department staff members are often highly knowledgeable about course offerings and concentration requirements, because they need only to know the details of a single field.
The smaller, specialized nature of academic departments and committees allows students to receive significant attention from advisers who have a much stronger grasp on a student’s given academic interests. Elmer and Tucci both say they are able to have individual meetings with all of the concentrators in their departments. Tucci goes as far as developing a tentative plan of study with every chemistry concentrator.
“When I’m advising my own students in the program, I know the curriculum so well...I usually know in advance what's coming up the coming year because I make those hires and I help appoint the lecturers,” Light says. “ I have a really good sense of what our requirements are so I feel really confident.”
At the end of March, Annenberg will host representatives of the College’s 48 concentrations. The space so closely linked with Harvard’s freshman year experience will become the kickoff location for Advising Fortnight and the starting point in the transition to becoming upperclassmen. With the move to sophomore year, some of the problems associated with freshman advising fade away. But for the Class of 2018, that transition is still several months away.
As the APO begins to assemble its slate of academic advisers for the Class of 2019, its office—and approach to advising—remains under construction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev’s legal team openly admitted the defendant’s guilt in the April 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings during the first day of Tsarnaev’s trial Wednesday.
“It was him,” defense attorney Judy C. Clarke said at the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse in Boston.
Tsarnaev faces 30 charges from the April 2013 bombing, which killed three and injured over 260, as well as the subsequent manhunt and shooting of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier.
In opening statements, Clarke, a public defender, painted her client as a victim of older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s influences in an apparent attempt to sway the jury away from sentencing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death.
The trial currently is in the phase of determining Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s guilt. If he is convicted, because 17 of his charges 30 charges are capital crimes, the jury of twelve will decide whether he will receive a death sentence.
“[Tamerlan] was determined not to be taken alive,” Clarke said of the manhunt and shootout. “Dzhokhar fled.” Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed by a vehicle driven by his younger brother during a shootout in Watertown on April 19.
Sitting between lead defense attorney Miriam Conrad and Clarke and wearing a black blazer over a white dress shirt, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared relaxed, at times conversing with his defenders.
Clarke, who has defended notorious murderers in the past, specializes in saving defendants from the death penalty.
The prosecution, led by assistant U.S. attorney William D. Weinreb, argued in its opening statement that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was just as responsible as his older brother. He said that the two were “partners-in-crime,” planning and carrying out the acts together.
“Even though he and his brother played different roles in the crime, they are equally guilty,” Weinreb said.
The prosecution also repeatedly emphasized that the defendant digested terrorist literature and believed he was acting to retaliate against the United States for deaths of Muslims in the Middle East.
"He did it because he thought it would help secure him a place in paradise,” Weinreb said.
Weinreb was largely restrained, but at times painted a gruesome picture of the carnage the Tsarnaev brothers left in their wake. Weinreb emphasized that the bombs the Tsarnaev brothers placed near the finish line of the marathon were designed to “tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle.”
“The bomb tore large chunks of flesh out of Martin Richard’s body,” he said, referring to the eight-year-old Dorchester boy who died in the bombings. “Martin bled to death on the sidewalk as his mother looked on.”
Weinreb said that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev waited four minutes after he arrived at the explosion point before detonating the bomb, which he had left next to a row of children.
Weinreb claimed that in the days after the bombing, the defendant showed no remorse. 20 minutes after the bombs exploded, the Tsarnaev brothers drove to Whole Foods and purchased a gallon of milk, according to Weinreb. Also after the bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev posted on Twitter that he was “a stress free kind of guy.”
“He acted like he had not a care in the world,” Weinreb said. “He acted that way because he believed that what he had done was good.”
The two sides disputed exactly how the younger Tsarnaev came to participate in the crimes. While the prosecution said that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev “self-educated” with terrorist materials he found online, the defense said that he was heavily influenced by his elder brother.
Clarke, one of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s lawyers, began her opening statement by addressing the emotional toll of the case. She referred to the crime as “misguided acts carried out by two brothers—26-year-old Tamerlan and his 19-year-old brother.” Throughout her defense, she argued that Tamerlan Tsarnaev led and planned the alleged attacks.
“[Dzhokhar’s] path was born by his brother, created by his brother, and paid for by his brother,” she said. “Unfortunately and tragically, Dzhokhar was drawn into his brother’s plan ... and that led him to Boylston Street.”
Members of the public and journalists watched the proceedings by television in two overflow courtrooms. Examinations of witnesses followed the opening statements.
Months before the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev worked as a lifeguard at Harvard’s Malkin Athletic Center. He attended the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, just a few hundred feet away from Harvard’s campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators will increase security presence relative to typical levels across the College next Wednesday night in anticipation of the pre-Housing Day celebration known as "River Run."
In past years, River Run has involved freshmen visiting—and often consuming alcohol in—the upperclassman Houses the night before they receive their upperclassman housing assignments.
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard, said the Houses are responsible for taking precautionary measures and that security for this year’s River Run will be similar to previous years.
As in recent years, Houses will see Harvard University Police Department and Securitas presence increase compared to typical evenings, as well as a state police cruiser that will monitor the River House area, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. He said he was uncertain whether or not swipe access to upperclassmen Houses will be turned off for freshmen.
“The Houses have to close their gates,” Dingman said. “Their efforts are going toward providing a warm welcome the next day for students who are assigned to their House.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that “HUPD as well as other local police jurisdictions are aware of the event and will work cooperatively to ensure that Wednesday night/Thursday morning is safe for everyone involved.”
Catalano declined to comment on specific security plans.
Despite significant police presence during River Run, students have continually found ways to participate in the celebration in years past.
“We didn’t have that many problems with security,” said Jacob W. Gollub ’17, who was able to gain entrance into each of the 12 Houses during River Run last year, adding that he did not notice significant police presence at the time. He also said he saw no security in the Quad that evening.
“I remember hearing stories from upperclassmen about how they got into Eliot and had to climb over a wall, jump on top of a dumpster, and climb through the d-hall window,” said Andy Kim ’17, who also participated in River Run last year. “I was pretty pumped.”
Kim said he did not face extreme security measures, which he attributes to the relatively late time—11 p.m.—at which he started River Run. He remembered seeing “a lot of freshmen” earlier in the evening, but not as many as the night progressed.
Next Wednesday, as in other years, the First Year Social Committee will host an event on Housing Day Eve, which Dingman and Ranen both encouraged freshmen to attend.
“This is a night where the class should be celebrating as a class back in the Yard,” Dingman said.

As the College’s more than $1 billion House renewal plan continues, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview that an ultimate goal of the program is phasing out the overflow housing units on DeWolfe Street.
With construction on Dunster House nearing completion and work set to begin on an additional building attached to Winthrop House, Khurana said that House renewal should permit all students to live in their affiliated Houses.
"As House renewal goes through, [the goal] is to take the expedient decisions that were made over time at the right time for the right reasons, but over time...to get everybody back," Khurana said.
DeWolfe Street currently accommodates students from Houses including Kirkland, Quincy, Leverett, and Winthrop. Although no dates have specifically been announced for the closing of the two DeWolfe properties, students will be phased out as House renewal progresses. Leverett and Quincy have both recently renewed portions of their houses as part of House renewal, but students from both of those Houses still currently live in DeWolfe.
Winthrop students will no longer live in DeWolfe after the House is renewed in 2016-2017. Winthrop's construction will include an addition to Gore Hall.
What remains unclear is the fate of the College’s renovated “swing housing” properties at the Inn at Harvard and various other buildings throughout Harvard Square. Students are being moved in and out while their individual Houses are renewed, but Faculty of Arts and Sciences Spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that “details on how swing housing may be used are still being worked out.”

Hong Kong billionaire investor Gerald L. Chan has purchased the former Harvard Square Theater, adding to the more than $100 million real estate portfolio he now owns in the Square.
Chan’s purchase of the Church Street building follows a year in which his investments have reshaped the landscape of the Harvard community—having pledged the largest single donation in Harvard’s history of $350 million to the Harvard School of Public Health in September of last year and systematically buying up several other properties around the Square.
Cambridge real estate firm Carpenter & Company, Inc. sold the old Harvard Square Theater building to Chan for $17.5 million, according to the Massachusetts Registry of Deeds. The real estate firm, headed by Richard L. Friedman, acquired the Harvard Square Theater for $6.5 million when it closed in 2012. Friedman was reached on Wednesday but declined to comment.
In 2013, actor Casey Affleck reportedly explored the prospect of buying and re-opening the Harvard Square Theater that he and his brother Ben Affleck, both native Cantabrigians, once attended. However, the deal never went through.
Real estate is not a new endeavor for Chan, who works with his brother Ronnie C. Chan as principals at Hang Lung Properties. The company is one of the largest real estate companies in Hong Kong, with an estimated value of roughly $3 billion, and the brothers are ranked 24th on Forbes magazine’s “Hong Kong’s 50 Richest” list.
Chan’s other holdings in Harvard Square include property from 18 to 28 JFK St., which covers UNO’s and Papyrus. He has also acquired property in Winthrop Square, including Grendel’s Den and the former restaurant Upstairs on the Square.
While some tenants have retained their space, others have left after Chan acquired their properties. These include 39 JFK Street, which previously housed Leo’s Place Diner and the American Express office, both of which closed after the transfer of ownership. Tamarind Bay, an Indian bistro located at 75 Winthrop St., closed down when its rent doubled after Chan acquired the property.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshmen blocking group submissions were due at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, ending what was—for some—a period of drama and frenzy, despite efforts by freshmen proctors and Peer Advising Fellows to clear up misconceptions and offer advice throughout the process.
PAFs play a particularly unique role in advising during blocking because of the perspective they offer, according to Tiffany H. Song ’16, who is a PAF herself.
“Not only have we experienced and gone through the blocking process ourselves, but our advising experiences help show us what tend to be recurring problems or points of confusion year after year,” said Song, who is also a Crimson design editor.
Additionally, all entryways held a mandatory entryway meeting in which freshmen and PAFs offered advice.
“I think [the entryway meeting] was super helpful for some people, but I [had] asked a bunch of questions before then so I didn't really learn anything from the meeting," Matthew J. Naddaff '18 said. “But I could tell a lot of people did.”
The Freshman Dean’s Office and proctors had to strike a careful balance about when to advise freshmen about blocking. According to Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean of Ivy Yard, discussing blocking too early can cause stress, whereas talking about it too late can also cause problems to arise.
“I had a student talking to me about blocking in October,” said proctor Bryce J. Gilfillian '12. “By discussing blocking too early in the semester, I fear that we reinforce this inflated sense of importance.”
However, Gilfillian noted that while the process is important, it is not worth too much stress.
“Certainly blocking groups and block mates can be a large part of a Harvard student's life, but these groups are really very transient in most cases as people's friend groups evolve over time,” he said. “I try to stress to my proctees that their blocking groups are certainly not the be-all-end-all of their Harvard experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What began last year as a mentorship program between undergraduates and students at Harvard Business School has evolved into the Harvard Undergraduate BGLTQ Business Society, an organization specifically devoted to exposing BGLTQ students on campus to job opportunities in the business sector.
As hundreds of undergraduates participate each year in Harvard’s On-Campus Interview Program, HUBBS is one effort working to increase BGLTQ participation in such recruiting programs. And it is part of a growing trend: Increased efforts to expose BGLTQ-identified students at Harvard to business and corporate careers this year from student organizations and the Office of Career Services have been embraced by students and companies alike, although some BGLTQ undergraduates add that they face challenges acclimating to work in the business sector.
EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES
Students nationwide and at Harvard have made recent efforts to increase business recruiting and career opportunities for BGLTQ undergraduates. Several years ago, in 2004, a business conference was founded called Out for Undergrad, which aimed to increase BGLTQ students’ representation in the business sector. This year, Out for Undergrad will expand to offer conferences to undergraduates in four sectors—business, technology, engineering, and marketing.
According to Brandon Fail ’03, Out for Undergrad’s executive director, the conference today tries to help “[get] the message out” that companies are interested in recruiting BGLTQ undergraduates “in time to affect their recruiting decisions and career choices.”
“It’s so valuable to connect students with real, live professionals inside key industries early on,” he wrote in an email.
At Harvard, some groups seek to mitigate what members describe as some students’ impression that business is not welcoming to BGLTQ people by expanding student exposure to business careers, including finance, consulting, and technology.
Born out of the idea of obtaining corporate sponsorship for student activities, the student-run HUBBS, which grew out of a committee in the Queer Students and Allies, split off to begin programming and mentorship programs centered on giving undergraduate students the tools to enter business careers. Organizers approached the Office of Career Services when forming the group.
According to HUBBS founder and co-president W. Powell Eddins ’16, the group has grown “exponentially,” with about 70 students now involved in the organization. Eddins characterized HUBBS’ efforts as highly successful; the organization raised more than $5,000 in its first year, according to Eddins.
HUBBS currently has sponsors ranging from technology companies to consulting firms, including Facebook, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft, among others. The Office of Career Services, meanwhile, has partnered with the group to host events.
According to Dylan MarcAurele ’16, co-president of HUBBS and treasurer of the Queer Students and Allies, the events HUBBS organizes with business partners help expose students to what job opportunities exist.
“I know so many people in [HUBBS] that have become so much more confident with their identities and the processes of interviewing and getting internships and networking,” he said.
IN THE WORKPLACE
Students involved in organizing BGLTQ recruiting resources say businesses have been receptive to their efforts. Fail, for his part, wrote that a “hot topic among recruiters and professionals alike these days is how companies can do a better job of attracting and retaining members” of diverse groups including “female students, trans students, and LGBT students of color.”
At Harvard specifically, Timothy P. McCarthy, the faculty advisor to both HUBBS and QSA, said businesses more recently have been not just tolerant, but embracing of BGLTQ employees.
“Among my graduate students there has been particularly targeted recruitment because these companies understand that these students are important to their institutions,” McCarthy said.
Eddins added that HUBBS has also been received well by corporations.
“These companies really care about us and they really care about representing us, and also because they’re serving more and more diverse clients,” Eddins said.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the investment banking arm, is one of HUBBS’ sponsors. A spokesperson for the bank, Ferris Morrison, wrote in an email that its campus recruiting efforts are a “vital pipeline of talent for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.”
“Because diversity is such an important part of our culture, we partner with a variety of organizations like the Harvard Undergraduate BGLTQ Business Society as a way to support and encourage diverse candidates who might be considering careers in our exciting industry,” Morrison added.
Marissa L. Long, the assistant director of the On-Campus Interview Program and employer relations at the Office of Career Services, said that companies that recruit at Harvard often reach out to affinity groups on campus in an effort to attract a “diverse group of applicants.” However, she added that there is still some work to do, such as with international organizations.
Some students say they face difficulties being open about their identities when they arrive at an internship or workplace. Albert A. Murzakhanov ’16, a former HUBBS co-president who interned last summer at T.D. Bank, said that while the process of applying to and interviewing for jobs in the business sector, particularly in larger firms, has not been an issue, it can be “very hard” to come out to colleagues once assuming a new position.
“As a summer intern, I felt it was very hard to be out,” Murzakhanov said, adding that many large firms are building internal support networks. Carl E. Rogers ’16, who worked for Ogilvy & Mather, an advertising and public relations firm, in Beijing last year, similarly said he was a “bit careful” about to whom he came out in China.
Fail acknowledged that even the most BGLTQ-friendly companies still have a “good deal” of work to do in making undergraduate students aware that they are welcome in the industry in time to affect their recruiting and career choices. He suggested that BGLTQ students “leverage their common identity to seek out, meet, and learn from older, more experienced LGBT people in the industries they’re most interested in.”
“Things have gotten better, but being L, G, B, or T still means being different. And to succeed in today’s hypercompetitive world, LGBT students need to know how to make the most of that difference,” Fail wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wearing gold sneakers and grey skinny jeans, internationally acclaimed organist T. Cameron Carpenter led a master class on his digital, custom made, International Touring Organ in Sanders Theater on Wednesday night.
Three Cambridge organists participated in the master class, including one undergraduate student from Harvard. They each played a piece for Carpenter and received advice from him about both their technique and style.
“You do that so well, but it isn’t demonic enough. It wasn’t perverse enough,” Carpenter said of one performer’s presentation.
Some organists said Carpenter directly confronts organist stereotypes, sometimes in ways that are controversial. Laura E. N. Gullett ’16, the former president of the Harvard Organ Society, said that Carpenter wants to break with what he would term the traditional academic organ tradition.
“In my opinion the fact that he tries to gain a new audience for the organ is at least respectable, but I don’t know if I necessarily agree with all of his tactics to do so,” Gullett said.
Despite his reputation for confronting stereotypes, Carpenter said that it is a misconception that he has a mission to change what people think about the organ.
“I actually don’t really give a damn what people think about the organ,” Carpenter said. “I want to play the organ in the way that I feel that it should be played.”
Carpenter said that the traditional organ is difficult to commercialize due to variations across individual instruments. The mobility of the International Touring Organ allows Carpenter to maintain a consistent sound and style across various performance venues.
The event was co-hosted by the Office for the Arts and the Harvard Organ Society through the Learning from Performers program. Established in 1975, the Learning from Performers program hosts 15 to 20 artists annually who specialize in various forms of art.
“The mission of the program is to engage professional artists to come to Harvard and work with students in various educational forms,” said Program Director Thomas S. Lee.
This was the first time the OFA has hosted an organist, and one of the first times that a master class has been held on Carpenter’s International Touring Organ.
“I just knew that this was a very unusual artist doing very unusual things with a very traditional instrument,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana fielded responses from students and replied to arguments concerning the state of extracurriculars at the College at a town hall event Wednesday.
The event, attended by about 40 undergraduates, featured extended discussion on the interplay between clubs, social life, and personal development. In the recent past, administrators have raised concerns about the tension resulting from students dedicating increasing amounts of time to extracurriculars rather than academics.
“Many people had talked about the changing role of extracurriculars on campus, and the impact that it was having, in many cases positive, and in some cases concerns, around Harvard College culture and Harvard College experience,” Khurana said.
Last September, Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that senior survey data revealed that undergraduates have in recent years dedicated more time to extracurricular activities. In the three-year span of 2010, 2011, and 2013, Khurana wrote, the proportion of surveyed senior reporting spending more than 10 hours a week on extracurricular events increased from 27 to 43 percent.
In that email, Khurana asked students to submit their thoughts about the extracurricular culture at Harvard. On Wednesday, he said that subsequent responses—which had been aggregated in a Google Doc—revealed four common themes: that students join extracurriculars in search of skills not acquired in the classroom, that some students feel that extracurricular activities can be at times more rewarding or engaging than academics, that some students feel a pressure to participate in extracurriculars, and that students had varying opinions on the “comp” process.
Skip L. Rosamilia ’17, in attendance at Wednesday’s town hall, said many students feel pressured to join extracurriculars for social reasons.
“I think that something that we struggle with at Harvard is a space issue, of not having a lot of social spaces for people to just go as students; rather you have to be a member of something, or punching, or comping something to be able to get into these scenes,” Rosamilia said.
Although the event mainly featured students offering opinions on the interplay between extracurriculars, social life, and academics, Khurana replied at times to specific points either in the survey or immediate comments from participants.
At one point, Khurana agreed that students often perceive that being busier than their peers is a “heroic” quality.
Some students at the town hall defended the predominance and role of extracurriculars on campus, while others cautioned against taking a strictly binary approach in assessing extracurriculars and academics.
Undergraduate Council representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said he does not believe that everyone who comes to the College enrolls chiefly for the sake of learning in the classroom.
“I don't think it’s surprising that people often times will prefer extracurricular activities to sort of more academic-oriented endeavors,” Biebelberg added.
John A. Sturm ’15, meanwhile, said he thinks there is more overlap between academics and club activities than might be first assumed.
"I was struck by how strongly students contrasted the role of academics and extracurriculars," Sturm said after the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a faculty committee at Harvard Law School convened to craft a new set of sexual harassment procedures for the school last fall, they examined existing processes at peer institutions, according to Law professor John Coates, who chaired the committee. The final product of their work closely resembles systems in place at other schools across the Ivy League, particularly Columbia.
The Law School’s new Title IX procedures, which break from Harvard’s central process for adjudicating sexual harassment complaints filed against students, were adopted by the Law faculty in December and will be soon implemented, according to administrators.
The changes came after faculty expressed discontent over Harvard’s approach to handling sexual harassment and Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow appointed Coates’ committee to create a new set of procedures for the Law School.
Coates said the committee reviewed the procedures of all other Ivy League schools specifically when writing the Law School’s new framework.
Several aspects of the Law School’s procedures, including the promise to provide attorneys to students involved in sexual harassment cases, mirror elements of Columbia’s process of responding to cases of alleged sexual harassment. Both separate the investigation and guilt determination processes, and involve hearings.
Under Columbia’s procedures, which apply to every school in the university, after the investigation process, a hearing panel generally consisting of administrators determines an accused party’s guilt. The panel holds hearings involving both complainants and respondents. If the panel determines guilt, designated “sanctioning officers” from individual university schools hand down sanctions.
This process resembles, in part, the new one at Harvard Law School. At the Law School, an independent adjudicatory panel consisting of non-Harvard affiliated experts will review the results of investigations of allegations of sexual harassment. The individuals tasked with investigating the allegations do not serve on the adjudicatory panel, which is wholly separate from the investigation process. If either the complainant or respondent in the case requests a hearing, the independent adjudicatory panel will hold one, although Harvard’s adjudicatory panel may not request to convene a hearing itself. Also unlike Columbia’s system, the Law School’s adjudicatory panel determines disciplinary action.
Harvard’s central set of procedures, which went into effect last year and created the central Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, differs significantly from both the Law School and Columbia’s set of procedures. Under Harvard’s central system, the same team both investigates cases and determines whether or not a policy violation occurred. Individual schools, then, hand down sanctions, which is similar to Columbia.
Harvard’s central procedures also make no guarantee that parties involved in a case will be provided legal counsel, instead advising students to contact an attorney if the case has criminal implications.
The Law School’s departure from Harvard’s centralized framework is also similar to a system formerly in place at Yale Law School. Although Yale has a university-wide committee that hears sexual assault complaints, its law school also gave its students the option to file a complaint with the school in lieu of the larger university committee until Feb. 18. That separate process, however, was largely unused and has since been phased out, according to Claire Priest, Yale Law School’s Title IX coordinator and a professor there.
When Yale created its University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct in 2011, she said, it “became the forum to bring the complaints. So we recently just chose to codify that.”
Approved by the Harvard Law School faculty in December, the new set of procedures received initial feedback from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights weeks after the government found the Law School in violation of Title IX.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After clean sweeps in the first round of the ECAC tournament last weekend, the Harvard and Quinnipiac women’s ice hockey teams will meet for the third time this season in a tournament semifinal matchup on Saturday afternoon.
In Potsdam, N.Y., at Clarkson University, the teams will square off in the second round of the conference playoffs to determine who will earn a trip to Sunday’s ECAC championship.
The No. 4/4 Crimson (23-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) was able to dispatch visiting Yale by winning two consecutive contests at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center last Friday and Saturday by scores of 2-1 and 3-0, respectively.
The No. 6/6 Bobcats (26-7-3, 15-5-2) were similarly successful in home performances at the High Point Solutions Arena, eliminating Princeton by sweeping a best-of-three series in two games, all without allowing a single goal in 7-0 and 2-0 victories.
The Crimson has won both games against Quinnipiac earlier this season,  with a 2-1 win at home in December and a 2-1 overtime win on the road in Hamden, Conn., in late January.
Although this familiarity allows for both teams to plan for the game with a specific focus on each other’s strengths and weaknesses, it does not inherently benefit one side over the other.
“It has its pros and cons because we do know their game very well, but it’s hard to beat a team multiple times in the same season,” Harvard co-captain Samantha Reber said. “Anytime we play them it’s going to be a tough game.”
Harvard and Quinnipiac have both played a tight game defensively this year. The Bobcats rank at the top of the ECAC in goals against average, sporting a 1.04 mark. The Crimson places third, tallying a 1.51 figure.
Another battle will take place over the penalty kill. Quinnipiac has held opposing power plays scoreless 91 percent of the time, the highest success rate in the conference, while Harvard has converted on 22 percent of power play opportunities, good for second-best among ECAC teams.
In a game in which putting the puck in the net is often a difficult task, a notable matchup this weekend will be the one between Bobcats senior goaltender Chelsea Laden and Crimson sophomore forward Sydney Daniels. Laden’s 1.09 goals against average and .765 win percentage top both ECAC charts.  Daniels stands at fourth in the conference and at the top of her team with 18 goals on the season.
Regarding momentum, Harvard enters with a slight edge, posting a record of 8-1-1 over its last 10 games. Over the same stretch, Quinnipiac has played at a 6-4-0 clip.
Both squads share the goal of improving on their performance from a year ago, when each faced defeat in the semifinal round of the 2014 ECAC tournament. Harvard fell to Cornell by a 6-4 margin, while Quinnipiac’s tournament run ended after a 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Clarkson, the eventual NCAA champion.
This year’s NCAA tournament is slated to begin on March 14, with eight teams qualifying to compete. One of these bids is guaranteed to the winner of the ECAC tournament.
Knowing that this game will likely play a huge role in influencing national rankings and bracket positioning heading into nationals, both squads have reason to feel optimistic about the status their season-long success has afforded them.
“Honestly, I think I speak for the entire team in saying we see ourselves in Minnesota at the Frozen Four,” Reber said. “We have all the potential in the world.”
Ranking well within the top 10 nationally, both the Crimson and the Bobcats are currently in a position that puts them in the discussion to receive at-large bids to the NCAA tournament, should ECAC title hopes flare out. Last year, Harvard, under the leadership of interim head coach Maura Crowell, was awarded an at-large spot and faltered in the first round on the road to Wisconsin.
“From day one of this season, winning a national championship has been our goal, so we just see [this season’s success] as us right on track to accomplish what we set out to achieve all year long,” said Crimson junior co-captain Michelle Picard.
The winner of the Harvard-Quinnipiac game will play Clarkson or Cornell in the conference final.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As senior guard Wesley Saunders grabbed the ball with 10.9 seconds remaining and his team down just one point to Holy Cross back in November, the direction of Harvard’s season seemed to rest in his hands. As Saunders’s shot fell off the front rim and onto the hardwood of TD Garden, so too did Harvard’s No. 25 ranking in the Associated Press poll.
Just one month later, the Crimson surrendered almost all hope of an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament in back-to-back losses against No. 6/5 Virginia and Arizona.
Nonetheless, with a win this Friday night over Yale (21-8, 10-2) and then either a win the ensuing night or a Yale loss, Harvard (20-6, 10-2) will have a chance to become the first team in the nation to earn a spot in March Madness.
The winner of Friday’s contest at Lavietes Pavilion will earn at least a share of the Ivy League title. If either team can sweep the weekend, then the winner will be in sole possession of the conference’s automatic bid.
“Given the situation, it’s a big game,” Saunders said of Friday night’s contest. “Every game is a must win and determines whether we are going to go to the postseason or not. We don’t single out Yale as that game but given the situation…it’s win or go home.”
Last time out, despite holding the Bulldogs to 11 first half points, the game still managed to come down to the wire, as Saunders sunk two free throws with six seconds left to secure the 52-50 win in New Haven. On Friday, the Crimson will have the luxury of not only playing on their home floor, but also the backing of a sold out crowd.
In fact, tickets for Friday’s matchup sold so quickly that the Harvard Athletic Department has added additional seating by bringing extra bleachers in from Blodgett Pool. Though home court advantage will be valuable, the Crimson will have to shut down junior forward Justin Sears, Yale’s leading scorer and rebounder, whom Harvard held to just nine points and seven rebounds earlier this year.
“We are going to need a rotation of big guys up front,” Amaker said. “They are big and strong upfront and the best rebounding team in our league for a reason.”
That rotation will likely consist of captain Steve Moundou-Missi, senior Jonah Travis, and sophomore Zena Edosomwan, all of whom played double-digit minutes the last time the two teams faced. Senior center Kenyatta Smith, who has slowly returned from a leg injury, will also be a factor against Sears.
But even if Amaker’s squad can hand Yale a loss Friday, the Crimson’s quest for a fifth consecutive league title—the first since Penn’s run in 1978-1982—will be far from over.
Less than 24 hours after its rivalry matchup, Harvard will face another troubling opponent. Though Brown (13-16, 4-8) currently sits at seventh place in the Ancient Eight with no true postseason prospects, the Bears will look to play spoiler in Lavietes on Saturday night.
When the Crimson entered the Pizzitola Sports Center a month ago, Brown was 0-5 in the Ivy League and its leading scorer and rebounder, Leland King, had just left the program for personal reasons. Nonetheless, even with Saunders, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, scoring a career-high 33 points, the game went to overtime as Harvard squeaked out a 76-74 win.
Brown’s sophomore guard Tavon Blackmon, who dropped 25 points in the last matchup, wreaked havoc on the court all night, weaving through defenders and giving Harvard junior co-captain Siyani Chambers all he could handle. Blackmon’s health will be a key issue to watch for Saturday night, as he suffered a quad injury that limited his minutes last weekend.
Despite the trouble Brown gave Harvard earlier this year, Amaker has maintained that his team’s focus is the Bulldogs heading into the final weekend of the regular season.
“We can’t get two until we get one,” Amaker said.
While beating Yale is certainly the first and most crucial step to securing its fourth straight tournament bid, Harvard will have to win both matchups to keep its fate in its own hands.

Harvard is no stranger to celebrities. They only come by, like, once a week. And when you’ve seen the Vice President, the creator of HONY, the former Miss America, the United Nations Secretary-General, Amy Poehler, and Chris Pratt in the span of just a few months, you’ve basically seen them all. But little do you know, there are celebrities walking among us this very minute. It’s high time they get the recognition they deserve. Presenting… the Class of 2018 Facebook celebrities: Gabriela (Gabi) “Wabi” Thorne ‘18, Tania Fabo ‘18, Maria Zlatkova ‘18, Wyatt Robertson ‘18, and David (Davey) Hughes ‘18. 
Flyby: What first motivated you to start posting in the group, and did you ever anticipate stardom?TF: To be honest, I was just bored. Especially in high school, as a second semester senior. I thought, what do you do with your life? Oh, I thought, why don’t I post in the college Facebook group? Also I was so excited to have gotten into Harvard, and I wanted to make sure Harvard people knew who I was.MZ: Yeah, I even posted in the Princeton group for a while.TF: I posted during lunch breaks, because I had nothing better to do with my life.WR: I only posted once before school started. I checked my email and I saw the rooming assignment, and I wanted to be the first to post that in the group and tell everyone to check their emails.GT: I think for me, it was honestly that when I saw something funny, I’d comment and make it even funnier.DH: I just tried to be helpful.

Flyby: (frantic typing as the Facebook celebs started going off-topic)
TF: I remember I wrote that one post, asking everyone what’s one book they’d rather read. I hate myself.GT: Tania, this is being recorded.TF: I was on the floor crying because I was so ashamed of myself.GT: I posted in the group about finding tall men.MZ: I related to that.TF (speaking as a tall person): Did you really? To what extent?
Flyby: Wait guys we’re going off-topic.WR: It actually got easier for me to post in the Facebook group once we got here. I’m part of the UC and FYSC, so I have to post pretty regularly in the group anyway.TF: It got weirder for me to post once I got here. I wanted to be in the real world, meeting real Harvard people. It felt weird making funny comments on the group. Except when I needed help with math– that’s when I started posting in the school year.MZ: I forgot to be Facebook active in the first few weeks here. It was so overwhelming.GT: I just met people in real life.

Flyby: How was it introducing yourself when you actually moved onto campus? Did people recognize you?
TF: Introducing myself, or having other people introduce me? I realize that I sound like an @$$hole.MZ: With me, it’s the hair. People would just know me as the “girl with the red hair.”GT: I just say, “Hey, I’m Gabi” and they say, “Gabi Wabi!” and the conversation ends there.DH: Yeah, a lot of people recognized me.WR: Basically everyone.DH: It was also the hair.TF: Oh, the big hair!WR: Please when you write “@$$hole” in your article, use dollar signs and an at symbol. (you're welcome) GT: Can I call people @$$hole or is that rude?WR: Well generally that is rude.MZ: In Bulgaria, it’s polite.

Flyby: What do you think about being deemed a “Facebook celeb”?
TF: It makes me feel lame.WR: Whoa.GT: Umm okay.TF: Let me explain myself though. I feel like a lot of times when you’re a “Facebook celeb,” people ask things like, “So do they have social lives outside of Facebook, or is Facebook the only thing they did with their lives before Harvard?” I just posted way too much. I got too eager.GT: To be fair, so many people posted in the group besides the Facebook celebs.TF: If I could do it again, I probably would. Even though I feel dorky about it, it was still a good experience getting to know people through Facebook before coming here. It eased the transition. So even though I feel dorky, I’d do it again.GT: To be honest, I don’t care. I can’t feel ashamed for posting in the group when everyone else was doing it too– even people who think they’re above that. Also for me, my Facebook personality is similar to my persona in real life. I don’t feel ashamed because I’m the same way in person. I can’t feel ashamed of my personality. I mean, I can, but I don’t.MZ: I have no shame at all. I couldn’t go to Visitas because Bulgaria.GT: #bulgariaMZ: Maybe I was compensating? I don’t care if people thought I was annoying. I feel like I am very social in real life.GT: I agree.WR: My Facebook led people to my Instagram which I unfortunately care about more than my Facebook. Follow me: @wyattandthewhale.GT: Speaking of Instagrams, follow me: @everyrosehasitsthorne and @brassyclassysassy.

You’re going to make friends here no matter what.WR: Post photos of the most expensive gifts your parents get you. That’ll get you instant popularity.GT: If you’re going to post on Facebook, don’t be someone you’re not. If you feel like the person you are doesn’t like to be on Facebook, then don’t go on Facebook.

New semester, new you! Here’s how a few people on Harvard Crushes and isawyouharvard decided to start off their New Year’s resolution of #baewatch2k15:
Harvard Crushes
#1583“[J.C.], sorry for being so awkward. I only apologies because I cannot believe how I end up being a total mess when I am with you. I am shy, but I make it totally obvious that I fancy you. I shake and tremble not only because I like you, but because I don't know what words to share with you. If only I could read minds. You are so wonderful and amazing. I am not sure if you'd even like to be liked, wanted, or loved. I will end with this. You are like art and to tell you the truth, I love art.”
Harvard Crushes addressee, you need to find this person, and your first date should be at the Harvard Art Museum.
#1511“[J.W.]: I love you but can you shave please?”
Love hath some bounds, apparently. Shave bro, or none for you, bye.
#1505“evelynn hammonds,dayummmmmmmm grrrrrrllllllllll-ur future bae”
#thats(now)illegalhere #sorrymyfriend #continuethebaewatch
#1479“Dear Princeton,I know I'm stuck with Harvard, but I really like you.”
Don’t sell yourself short, kiddo. Harvard is the gold standard.

“I saw you... self. The primary reason I'm here is to increase my value on the marriage market. What is wrong with me?!”
Hey, some people go to college for a B.A., and others go for the B.A. and M.R. or M.R.S.
“I saw you... strange boy jumping around in the quad lawn snow. C'mon dude, you got work to do”
Join him in the snow for a study break! Everyone needs a stress relief, jeez.
“I saw you... looking all cute :)”
Aww, stop it. You’re making me blush!
“I saw you... giving bread to a homeless man. :')”
:’). Keep doing you. :').

If you’re anything like us, it’s going to be a struggle to get through these next few days. It’s times like these that “grade inflation” seems like a myth your jealous high school rivals made up. On the bright side, only 9 more days until spring break! Good luck!
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIn case you thought yesterday’s melting snow meant spring is on its way, don’t worry, you’re wrong. It’s going to be cold and gross again today with windchill in the teens and a chance of snow.
IN THE D-HALL
Lunch
Bacon and Spinach Pizza on Multigrain Crust
Chicken Fingers

Dinner
