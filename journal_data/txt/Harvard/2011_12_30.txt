After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, two recent alumnae who first met as roommates in Wigglesworth launched an African fashion website. Co-founded by CEO Chioma M. Achebe ’10 and CFO Osub S. Ahmed ’10, the site is called Osisi, which means “tree” in the Igbo language of Nigeria, according to the site’s creators.
Osisi sells clothing created by 11 African designers: one man and ten women, hailing from countries across Africa.
“We wanted to create a place where people could buy affordable and accessible African designs,” Achebe said.
The idea for the site first took root at Harvard. While serving as president and vice president of Harvard African Students Association, Achebe and Ahmed helped run a fashion show that showcased African designs. Achebe said that many people came up to her after the show to ask where they could buy the clothes they had just seen. She searched the web for outlets that sold affordable African designs, but she could not find many.
“I thought it would be cool to create a website,” Achebe said. “There’s a ton of small African fashion designers. I thought of bringing all of these designers together, like a hub. When we contacted these designers, they were really receptive and excited about it.”
The process of putting the site together took about nine months, and the two have been thinking about starting the business for even longer.
“It took an unbelievable amount of time, and at the end of the day, you have to be flexible,” Achebe said.
STARTING SMALL
The two co-founders decided to start small before branching out, Achebe said.
Currently, the items on the site are geared toward 18- to 35-year-old customers, but the women eventually plan to target other age groups as well.
Achebe said that they do not have plans to open a physical store at the moment but remain “open to a lot of opportunities.”
“Our stuff is not just for Africans,” Achebe stressed, though she noted that the designs are uniquely African.
“Practically, different fabrics and materials are used," Achebe said, and the clothing lines feature prints that are "virtually only used in African countries, especially in West  Africa."
Each designer also has a different style, Ahmed said, and Osisi features “a great sample from all over the continent.”
Achebe chose the name Osisi for its arboreal meaning. “I like what a tree represents,” she said. “It’s a good representation of what Osisi is about. We are digging into roots and branching out, and people can experience and see it [the culture] by wearing the clothes.”
Both co-founders have other occupations, but “having another creative outlet is worthwhile,” Ahmed said.
Achebe said she considers meeting people from all over the world the “most rewarding part.”
“I am just amazed at all the people we’ve met,” Achebe said. “These designers are so smart and savvy.”
When creating the website and deciding on the designs to promote, the women said that they aimed to pick items that they themselves would want to buy.
Since Osisi’s recent launch, Achebe and Ahmed said that it has been successful so far.
“The average time [people are] on the website is about eight minutes,” according to Google Analytics, Achebe said. After eight days, the website had over 6000 page views, which means about 800 people, she added.
“From all over, the people are checking it out,” Ahmed said.
A GOOD TEAM
Since their days as freshman roommates, Achebe and Ahmed have considered themselves best friends.
“I think that being good friends with someone translates to working well off one another and working off one’s strengths,” Ahmed said. “Even having worked together before—as president and vice president of HASA—how we worked together there translates to Osisi. We have a deep-set trust and a good base. It worked out.”
“You just know each other really, really well,” Achebe said. “We know what the other is good at.”
For example, Achebe said that Ahmed is very artistic, so she handles all the photographs and design for the site.
“Being friends with your business partners is really great,” Ahmed added.  “Doing it together is better than doing it separately, and with small businesses, you definitely cannot do it alone.”
Both founders said their time at Harvard helped them create Osisi.
“Harvard has such a great collaborative environment, especially among the student groups,” Ahmed said. “Having been student leaders, we really learned how to connect to people in the Boston area and more.”
“Interacting with everyone who was there—dining hall conversations, late night chats—everyone just inspires you," Achebe said. "Everyone has all these big ideas and dreams."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As 2011 comes to an end, The Crimson looks back at the most important events at Harvard over the year.
10. Football Team’s Triumphant Ivy Season Ends in Tailgate Tragedy
 
After Harvard finished second in the Ivy League in 2009 and 2010, the pundits projected the same result for the Crimson in 2011. A loss in the year’s first contest to Holy Cross and injuries to quarterback Collier Winters and linebacker Blaise Deal only seemed to bolster the prognostications. But after that lone loss, Harvard reeled off nine straight wins in historic fashion en route to an Ivy title.
All sorts of records fell in 2011. The Crimson broke its modern-era record for points scored in a single season, with 374 in its 10 contests. Winters’ replacement as quarterback, Colton Chapple, became just the second player in program history to throw for five touchdowns; the following week, having returned from injury, Winters became the third. On Nov. 5, Harvard’s 35-21 victory over Columbia made Tim Murphy the winningest coach in Crimson history, passing the mark set by long-time coach Joe Restic, who passed away on Dec. 8.
A resounding 37-20 victory over Penn secured the Ivy title for Harvard. The season ended with the annual Harvard-Yale game—which the Crimson won, 45-7. The triumph was marred by disaster, however. At the tailgate party before the game, a U-Haul truck driven by a Yale student struck three women, leaving 30-year-old Nancy Barry dead and two hospitalized. Yale announced that it would launch a special review of its tailgating regulations in response to the accident, and it remains unclear whether Harvard will follow suit.
9. Summer School Instructor Swamy Sparks Anger with Editorial
 
In July, Indian politician and Harvard Summer School instructor Subramanian Swamy published an editorial in India that soon caused ire on both continents. In light of the piece, which proposed demolishing mosques, disenfranchising non-Hindus, and forbidding Indian citizens from converting from Hinduism, a group of Harvard students circulated a petition calling Swamy’s words offensive and asking that Harvard cut its ties with him.
At first, Harvard claimed that it would stand by Swamy despite the “distressing” content of his op-ed. A civil liberties group warned that any action against Swamy would be a violation of the instructor’s free speech rights.
But in December, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reversed course. When the Summer School course catalog came up for approval, the Faculty passed a motion to exclude Swamy’s economics classes from the 2012 roster. Though some expressed concern that removing an instructor based on his political viewpoints sets a dangerous precedent, the majority of the Faculty, led by Diana L. Eck who introduced the motion, saw fit to end Harvard’s relationship with the inflammatory politician.
8. “I Am Fine” Spurs Campus Discussion About Mental Health
 
An anonymous essay on mental health published by The Crimson in February opened a floodgate of heartfelt responses from the Harvard community and beyond. In the essay, titled “I Am Fine,” the writer discussed her struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts at Harvard. Her frank, haunting piece emphasized the importance of students talking to each other about their emotions rather than attempting to make their busy schedules and taxing workloads appear effortless.
The community listened to the writer’s message. Over one hundred people posted comments on the article, many sharing their own painful experiences with mental illness at Harvard and at colleges across the nation. Administrators, editorial writers, and concerned students encouraged students to open up to each other about their feelings and to take advantage of mental health resources at Harvard. Dialogue about this often silent issue increased through many channels: a new online forum inspired by the article, a new website from a student mental health advocacy group and appearances outside the Science Center, and the opening of the HappyNest, a play space in the Quad geared toward reducing student stress.
7. First Locations for House Renewal Picked: Quincy and Leverett
 
Early in the year, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced the beginning of Harvard’s long-planned major renovation of its 12 residential Houses. Old Quincy will serve as the first test project for construction on all undergraduate Houses, and House Renewal will rank high among the University’s priorities for its quietly budding capital campaign. Drawing inspiration in part from recent renovations at Yale, the construction will update outdated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and increase wheelchair accessibility.
While Old Quincy undergoes its 15-month face-lift, which will start soon after Commencement in 2012, students will be relocated to one of several swing spaces. After that, administrators recently announced, Old Leverett will be next to see renovations.
 
6. Convicted Murderer Sentenced to Life in Prison for Shooting in Kirkland House
 
The legal saga that arose from the fatal drug-related shooting that rocked campus in 2009 played out in court this year. After a three-week trial in which the defendant’s attorney argued that another man fired the bullet that killed 21-year-old Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland House, Jabrai Jordan Copney, 22, was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Two other men, originally charged with first-degree murder along with Copney, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter and avoided trials. Jason F. Aquino was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison, and Blayn Jiggetts, who cooperated as a witness against Copney, received a sentence of 9 to 12 years.
Brittany J. Smith, the only Harvard student charged with a crime in connection to the murder, pleaded guilty after her boyfriend Copney’s conviction and received a three-year prison sentence. Smith’s friend Chanequa N. Campbell, the other student dismissed from Harvard just before her graduation for her involvement in the shooting, served as a witness in Copney’s trial and was not prosecuted.
5. Reverend Peter J. Gomes Dies
 
Reverend Peter J. Gomes died in February after serving 35 years as Harvard’s Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals. Gomes was known at Harvard and nationwide for his oratorical gifts, best-selling books, advocacy for equality, and many endearing quirks. Speaking out when he saw injustice and standing up for students in tough circumstances, Gomes was seen as a moral compass at Harvard.
University President Drew G. Faust invoked Gomes’ memory at the 2011 Baccalaureate Service, a ceremony that Gomes had presided over for decades. “As a man of multiple labels, Peter Gomes was a little ahead of his time,” Faust said at the service. “The black, gay, and once Republican preacher did not fit any categorization.”
After Gomes’ death, the University named Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer as the acting Pusey Minister and launched a search committee to find a permanent minister. The search is ongoing.
 
 
4. Harvard Brings Back Early Action Admissions
 
This year brought early action admissions back to Harvard, reversing a policy that had once been heralded as a way to level the playing field in Harvard admissions.
Five years ago, administrators announced that Harvard would eliminate its early application program in favor of a single admissions cycle per year, claiming that early admissions programs put less privileged students at a disadvantage. Harvard administrators had hopes that colleges nationwide would follow Harvard’s lead in moving to a single-cycle admissions policy. But only Princeton and the University  of Virginia did so, while universities like Yale and Stanford that often compete with Harvard for top applicants kept their early action programs.
With the return of early action to Harvard, admissions experts questioned whether underprivileged applicants would be at a disadvantage under the revived program. But when more than 4,000 applications poured in this fall, the Office of Admissions reported that the pool was more diverse than the last time the program existed. Eighteen percent of those applicants received acceptance letters in December.
3. After One Historic Season, Basketball Team Headed Toward Greater Heights
 
As Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker often remarks, it’s not easy to do something for the first time at a school that has been around for 375 years. But that’s exactly what the Harvard men’s basketball program has done and continues to do.
It was a historic year for the Crimson. In March, the Crimson captured a share of its first Ivy League title ever, defeating Princeton, 79-67, in front of a boisterous crowd at Lavietes Pavilion. But the celebratory mood faded one week later when the Crimson fell to Princeton in heartbreaking fashion in a one-game playoff to determine the Ivy League’s representative at the NCAA tournament.
After turning down an offer from the University of Miami in April, Amaker returned to Cambridge for his fifth season. Even before the 2011-12 season tipped off, Harvard turned heads, hosting a star-studded group of eight high school recruits—six of whom were ranked in the MaxPreps.com Top 100—in an attempt to persuade them to commit to Harvard.
On the court, Harvard has continued to succeed. Its win in the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in November helped propel it into the Top 25 in national rankings for the first time ever. And with an 11-1 record midway through the season, the Crimson appears poised to continue making history, likely heading in 2012 to Harvard’s first NCAA tournament berth since 1946. 
 
2. ROTC Returns to Harvard
 
After nearly four decades of contentious relations with the military, Harvard officially recognized the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in March following the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the national military policy that banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in uniform. The University opened a Naval ROTC office on campus in September, though Harvard cadets will continue to conduct their training at MIT because student participation rates have remained low.
Though many praised Harvard’s decision to renew its ties to the military, students have protested Harvard’s recognition of ROTC because the military does not allow transgender or intersex individuals to serve openly.
In 1969, Harvard expelled ROTC when faculty and student outrage over the Vietnam War reached its peak. Later, the University justified the continued split with the military on the basis of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which Harvard said violated its anti-discrimination policy. Harvard was the first of its peers to welcome back ROTC this year; Columbia and Yale followed within several months.
 
 
1. Protesters Occupy Harvard Yard
 
They have occupied the Yard—and much of campus discussion throughout the past semester.
From October, when members of the Harvard community joined the Occupy Boston protest and some were arrested, to early November, when students walked out of an Ec 10 lecture in protest, support for the nationwide Occupy movement simmered on campus.
Then the occupation of Harvard Yard began. Overnight, the University limited entrance to the Yard to Harvard ID holders only. The increased security left students and tourists divided over the movement. A freshman circulated a petition asking the campers to relocate, and professors urged University President Drew G. Faust to open the gates in a letter and at the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
In a series of victories for the Occupy movement, Harvard agreed on a new contract for custodial workers, avoiding a threatened strike, and said that it will reconsider its investment in controversial chain HEI Hotels & Resorts. With winter approaching and Occupy Boston shut down by police, Occupy Harvard packed all of its tents—except for its large metal geodesic dome—but vowed to keep advocating for Harvard to bend to its remaining demands. The gates, however, are open wide once more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—For the fourth straight year, the No. 23/24 Harvard men’s basketball team came out on top over cross-town rival BC at Conte Forum. But unlike the previous three victories over the Eagles (5-8), Thursday night’s contest was not an upset.
The Crimson (11-1) earned its third straight victory since falling to UConn on Dec. 8, 67-46, simultaneously ending a streak that saw the Eagles win three games in a row by double digits.
Harvard is currently 4-0 against Massachusetts schools, after taking home wins against Boston University, Holy Cross, and MIT earlier this year.
“It’s definitely something we take pride in, when we match up against other Boston-area teams,” said junior point guard Brandyn Curry. “But [the matchup against BC is] just another game. We have to come out and take care of business.”
Although the win on Thursday night leaves Harvard’s seniors with a perfect 4-0 record on the road against BC, the Eagles still hold a large edge in the all-time series, 32-13.
FEELING HOT, HOT, HOT
The Crimson started off the evening ice cold, scoring just three points—all from the free throw line—in the first six minutes of play, as BC took a commanding 14-3 lead. It wasn’t until 6:02 had expired that Curry knocked down Harvard’s first field goal of the game.
Luckily for the Crimson, hot shooting started to kick in, and the visitors staged an early comeback. Down 20-13 with just under 10 minutes to play in the first half, sophomore Laurent Rivard knocked down a three to put the contest within range. Rivard went on to score 18 points for the Crimson, including 15 first-half points and four threes, to help Harvard secure a seven-point lead heading into halftime. The sophomore was 7-for-12 from the field on the night.
“We are good shooters, and we haven’t really shown that [so far], in the first month of the season,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “We wanted to attack them through ball screens, and I think we did a good job of that.”
In the second half, freshman Corbin Miller picked up where Rivard left off, scoring 12 points on 4-of-5 from behind the arc.
“Corbin [came] off the bench with a lot of confidence,” McNally said. “He’s a kid who can really play offensively, and he showed that today by hitting some big shots.”
Behind solid long-range efforts from Miller and Rivard, Harvard was an impressive 10-of-20 from three-point range.
“The key [was] Corbin Miller [who] hasn’t played much this year,” said BC coach Steve Donahue of Harvard’s success from beyond the arc. “You have to give him credit. Rivard was really locked in early on.”
 
The Crimson held its cross-town counterparts to 3-of-11 from downtown—a season low for an Eagles team that averages seven made threes per game.
BIG MEN ON CAMPUS
Freshman center Dennis Clifford led the Eagles in scoring with 14 points, seven of which came in the first half. The seven-foot tall rookie proved to be a big factor early in the game, with four points in the first five minutes of play.
“Their freshman [Clifford] is a really good player,” McNally said. “He attacked us pretty well in the beginning, but we also have two really good big men.”
But the Harvard defense—which combined for 12 steals to help force 17 BC turnovers—held the duo of Clifford and freshman forward Ryan Anderson to a combined 16 points on the game.
“It was tough to give a lot of help [down low] from the perimeter because we wanted to focus up on the shooters,” McNally said. “They shoot the three really well. [It was about] our big men manning up, staying in front of them, and making them take tough shots.”
“[BC was] hitting shots in the beginning of the game,” he continued. “I think we really locked them down and made them take tough shots later on.”
On the Harvard end, four players scored in double digits, as Rivard, Curry, Miller, and junior forward Christian Webster led a balanced Harvard offense.
Co-captain Keith Wright contributed eight points for the Crimson down low, while the Eagles defense held junior forward Kyle Casey to just two points. Harvard pulled down 36 rebounds on the night while allowing BC 22 and just four offensive boards.
“They’re content with winning,” Donahue said. “That’s when you get a dangerous team. When they’re open, they shoot. If they’re not, they move the basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You would be hard-pressed to find someone who knows Ivy League basketball better than Steve Donahue. The second-year Boston College head coach spent 10 years as an assistant to Fran Dunphy at Penn from 1990 to 2000, and another 10 years as Cornell’s head coach, leading the Big Red to three Ivy League championships and a berth in the Sweet Sixteen in 2010. So after the Crimson’s 67-46 win over the Eagles last night, Donahue shared his thoughts on the Harvard men’s basketball team and its place in Ivy League history.
“There are a couple things that make [Harvard] really good, but defense is certainly one of them. In my years at Cornell, I thought we hurt them on the offensive end against their defense. In my last year, I think we had one game where we had [22] assists, [eight] turnovers, scored 86 points [against] the same kids that were out there tonight. I think that’s a lesson to be learned with younger players developing: in two years you get bigger; you get stronger. Just watching the Harvard guys communicate out there, how they know each other so well, and they have such confidence and trust in each other. [Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s] done a fantastic job just developing that defense.
“The other thing that’s impressive with them is they start three guys that started three or four years in [Oliver] McNally, [Brandyn] Curry, and [Christian] Webster, and none of them average over [seven] points, and they’re content with winning. That’s when you get a dangerous team. Kids don’t care. When they’re open they shoot it. [If] they don’t, they move the basketball.”
In your last at Cornell, you might have had one of the best Ivy League teams of the past 20 years. How do you see this Harvard team comparing?
“It’s really hard for a lot of reasons. I grew up on Ivy League basketball in Philadelphia. I saw a No. 1 ranked Penn team in 1971. I saw a ’79 Penn team that went to the Final Four. My teams at Penn had three NBA players. The ’98 Princeton was ranked seventh in the country, one loss. And then obviously the runs Penn made in the 2000s and then our team [at Cornell]. What you realize is, when you can get it going at those places, the intelligence and the unselfishness that exists on those teams is what separates them. I think Harvard has that same formula. Hard to compare who is better or not, but that’s definitely something. Those kids share the heck out of the ball, they defend the whole time, [and] they don’t care how it gets done. That’s why they’re dangerous, and that’s why they are good."
You guys made only three three-pointers today. The previous season low was five. Was that you guys just missing shots, or was that something about Harvard’s perimeter defense?
“I think Harvard does a very good job of chasing you off the line. First, they switch a lot of things. That does help. It keeps guys in front. You don’t get miscommunication. They switch all one through four. The thing that’s hard is they’re so aggressive on ball screens. When you get the ball moving you’d think that they would give up an open three, but what they do is they chase you off that line. They fly at you.”

After traveling halfway across the country, the Harvard men's hockey team tied No. 18 University of North Dakota, 4-4, Thursday night in a back-and-forth overtime battle.
The Crimson (4-3-4, 3-3-2 ECAC) got on the board first. With just under five minutes left to play in the first period, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally slipped one past the goalie to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
But the Fighting Sioux (9-8-2, 7-7 WCHA) came out hot in the second, notching back-to-back goals within the first two minutes of the frame. Senior forward Alex Killorn, who finished the game 17-4 in faceoffs, continued the scoring frenzy and netted one of his own less than a minute later to tie the game at two.
Though the rest of the period saw back-and-forth play, North Dakota found the back of the net two more times in the period to give the home team a 4-2 edge going into the second break.
Despite its struggles in the second frame, Harvard took control of the third period. Junior forwards Alex Fallstrom and Marshall Everson each tallied a goal midway through the final frame of regulation, propelling the Crimson into overtime with the score knotted at four.
Starting with a penalty early on, Harvard found itself on its heels in overtime and was unable to record a single shot. North Dakota had four, but freshman goaltender Steve Michalek, who had 33 saves on the night, corralled them all, and the game ended with both teams frozen at four.
The two squads head back to Engelstad Arena Friday night when they face against each other for the second time in as many days.
