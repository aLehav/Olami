To the editors:Leon Eisenberg was a pioneering psychiatrist, [trained in both adult and child psychiatry,] and not a psychologist as your article erroneously implies.  I am sure that Professor Kleinman–also a psychiatrist–did not tell your author that Dr. Eisenberg would leave a legacy in “psychology,” a very different discipline from the one to which Dr. Eisenberg made so many contributions.  Attention to accuracy about the facts of this great man’s life would have been a more fitting tribute.

Summer vacation may not be safe for much longer. In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’86 reiterated President Obama’s belief that curtailing the length of summer breaks for public schools would be an important way to keep American students competitive with their counterparts in Europe and Asia. While shrinking summer might make fifth graders gasp in horror, it is also could be an important step in revitalizing American public schools. We hope that the Department of Education acts on the proposal but keeps in mind that, while lengthening the school year is a step forward, it should not occur at the expense of fixing the more fundamental problems in public education.
“Young people in other countries are going to school 25, 30 percent longer than our students here,” Duncan pointed out to the AP. Many studies indicate that it is during this prolonged summer that the gap between the performance of higher- and lower-income students widens most significantly.
Karl Alexander, the author of one such study, points out that “disadvantaged kids’ test scores improve at pretty comparable rates during the school year...But over the summer they fall behind.” Alexander went on to suggest that the disparity between the kind of environments higher- and lower-income students are exposed to over the summer is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. Higher-income students, he posited, are more likely to be exposed to such enriching experiences as private lessons, computers, newspapers, magazines, libraries, museums, having their parents read to them, and the like. The study indicated that poorer students, on the other hand, largely fail to make progress and sometimes even regress over the summer. Studies also show that more time in school can proffer marked gains in student performance. Tom Loveless of the Brookings Institution, for example, examined the impact of increased time spent learning math on math scores, finding a significant increase when as little as 10 minutes were added to the school day.
Here in Massachusetts, early results for the expanded learning time initiative suggest that adding hours to the day or days to the year to expand time spent on both traditional academics and enrichment activities improve performance on state standardized tests. Charter schools, moreover, also appear to benefit from longer school years or days. The KIPP national network of charter schools, for example, has a school day typically running from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday class every other weekend, and a three-week summer session, and KIPP’s eighth-grade classes regularly outperform their district averages on standardized tests.
In addition to potentially improving student performance, a shorter summer would also help ensure the safety of lower- income students.“Those hours from 3 o’clock to 7 o’clock are times of high anxiety for parents,” said Duncan.
Duncan also noted that the current system of summer vacations of interminable duration is a vestige of another era. “Our school calendar is based upon the agrarian economy, and not too many of our kids are working the fields today,” Duncan said.
It would make a great deal of sense, therefore, to jettison the current system and transition to one in which students’ vacation time is spread out over the year at more balanced intervals, as some schools have already pioneered.
The United States ought not fear the possibility of overhauling summer as we know it in a dramatic fashion. We should not take off the table any method that has proven effective at improving the quality of American education.

After President Obama’s speech last week, outrage likely erupted in schoolyards from coast to coast. His address proposed that America lengthen its school day and year, for two reasons: to ensure that students remain in a safe, stimulating environment when parents cannot provide one at home; and to increase America’s academic competitiveness on a global scale. While this first justification reflects a dire need across lower-income communities, the second unfairly frames education in terms of test scores instead of well-rounded mental development. America would do well to lengthen school days and shorten summers, but only if this extra instructional time were devoted to enrichment activities like arts, clubs, and sports.
As most veterans of the U.S. public-school system can attest, many students enrolled in traditional math and English courses spend each period praying for the bell to ring. Extending the school day and year without implementing significant curricular changes would only intensify this painful academic experience, possibly leading to earlier, more frequent dropouts. On the flip side, those who would otherwise checkout might find joy in playing basketball, painting, dancing, practicing the flute—activities that would improve their quality of life while also keeping them in a safe school environment. If these mandatory programs began early, in kindergarten and first grade, schools could capture children’s attention before they become jaded or negatively influenced by peer pressure.
In his theory of multiple intelligences, Professor Howard Gardner famously posited that different people possess affinities for particular types of learning, whether linguistic, body-kinesthetic, musical, spatial, etc. Schools that provide only linguistic and logical-mathematical material exclude those who learn better under different circumstances. Since underprivileged families often cannot afford to send children to expensive music camps or martial-arts lessons, young people with untapped potential remain unaware of myriad avenues toward success. Arts and sports classes offer a unique strategy for re-engaging students who have given up on themselves, academically and otherwise.
Obama’s desire to expand school hours and days, in combination with the economic stimulus bill, provides a unique opportunity for American education to adopt such enrichment courses. If the president’s scheduling plans come to fruition, schools would no longer face an either-or decision, where providing time for arts and sports comes at the cost of academic instruction. Since the stimulus bill includes an education component totaling more than $125 billion, funding for this additional class time seems plentiful. Districts that have failed historically in their attempts to implement arts and sports programs could benefit immensely from this financial support.
Schools cannot counter students’ lack of motivation by forcing them to remain longer in the very settings that first led to their disillusionment. Instead, the American education system needs to innovate—and bring enrichment into the classroom, where it belongs.

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the city’s richest and most powerful man, embodies New York in all its contradictions. He brags about taking the subway to work but first gets chauffeured to the subway station in an SUV. He exercises regularly and keeps a running calorie-counter in his head but throws salt on his pizzas, devours fried chicken, and grabs food off the plates of aides and strangers alike. He has already spent $37 million on an uncompetitive election campaign—spending $7,000 alone on pizza.
This push and pull between restraint and indulgence is not just Bloomberg’s story: It’s the story of New York City. Manhattan may be New York State’s thinnest county, but the culinary temptations are everywhere. Countless pizza places leave the door open for the smell of fresh bread to waft outside, as thick slices with countless toppings sit on display. In Times Square, bright flashing ads of M&Ms bombard tourists as they gape upward, extra-large sodas in hand.
The city’s bipolar swings between temptation and abstinence evoke the anxieties of a more ancient city-state. The ancient Athenians viewed the world as teeming with temptations—food, alcohol, clothing, sex—and sophrosyne (self-restraint) was paramount to protecting their democratic way of life. In Herodotus’s chauvinistic “Histories,” the Greeks overcame the invading Persians because their army maintained sophrosyne, eating only the sparsest food, while the Persians indulged in luxuries even as they overstretched their empire, depleting the land as they feasted on it, marching westward in their own imagined manifest destiny.
As University of Warwick Classics Professor James N. Davidson explains in his book “Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens,” Athenians viewed indulgence and tyranny as inextricably intertwined. Pleasure-seeking and power-seeking were often one and the same—if a man could not control his appetite for fish and sex, what would prevent him from taking over the acropolis?
Americans have found hedonism less problematic than the ancient Athenians: Love today rarely strives to be platonic. But the tension between indulgence and self-restraint does manifest itself in the way in which many Americans treat food and exercise. It’s all too common for high-achievers—whether at Harvard or in New York—to indulge in greasy food one moment and hit the gym the next.
The parallels extend even to New York’s financial system. Just as Bloomberg goes on a ferocious diet after seeing an unflattering photo of himself, Wall Street has almost completely abstained from giving out loans. Considering the way banks used to court risk-taking businesses clearly unable to repay them, this is a diet of the highest magnitude. Likewise, after getting tied up in highly leveraged purchases of their own homes, American consumers have been forced to get thriftier. History Professor Niall C.D. Ferguson has even warned that New York may go the way of Venice and become just another tourist center, underlining a permanent shift in the economic balance of power from West to East.
Davidson ends his book with an ominous image: While Aeschines is prosecuting Timarchus in 346 BCE for practicing homosexual prostitution in his youth—a warning sign in Athens of tyranny—he portrays an “anti-Athens” of hollow zones and derelict buildings that “lurks still in the city’s crevices” amidst “unbridled appetites and animal passions”—waiting “like the abysmal Charybdis to swallow Athens down.” It’s still eerie to modern ears, for though New York’s skyline may stand mostly intact, 143 stalled building sites loom over the city, and after eight years, the World Trade Center site still looks like Ground Zero. The unemployed—now over a tenth of New York City’s population—often roam the streets in greater numbers than the tourists.
Bloomberg is perhaps the one man with the power to temper these developments. The next four years will be critical. If he has the will and the ability to maintain New York’s standing as a key financial center—while helping ensure that Wall Street does not help cause the next global financial crisis—historians may look back on his tvhird term as an embarrassing hiccup in democracy that ultimately helped maintain New York and America’s dominance on the world stage.
Or his story may end in lame-duck leadership as he feasts on over-salted pizza and New York’s economy slides into irrelevance. The choice is his.

Many people know the term “placebo effect,” but they probably don’t know how much placebos play a role in their lives. In light of our looming health-care crisis, it is time for government and industry alike to embrace and harness the peculiarities of this phenomenon.
The term “placebo” has been around for centuries; it originates from the Latin for “I shall please,” which then developed into a derogatory term for a medication aimed at pleasing the patient more than healing him. Today, it refers to a simple sugar pill used in clinical trials as a control to judge the effectiveness of new drugs. Ironically, the placebo today tends to equal or even surpass modern pharmaceuticals in effectiveness: the “placebo effect.” Placebos are relevant in our lives in not just medicine, however—many elevator “door close” and street crossing “press to walk” buttons are placebos.
Harnessing the placebo effect does not seem a particularly easy, or even feasible, task: beating the best of 200 years of scientific discovery, invention, and insight with just inert sugar. But the evidence remains embarrassingly clear that the placebo effect is real—and more important than we may care to admit. A recent article in Wired magazine explained the trend: “From 2001 to 2006, the percentage of new products cut from development after Phase II clinical trials, when drugs are first tested against placebo, rose by 20 percent.” And 50 percent of drugs that fail during clinical trials do so because they cannot improve upon the sugar pill. Pills for Crohn’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression have unexpectedly come up short against the placebo. Even surgical procedures and gene therapies have been proven no better than a skin incision or saline solution, which are in themselves placebo treatments.
In case this seems disturbing news, know this—new treatments are not getting weaker; instead, the placebo effect is actually growing stronger. Drugs like Prozac have flunked follow-up studies on effectiveness when the placebo effect literally doubled in size. And the most comprehensive reviews of antidepressant medications have revealed that the placebo effect has grown significantly stronger since the 1980s.
While the exact mechanism of the placebo effect is still unknown, researchers have discovered and elaborated upon the power of expectations. Not surprisingly, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is familiar with the concept. In 2004, it spent $23 billion on marketing, crafting an image of safety, health, and well-being through television and print ads as well as the aggressive pursuit of trusted doctors and health-care professionals. Indeed, the positive effects of many modern medical treatments including cough medicines, antibiotics in the case of some infections, and the majority of back and arthroscopic surgeries have been proven to be the result of culturally ingrained expectations of their usefulness. Not one of the listed treatments beats a less expensive alternative.
What does this mean for our current health system? Some would call for the stop of such underperforming treatments, and this is not so unreasonable. Consider the complications that can result from surgery, and the antibiotic resistance that can develop from an improperly administered regimen—especially if the antibiotics aren’t doing anything a sugar pill couldn’t do. Doctors perform over 600,000 back surgeries a year to the tune of $20 billion. Surely some of the savings from eliminating back surgeries alone could go a long way toward funding health-care reform. This idea gains even more traction when you consider that, if subjected to the FDA approval process right now, back surgeries and any number of prescription or over-the-counter drugs would be summarily dismissed as failing to outperform the placebo level.
What the growing placebo effect shows is not so much the failure of modern medicine as much as the success of the modern production of beliefs. The modern health-care narrative is so firmly entrenched that it needs no introduction. You are sick; you visit the doctor; he diagnoses the illness; he prescribes the appropriate medication; you get better. Often this process, and not the actual treatment, cures us with its normality. This is why 55 percent of Chicago doctors have prescribed a placebo treatment to their patients.
All of this is not to deemphasize the importance of modern medicine. There are certainly drugs and treatments on the market that continue to significantly improve upon the placebo effect—but equally important is the perception and the culture of health care.
The government should see this as a sign that advertising works and duly subsidize or commission media campaigns targeted at lesser-known, cost-effective drugs. Even better, it should support new types of treatments, bringing their effectiveness into public consciousness and increasing the placebo effect associated with them. But even more importantly, the government should extend the provisions for research on the comparative effectiveness of different treatments and of different treatments against a placebo. We should be pleased that placebos provide these opportunities for saving money to use in health care—now we must pursue them.

The American obsession with fat is doing more than clogging our arteries—it is colonizing our culture. Incendiary reports on the all-consuming “obesity epidemic” saturate the media: According to the most recent statistics, two-thirds of Americans are overweight and one-third are obese. Shows like the “The Biggest Loser” place comically adipose contestants on display in their skivvies, while sites like thisiswhyyourefat.com showcase contributors’ attempts to pack as many calories onto a plate as possible. Apparently, just about anything can be deep-fried, doused in gravy, and served with bacon. The dieting industry counterpoises this delight in excess, raking in over $40 million per year from Americans’ bodily angst. When combined with the pin-thin ideal of beauty espoused by the fashion industry and heeded religiously in Hollywood, the situation becomes combustible. At once addicted to fast food and worshipful of heroin chic, American society has expunged the middle ground from its depictions of bodies. When it comes to weight, the center, it seems, cannot hold.
Recent efforts to combat the fat neuroses particularly virulent among American women do not seem to be helping. Take, for example, Glamour’s decision to run a single photo of plus-sized model Lizzie Miller in last year’s September issue. As Editor-in-Chief Cindy Levine gushed, the image did not feature a celebrity or a supermodel, but “a woman sitting in her underwear with a smile on her face and a belly that looks...wait for it...normal.” Yet a quick flip through the magazine’s other 193 pages of single-digit figures makes the abnormality of Miller’s stomach painfully manifest. Considered in the context of the issue at large, the photo appears more like a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to challenge the size-zero standard. Miller is too obviously the exception, and Levine’s remarks sound self-congratulatory rather than sincere.
Dove’s “Campaign for Real Beauty,” which features “real women, not professional models,” constructs its message entirely around those loaded words: “real” and “normal.” These terms prove problematic, not simply for their vagueness (who decides what the phrase “real women” actually means?), but for their brazen attempts to legislate the normal. Harming yourself in an effort to conform to society’s expectations of how your body should appear, rather than acquiescing to the natural demands of hunger and the sagging of old age, certainly seems inauthentic. Yet affixing the word “normal” to a nebulous concept linked with larger waist lines is equally troublesome. The effort draws attention to the female body as a site of political contestation, to be argued about and picked apart by others. Like so many cultural forces, it reduces women to their bodies, to the myth of the female as flesh, immanence, and passivity, the embodiment of limitation and contingency. What’s more, it delegitimizes the experiences of certain women—those who are thin, both naturally and unnaturally—and ostracizes them to the realm of abnormality.
After years of battling teenage insecurities, I have accepted the fact that I will probably never be at peace with the diameter of my thighs. Does Lizzie Miller’s photograph ease my anxieties? Does she help me come to terms with the fact that I do not, and biologically cannot, resemble the models who grace the pages surrounding her? Not really. If anything, her exile to a single three-by-three frame makes it clear that she, and other bodies like hers, remain eminently out of place in Glamour, rightly so or not. Even if Dove’s campaign does manage to invert contemporary beauty norms, it creates an out-group of its own—a fact that the campaign itself illustrates with its disparagement of the “thin, young, and blond.” Although Dove purports to employ objective, universal standards, the “beautiful” and the “normal” can only be defined in relation to their opposites: the ugly and the abnormal. Someone will always be the loser in our cultural beauty contests.
Every day, I watch my female friends struggle with society’s prescriptions of how much they should weigh and how much they should eat. Rationalizations of chicken-tender consumption, 10-minute debates over getting a second cookie, and self-punishments at the MAC for feeling “too full” after dinner all make dining-hall meals feel like a survey course in female fat phobias. Yet seeking recompense through the mainstream media, at least in the model of Glamour and Dove, may not prove fruitful. The implication that a certain representation of the female form is more “real” or natural than another merely devolves into the initial conundrum: the attempt to define normality, a culturally contested term with a perpetually unstable meaning.

Despite e-mails sent to students this week by some undergraduate directors of studies, all thesis writers applying to stay on-campus will not necessarily be guaranteed January housing, said Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer.
An e-mail Ameer sent to undergraduate concentration officials on September 24 prompted undergraduate studies officials in various departments to inform thesis writers that as long as they properly filled out their application materials they would be provided housing in January.
Ameer, who is heading up the effort to determine which students can stay on campus in January, wrote in the e-mail, “Of course thesis writers can be on campus in January...All [thesis writers] need to do is apply so we have a record of who is here for safety reasons.”
But Ameer told The Crimson yesterday that all thesis writers would not be guaranteed housing, only those with a “clear need” to stay on campus to work on their thesis—such as to do archival research or lab work—will get an opportunity to do so. Whether those without a “clear need” will be permitted to stay will remain undecided until after the application deadline.
“We are definitely going to make room for all thesis students who need to be here,” Ameer said.
After receiving this e-mail several directors of undergraduate studies said that they believed that Ameer’s e-mail meant that all students who properly applied to stay on campus would be allowed to do so.
“What we were told was thesis writers who filed by the October deadline would get to stay,” said Karen Kaletka, the coordinator for undergraduate studies for the government department.
“I think thesis writers are guaranteed,” she said.
Trygve Van Regenmorter Throntveit, the assistant director of undergraduate studies for the History Department, said he and his office originally believed that thesis writers who needed to stay on campus were not guaranteed housing.
But after receiving Ameer’s e-mail, he sent an e-mail to thesis writers in the history department, writing, “The Advising Programs Offices has confirmed that all thesis writers will be provided housing in January as long as they properly complete the application procedures.”
Amidst the confusion, some thesis writers remain nervous that they will not receive J-Term housing.
“I’m pretty sure actually that I’m not going to get it,” said Meggie M. Roberts ’10, a human evolutionary biology concentrator who applied to stay in January to work on her thesis.
She said that “having never written a thesis before” she is not sure what resources she will need to finish her Human Evolutionary Biology thesis.
Recently Roberts was asked to submit more information on why she would need to stay on campus in January. Ameer said that the College has requested more information from some students who did not provide detailed descriptions of their need to stay on campus in their original application.
Ameer said that the College has currently received about 800 applications from students hoping to stay on campus in January. While the College originally said the number of students allowed to stay on campus will not exceed 1,000, Ameer said 1,000 is actually more of a “guiding number.”
The College plans to begin informing students if they will be allowed to stay after the October 15 submission deadline—originally they had planned on having a rolling deadline.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stock market has gone up and down, but for decades at Harvard Law School, one thing has remained the same: job security.
“As a Harvard student, you feel entitled to get a job, and you ignore these dire reports on CNN,” one student told the Crimson in February after the Harvard Law School’s peak recruiting season had passed her by and left her without a job. “You think that things will work out like every other year.”
During the current recession corporate law firms—like a majority of other industries—have pared down their operations after transactional assignments in investment banking and trading evaporated in the heat of the downturn.
Top performers from the nation’s most elite law school are now faced with slashed salaries, lay-offs and reduced hiring. The pre-crash ideal of fast-cash has been swept away by the brusque hand of the last two years of financial uncertainty.
In economic downturns, law firms have come to expect litigation activity to increase even while transactions decrease in a recession. But the magnitude of this recession—the worst since the Great Depression—has nullified this conventional wisdom, leaving firms scrambling to cope.
The fall-out has accelerated a reform process within firms to improve the way that they hire, recruit, and operate.
This year, Harvard Law School has seen a 20 percent reduction in the number of firms participating in its recruitment process, according to Mark A. Weber, assistant dean for career services at the Law School. Some members of the class of 2009 received deferred start-dates as firms struggled to keep the hiring commitments they made two years earlier. And starting salaries for the largest firms have dropped from around $160,000 to $140,000.
Administrators and experts at the Law School have hinted at the possibility of pushing back the start date of the fall recruiting season. But starting this spring, the Law School will host a second recruitment period for “firms whose hiring outlooks have changed,” in anticipation of an economic recovery.
‘OVERHANG’
Jason C. Murray, a second-year student at the Law School flew from Cambridge to Washington, DC two weeks ago for what is commonly referred to as “fly out week,” an intense week long, class-free period of job interviews and elbow rubbing with potential employers.
Murray is one of the few still falling snugly into the mold that has characterized the recruiting process for decades earlier. Just one semester into his first year, Murray entered into the competitive process of applying and interviewing for summer internships.
The next fall, the job hunt began in earnest. Murray landed three interviews in Washington and three summer job offers that would likely result in a full time offer.
But Murray’s success is emblematic of a fundamental problem with this recruitment system, some critics say. The two-year lag between when firms extend job offers and when employees begin their first year forces firms to predict associate demand far in advance of the start date and leads to inaccurate predictions of hiring needs.
According to Weber, the backlog of entry-level associates or “overhang” is negatively impacting firm demand for associates in this recruiting cycle.
After the financial crisis pummelled investment banks and the fountain of transactional work dried up, law firms were forced to keep the commitments they made to new hires two years earlier. The result: a spate of deferred start dates that began with the class of 2009 and may continue with the class of 2010.
The Law School began taking steps to cope with the downturn last year when they announced that the 2009 fall recruitment schedule would be moved up by a month. Also this year, the school will mediate a second recruiting session in the spring.
Students say the Law School’s Office of Career Services has generally been helpful in guiding students through a tough job market—anything from presenting students with possible career options to offering fashion advice on interview days.
But several students criticized OCS for issuing newsletters packed with “doom and gloom” predictions about the job market.
“It was almost like fearmongering,” said Julia K. Seider, a second year student at the Law School.
Law Professor Asish Nanda said he is leading a movement to reform the recruiting process that would entail transitioning law schools to a system similar to the method medical schools use to match students with residencies.
Under such a system, firms would interview all applicants in the spring of their second year. Firms would then list preferences for applicants, students would list their firm preferences, and a matching program would pair students with firms.
But some students say that the getting an early start to the recruitment process gives them early exposure to firms and in many cases guarantees that they will land a high-paying job, even as they watch their student loans pile up.
“The interview process is an opportunity to learn about the firms,” Murray said. “It would be hard to get a firm idea of what the firm is like under a different system.”
But law firms today publicly defend the extended recruiting system as an important component of acclimating new hires to life at a firm.
“I think one of the things that works well is that it gives students a real opportunity to come spend some time at the firm and get a very real sense of what it’s like to work at the firm,” said Michael J. Summersgill, chair of the hiring committee for Wilmer Hale’s Boston office and a graduate of Harvard Law School. “What other industry has that opportunity to work? I think it’s a unique approach, and I think that’s a good thing.”
A STRUCTURAL CHANGE?
For experts on the legal profession like Nanda and Law School Professor David B. Wilkins ’77, there has not been a better time in the last 30 years for structural reforms to take shape in the industry.
“I’m in the Rahm Emanuel camp,” Wilkins said. “Never let a crisis go to waste.”
Now that the boom years are over for Wall St. and the law firms it patronized, Nanda said that firms will need to start outsourcing many of their basic legal services and improve the quality and performance of their associates.
“We teach students how to think like lawyers and firms teach them how to be lawyers on the client’s dime,” Wilkins said.
That system simply is not tenable in a tighter legal market, Nanda said.
In the past, associates have climbed the pay-scale in lock-step with their recruiting class at set intervals. Associates are guaranteed job advancement and firms faced steadily escalating costs in the absence of a system that incentivizes high performance. According to Wilkins, a competency-based system would force associates to meet bench-marks before gaining a promotion.
Reforming this system poses a typical adversarial cooperation problem for firms who fear that other firms might cheat the system by keeping the old methods in place and attracting the best recruits with a cushy compensation system. But Wilkins said that the financial crisis has placed sufficient pressure on the legal industry to make cooperative reform possible.
“Some types of financial transactional work in structured financial products which required high leverages—that work has gone away and for a long period of time,” said Nanda.
Much of that transactional work had been the responsibility of summer associates and entry level associates. But now firms are reducing the overall number of summer associates and are placing greater demands on the few that they do hire, said Brian T. Aune, a third year student who has spent the last two summers working at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton.
If the financial sector returns to its previous size, law firms may recover some of the positions lost to a decrease in transactional work, but that is unlikely to occur in the near future, Nanda said.
Nanda and Wilkins both say that associates can expect that much of their bread and butter work will be outsourced in the future, potentially decreasing demand for associates.
“There are alternate of forms of delivery for that type of work,” Nanda said. “Discovery and other large volume work will likely go to India and the Philippines.”
According to Wilkins, the bottom line is this: associates can expect to see lower entry-level salaries.
“Some of my students might not appreciate this, but I think it’s a good thing,” he said with a laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for the use of “soft power” to resolve conflict among eastern, western, and Islamic civilizations and outlined nine global “imperatives” for promoting peace and prosperity in the 21st century in a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday evening.
“Cross-fertilizations of cultures can produce something wonderful,” Yudhoyono told the full-capacity audience. “The more we exchange cultures and ideas, the more we learn from one another, and the more we cooperate and spread goodwill, the closer we are to world peace.”
Indonesia is currently home to more Muslims than any other country in the world—over 200 million—and Yudhoyono touted the nation as emblematic of the potential success of democratic governments in the region.
Indonesia’s flavor of Islam is generally considered to be less austere than that of some Middle Eastern nations, and Yudhoyono’s government has succeeded in appealing to the moderate majority in an effort to undermine the political power of Islamic extremists.
“We can be a powerful example that Islam, democracy, and modernity can go hand in hand,” he said.
But the country has not been immune from the turmoil of extremist violence. As recently as July, bombers attacked two luxury hotels in Jakarta, killing at least nine and injuring over 50.
Throughout his remarks, Yudhoyono sought to characterize the future of international relations as one of peace and the mutual exchange of ideas. But he also drew attention to the shift in the global balance of powers away from Europe and toward Asia, whose economic growth in recent years has spurred calls for greater world recognition. Indonesia’s economy grew at a rate of over 6 percent in the past year.
One of Yudhoyono’s nine “imperatives” included a proposal to restructure the United Nations Security Council, in which four of the five countries with veto power are western nations.
Drawing a parallel between his remarks and President Barack Obama’s address to the Islamic world at Cairo University this summer, Yudhoyono said that America should continue to play a pivotal role in international relations. Even if the age of American dominance has ended, he said, the United States should exert economic, social, and political influence to “help make the world anew.”
Although Yudhoyono’s message of cooperation and global progress resonated with many audience members, some said they were disappointed by his lack of specificity, especially on how to solve the growing problem of global factionalism.
“He was very idealistic,” said Maxwell D.A. Dikkers ’13. “But he does seem to have a great vision of what he wants to get done.”

Overweight women still stand to gain much in long-term health if they maintain their above-average weight instead of letting more pounds pile on, according to findings from a Harvard study published today.
The study—the first to analyze the effect of obesity on overall health for women who lived through 70—also found that obesity early in adulthood typically led to moderately worse health far later in life,
The research suggests that longevity hinges in part on women maintaining an optimal body mass starting in their 20s and 30s, said Qi Sun ’07, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“To really enjoy optimal health status at age 70 or higher, women should keep a healthy body weight since very young adulthood and maintain that,” said Sun, whose research was inspired by a similar study on male Japanese-Americans in Hawaii. He said he wanted to see if the same trend appeared in women given that they live longer than men and they have a higher Body Mass Index.
Utilizing the ongoing Nurses’ Health Study, which periodically surveys over 120,000 registered nurses via questionnaires, Sun and his research team tracked and analyzed data for 17,000 nurses from 1976 to 2000. He searched for trends in multiple aspects of health, from physical and cognitive function to mental health and chronic diseases.
His findings suggest that women should begin making decisions with an eye to their long-term health as soon as they enter adulthood.
“No matter what your weight is now, focus on maintaining your weight at every level,” said Soheyla D. Gharib, chief of medicine at University Heath Services. “When you’re overweight at age 18, it seems like there aren’t going to be more changes [to your weight]—I think people are not aware of that. There’s a market out there about joining weight loss programs and taking pills, and while those may be quick fixes, in general, it’s hard to go back.”
According to Gharib, the impact of the study is the emphasis on trying to maintain body weight as opposed to allowing the weight to increase if someone is already overweight. Part of that maintenance, as Sun recommends, is moderate to rigorous physical activity and keeping total calorie intake low.
Additionally, Gharib said that there are nutritionists on campus whom students may access if they have concerns about their weight. For those who express serious weight concerns, Harvard has group informational meeting slots that provide a foundation in nutrition.
“These are important life-long skills,” said Gharib. “You’re building your foundation during your college years for later life. [When it comes to health,] there’s no makeup test.”

Something rarely seen on Harvard’s sidewalks: dinosaurs, starfish, and mollusks. In chalk, that is.
Yesterday, on a bright and sunny afternoon, Sidewalk Sam, a Boston-based artist most recognized for his chalked sidewalk murals, collaborated with Harvard Museum of Natural History to draw a timeline of the earth’s 4.6 billion year history and the diversity of life forms that existed during these eras.
The mural project began to materialize when a graduate student in paleontology, Ben Kotrc, met Sidewalk Sam during the summer at an event. The project attracted young children of all ages and encouraged students to marvel at the foreign life forms created by the artist and other collaborators.
The fossils were drawn in distinctive hues such as saturated blue, orange and yellow, and drew the attention of many passers-by. While the depictions of these fossils are inaccurate as far as the color scheme is concerned, they nevertheless add a colorful flourish to what some may find stodgy subject matter.
“We want the Harvard community to think like naive third graders again,” said Sidewalk Sam. His desire to reignite a sense of wonder and engagement in the history of the natural universe certainly echoes the wishes of the life science community at Harvard.
“We want to get people at Harvard more enthusiastic and involved in the Life Sciences,” said Hann-Shuin Yew ‘10, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator and a member of the Harvard Undergraduate Biological Sciences Society.
The mural will undoubtedly disappear with the elements, but its creators say they hope any observer’s newfound curiosity in natural history won’t fade away with it.

CORRECTION APPENDED
The Student Life Fund, created by the College administration last year to fund House formals and student organization travel, may see its mission change after its distribution last year is reevaluated by College officials.
On Sunday, UC Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11 sent an e-mail telling UC representatives to warn HoCos, who plan house formals, that the $1250 a semester allocated to each House by the Student Life Fund, may not be available this year.
The $75,000 fund, which is jointly administered by the College Dean’s office and the UC, was temporarily halted at the end of last year due to financial uncertainty, according to former UC Treasurer Anthony R. Britt ’10.
“The [fund] is not frozen,” said Paul J. McLoughlin, Assistant Dean of the College. “It is budgeted for this year in the College’s budget.”
McLoughlin said that the administration would like to review how the fund was used last year before releasing the funds for this year.
“We actually need to see how the money was used [and] see what difference it made,” he said. Depending on the conclusions of that assessment, the fund “may have a different mission this year.”
According to Britt, the requested financial report was submitted Monday. He estimated that the administration will make a decision on the future of the fund by November.
“In terms of the full year, [HoCos should] be able to get some funding, though it definitely won’t be as much as it was last year,” he said.
Leverett House HoCo co-chair Jordan F. Bock ’10 said she is not worried about the potential reduction in funds.
“As long as we plan well, we’ll be fine,” she said.
The fund also had a goal of funding “unique” travel for student organizations, according to Paraszczak, with $45,000 of the fund allocated towards that purpose.
Britt said the UC gave out travel grants from the fund to about 30 student organizations last year, totaling in approximately $19,000.
The Queer Students Association was one of the groups that benefitted from the travel grants. According to QSA co-chair Marco Chan ’11, the grant covered travel expenses for himself and two other board members to travel to New York for a conference with Ivy League LGBT leaders.
“Even just small expenses like $15 one-way bus tickets, which might seem insignificant to other people, is really important to the financial sustainability of student organizations,” Chan said.
Britt said the remaining $26,000 from last year’s fund will be distributed by the College as it sees fit.

The original version of the Sept. 30 news article "Student Life Fund May Be Redirected" incorrectly referred to Jordan F. Bock ’10 as the Adams House HoCo co-chair. In fact, Bock is the HoCo co-chair of Leverett House.

After last night’s 2-0 victory over Holy Cross, Harvard women’s soccer coach Ray Leone may need to bring in a doctor from UHS to check if his team is suffering from bipolar disorder.
Nine games into the season, Harvard (3-5-1, 1-0 Ivy) has been a team with two faces. On the road, the Crimson’s record is 0-4. But with junior Caroline Kutler and senior Christina Hagner’s first half goals, the Crimson showed its other face last night, defeating Holy Cross (5-4-1) under the lights at Cumnock Turf and improving its home record to 3-1-1.
While the Crusaders came out firing in the game’s opening minutes, Harvard’s defense came up strong on several occasions to keep Holy Cross off the scoreboard. After Harvard withheld the initial onslaught, it managed to generate advantageous offensive opportunities as well.
Unlike the Crusaders, Harvard was able to capitalize on them.
Holy Cross’ first scoring opportunity arose just eight minutes into the contest. With Harvard senior goalie Lauren Mann on the ground after diving for a ball, it looked as if the Crusaders had an open shot on goal.
But sophomore defender Lindsey Kowal, a member of the United States Under-23 Women’s National Team, dove to the ball just in time to knock it away.
“[The defense] was compact,” Kowal said. “Everyone was really on their game [and] physical, which is good.”
Holy Cross’s next scoring opportunity came five minutes later when senior forward Shelby Stand, who leads the Patriot League in goals-per-game, fired a shot that ricocheted off the corner post flying out of bounds.
For the Crimson, defending Stand was of the upmost importance.
“She’s big and strong so we made sure that someone was in front of her and keeping an eye on her throughout the game,” Kowal said.
Harvard struck blood first in the 25th minute when Kutler finished a play that left fans impressed. After sophomore Melanie Baskind crossed the ball into the box, junior Katherine Sheeleigh tipped it behind her to Cutler, who sent the ball through the hands of Holy Cross goalie Mary Ferketic.
“I just found [the ball] in the box,” said Kutler. “I just wanted to put it away.”
Kutler continued on to orchestrate the Crimson’s second scoring opportunity seven minutes later. Kutler dribbled the ball up the left side of the field but was quickly trapped by a Crusader defender on the sideline. Cradling the ball with her back to the defender, Kutler wrapped the ball around and created enough space to get a pass off to Hagner as she cut to the goal. Hagner faked one way, then shot the other and planted the ball in the right corner of the net to give the Harvard a commanding 2-0 lead.
Hagner, who plays both forward and midfielder, led the Crimson last season in scoring. The California native, however, missed significant playing time at the beginning of this season with an injury to her left knee. But Hagner returned to her old ways last night as she scored her second goal of the season and her second goal against the Crusaders in as many years.
“Since this weekend against Penn, I’ve felt 100%,” Hagner said. “I feel like I can do everything that I want to do on the ball. I’m not debilitated in any way.”
After a slow start this season in which Harvard took away only a single victory in its first seven matches, the Crimson appears to have righted the ship, winning its Ivy League opener against Penn last weekend.
“In general I think our team is really starting to come together,” Hagner said.
To achieve another consecutive 10-win season, Harvard will have to win its next seven matches starting with Ivy rival Yale this Saturday.
“We really needed another win to solidify,” Kutler said. “We had a rocky start to the beginning of the season and I’m just so excited to go into Yale with this win. I hope we can kick some butt this weekend.”

Although the men’s basketball season officially begins in a month and a half, well under way is a different sort of competition—the unending battle for recruits—and for once in its not-so-illustrious history, Harvard hoops appears to be ahead of the pack.
The difference, of course, has been the arrival of coach Tommy Amaker over two years ago.
Interestingly enough, for all the uproar about his recruiting tactics, Amaker’s first collection of rookies failed to take the league by storm. Hampered by injuries,  last year’s freshmen played more of a supporting role than a starring one.
This could all change with the next two groups of recruits.
Highly-touted prospect Kyle Casey, who spurned Stanford and Vanderbilt in favor of the Crimson, headlines a quintet of talents—all noted on the national scene—who should be ready to play immediately.
The scary thing is—the potential class of 2014 looks to be even better.
One of the biggest highlights of Amaker’s coaching tenure, right up there with the upset victories over Michigan and Boston College, came this past weekend, when five major recruits made visits to Cambridge.
The fact that Dwight Powell is even considering joining the Crimson is an accomplishment in its own right for Amaker and his staff. The 6’10”, 205 lb Canadian native is a Scout.com four-star recruit, ranked consistently among the top dozen centers in the nation, and has drawn attention from UCLA and Cal.
Throughout the summer, Stanford was thought to be Powell’s top choice—a sentiment corroborated by positive reports following his visit to the Palo Alto, Calif., campus.
Evidently, his recent trip to the East Coast made an impression.
“He left with Harvard and Stanford neck-and-neck,” one Crimson player said.
Powell is declining to make any more statements until he has completed his October visit to Georgia Tech, the remaining member of his final trio of schools. Powell said that a decision would come likely after that.
A fellow inhabitant of the top tier of hoopsters nationwide, Rod Odom has Harvard on his mind, too.
The identity of Odom’s future destination has been rife with rumors, as might be expected with a 6’9”, 210 lb prospect carrying offers from Louisville and UConn.
Having earned a four star rating from Rivals.com, the small forward took a visit to Arizona the weekend before last. Odom and his father came away with plenty of good things to say, which had led some to believe he would soon commit to the Wildcats.
What Odom is most committed to, however, is taking his time.
According to his father, a veteran of the recruiting circuit, Odom’s top four destinations are still Arizona, Harvard, Boston College, and either Vanderbilt or West Virginia.
Odom will be making a visit to Boston College this coming weekend, and a decision could be possible following the trip, but it would not be surprising if it took longer.
Impressive physical specimens and versatile threats on the hardwood, Powell and Odom would constitute tremendous coups by Harvard if either were to commit. They are the caliber of player the likes of which the Ivy League rarely encounters, but as always, it remains to be seen where the prospects end up.
The picture is much clearer with the other three visitors of the weekend.
Austin Carroll, a 6’3” shooting guard out of New Hampshire’s Brewster Academy, is rated at an 84 by ESPN, and was complimented by members of the Crimson for his on-court feel and sharp-shooting ability during workouts with the team.
As of yet, his other option appears to be Rutgers, a visit to which will be taking place in the upcoming weeks. Though Carroll himself did not comment, Harvard has been called his leader.
“Very impressive what they have done in the past few years,” Carroll said through text message.
Ugo Okam has confirmed that Harvard is currently his top choice. A raw prospect with outstanding athletic ability, Okam is a 250-lb seven-footer who would provide the Crimson with a front-court force to be reckoned with. Following visits to Vanderbilt and Loyola Marymount, he will have a decision next month.
Another high-major prospect, Majok Majok was unable to be reached for comment, but multiple sources believe his current favorite is Harvard. The rugged 230-lb power forward grades at an 86 according to ESPN. He places a high value on academics, because “we’ll all someday have to take off our jerseys and go into the work force,” he said via text.
This past weekend was recognized around the country as a major moment for the Crimson program. If coach Amaker gets his way, Harvard basketball will be put on the map not only for a couple of days in September, but for many years to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer’s high school yearbook quote says it all: “Trust me, I can handle anything.”
These words, spoken by Legally Blonde’s Elle Woods, describe Fryhofer well. However, the six-foot-tall blonde Harvardian isn’t worried about getting into law school just yet. Right now, the Atlanta, Ga. native is focused on surviving her sophomore year and leading the Harvard women’s volleyball team to victory.
Fryhofer stars as a middle blocker for the on-again-off-again Crimson, which currently posts a 4-8 record. Yet, despite the immense time commitment that comes with membership in Harvard’s Varsity community, volleyball has hardly been Fryhofer’s sole interest.
In addition to daily practices and a hefty game schedule, the sophomore also participates in the Institute of Politics’ Citizenship Tutoring Program and the LowKeys A Cappella group.
Like so many college freshmen that become overwhelmed by the cornucopia of booths at the fall activities fair, Fryhofer bit off a bit more than she could chew. Albeit attending Atlanta’s Westminster School, the Georgian’s transition to collegiate life was less than smooth due to a heavy extracurricular overload.
“I would have volleyball from 3 to 6, and then we would have [a cappella] practice from 7-10,” Fryhofer said. “I would have class all in the morning, so I would just have maybe an hour during the day to do work. And I couldn’t go to bed too late because I was in season—it was really hard.”
Similar problems affect many Crimson athletes, who find it difficult to balance life beyond athletics. Fryhofer has begun this year with a compromise, giving herself a break from a cappella until the spring semester, when the competitive volleyball season will have ended.
However, even with her team’s Ivy League season just beginning, Fryhofer is beginning to stand out. The middle blocker has already set career highs in aces, digs and kills, registering twelve kills in multiple games this year.
Fryhofer’s twin brother George, a walk-on to the Varsity lightweight crew team that discovered Harvard on one of his sister’s early recruiting visits, notes her athletic prowess.
“She thrives in that kind of competitive environment,” George Fryofer said. “She can really help if something’s not going right to bring the team back together. Any sport I’ve ever seen her play, she seems to put everything into.”
While the female Fryhofer and volleyball appear to be a perfect fit, her decision to play was hardly instinctual. The sophomore was also renowned on her high school’s basketball court where she was a four-time letter winner. Fryhofer was captain of the basketball team her junior and senior years, and, as a freshman, helped lead her team to the Georgia State Final Four Tournament.
Yet, for Fryhofer, something with volleyball clicked. Although she stayed in contact with the coaches of both the Crimson’s basketball and volleyball teams, Fryhofer had made decided in her second year of high school to pursue volleyball.
“Volleyball is different from other sports because it’s a game of strategy,” Fryhofer said. “It’s more of a team sport, [and] it’s a lot less stress on your body than basketball.”
George approves of his twin sister’s decision.
“She seemed to enjoy volleyball a lot,” George Fryhofer said. “In volleyball, she was a little bit more in her element.”
Fryhofer also appears to be in her element at Harvard, where she has flourished both on and off the court. In addition to her plethora of extracurricular activities, the pre-law sophomore will be concentrating in Government and is pursing a citation in Spanish.
Fryhofer is also interested in health policy in Latin America, and spent this past summer working for a healthy policy think tank at the Center for Disease Control.
While hoping one day to attend Harvard Law School, the sophomore is currently concentrating on running over Dartmouth—like she could in the Hummer that she drives at home—this coming Friday.
For the multitalented, singing, spiking Fryhofer, the future is wide open.

Most loyal viewers of NBC's "Heroes" are well aware that the show has spiraled downward into a convoluted mess over the past two seasons. Between the excess of characters, nonsensical and repetitive plotlines, and the fact that continuity has been completely shot to hell, FlyBy is seriously hoping for an upward turn. Perhaps the volume's title "Redemption" is self-referential, but after watching this week's episode, we aren't getting our hopes up.
Spoilers abound, so beware.
Claire internally debates whether or not to tell her friend about her power/Daddy is interfering but he only wants to protect! his ClaireBear. As always.
Last week Claire let herself fall out her bedroom window, proving that her hyper-achieving roommate actually committed suicide and was not pushed. However, her friend-slash-stalker Gretchen happened to witness her healing. Oops.
Claire spends the entire episode avoiding Gretchen, whining about how she wants to trust someone and stop hiding the truth, while battling overprotective Daddy Noah Bennett along the way.
The Good: Claire finally stands up for herself; Claire bitches about orgo; we see a shirtless guy reflected in the mirror of the coed bathroom.
The Bad: Claire's whining about wanting to be herself and stop lying is getting really annoying and redundant. We sympathize, but enough is enough.
The WTF?: Noah Bennett never gives in that easily. NEVER.
Matt Parkman is totally losing it and seeing visions of Sylar because he just feels SO SO GUILTY about putting him in Nathan Petrelli's body. Or is he?
Matt Parkman is out on the job as a cop trying to shake down some drug dealer. But that's not important. What's important is that while inside this guy's house, Sylar shows up and starts totally screwing with Parkman's mind, in some cases saving his ass and in others making him see things that aren't there. But since, of course, the department doesn't know he's a telepath, Parkman has been telling everyone he's trying to kick the habit of "using."
The Good: Sylar and Matt's hilarious rapport; Sylar telling Matt that the dealer was in the closet and had a gun--and being correct; Matt finally using his powers again.
The Bad: Can't Sylar do something on his own, already?
The WTF?: Wait, we thought Sylar was just evidence that Matt was losing it. Is he real now? Is he just a figment of Matt's imagination? We're seriously confused.
Peter Petrelli gets sued but not really because it's the Samuel the carnival-ink guy trying to find him and use him to replace his brother, and oh wait, he also meets this new deaf girl who can hear colors. WTF?
So. There's this new guy, Samuel, whom we met last week, who can control ink, but his actual described power is to control the earth. He wants to find someone to replace his dead brother within his entourage at the carnival. So he goes after Peter Petrelli by pretending to be someone he previously saved and suing him for injuries. They bond. And simultaneously we are introduced to a new character Emma, who is deaf but can apparently see sound in the form of colors. At the end, Samuel collapses a big fancy house into a sinkhole.
The WTF?: This entire storyline. Maybe we weren't paying close enough attention, but we still don't totally understand what the deal is with Samuel.
OVERALL RATING THIS WEEK: B-
Most badass hero: Sylar. Hands down.
Most useless hero: Emma. Seeing sound as colors is kind of a cool effect, but we wish she could have done something interesting with it this week.
Character whom we wish had been killed off a while ago: Claire. Notice how she NEVER asks Gretchen about herself? That's because it's ALWAYS about Claire and how important she is and how hard it is to be her, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, given the rapid cellular regeneration thing, we're guessing we're stuck with her. Forever.

The art of sexile: It's perhaps the most sacred of all college maxims, the unspoken code of conduct that keeps lusty teenagers and cramped dorm rooms at peace.
Yet, students at our favorite Medford safety school seem to have had some trouble accepting and adhering to this age-old social decree—prompting administrators to lay down some intimacy rules:
A new addition to the Tufts student guest policy states:
Furthermore:
It's hard to imagine how this will be enforced, although the handbook says that "actions will be properly documented and subject to residential judicial consequences. Any flagrant violation [...] will result in immediate loss of guest privileges for a specified time period."
See how they're justifying the policy after the jump.
According to The Tufts Daily, the new policy was triggered by a "significant number of complaints last year from residents bothered by their roommates' social behavior," and the Tufts Office of Residential Life and Learning's assistant director told the newspaper that the incidents "happened more often than we'd like." But the Office emphasized that the new policy was aimed more at "facilitat[ing] conversation and compromise between roommates" than hindering "personal or private activity."
Seriously? Has there really been such a broach of civility to necessitate formal, explicit intervention? Cue student backlash:
"I don't believe it's the university's place to determine what goes on in a room," Freshman Jon Levinson told the Associated Press. "Personally, I wouldn't want to have sex in front of my roommate, and my roommate wouldn't want to have sex in front of me."
FlyBy sure hopes so—as much as Tufts bores us, we'd rather not learn that it's secretly become a breeding ground for voyeurism.

How could an episode of House called “Epic Fail” not be worth watching?! Unless of course it turned out to describe the plot...but FlyBy thinks not.
Recap and ratings after the jump. Yes, there are spoilers.
For the first couple of minutes, FlyBy was a little anxious: we weren’t really sure why there was a video game demo in place of a medical drama involving a misanthropic doctor who just got out of rehab. But don’t worry! All’s well!
Well, not really, because one of the designers of the video game has a few problems. He feels that his hands are burning; his lungs fill up with fluids; and oh, he also has a painful (we were not surprised) erection for three hours (?!). Gregory House has seen worse. But he’s too busy finding new hobbies, cooking meatballs, and making juvenile jokes about male genitalia with Wilson.
Wilson: Oh! Ow. No, no. They're browning way too fast.
House: Blue is the color you've got to watch out for.
*snicker snicker*
We thought that was funny. A little. Come on. You know you did, too.
House also quits his job. And the moment House leaves the room, Foreman (shocker) asks Cuddy to let him run the department. Cuddy asks him to take this case to see if he can handle the pressure. At that point, FlyBy was seething. But we also knew where the title of the episode came from.
WHAT AN EPIC FAIL.
Foreman makes several poor decisions when the patient posts his symptoms online and offers a $25,000 reward to anyone who can correctly diagnose him. Finally, the team diagnoses him with amyloidosis. Foreman has a dejected conversation with Thirteen about whether he’s ready for the responsibilities of the promotion when Thirteen tries to cheer him up by detailing her bisexual exploits. Wait, WTF?!
And just when you think everything is fine and dandy, the patient goes crazy and hallucinates again. Clearly, they were wrong. Foreman asks her to start him on chemotherapy. Later, he has a brainwave and runs up to Thirteen to tell her to stop. But she already has figured it out (correctly this time), after reading the online diagnoses.
Even though he told her not to. Uh-oh.
Later, he tells her that he finds it too hard to manage both the relationship and his promotion. Is he going to break up with her? No. He’s going to fire her. UH-OH.
In the meanwhile, Taub resigns because House isn’t around. UH-OH.
While shit goes down in Princeton-Plainsboro, House is sitting back and having a conversation with his therapist with--voila!--a check for $25,000 made by correctly diagnosing his old team’s patient. Medical diagnosis seems to be the only reliever of House’s pain.
In conclusion:
House is BACK. But he’s not the same. He’s not the same narcissist he used to be. No scathing comments. In fact, FlyBy doesn’t know whether we like him as much as we used to.
On a scale of 1-10:
The diagnosis: 6 (FlyBy doesn’t really like Foreman right now)
Sub-plots: 9 (Thirteen?! Taub?!)
House: 9 (“Et tu, bootay?”)
Overall: 8
Epic Fail? Nope.

Whichever students and other members of the community felt like stopping by helped contribute to the chalk drawing along the concrete driveway lining the lawn in front of the museum. FlyBy found the walk through time, though done with simple materials, to be epic in its own right. It has not been washed away by the dust of time yet, so if you have the time, it is worth checking out.
"The idea is to just highlight the amazing history of life on earth and just have fun and combine art and science into a community project," said event organizer and EPS graduate student Phoebe A. Cohen.
Sidewalk Sam, a 70-year-old Boston-area artist, helped rally the troops of science nerds and other lovers of the origins of life who came out for the event. He said that he was glad to headline the event because it represents three different ages—the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and GCenozoic—which together encompass hundreds of millions of years in the history of life.
Sam explained in an interview that though he originally hoped to become a painter, in his late 20s he "began to see a problem with traditional painting."

Sam, who then still went by Bob Guillemin, decided to try to do both sidewalk painting and regular painting, but the art world shunned him, he said. "The art world said, 'Wait, you want us to sell your art in the gallery, and then at the same time you're doing art on the ground for free in chalk. It disappears. We can't have you doing art on the sidewalk.'"
Then, when 30, "I made the cataclysmic decision to go with the sidewalks and ignore art as I was brought up to do," he said.
Sam explained that he has made his living by spending 15 to 20 percent of his time painting portraits for corporations and individuals, and also by applying for grants and stipends, but otherwise he has done what he enjoys most: sidewalk art.
The event cost about $4,000, mostly for supplies which the museum mostly paid for, according to Cohen, one of the event's organizers. The General Education program, which advertised the event on its Web site and Twitter, contributed about $300.

Monday morning, Kirkland House Master Tom Conley sent out a curious e-mail over the house list on behalf of a "transfer" who, it seems, couldn't type the e-mail for himself. It went like this:
I am a transfer having recently moved into an apartment adjacent to N-21.  My roommate is Jesse.  I am very excited about meeting and sharing meals with everyone at the House.  Looking forward to the good company of K-House,
--Max
A cryptic e-mail, indeed. Who is this Max, and how dare he presumptuously talk of sharing meals and other such intimations? Find out after the jump:
The answer: Max is a 15 lb. male dog. Supposedly, he's only nine-weeks-old, and you know what that means.
Check out the living ball of adorable fur, rollicking in grass that might as well wilt and die of shame from being in the same picture of Max and his lustrous black coat. Look at how he daintily lifts a paw, as his dark eyes sit like deep wells in the face of a poet. What a creature!
Ahem, sorry, FlyBy was a little taken. But it seems like the rest of Kirkland House is, too. One resident claimed that she was prepared to carry Max to UHS for "Furry Cuteness Overdose," and another resident cooed:

Year after year, the admissions office waxes poetic about the virtues of a "well-rounded class"—a class whose members have every expertise imaginable, from the International Math Olympian to the internationally ranked pole vaulter. And for the most part, they must have succeeded: everyone has a friend of a friend with an obscure talent honed to perfection.
Not so, says Mariah Carey. "Up Out My Face," released from her upcoming album, takes a swipe at the Lego skillz of this year's senior class:
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn’t put us back together again.

Flyby would be flabbergasted if no one in the class of 2010 spent a childhood building edifices to humanity from these interlocking bricks. And the seniors may not take those lyrics sitting down, if Class Marshal Shiv M. Gaglani '10 is to be believed:
And if not, Mariah, look no further than that tech school downriver.
