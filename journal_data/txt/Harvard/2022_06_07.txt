After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
George Miller’s “Three Thousand Years of Longing” brought a dose of rose-tinted romance to the 2022 Cannes Film Festival when it debuted on May 20, marking a sharp divergence from the darker, more serious tone of the festival lineup so far. Miller’s new film offers adults what Disney fairy tales give children: a lyrical, awe-inspiring escape into a disconnected world where universal emotions — love, obsession, cruelty, grief — are heightened to the utmost drama on a backdrop of surreal beauty. The movie is a spectacle of technical excellence, from dynamic editing and sharp cinematography to enchanting set pieces, but there’s little meaning behind the magic. At its heart, the film is thematically underwhelming, delivering only a trite tribute to the power of storytelling while failing to say anything new.
That’s not to claim “Three Thousand Years” isn’t a fun, deliriously vivid ride. Tilda Swinton plays Alithea, a scholar and narratologist (a title so whimsical, one wonders why more Harvard professors haven’t embraced it) who takes a work trip to Istanbul and unwittingly buys an antique bottle containing an ancient Djinn spirit (Idris Elba). When she accidentally releases the Djinn into her hotel room, he begs her to name three wishes so he can grant them and be free — but she’s heard enough cautionary tales about impulsive requests to know better. While she considers potential wishes, he recounts the millennium-spanning story of how he came to be trapped in the bottle.
As the Djinn speaks, Miller illustrates his stories with his hallmark grandiosity and vibrant flair, carrying viewers from tumultuous royal courts to bloody battlefields, arid deserts, and the depths of the ocean. Cinematographer John Seale present a visual feast with every shot, and the production design and visual effects (helmed by Roger Ford and Paul Butterworth, respectively) work in lockstep to make every space lift off the screen, whether it’s the palace of Murad IV (Kaan Guldur) or the attic apartment of the Djinn’s genius lover Zefir (Burcu Gölgedar). As the film flips back and forth between ancient realms and the contemporary hotel room where Alithea sits listening, the contrasting chaos and stillness of the past and present bolster the film’s aesthetic immersion.
It’s a fairy tale to match the best of them — and, true to form, a romance soon blossoms. As the Djinn’s story sparks Alithea’s curiosity, their probing conversation brings them together in a fittingly poetic, if obvious, lover’s arc. But the predictability of the film’s third-act progression doesn’t reduce its watchability because the whole movie has the atmosphere and pace of a fable winding its way toward a poetic but played-out end. More broadly, none of its highly conventional elements hurt its digestibility — with all its period-era melodrama, eccentric historical characters making minute-long appearances, and mind-bending camera work, “Three Thousand Years” is one of the most highly-watchable films of the festival, sure to be a crowd-pleaser in theaters.
But this palatability comes at a cost. Though it was billed as a scaled-down, conversation-driven study of two characters falling in love through storytelling, the film is too busy hurtling through years of historical betrayals and tumultuous monarchs to slow down and develop Alithea and the Djinn’s connection beyond their superficial similarities. Their romance has the depth of a Disney princess’; it’s eternal love at first sight, which stands out as abrupt and hollow in a grown-up narrative.
As co-writer Augusta Gore discussed in a Cannes press conference, the film’s narrative-within-a-narrative format was intended to celebrate storytelling as an art form and an emotional unifier. As an expression of that theme, the film’s concept is extremely, even frustratingly, straightforward. It depicts storytelling in the sense that it literally follows a genie telling a story, but its exploration of narrative impact ends with Alithea’s quickly-proclaimed love. The film fails to provide a profound, insightful, or fresh take on stories or art. Its narration-brought-to-life structure has been done and redone many times before, from “Big Fish” to “The Princess Bride” to “Amadeus,” and it rings hollow without well-conveyed secondary themes, complicating factors, or further messages to bolster its resonance.
“Three Thousand Years”’ thematic flimsiness is particularly striking because it is premiering at Cannes alongside many smaller films that more creatively and poignantly examine the importance of narrative and the interpersonal power of art, from “Coupez !” to “El Agua” and Holy Spider. These films are not necessarily better, nor do they achieve the technical scale of “Three Thousand Years” — but they do explore age-old questions of storytelling, audience and human connection from fresh angles, and they’re carried forward by the urgency of their yet-untold stories. “Three Thousand Years” does not feel timely or relevant. In fact, with the broad appeal and mindless moral stakes of a superhero film, it doesn’t feel tethered to any time, place, or perspective at all. And aren’t those the hallmarks of a lasting story?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a moment early in “Don Juan,” Serge Bozon’s sparse new musical adaptation of the classic tale, when the clarity of the basic premise becomes muddled. A gaggle of French thirty-somethings seemingly attending a failed wedding wander outside into the venue lobby, where their matching tote bags suddenly suggest that they’re attending some kind of corporate function instead. Is this even a wedding? Why is everyone so curt and professional; are they actually businessmen attending a pharmaceutical convention? The impersonal atmosphere that Bozon immediately cultivates would be more suitable for the latter, and it might fit perfectly with a gray-hued tale of corporate ennui — but it’s jarringly mismatched with the grandiose drama Bozon tries to construct. Though “Don Juan” tries to develop its barebones plot and simple stakes into a profound statement on chauvinism, it’s flattened under the weight of its underwhelming script and execution, making for an empty viewing experience.
The script opens on the aforementioned event, which is indeed a wedding — although it doesn’t go to plan, because Laurent (Tahar Rahim), the film’s modern stand-in for the infamous womanizer Don Juan, is left at the altar by his beloved Julie (Virginie Efira). As viewers see in a confusing, under-explained scene outside the wedding venue, Julie had second thoughts after seeing the way her fiance ogled a female pedestrian as he leaned out the venue window, scanning for his bride. Predicting his infidelity, she flees the scene. He’s heartbroken, as evidenced by the soulful, lyrically shaky ballad he breaks into. So goes the middling musical aspect of the film, which emerges at random moments when characters suddenly burst into mediocre songs. By the time Laurent arrives in the seaside town where he’s booked to perform as Don Juan in a prestigious stage production, the audience is well-acquainted with his tormented wallowing, as well as the strange mental condition it has prompted. He sees Julie’s face on the body of every woman he runs into, causing countless moments of confusion and fear as he confronts, grabs, and propositions random strangers he is convinced are his ex.
This is where the film becomes alienatingly hard to watch, as it devolves into a bizarre musical about an unlikeable man terrorizing women on the street. Many great films have revolved around terrible men, from Mike Leigh’s “Naked” to the Safdie brothers’ “Uncut Gems,” but “Don Juan” lacks the self-awareness, depth, or realism to pull off an entertaining drama or a substantive critique. Instead, Laurent appears as a skeletal character, lacking any real motivation or complexity beside his fixation on Julie — which, audiences are supposed to believe, belies a true disregard for monogamy or commitment. Yet Bozon never actually illustrates Laurent’s philandering ways or unreliability in a relationship, as his worst offense is occasionally staring at other women. Aside from the fact that his aforementioned problem of seeing his girlfriend’s face everywhere could explain his staring, the film’s insistence that he’s a consummate “Don Juan” because he occasionally checks out women feels ridiculous. He’s horrible for weirder reasons (he compulsively harasses women!), but the film constantly tries to get its audience to sympathize with his predicament, reiterating that he’s confused and devastated by Julie’s abandonment.
When Julie eventually returns to Laurent’s life after being cast opposite him in “Don Juan,” it feels like the latest exhausting turn in a film that desperately wants to make its central character more interesting and universal than he is. After all, the film was created as an inversion of the classical story, meant to reframe Don Juan’s trademark womanizing as the source of misery and desperation in a man’s life. Indeed, Bozon constructs Laurent as a character tormented by his own wandering eye — but his literal wandering eye is as far as his infidelity goes, and the extreme pendulum-swing of his misery and euphoria bring over-exaggerated melodrama to the punishingly simple narrative.
By its finale, the film has barely expanded on the idea introduced in its opening: A man constantly scoping out women will never be able to maintain a meaningful relationship. It’s not a bad hook for a reimagination of “Don Juan,” but the film fails to deepen its ideas or give its characters dimensionality and texture in their portrayal. To its credit, though, the film is gorgeously shot with strikingly unique locations and solid performances from Rahim and Efira, but the beautiful visuals can’t save it from the atmosphere of superficial wretchedness that pervades each moment. Neither can the nearly unlistenable musical numbers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council selected Yi-An Huang ’05 to serve as the next city manager on Monday, concluding a months-long search to hire the city’s next top official.
Following more than two hours of public comment and discussion, the Council voted 8-1 to offer the position to Huang — currently the executive director of clinical operations at the Boston Medical Center — during a Monday evening meeting.
Huang will replace outgoing city manager Louis A. DePasquale.
Huang was chosen from among four finalists for the position, who were selected by a screening committee of residents and city councilors. The other three finalists were Iram Farooq, Cambridge’s assistant city manager for community development; Norman Khumalo, town manager of Hopkinton, Mass.; and Cheryl Watson Fisher, city solicitor of Chelsea, Mass., and a former assistant city solicitor in Cambridge.
Councilors Marc C. McGovern, Paul F. Toner, and E. Denise Simmons initially voted for Watson Fisher. Following an initial tally, McGovern and Toner changed their votes from Watson Fisher to Huang.
During the Monday meeting, the Council also unanimously appointed Owen O’Riordan, the current commissioner of Cambridge’s Department of Public Works, to serve as interim city manager after DePasquale retires on July 5.
Huang, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, was lauded by several neighbors, colleagues, and friends during public comment. Several described Huang’s decision to house three teenage Afghan refugees; one shared that Huang regularly picked up groceries for her while she recovered from a stroke.
Many councilors echoed the praise.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who led the search process, said in the meeting that Huang best fit the “leadership profile” released in March describing the position of city manager.
“When I look at this leadership profile and who is our ideal candidate, for me, Yi-An Huang meets every bullet point here, both professionally and personally,” Mallon said.
The story of Huang picking up groceries for an elderly neighbor “was, for me, just the culmination of everything I had heard about him and his family, his humility, his warmth, his grace, his intelligence,” Mallon said.
Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 praised Huang’s leadership and communication skills and said she admired his work bringing telehealth to the Boston Medical Center in just 14 days during the Covid-19 pandemic, instead of the three-year plan previously laid out by the hospital.
“I believe he is a candidate who will bring a fresh perspective, to bring progressive change,” Nolan said. “He has a demonstrated ability to get things done and to do things urgently.”
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said she believed Huang would meet the standards for the next city manager laid out by “residents and stakeholders” during the public engagement period of the search.
“They wanted someone who has experienced tackling complex problems and has effectively led large diverse organizations,” Siddiqui said. “It was made clear that the next manager needs to be experienced in inclusive leadership, be forward-thinking, be progressive and collaborative.”
“These are criteria that I believe Mr. Huang has proven that he meets,” she added.
Several residents and councilors also spoke in favor of Watson Fisher, praising her deep roots in Cambridge’s The Port neighborhood and her lived experience as a Black woman, in addition to her professional experience in city government.
“Cheryl Watson Fisher brings with her the depth and breadth of diverse experiences that match the diverse experiences lived by our residents all across the Cambridge community,” said Simmons, the only councilor who ultimately voted for Fisher.
In describing their deliberative processes and ultimate picks for city manager, several councilors described feeling strongly about both Huang and Farooq.
“I see them at two different ends of capabilities, both at the highest level and both could do the job,” Councilor Dennis J. Carlone said, before ultimately voting for Huang. “That’s where I am now — in the middle of that quandary.”
Mallon thanked Farooq for her work at the Community Development Department and participation in a “very difficult public process.”
“Ms. Farooq is incredibly talented and I have worked with her for such a long time,” Mallon said. “It truly was a very difficult decision.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan described his hope to break from “the current administration and its culture, which has largely reigned supreme for the last 40 years.”
Although Zondervan said both Huang and Farooq met this criteria, he ultimately offered his support for Huang, saying he “offers the bold, dramatic change that we need.”
Of the four finalists, Huang was the only candidate without municipal government experience.
In an interview with The Crimson in May, Huang described his hope that his work in health care administration would bring “some fresh perspectives” to Cambridge government.
“There’s components where I feel like I would have to learn a lot and there’s other ways that I feel like I’d be bringing a perspective that would be really useful,” Huang said. “Bringing those together, I hope, would make a much stronger city.”
