After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It goes without saying that the Satanic Temple—whose members simulated a black mass on Monday much to the chagrin of the Boston Archdiocese—is far from an orthodox church. Apart from the fact that the word “Satan” is in its name, the temple is nontheistic, and its doctrine eschews the supernatural. God doesn’t exist in its pupils’ eyes, but neither does Satan himself, nor any other scriptural being.
Most of the temple’s seven core tenets are widely agreeable—and for atheists, all of them are. “One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason,” goes the first. “People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and resolve any harm that may have been caused,” reads another.
The Satan to which these “Satanists” are referring is a literary one who appeared in a number of early Renaissance books and poems as a tragic hero, if only in a technical sense. The temple’s current leader, Harvard grad Lucien Greaves, cites Joris-Karl Huysmans’s “Là-bas” and Milton’s “Paradise Lost.” In each of these works, Satan asserts his own free will and the centrality of his intellect in contradistinction to God’s omniscience.
Elaborating on the temple’s philosophy, Greaves says that this literary, purely metaphorical Satanism is “defiant of autocratic structure” and based on a rejection of “superstitious supernaturalism.”
This superstition, he elaborates, is the ultimate enemy of the temple. And, yes, as Christians have complained, the Satanists do attempt to satirize the Church—as they do with all churches that believe in the supernatural. Their black mass is partly a symbol of their rejection of superstition, which, transitively, is a rejection of most theistic faiths.
In the past, the group has mocked the Westboro Baptist Church, denigrated Florida Governor Rick Scott’s Bill 98 supporting prayer in public schools, and the group is currently building a devil-goat statue called Mahomet to display outside Oklahoma’s statehouse. So this recent mass—which was drawn from a scene in “Là-Bas”—was just one political act in a series of political acts, from a secularist, humanist church that’s as political as it is religious. 
To me, a political and cultural writer who has mocked others’ beliefs—and whose beliefs are often mocked—this sort of action seems permissible. In fact, it seems to be a staple of democratic discourse. Make no mistake; Satanism as a vessel for symbolic rationalism is a bad, overly abrasive strategy for those who strive for a secularist world. I personally disagree with the tactic. But these soft-core Satanists have every right to challenge theism in whatever fashion, so long as their strategy is not based on intimidation or the provocation of violence. 
This, unfortunately, is not a concept with which the regional Catholic Church—or many of its pupils—agrees. To be sure, some institutional response was appropriate, but much of the response from the Christian community has itself been based on intolerance and the suppression of discourse.
As the Extension School Cultural Studies Club claimed in the Harvard Political Review, the group received intimidating letters and coordinated emails lambasting the group, some comparing it to the KKK—which committed brutal ethnocide throughout the 20th century.
On Fox News, prominent conservative student Jim McGlone ’15 called on campus administrators to cancel the event and again invoked the KKK analogy.
The Archdioceses of Boston and the Harvard Chaplains demanded that the event be canceled. Eventually, the event nearly did implode under the weight of intimidation—and this, I submit, was the only reason that many students on campus, according to my unscientific sampling, have expressed sympathy toward the Satanists.
On its own, a ridiculous, sexualized enactment of a scene from Huysmans’s “Là-Bas” is not a powerful critique of the autocracy of theistic religion. The reaction by Boston’s faithful, on the other hand, added an unfortunate fleck of legitimacy to what would have otherwise been an illegitimate critique.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Lately, the phrase “check your privilege” has dominated the national news scene. This month, students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government devised a way to institutionalize the concept on campus: a mandatory training program for incoming Kennedy School students to understand privilege and power differentials in the classroom.
The ultimate value of the proposed programming, however, will depend on how it is conducted. We urge the Kennedy School to create an open forum in which people can discuss experiences constructively. But while we hope the initiative does foster conversation, we do not believe it should be mandatory. Kennedy School students should be considered mature enough to make their own decisions.
We understand the need for further education on privilege and power. The students behind the campaign, called HKS Speaks Out, point to classroom experiences where they have noticed unhealthy power dynamics. They also indicate that other classes fail to address important issues like race and gender when it comes to policy formulation. Both of these concerns are valid and serious. In no Harvard classroom should some students feel less comfortable speaking than others. Moreover, Kennedy School students are in training to become world and national leaders, and they cannot carry out those jobs fully without a nuanced understanding of how social dynamics and inequality affect any country and its citizens.
The form that discussion takes around the subjects HKS Speaks Out wishes to tackle will play an integral part in its success. It is crucial that the group frames its proposed sensitivity training as a conversation, where students can share their experiences and learn from constructive debate with one another. The initiative will prove far less effective should it exist as a lecture-style seminar in which students are told by a select few how the world works.
Students at the graduate level have the capacity, developed over years of life and education, to think clearly and cogently. This capacity also vests them with the power and responsibility to come to conclusions on their own. Sensitivity cannot be taught in a classroom—it comes from personal interactions and contemplation. For this reason, we do not think the Kennedy School’s privilege training should be obligatory. Rather, we trust students who think they would benefit from the seminar to attend, especially if the Kennedy School takes it upon itself to develop more robust programming. We also trust these students to consider power, privilege, and their implications outside of the classroom.

For the most part, I like people.
At least, I certainly don’t subscribe to the aphorism that l’enfer c’est les autres, especially because I’m pretty sure I’m misinterpreting it. But even as a lover of humanity, I feel comfortable creating a maxim of my own: Heaven is ourselves.
I don’t mean this as a statement of egotism, or even egoism. I just mean—to move out of the realm of pseudo-philosophy and into the realm of pseudo-patois—that we don’t rep alone time hard enough.
We spend our days here surrounded. We wake up to the rustling of roommates packing up for the day, and we go to sleep to the rustling of their sheets on the other side of thin walls as they pack it in for the night. Every moment in between, we run into teaching fellows, close to distant friends, and section kids. From lectures in Lowell to lunch in Leverett (bad call), social interactions abound.
Often, that’s what we need. For aloneness to feel as good as it should, after all, we have to choose it. Perhaps it’s not the case for everyone, but I know I didn’t enjoy eating at Annenberg with my best friend at the time: my Ec 10 textbook. There are moments, and maybe it’s most moments, when we want nothing more than companions at our side. And even at other times—the times where we’d rather shed companionship and watch Netflix in our beds—we need to know that if we called on the people we care about, they’d come.
But we also shouldn’t feel guilty when those other, Netflixy times strike. There’s value in hanging out with ourselves. It doesn’t make us losers; it gives us space to think.
As far as I know (I read the Yahoo Answers response to the question, “What did SATRE [sic] mean when he said ‘HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE’?”), Jean Paul Sartre was not suggesting that our relationships always end in agonizing acrimony. Rather, he posited that we see ourselves only through the eyes of others—in his own words, “We judge ourselves with the means other people have and have given us for judging ourselves.”
Perhaps that’s true, perhaps it’s unavoidable, and perhaps it’s usually for the best. Obviously, viewing oneself in a vacuum doesn’t do anyone any favors. But neither does viewing oneself based solely on outside opinion and expectation. It’s all too easy for us as college students to fall victim to the second trap when outside opinion and expectation pervade every aspect of our lives. Alone time helps us break free for a little while. It gives us a respite from the voices of others constantly roaring in our ears. In the silence, we can hear ourselves think.
The thing is, I have a lot of questions I need answered. Am I really doing well? Am I really proud who I’ve become over the last two years? Am I really okay with Felipe’s changing locations? Honestly, I’m not quite sure. Intentionally or not, I’ve gotten other people’s perspectives—particularly on the last point. Now I ought to hear my own.
Luckily, each one of us will have the chance to do just that in the coming months. Sure, we have internships and international intrigues bound to get in the way, but that’s no matter. We can make room for ourselves, and maybe we’ll like it enough to start doing it at school, too.
I’ll spend this summer with the people (and animal) I love most—my parents, my brother, my dog, and this one other guy. I’m glad. But some nights, I think I’ll slip out of the house and go for a solo stroll on the sweltering D.C. streets. And if my family and I find ourselves hiking the mountains of Maine this August, I’ll forge on ahead at the end of the trail, just to take in the view on my own for a second before sharing it. It’s time I and I had a talk, just us.
The dog, of course, can come too.

What a semester this has been. By now all underclassmen have left campus, except for those who are unfortunate enough to have late exams or Crimson articles to finish up. Heck, even most of the faculty has fled to the Cape, or New York, or some other place that has the distinct characteristic of not being Harvard. The only ones left are the seniors and the unlucky. The past year has been quite a ride for us all, and it is certainly going out in style.
The past few weeks have seen their fair share of exciting developments. “24” has returned to our lives! Bauer’s power hour is back, which naturally means that no student who relies on Netflix or HBO GO will actually see any of the new episodes. I know this, you see, because I did some investigative journalism for this piece. I asked the random people sitting next to me in the dining hall who they were and how they felt about the return of “24.” “We’re your roommates, dude,” they responded, “and we’re busy studying for finals, so please put a cork in it.” They didn’t actually use the expression “put a cork in it,” because they’re not 60-year-old wine connoisseurs, but I changed the phrasing because my “editor” thought the original language did not live up to The Crimson’s very ambiguously defined “journalistic standards.”
Speaking of journalism, TIME seems to be in the business of reading college editorials these days, finally answering the long-running question of what the employees there actually do. (To the editors of TIME: if you’re looking for the next amazingly talented yet surprisingly humble writer to feature, I’m right here.) Congrats to Jenny Gathright ’16 for having her article about feminism picked up! And also Tal Fortgang, the freshman from Princeton who took on checking privilege! Boy, what a discussion that one started. I myself have been too busy checking over problem sets, and checking my email, and checking in and checking out. But mostly checking over many, many problem sets. If that’s what is meant by checking privilege, then I’ve signed up for a whole lot more checking privilege next year, but mostly because I’m a masochist.
The controversies hardly end there. Harvard has entered the phase of its relationship with current seniors in which the school does little except ask for money. “Honey, I just need $80 for a new tote bag!” This is euphemistically referred to as the “Senior Gift Campaign.” The conversations I’ve seen about this fundraising effort usually begin by one student asking another to donate for financial aid. The second student typically responds that money is fungible, to which the first student kind of scrunches his or her face and tries to remember if he or she ever knew what the word “fungible” means. (I haven’t double-checked this, but I’m reasonably sure it’s a species of toad.)
Now we can’t hold the folklore and mythology concentrators too accountable for not knowing their phylogeny. Some of them took psychology to meet their science requirement. Members of the graduating class, after all, were the ones who first taught me what classes to take and which ones to leave to the premed kids. Organic chemistry? No thank you; I’d rather write an article about privilege.
I can say this for sure: we will all miss the graduating seniors, even the ones who took psych. We’ll miss you for being our Peer Advising Fellows freshman year and giving us all the advice we needed, regardless of whether or not any of it made sense. We’ll miss you for making fun of our obsessive focus on GPAs and reminding us that sometimes the most important thing to do is nothing at all. We’ll miss you for storming our dorms during Housing Day and teaching us what it means to be drunk at 8:30 in the morning.
We’ll miss you for showing us what it means to run around in search of a summer internship before we had to do it ourselves. For picking up our “party supplies” when we were too young to buy them ourselves. For late nights at the Kong, and by the Charles River, and wherever else the winds blew us. For teaching us about Fulbright scholarships and Hoopes Prizes and nonchalance in the face of disappointment and rejection. For reminding us that theses can be written in the span of two weeks, but really good ones take months of dedication. For showing us what it means to be hardworking, selfless, dedicated, supportive, and all-around amazing.
I want to thank all the seniors for what you’ve done and wish you the best of luck in your endeavors for the next two years, before you come back for grad school. We’ll all miss you dearly, and campus just won’t be the same without you.
Except “24.” That’ll still be on TV, and we still won’t watch it.

Two heads of state, University President Drew G. Faust, and Kennedy School of Government Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 shared the stage at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday to celebrate the transition of the Kennedy School’s $500 million capital campaign from the quiet to the public phase.
The two-day launch event, called IDEASpHERE, kicked off with a forum featuring Kennedy School graduates Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the current president of Liberia. According to Kennedy School Academic Dean Iris Bohnet, the Forum was filled to capacity, with an audience of 750 that consisted of an even distribution of school supporters, alumni, and current faculty and students.
Following Sirleaf and Calderon’s talk, Faust took the stage, stressing the importance of the Kennedy School in the University’s capital campaign vision.
“The Kennedy School embodied ‘One Harvard’ before it was cool,” Faust said, adding that the school has “led the way as the rest of the University has become more globally engaged.”
“To ask what you can do is a deceptively simple question,” she said, alluding to the school’s campaign slogan.
Faust then introduced Ellwood, who emphasized the School’s aim to educate and empower students to make a difference.
“I am convinced the Harvard Kennedy School must and will answer the increasingly urgent call for exceptional public leadership,” he said. “If we can’t, what place can? And if we won’t, who will?”
True to Ellwood’s claim, Calderón and Sirleaf shared personal anecdotes from their tenures in public service and connected their experiences to their time at the Kennedy School.
Both heads of state reflected that their “call to leadership” began during their childhood years, and credited their parents for inspiring them to take part in politics.
Sirleaf, the first female president of an African country, said she hopes to to inspire other women to follow suit.
“My first role is trying to inspire women,” she said. “You must accept the fact that there will be vulnerability in response to [disaffected citizens’] needs...and that’s part of what leadership is all about.”
Calderón called on the U.S. to use its influence to make a difference globally, and ended the forum by giving advice to new graduates of the Kennedy School.
“The most important recommendation is to believe in something—have an honest motive in your life,” he said. “Once you pick the right motive...fight for it with all your heart.”
Following the speeches, audience members attended breakout sessions on various topics, including “Challenges to U.S. Global Leadership” and “Harnessing Market Forces to Protect the Climate."
Bohnet, who helped organize IDEASpHERE, said before the launch event that the sessions were arranged by reaching out to faculty members and inviting them to suggest ideas, sessions, and speakers.
“This is unheard of for the Kennedy School to run such a large conference with 12 parallel sessions taking place at the same time,” Bohnet said.
In an interview before the forum, Bohnet said, “What is most exciting for me is...that we come together as a community...to celebrate ideas that make the world a better place.”
The festivities will continue Friday with a keynote speech from Lawrence H. Summers, a former president of University and Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. Details of the campaign’s progress will be announced Friday.

Based on preliminary interviews with undergraduates, the chair of a committee recently convened to review the Program in General Education said that students often do not understand the goals of the academic program and how it differs from distribution requirements.
Since the committee was created in March, Philosophy professor and committee chair Sean D. Kelly, joined by six members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has been meeting with students, faculty, and administrators to gather impressions and opinions about the General Education program. The committee’s findings will inform a formal review of the program to be released in the spring of 2015.
The committee members include Music professor Alexander Rehding, Slavic Languages and Literatures professor Stephanie Sandler, African and African American Studies professor Jennifer L. Hochschild, Earth and Planetary Sciences professor John H. Shaw, Engineering professor Robert J. Wood, and Engineering professor Todd Zickler.
The group was selected in consultation with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and is intended to represent a diversity of disciplines in the College, Kelly said.
According to Kelly, the group plans to continue meeting with faculty and students in the fall, conduct “town hall meetings” intended to engage students and faculty in discussions about General Education, and send surveys to students.
From his own observations, Kelly said that students may not fully understand the purpose of the program because faculty members fail to clearly articulate the cross-disciplinary nature of their courses.
“I think the faculty, when they wrote the General Education legislation, had a lot of discussion about how this program was really not intended to be a mere distribution requirement,” Kelly said. “I feel like that has gotten in lost in the conversation about the nature of General Education.”
The May 2007 vote by FAS that created General Education legislated that the program should aim to achieve four main goals, including preparing students to act as citizens, to respond to change, to understand ethical consequences of their words and actions, and to teach students to “understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and values.”
Kelly said he thinks that faculty members ought to reaffirm these goals.
“It would be good to get clearer for the sake of the faculty and the students what exactly is distinctive, or what’s intended to be distinctive, about the General Education program,” Kelly said.
At the end of May, Kelly and the review committee will travel to Yale to talk with administrators in the school’s Directed Studies program, their equivalent of Harvard’s program in General Education. According to Kelly, the committee hopes to hear about the successes of Yale’s program and use this information to inform their own review process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who helped publish Naational Security Administration documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden in The Guardian and other news outlets last year, discussed Snowden's misportrayal in the aftermath of the the documents' publication in a talk at the First Parish Church Thursday.
Greenwald blamed both the government and the media for distorting Snowden’s intentions while debuting his book, “No Place to Hide.”
Speaking about the motives behind writing the book, Greenwald said that he felt an obligation to reveal the information it contains and spur debate about privacy issues and the threats of surveillance agencies.
“Ever since I got these documents, I felt a very cumbersome obligation to my source, who unraveled his existence to bring this information to the public...and also to the material and to the public which had a right not only to see it but to understand and interact with it,” Greenwald said.
Greenwald also commented on the media’s dissemination of false claims regarding Snowden. He said he was not surprised that the news outlets distorted Snowden's story.
“So much of [what has been said] has been completely untrue,” Greenwald said. “I really wanted to take the opportunity to present the cumulative set of events as I saw them, and furthermore, to correct them.”
Greenwald argued that the media was complicit in coordinating an effort to diffuse attention from the release of the documents to the state of Snowden’s mental health, saying that the media was guilty of “clinically diagnosing [Snowden].”
“They all somehow settled on this incredibly coordinated strategy that he was a fame-seeking narcissist,” the author added.
Voicing his respect for Snowden’s actions and comparing them to those of key figures in the Civil Rights Movement, Noam Chomsky, an MIT professor who was also present at the event, said that “almost every significant change has often been created by an isolated individual.”
Greenwald, who spent months reporting from Hong Kong on the leaked documents, noted the United States’ role in obstructing Snowden’s search for political asylum. He recalled how the United States revoked Snowden’s passport in a Russian airport.
Describing his first conversations with Snowden, Greenwald shared how Snowden wanted to identify himself as the source of the disclosures and explain his actions in order to prevent false deductions from the media. After revealing himself, Snowden had planned on retiring from the public arena, according to Greenwald.
“He knew that the objective of the national security state apologists and defenders would be to try and shift the focus from the substance of the revelation to...talk about his mental afflictions,” Greenwald said.
Cate Mingoya, a student at MIT who was present at the event, voiced her surprise concerning the statements made during the discussion. After the talk, she said that she had a much deeper understanding of Snowden, but was surprised by Greenwald's portrayal of “the media’s attempts to cloud the intent behind the release of the documents.”
The event was sponsored by the Harvard Book Store.

Plastic sword sheathed and military-style uniform put away for the summer, Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 joined Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 Thursday in reflecting optimistically on the role the Council has played in advocating student concerns this semester, even as they conceded that much of what they have been seeking has yet to come to fruition.
Mayopoulos and Goffard, a pair that emerged from a tumultuous Fall election that included an unprecedented victory of a then “joke” ticket and a reversed plan of resignation, said there was a need for change as soon as they entered office in December.
“There was consensus on campus that there was a time for change, and I think we brought the change,” Mayopoulos said in an interview Thursday in Ticknor Lounge.
While Mayopoulos and Goffard were hesitant to characterize the degree of relevance of prior UC administrations to student life, they said the spring semester was one of “increased student voice” and visibility for the Council.
One of the most public efforts by the administration to date, the campaign to secure another $250,000 in funding for student groups, led to a large rally outside Massachusetts Hall and figured prominently in the UC leaders’ meetings with deans in the Office of Student Life, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Michael D. Smith, and University President Drew G. Faust. Indeed, Goffard said that  he and Mayopoulos have prioritized the issue more so than past leaders of the Council.
Despite the efforts, the UC has yet to secure any additional funding from the University.
While Mayopoulos acknowledged that the “concrete benefits” of the campaign have yet to be seen, he attributed delays to administrator’s desires to gather more data on the matter and weigh the concerns of undergraduates against other goals before deciding where to allocate resources.
Although Pfister and Smith have expressed support for increasing the UC’s year budget, which has hovered around $500,000 for the last six years, Goffard and Mayopoulos said they have been told by various administrators that the FAS is facing a budget deficit, meaning that an increase is unlikely.
“It is a little bit disconcerting when we identify a problem that is really important for students and really isn’t very expensive for Harvard to fix, and we’re essentially set back by these administrative bars,” Mayopoulos said.
Even so, Mayopoulos said that, with the OSL working on the issue, he is confident that a concrete decision will be made next year regarding the UC’s requests.
Reflecting on the Council’s work over the past semester, Mayopoulos and Goffard spoke highly of the relationship they were able to foster with students through their Operation Ghost Protocol initiative and regular emails to undergraduates.
Students seem “more aware” of what the Council is doing, Goffard added.
Still, the pair openly conceded particular difficulties they have had in actually implementing their goals, pointing to the rollout of their new website, which was both slow and months behind schedule when it launched in April.
On the whole,  Mayopoulos and Goffard positively characterized their first semester in office, citing advocacy efforts for gender neutral housing and the recently approved honor code as areas where their support was helpful. They also mentioned Student Life Committee projects like the Freshman Health Project, as well as the Student Initiative Committee’s sponsorship of several student start-ups.
Next semester, Mayopoulos and Goffard said they will continue emphasizing  the funding discussion, while taking advantage of opportunities to include student opinion on important issues.
Referring to a sexual assault policy working group convened in May 2013 by way of example,  Mayopoulos said “there should never be a situation where a policy that affects every undergrad is decided and not one undergraduate serves on it.”

UPDATED: May 16, 2014, at 10:23 p.m.
University President Drew G. Faust received a total compensation package of just over $1 million in 2012. according to a recent University filing with the Internal Revenue Service. In 2011, Faust earned $899,734 after benefits.
With benefits, Faust earned $1,040,637 during the twelve-month span. The bump in compensation stems mostly from a raise in Faust’s non-salary benefits, which include the presidential residence at 33 Elmwood Ave.  in Cambridge. Faust’s pre-benefit compensation rose from $729,106 to $770,887 from 2011 to 2012. Additionally, Faust earned a $75,000 salary and $175,000 in stock options for serving on the board of Staples, Inc.
While Faust was the highest earning University administrator, she was out-earned by numerous officials within Harvard Management Company. In 2012, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo earned $4,801,347—a decrease of more than $500,000 from 2011—while Andrew G. Wiltshire, head of alternative assets for HMC, was the company’s top breadwinner with $7,896,277 in compensation.
HMC employs a performance-based compensation system linked to overall market performance, according to the company’s announcement.
Five officials at HMC, including natural resources portfolio manager Alvaro Aguirre-Simunovic, head of public markets Stephen Blyth, and real estate portfolio manager Daniel W. Cummings, earned more than $4 million in 2012.
The filing, IRS Form 990, is required by all tax-exempt organizations, and lists the compensation of University officers and other top earners. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 was the most highly compensated administrator after Faust, earning reportable compensation of $619,093 and a total package of $750,885. The most highly compensated dean was Jeffrey S. Flier of Harvard Medical School, who earned $582,243.
Much of the non-salary compensation for Faust and Garber, as well as Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, came in the form of a University-owned residence or, in Smith’s case, a housing allowance. With benefits, Smith earned $554,370 in 2012, while Nohria received a total package of $681,073.
Other notable pay packages included a salary and benefits total of $447,910 for Christine M. Heenan, vice president for government communications and public affairs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a four-sport high school standout and a four-year starter on the Harvard women’s basketball team, co-captain Christine Clark has seen many a season come and go.
However, when the final buzzer sounded inside the Rutgers Athletic Center on Mar. 24, the 63-52 defeat for the Crimson in the second round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament signaled not only a difficult end to another Harvard season, but also the close of Clark’s career in Crimson.
For Clark and her fellow seniors, she says, the disappointing finality of the loss was tempered by a sense of accomplishment for everything the group achieved together during their four years in Cambridge.
Although Harvard never broke through to capture the Ivy League championship during Clark’s tenure with the team, the Crimson finished second in the Ivy League in four consecutive seasons and reached the second round of the WNIT three years in a row.
But the veteran guard had little opportunity to reflect on her decorated collegiate career in the days following its conclusion, as she turned her focus toward preparing for her next athletic pursuit: professional basketball.
“With women’s basketball, there’s a lot of opportunity overseas, and you can go live in Europe for free basically,” Clark said. “That’s kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity.”
The Harvard women’s basketball program has a history of producing players who have gone on to play professionally overseas.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who after 32 years in Cambridge stands as the winningest head coach in Ivy League history, says that around 20 of her former players have pursued careers in Europe.
Given the varying experiences of these players, Delaney-Smith stresses the uncertainty involved in trying to find a roster spot abroad.
Due to the fluid nature of European scouting and scheduling, garnering recognition from foreign organizations can prove challenging.
“Brogan Berry [’12] was the last player I had who tried to go play,” Delaney-Smith said. “Unfortunately…she did it in an Olympic year where the calendar was entirely changed.”
In addition to the problems presented by the structure of the European system, Delaney-Smith notes that Clark’s on-floor position may pose an additional challenge as she seeks interest from teams.
Due to the prevalence of the small-ball style of play in Europe, the continent produces a plethora of skilled guards but lacks a pool of talented frontcourt players to draw from. As a result, European organizations usually seek forwards and centers when they scout American players.
Because Clark plays guard, the Tucson, Ariz. native faces more competition for recognition than she would at another position.
Delaney-Smith admits the troubles of this reality but also understands Clark’s talent.
“Guards are a dime a dozen in Europe,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Clark’s] an elite-level guard, so if she stays persistent, I’m sure she’ll get to the right place.”
So far, Clark has indeed been proactive in her efforts to make headway through an otherwise uncertain process.
She says she has frequently looked to Delaney-Smith and other friends in the basketball world for advice, and she has reached out to former Harvard forward Katie Rollins ’08, who played professionally overseas in Germany.
Clark has also worked closely with her agent, Joe Dinda of Alliance Sports Management, to market herself to potential clubs.
The two have created a profile for Clark containing game film that has been sent to prospective coaches and organizations.
Dinda has placed players in locations all over Europe, including Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, and Poland.
For now, all Clark can do is wait as teams collect information and make their assessments about prospects.
The senior guard says that teams do not begin to make offers until June, when they have finished discussing and organizing their finances and have determined which players they wish to target and sign.
This long delay gives Clark the chance to settle down after what she admits has been a very hectic and stressful time for her.
As she reflects on her career in Cambridge, she will no doubt have a great deal to be proud of.
Clark ranks fourth and second all-time in Harvard history in points and free throws made, respectively, and was selected to the All-Ivy League first team three times.
Her coach, who refers to her affectionately as “Clarky,” praised the co-captain’s impact on the program.
“Clarky is the kind of player you love to coach. Her work ethic is phenomenal,” Delaney-Smith lauded. “Day in and day out, she doesn’t ever take a day off…. There isn’t a piece of the program she hasn’t touched.”
That work ethic should serve Clark well in the coming months, as she will be without formal basketball practices and games before her potential return to organized basketball, this time in the professional ranks.
The senior has been playing pick-up games and lifting to stay in shape, and she will pick up the intensity of her workouts over the summer as she has in previous years.
Despite the prospect of professional basketball looming, Clark has a more immediate focus: final exams and graduation.
“Right now, I think, my primary goal is to get through finals and finish strong academically,” Clark noted.
As she prepares to graduate and leave Cambridge, Clark looks forward to a potential opportunity to continue playing the sport she loves, and hopes that that 63-52 loss to Rutgers in the WNIT is not her last competitive contest.
“I’m really not ready to stop playing basketball,” Clark said.
