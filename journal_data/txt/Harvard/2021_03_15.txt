After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, scientists developed mRNA Covid-19 vaccines at historic speed. That wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for scientists like Katalin Kariko, who has laid the groundwork for mRNA vaccine development since the 1990s.
Kariko’s own career, however, nearly ended in 1995, and her story shows how science funding mechanisms in the U.S. have failed us.
After arriving in the U.S. from Hungary, Kariko sought to develop therapies using mRNA, pieces of genetic code that tell cells what proteins to make. Theoretically, you could artificially create mRNA that encoded instructions for enzymes or antibodies. Practically, however, it was a challenge to send synthetic mRNA into the body’s cells in the first place, and most scientists abandoned the field.
Not Kariko. Kariko sent out countless grant applications and received countless rejections in her pursuit of developing mRNA technology, and with no money coming in, the University of Pennsylvania demoted her.
At this point, with their reputation skewered, most scientists would let go of their research. But Kariko, despite being newly diagnosed with cancer, pressed on. From when Kariko was demoted from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995 to when she was kicked out of the lab in 2013, her salary barely changed, even as health insurance and parking costs went up — she was making less than the lab technicians she worked with.
“I could see that people around me, you know, they get the grants and they get the money,” Kariko said in an interview. She was never awarded a single major grant from the National Institutes of Health over the course of her career.
As I was talking to Kariko over Zoom, it was obvious how passionate she is about science. She told me about her excitement heading into the lab at 6 a.m. on Sundays.
“There's people from outside seeing me struggling or sweating. The whole thing is struggle, struggle,” Kariko told me. But “as long as you could see how [your research was] advancing, you didn't feel tiredness.”
I am in awe of Kariko’s service to science and her relentless determination despite countless grant rejections, not to mention demotion. But the fact stands: The system failed to support mRNA research, and most researchers would have pivoted.
“It's a complicated ecosystem,” Harvard Dean of Science Christopher Stubbs said in an interview with the Crimson. “People move their research in the direction where the resources exist for sure.”
Current grant funding can come from either private companies and foundations or the government. Funding in the public arena began after World War II, and the selection process has since greatly intensified. Individual researchers submit proposals to a government agency like the National Science Foundation or NIH, where a group of scientists evaluate the proposals and allocate funding to only about 10 percent of proposals. The National Cancer Institute’s funding line is even lower.
What this means is that current scientific research follows a “regression to the mean instead of aspiration to excellence,” according to Astronomy professor Avi Loeb. Since a vast majority of applications are rejected, funding mechanisms end up driving many researchers into non-academic positions or leaving many researchers in the field spending time writing grants and chasing more conservative trends, performing minor variations on trending or already-successful research experiments.
“Extraordinary conservatism leads to extraordinary ignorance,” said Loeb, who faced skepticism and ridicule from colleagues for hypothesizing that ʻOumuamua was an interstellar extraterrestrial object. “Because if you are not open-minded to discover new things, you will never find them.”
Most grant proposals ask for a breakdown of what you hope to accomplish in year one, two, and three. What’s backwards about this procedure is that the grant mechanism itself projects and ensures an expectation of what you’re hoping to accomplish. In fact, many researchers apply for grants having already finished half or most of the project.
Loeb recalled once submitting what he considered a “safe” grant proposal — a project he had already completed and slated for publication, only to receive a grant rejection that claimed the project could not be done.
“I feel like I'm serving the role of the kid saying the emperor has no clothes,” Loeb said. “I hate it when some of my colleagues are basically speaking responsibly: keeping an image and never making mistakes, and having their students and postdocs repeat what they did already and just making it even louder.”
So, how do we solve the funding issue? For one, we must increase funding overall to combat the scarcity and constraint of funding lines. More importantly, we must foster innovative research by specifically portioning funds for high-risk projects.
Kariko told me that despite every obstacle, she was driven from within by a love of science: “I don’t use a stick or carrot.” But many scientists in Kariko’s position, frustrated that available funding mechanisms did not recognize the importance of their work, would have given up. Furthermore, mRNA was intellectually interesting to Kariko, but nobody knew just how important it would be to humanity in 2020. If we fund projects that only advertise immediate and obvious benefits, then we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.
It is also paramount to make sure that these high-risk funds aren’t only given to established labs that have already made it and been winnowed out — perhaps, every lab should be given a chance to try one potentially major project.
At the end of the day, funding is supposed to fuel science, not hinder it. If the funding system is actively preventing groundbreaking research, we have to change that system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been a year since I’ve worn pants to class.
It’s a strange accomplishment to have — one that I did not expect to achieve at Harvard (or anywhere). Ever since the pandemic began, I would be too lazy to roll out of bed and put on any other piece of clothing for class, so I’d wear my Hawaiian boxers and my day-old shirt. It became quite the habit for me day in and day out, with the exception of eventually changing my boxers and shirts.
Last March, on a random Friday afternoon, I lost any sense of normalcy I had once had. My regular, daily class schedule was replaced by Zoom classes filled with aching eyes and pixelated humans. We freshmen didn’t receive that necessary closure from high school to college. Now some of us are stuck, doing Harvard online in our childhood bedroom.
These circumstances have fostered social isolation and a merging of work time and break time. I cannot honestly say I’ve sat down and relaxed for the past year. My work and my time set aside for self-care have blended to the point where I feel guilty for not actively working on assignments or being busy at any given moment.
Constantly being busy might just be a way to keep me from dealing with the existential dread of living in a pandemic. But it also means I cannot escape to a place of peace — except a guilt-induced siesta. If I spend three to four hours on Zoom classes then spend a few minutes scrolling through TikTok or simply listening to music, I feel guilty for being unproductive.
Harvard’s administration has tried to remedy this crisis of students’ mental health by implementing "wellness days" and assuring us that college over Zoom is not harder, just different. This assurance has turned out to be completely false, and wellness days have failed us.
Wellness day mornings bring mental breakdown nights. What are wellness days supposed to be? A time to be away from screens, relax, and have socially distanced hangouts with friends and family? Should we just ignore the assignments professors have merely pushed to the next day and just “chill”? What is the point of these wellness days if we feel immeasurable guilt for not working on what is essentially the same number of assignments?
Wellness days would be extremely beneficial for all students if they were implemented correctly and all professors took them seriously. Successful wellness days require assignments not to be simply delayed by a day but rather not scheduled around them at all. A successful wellness day doesn’t mean simply changing live lectures to recorded ones. It means a complete day of relaxation without the stress caused by work due soon — something like what we would’ve gotten over spring break.
I understand we are working towards a Harvard degree, which means material that needs to be covered and comprehended. But is this material worth ignoring necessary periods of rest and further degrading student’s mental health during a global pandemic? Don’t forget Harvard, these are “unprecedented times.”
Yet, these unprecedented times don’t feel so unprecedented anymore. They have become our new normal. We’ve become content with Zoom calls and no personal time for rest as our new daily schedule. I’ve fallen into the trap of assuming life will simply be like this for another couple of weeks, months, or years. But no more. I refuse to continue working, studying, and living as if we were in a normal situation. The present bizarre situation deserves bizarre, eccentric, and odd actions to accompany it.
That is the true reason I haven’t worn pants to class — not because I’m lazy, but because of what those Hawaiin boxers stand for. They constantly remind me that this is not a natural way of life and caution me against getting comfortable with this as a new normal.
I understand that not everyone has Hawaiian boxers as spectacular as mine. But I urge you to maintain whatever bizarre habit, items, or behaviors that match the world we’re living in at present. These times don't deserve normalcy. And hopefully, by the fall, I will be able to meet you in person with a healthier space between work and play — and also with my pants on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has a stress problem.
It's not a new one either. Even before everything converged into a never-ending Zoom meeting, our campus was maskless but still stressed out. Most of us spend our time at Harvard, whether virtually or physically, worrying about this, that, or the other, drowning in problem sets and papers, or struggling to secure a decent summer internship. Throughout it all we're forced to keep our eyes on the prize — look around for a split second, and you'll stumble into an impossibly successful peer (and part-time CEO) with an enthusiastic recommendation letter personally penned by a current senator. It’s no wonder so many of our peers can barely juggle that pressure during normal times, let alone with navigating an ongoing global pandemic on their shoulders.
So that's the diagnosis: We are tense and overextended. But why?
The roots of the problem are as obvious as they are deep. Our institution selects a number of overachieving kids from across the globe in a highly dramatized and grueling admissions cycle. It then dumps all these big fish into one tiny Boston pond, where they are forced to compete against each other for virtually everything, social and academic alike. From the prestigious courses with elaborate selection methods, to the social clubs that enforce strict, unmerciful comps, our lives frequently rely on not being the one that gets cut. A vicious cycle of sleep-deprived overachievement ensues, along with the absurd expectation of constant productivity.
If you didn't know better, you might be forgiven for thinking it's all some sadistic sociological experiment.
It's worth noting that students, sometimes inadvertently, help perpetuate this toxic culture: Every unprompted reference to our eighth class or exorbitantly remunerated summer internship leads to more forced smiles and stressed-out souls. But if it is the University that selects us, houses us, and chooses the rules we live by, it also ought to be the administration's job to prevent the erosion of our mental health.
Their attempts to do so, however, can fall flat.
Take Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services: CAMHS. The program is, in principle, extremely promising, offering no-cost support to members of the student body. Yet experiences with it, even within this board, vary widely. For some low-income students, the no-cost policy is weakened by the presence of hefty cancellation fees, rendering the service financially risky. For others, seeking help for mental illness is complicated by fears that doing so will result in being forced to take a leave from the College.
The pandemic (as usual) hasn't helped. Students have dealt with an exponential increase in their base stress level, as well as personal and academic upheaval. The crown jewel of the University's response, the creation of class-free wellness days sprinkled across the term, has proved underwhelming. Their name has become a bitter joke for those students who still have to power through essays and assignments on their “time off,” only to attend make-up seminars a day later. “Wellness” days have become a poor remedy for our ailing mental health: another twenty-four hours to push ourselves to produce marginally better, if any, returns, no matter what the cost.
None of the above is meant to invalidate the value of mental health programming writ large. A clumsy CAMHS is still better than nothing, and a day-off can help someone get through the week, even if they ultimately dedicate it to yet another CS50 assignment. Indeed, for every student that has left a therapy appointment feeling frustrated, there's another who felt seen and heard for the very first time. Again, our experiences vary widely — for better or worse.
That means that the key isn't to vilify CAMHS or its hard-working therapists, nor is scratching wellness days at a time when normal spring break is completely untenable. But it isn't okay to act as if everything is perfectly fine either.
Rather, we want to see the administration admit fault in its approach to mental illness and health, commit to improving it in a manner cognizant of Covid’s unique pressures, while also acknowledging the underlying, pre-pandemic root causes of our stress. In the short run, that might mean addressing CAMHS's weaknesses; or, more pressingly, creating a set of common enforceable standards that protect our right to relax during wellness days, such as limiting scheduled work and prohibiting college-related Zoom events.
Harvard is stressful. When “normal” life resumes, this will remain true. Mental health resources are vital to our community, and bulking them up in an empathetic, situationally-aware manner has to be an essential part of the University’s mission, pandemic or otherwise.

Professor of Computing in Science and Engineering Petros Koumoutsakos, who joined Harvard faculty this semester, assumed the directorship of Harvard’s Institute for Applied Computational Science.
Koumoutsakos assumed the role as Faculty Director of the IACS — which runs graduate programs in computational and data science — succeeding outgoing director and Physics department chair Efthimios Kaxiras, according to a late February press release.
After completing his aeronautics and applied mathematics Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology, Koumoutsakos joined NASA’s Ames Research Center as an associate. Shortly thereafter, he became a professor of computational fluid dynamics at ETH Zürich, later rising to chair of the computational science department at ETH Zürich.
After more than two decades at ETH Zürich, Koumoutsakos joined the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences faculty this semester and was appointed IACS director in January 2021.
While the IACS’s current focus is on teaching, Koumoutsakos noted his goal as director will be to strengthen the research done through the institute.
“Computational science and data science are rapidly evolving fields,” he said. “You need to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.”
Koumoutsakos added that he is particularly excited to assume the role at this point in time, calling computational science training a “fundamental education,” given its increasing relevance across engineering fields.
“I very much believe that people should learn to compute — they should learn to handle data, almost [at] the same level as they know how to read and write eventually, because this is becoming very important in all fields of science and engineering,” he said.
Kaxiras, the founding director of IACS who is stepping down from the role, wrote in an emailed statement that the institute is lucky to have Koumoutsakos take over the helm.
“Prof. Koumoutsakos is also bringing to our University, and to IACS in particular, an unbounded enthusiasm and creativity,” wrote Kaxiras, who will maintain his other Harvard positions. “We are lucky to have him lead IACS toward great new accomplishments.”
Kaxiras added that Koumoutsakos is a “world-known expert” in fluid dynamics and computer simulations of physical phenomena. Koumoutsakos is also a fellow at several organizations for professional scientists, like the American Physical Society and American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Though this is Koumoutsakos’ first semester as a faculty member, this is not his first time as a researcher at Harvard. During the 2016-2017 academic year, Koumoutsakos was a fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, where he worked on a project modeling fluid flows using algorithms.
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III wrote in an emailed statement he was excited that Koumoutsakos has joined both Harvard faculty and the IACS.
“Prof. Koumoutsakos is a terrific addition to the SEAS faculty,” Doyle wrote. “Petros will build on the Institute for Applied Computational Science’s strong record of teaching, research, and engagement with the broader public.”
Doyle added that Koumoutsakos’ research interests are a “great fit” with SEAS’s “interdisciplinary ethos.”
“His research expertise will help guide work to apply AI and Machine Learning to address a variety of engineering and applied science problems,” Doyle wrote.
But Koumoutsakos noted that the utility of computational science is not confined to engineering alone.
“I think computing can help in many different ways, so adding components beyond engineering into the arts and sciences would be also great,” he said. “I’d like to see that also.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have evolved botulinum neurotoxins — commonly known as botox — to selectively target different proteins for the first time, presenting new opportunities for the potential treatment of a wide variety of medical conditions.
Botulinum neurotoxins are proteases — enzymes that break down proteins to activate or inhibit them — that normally target membrane-associated proteins needed for the release of neurotransmitters. In a study published in Science in February, the group of researchers showed that they can reprogram the botulinum toxin proteases to have new targets.
“We can now take a protease and teach it to operate on something new, and then penalize it for doing things that we don’t want to do, and in that way, we can take proteases and basically evolve them to target sequences that we choose, as opposed to the sequences that they natively cleave,” lead author and Chemistry postdoctoral fellow Travis R. Blum said.
In the paper, the group details the development of four botulinum neurotoxin proteases, each with high selectivity for native or non-native targets, using a method known as phage-assisted continuous evolution, or PACE.
Prior to the group’s success, the field did not know if proteases were even “amenable to evolution,” Blum said.
While botulinum neurotoxins are some of the most toxic biological proteins known, their high selectivity makes them attractive for potential therapeutic applications.
Another useful property of proteases for therapeutics is their catalytic nature, which enables them to process substrates — enzyme targets — at a high rate, according to Chemistry professor David R. Liu ’94, senior author of the study. This property makes proteases more potent than “other therapeutics such as antibodies or small molecules.”
“Targets for which this approach might be especially impactful include those that are poorly suited to other therapeutic modalities such as small molecules or antibodies, or those for which existing therapeutics are not known,” Liu wrote in an email. “They may provide new ways to intervene in previously intractable diseases.”
Advancements in PACE, which Liu’s lab developed in 2011, facilitated the group’s evolution of the botulinum neurotoxin protease to selectively cleave desired substrates. With PACE, proteases that cleaved the wrong sequence would encounter a “dominant negative selection marker,” a gene that produces a protein that “poisons phage propagation.” Combined with positive selection, PACE enabled the group to “enrich” desired variants only, according to Blum.
Blum said PACE is believed to be “about 100 times faster” than other classical methods of directed evolution, accomplishing a “workflow” that is “really difficult to do” with conventional selection- and screen-based models.
“The type of applications you can think of is really just unlimited,” said Geoffrey Masuyer, research fellow at the University of Bath who was not involved with the study.
Masuyer said that the next step for research in the field, now that it is possible to alter the enzyme’s substrate activity, would be to “target the right type of cell,” which presents “a challenge on its own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Design brought together mayors from across the country for a virtual panel discussion Friday on how urban planning and design can be utilized to combat racial injustice in their cities.
The event, entitled “Mayors Imagining the Just City,” was a collaboration between the Mayors’ Institute on City Design and the GSD’s Just City Lab. The panel consisted of the seven MICD Just City Mayoral Fellows: Stephen K. Benjamin, mayor of Columbia, S.C.; Chokwe Anatar Lumumba, mayor of Jackson, Miss.; Shawyn Patterson-Howard, mayor of Mount Vernon, N.Y.; Errick D. Simmons, mayor of Greenville, Miss.; Yvonne M. Spicer, mayor of Framingham, Mass.; Vince R. Williams, mayor of Union City, Ga.; and Randall L. Woodfin, mayor of Birmingham, Ala.
Trinity Simons, executive director of MICD, said the purpose of the fellowship is to encourage collaboration between mayors and professionals working “towards using justice not just to build better places,” but also to “bring justice to the lives of people” in those cities.
The first panel, “Memory, Place Narratives and the Just City,” focused on initiatives the mayors undertook to help residents. Simmons, the Greenville, Miss. mayor, opened up the panel with a quote from activist Jane Jacobs.
“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody only because and only when they are created by everyone,” he said, quoting Jacobs.
Simmons also explained one of his city’s initiatives, which focused on creating “a state-of-the-art affordable housing complex” for families with low or moderate incomes.
Brent Leggs, executive director of the African American Cultural Heritage Fund, highlighted some of the work being done nationally to help preserve African American historic places, and provide “equity investment” in Black neighborhoods. He added that as preservation practitioners, they “help cities manage change in ways that don’t disconnect” the areas from their pasts.
The other panel shifted its focus towards restorative justice through economic means. Woodfin, the Birmingham mayor, discussed the people and “freespace strategies” he uses in his city to achieve greater economic equity, inclusion, and ownership.
“I think the biggest thing is, I always speak to our citizens where they live, the neighborhood they live, in the street they live on, the block they live on,” he said.
He went on to explain that his administration allocated more than $28 million over the last three years for paving streets and improving public parks in neighborhoods throughout Birmingham.
Patterson-Howard, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., said that because of “misinvestment” in the past, Mount Vernon has “two cities within one city,” with more investment — and therefore more opportunity — going to one part of the city. She proposed comprehensive planning in order to create more mixed-income neighborhoods, rather than segregated ones.
“We really have to focus on restorative justice,” Patterson-Howard said. “We want to make sure that it retains the residents who have had the grit and resilience to stand by our side as we’ve struggled, but also provides opportunities for new families who want to move in, who can invest in our community.”
GSD Professor In Practice of Urban Planning Toni L. Griffin, the founder and director of the Just City Lab, argued for the importance of holding these public discussions in an interview prior to Friday’s event.
“It’s really important that our design students have access to and can be in conversation with elected officials, especially mayors who I believe are really the top of the food chain in terms of building cities — their policies and their agendas help to create and shape the built environment that we all live, work and play in,” Griffin said.
“Those are the types of mayors that we want our design students to be in partnership with when they go out into their careers, or maybe even become mayors and elected officials,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard School of Public Health will launch a program for business leaders to promote health in their corporate practices in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has dramatically altered the workplace, the school announced Wednesday.
Responding to demand from business executives for increased public health knowledge, the School of Public Health created the Public Health and Business Leadership Certificate program, which is set to start in September.
Faculty spanning the School of Public Health, the Kennedy School, and the Business School will instruct the program, which is designed for mid- to senior-level business executives.
HSPH associate professor Joseph G. Allen, a co-director of the program whose research focuses on how indoor environments affect wellbeing, said Harvard has an obligation to use its institutional resources to help educate business leaders.
“We have a responsibility to launch a program like this to offer training to business leaders looking for the public health background so that they can lead in their own organizations and drive change with a public health lens,” Allen said.
The program will award certificates to a cohort of 20 to 30 business executives who undergo four weekends of training guided by a curriculum that focuses on foundational public health principles, worker health and wellbeing, and global health policy, among other topics.
Though the program intends to conduct its offerings remotely, the final component will take the form of an in-person practicum in which participants will create a project specific to their organization and share their results with Harvard.
The program’s other co-director, Richard B. Siegrist, who is a senior lecturer on health care management at the School of Public Health, said it is important for executives to take an active role in promoting wellbeing among their employees.
“We think about the impact that corporations have on the environment, on worker wellbeing,” Siegrist said. “If they’re not deeply involved, things are not going to change the way they need to change.”
One of the program’s courses will expose business leaders to the history of public health, a foundation on how social factors contribute to health, and an overview of disease prevention practices.
The instructor of that course, Monica L. Wang, who is an adjunct associate professor of health policy and management at HSPH, said a core belief of the program is that a healthy society requires leaders from across industries to work together.
“The goal is that the production of health, and the promotion of health, can’t be shouldered only by the health care system, or only by public health officials,” Wang said. “It really requires moving the needle and working collectively and collaboratively with other sectors.”
Allen added that the program is committed to diversity in its admissions process.
“We’ve put in policies in place to be sure that we’re getting representation across different races, ethnicities, and equal balance by gender and critically across different types of companies,” Allen said.
Siegrist said they hope to expand the current initiative to a two-year degree-granting program within the School of Public Health.
“This is not the last crisis we will face,” Allen said. “What I’ve seen in organizations, big and small, is that they have a gap in terms of training and knowledge and expertise — and that gap is public health.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard University Native American Program celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, program affiliates said they aim to continue and build upon its mission to support Indigenous students on campus in the years to come.
HUNAP — originally called the American Indian Program — was established in 1970 as an interfaculty initiative housed in the Graduate School of Education, set on promoting the educational mission, scholarship, and inclusion of Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students and allies on campus.
Fifty years later, the program boasts over a thousand alumni and continues to advance teaching and research initiatives for Native students and faculty across the University. Though the program turned 50 in 2020, HUNAP marked the occasion with a panel featuring several of its original participants on March 5, 2021.
Shelly C. Lowe, a member of the Navajo Nation and the executive director of HUNAP, said she believes the program’s most significant accomplishment in the past 50 years has been not only attracting Native faculty, but also getting them tenured.
“When you have faculty on campus, particularly Native faculty and faculty working in Native and Indigenous issues, there’s now maybe the opportunity to really grow those areas of study and grow the program,” Lowe said.
Professor Joseph P. Gone ’92, a member of the Aaniiih-Gros Ventre tribe and the faculty director of HUNAP, said the program also strives to “carry forward” the commitment of Harvard in adhering to its Charter of 1650.
“The charter commits Harvard to ‘the education of English and Indian youth’ — that the education of Indian youth is part and parcel of Harvard’s founding mission,” Gone said.
“We try very hard to make visible Indian people, Indigenous people who in our society in the U.S. are generally invisible,” he added.
HUNAP has long served as a support space for Native American and Native Hawaiian students at the College, which together made up just two percent of the admitted Class of 2024 last year.
“From the moment that I began interacting with HUNAP, I knew that they were supportive of me and supportive of students like me,” Eli J. Langley ’20-21 said. “It was really helpful for me transitioning to Harvard to know that there was this base of support, people that looked like me, people that had similar experiences and life backgrounds.”
With help from HUNAP, Langley — who is a member of the Coushatta Tribe — successfully advocated for a change to the College’s language requirement to allow Indigenous students to receive credit for proficiency in their native languages.
HUNAP hosts a series of offerings each year, ranging from welcoming receptions to open houses to seminar series.
“I have been developing an Indigenous health seminar series, which just got started this year,” Gone said. “This got hundreds of people participating often not from Harvard but even Indigenous people from different communities around the country.”
In the future, Lowe said she hopes HUNAP will only grow larger as a program. She added she was optimistic for a “sincere and dedicated focus” on new curricula around Native studies and decolonization.
Still, progress can be “slow” at Harvard due to its decentralized nature, according to Lowe.
“It’s not impossible, but there’s different pockets and different ways that you have to move things forward to get it to really reach the entire campus,” Lowe said. “But we’re here and we’re gonna keep going at it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to conduct a student experience survey for the spring 2021 semester and release a fitness and recreation resource guide.
Sponsored by a spate of Council representatives across Adams, Cabot, Quincy, Currier, and Kirkland Houses, the legislation would allow the Council to create and disseminate a student experience survey to gauge satisfaction with the spring 2021 semester and signal their preferences for the fall 2021 semester.
“The Undergraduate Council can influence the Administration’s plans if it speaks out before the plan is released,” the legislation reads.
The legislation explains the Council’s influence upon the administration’s plans for each semester, citing the Council’s influence on the spring 2021 plans.
“The Undergraduate Council has already influenced the Administration’s Spring 2021 reopening plan in many ways, such as by convincing the Administration to allow students to have a guest in their rooms and to extend the optional pass/fail deadline to the 11th Monday,” the legislation reads.
The vote to release the survey was 36-0-7. The UC will open the survey on Wednesday, March 17, and accept responses from students for one week.
The second piece of legislation would allow the Council to publish a fitness and recreation resource guide to respond to the increased demand for physical health resources during the pandemic.
The guide will inform students of virtual fitness classes and other special workshops and encourage students to utilize these services.
Sponsored by President Noah Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, the legislation was passed by a motion of unanimous consent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said in a Friday interview he anticipates that state vaccine shipments will remain low through March but is “hopeful” that supplies will increase in April, in time to send students home for the summer vaccinated.
Since December, when HUHS began vaccinations, Harvard has submitted weekly requests to the state asking for thousands of doses, according to Nguyen. Due to insufficient supply and a focus on larger-scale facilities, he explained, HUHS has only received 100 or 200 doses at a time.
Nguyen said he expects this trend will continue until the end of the month, though he hopes supplies will increase in April.
“I got a communication from the state just last week saying that we should basically not expect a whole lot for the rest of March, and they’re going to do their best to make sure that we have enough to give people their second doses,” he said. “I’m anticipating that when we reach April and there will be larger supplies across the Commonwealth, I’m really hopeful that the state will be able to give us a lot more vaccines.”
As of Friday, HUHS had administered over 1,100 of the 1,300 total doses it received from the state, getting all second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine into patients’ arms on time thus far, Nguyen added. The clinic is on track to use up its vaccine supply by the end of the week.
HUHS is currently vaccinating patients who are 65 and older or have two co-morbidities, according to a Wednesday vaccine update from chief medical officer Dr. Soheyla D. Gharib. Previously, it has vaccinated clinical students and staff from the School of Dental Medicine, Covid- and patient-facing affiliates of Harvard Medical School, lab workers handling Covid specimens, the clinic’s healthcare workers, and people who clean in healthcare settings, Nguyen said.
Nguyen said he was thankful that HUHS has been able to expand its vaccination program to include older patients and employees. It has prioritized available doses based on age, beginning with those in their 90s, then to those in their 80s, then to those in their 70s, he said.
“But I would say that there are probably many thousands of people in the Harvard community who are already eligible, certainly more than we have had enough doses to administer,” Nguyen said. “I’m hopeful that many of them have been able to get shots through the state’s facilities, but I know that it's not as easy.”
Starting Thursday, March 11, K-12 educators, child care workers, and school staff became eligible to book a vaccine appointment in Massachusetts. In its latest update, HUHS directed patients in these categories to seek vaccination opportunities from all available sources to prevent longer wait times.
Although HUHS has only received the Moderna vaccine, it is prepared to store any of the three Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S., according to Nguyen. He said HUHS is not among the sites to which the Commonwealth has distributed single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
HUHS facilities are prepared to handle large-scale vaccination campaigns given their experience administering yearly influenza vaccinations and Covid tests, Nguyen said.
“If we got 1,000 doses tomorrow, we would be able to administer that within several days — we would be able to set up systems for people to go online and make appointments,” he said. “In a couple weeks, we probably would be able to vaccinate 1,000 people a day, if we had enough doses to.”
“We have the expertise and the capacity to do this — we are just waiting for the doses to come rolling in,” he added.
In his first primetime address Thursday, President Joe Biden directed all states to make adults eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine by May 1. Nguyen said HUHS would “most certainly” take part in those inoculation efforts if they have sufficient supply to vaccinate all eligible Harvard affiliates by then.
“We have a lot of students who are likely to leave the Cambridge, Boston area in late spring. And I would love to be able to send them back to their home communities protected,” he said. “That is our goal, and again, it really just depends on the availability.”
Nguyen added that a full campus return in fall 2021 is within the “realm of possibility” if everybody who returns to campus is vaccinated, although he said HUHS is not currently discussing a vaccine mandate.
“They need to get vaccinated. That is the most critical piece for us to get back to some sense of normal,” he said.
But even with a fully vaccinated campus population, he cautioned, the fall will not completely resemble a normal semester.
“It will involve, I believe, some degree of masking, some degree of testing, until we are certain that everything looks good,” he said. “I think everyone is very hopeful we’ll be able to see things more normal, and we’ll be able to bring more of us back together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activists with Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — a student group calling for the University to divest from fossil fuels — filed a complaint with Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 on Monday, alleging that Harvard’s highest governing board is violating state law through its continued investments in the fossil fuel industry.
The complaint claims the University’s fossil fuel holdings, valuated at less than two percent of the total endowment, represent the Harvard Corporation’s “failure” to comply with a provision of the 2009 Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act provision that stipulates that not-for-profit entities have a duty to invest with their charitable purposes in mind.
Should the Attorney General’s office review the complaint and find that the University’s fossil fuel holdings do violate UPMIFA, it could have the authority to direct the University to sell its estimated $838 million — based on the two percent estimate — in fossil fuel holdings, according to Joseph E. “Ted” Hamilton, an attorney who helped Divest Harvard prepare the complaint.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the complaint. The Attorney General’s office declined to comment.
The UPMIFA — which has been adopted by 49 states — removed some spending rules for charitable endowments and allowed not-for-profit groups to modify the restrictions donors place on the management, investment, or duration of their gifts.
Divestment activists also took their cause to the legal system in 2014, when seven students asked a state court to order Harvard to immediately sell off its fossil fuel holdings. The Massachusetts Superior Court dismissed the case, holding that the students lacked distinct interest in the management of the University’s endowment.
Six years after their unsuccessful lawsuit, Divest Harvard decided to pursue a different legal strategy. Activists are now betting that their 54-page complaint — which boasts the signatures of 65 Harvard affiliates, elected officials, climate scientists, and partner organizations — will push the Attorney General’s Non-Profit Organizations and Public Charities Division to determine whether Harvard’s investments are in violation of state law.
“This is not a lawsuit,” Hamilton said. “It’s not litigation. It’s a whole bunch of community members showing their support for the Attorney General taking action.”
Hamilton, a Harvard Law School graduate and co-founder of the Climate Defense Project, has also lent his expertise to other divestment efforts.
In November 2019, he helped file a similar complaint against Cornell University with New York Attorney General Letitia A. James. Hamilton credits the legal complaint with Cornell’s eventual decision to divest from fossil fuels in May 2020.
The complaint against Harvard alleges the University’s refusal to withdraw its endowment funds from an industry that contributes to “environmental destruction and social injustice” that contradicts its charitable mission.
It also argues the University does not manage its funds “with prudence,” citing the poor performance of fossil fuel companies in the stock market in recent years.
“In the last several months, the oil industry has begun to crumble, with the COVID-19 pandemic adding to already historic losses,” the complaint reads. “For any prudent investor, these signs clearly indicate that continued investment in fossil fuels is a losing proposition.”
Signatories on the complaint include State Reps. Nika C. Elugardo and Erika Uyterhoeven, both Democrats and Harvard alumni; City Councilors from Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, and Newton; Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74 and several other Harvard faculty; and former U.S. Sen. Timothy E. Wirth ’61, a former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.
Bevis Longstreth, a former official with the Securities and Exchange Commission who worked on the adoption of the UPMIFA in 2009 and joined the complaint, said in a press release that the University should not hold investments in businesses dependent on carbon emissions.
“Seeking profit from such activities today, or in the future, cannot be squared with Harvard’s charitable purposes,” Longstreth said.
Healey, the Democratic Attorney General, sued ExxonMobil in 2019 for allegedly misleading customers and investors about the risks of climate change due to the burning of fossil fuels. Theodore V. Wells Jr., a partner at New York law firm Paul Weiss and a member of the Harvard Corporation, is representing Exxon in the suit. Wells has recused himself from Corporation deliberations or votes related to fossil fuel divestment since becoming Exxon's counsel in climate change litigation in 2015, according to the University.

With the challenges of Covid-19, it’s safe to say that every single House stepped up to make a fire video in light of pandemic precautions and remote learning. And even if the video is slightly less-than-fire, it’s still worth getting hyped because each and every house has their own amazing perks. Dying to know who took this year’s crown? Without further ado, we present Flyby’s Official Housing Day Video Rankings for 2021.
1. Eliot: This That Domus
After Eliot’s uh… poor showing last year, this one was a welcome surprise. I mean, we were hype within the first 20 seconds, unlike some videos (*cough* Mather *cough*). It was something fresh with a catchy beat, great lyrics, and quality production value that made us hit repeat. “I mean wOaH.” Also, those library shots? Immaculate. The transition from kitchen to river at 1:59? Artistry. Seriously. Cannot rave more about this amazing Housing Day video. Can’t wait to see how Kirkland answers the shade at 2:35 next year 👀
2. Mather: Popstar
A dedicated group of our writers stood by this hot take, so we’ll let them explain: The good vocals and House spirit on this track will surely replace the DJ Khaled version as the True Version of Popstar™. The sacrifices made (read: touching the Charles without a hazmat suit, eating a kiwi with the skin on) along with the J.P. Licks mention and the stellar music production were enough to bump this video up to runner-up. Were some of us bothered by the long intro? Yeah. But, once you get to 2:25, it’s all good content. Also, bonus points for showing us all around Mather, from the tunnels to the courtyard to the basketball courts to the dhall.
3. Cabot: Cabot Gang
Last year, Cabot rolled out a fire Housing Day video, rife with cool special effects and high-quality music production. This year, Cabot rolled out a fire Housing Day video, rife with cool special effects and high-quality music production nearly indistinguishable from the first one, which is why it only nabbed third. Except, this year, it was filmed entirely at night, and we didn’t get to see much of their House. C’mon, y’all got great rooms — why didn’t you show them off? Also, where did they get the car?
4. Kirkland: Walk a Puppy
Kirkland has long been renowned as a canine haven, and they really leaned into it this year. The whole video, actually, was very Kirkland-y, from the dogs to the Zuck cameo to the frequent boar mentions. Also, we love seeing merch with K-House’s new flag. Kirkland’s rendition of WAP made us cry with laughter, and the Ben Shapiro bit sealed the deal. Can cheerleading hit up the man who did the split? The bad-ass rapping and creative House roasts, combined with the adorable dog cameos, made this one a real winner. Also, we love that they really decided to use a dumpster as a prop in their video. Stay weird, Kirkland.
5. Lowell: LOWELL
Remember when life was good? Yeah, this video is making us think of good times circa fall 2019 — making us want to get up and groove while conveniently sipping some tea. Not only was it a fun rendition, but the scenes of Lowell left us jealous and wanting more. I mean, guys — those drone shots? Unmatched. We’re also big fans of the lyrics; definitely not the same vibe as Eliot, but still cute and clever regardless. (“See the courtyard? It’s a courtyard. And over here, it’s another courtyard.”) Huge shoutout to the Oatly feature, and who knows — maybe Lowell just found a new sponsor. Also, a very wholesome cameo from Faculty Deans David and Nina at the end was the cherry on top. Solid work, guys.
6. Leverett: Love Story (Lev’s Version)
We’re massive fans of the flashback montage at the start; Lev has had some back-to-back bangers in recent years. Also, one of our writers in particular was ready to place Lev at the top for the pun alone (not to mention the purest sense of nostalgia we’ve felt in months). The wholesome vibes in this video made us miss Harvard (and our childhoods, we love you Taylor) that much more. Hype? Not exactly. But, new Bunnies definitely got an amazing preview of Lev’s spaces and sweet community. Plus 10 points for making us cry. (And another 20 points for a Flyby cameo<3).
7. Winthrop: What’s Throppin
Just when we finally get the Jack Harlow version unstuck from our brains, Winthrop hit us with the “What’s Throppin?”. Honestly, the Throp Lion had some infectious hype, and ThropTok may have just gained a new follower. The hype lyrics and recycled scenes from the past (rip, Grille mozz sticks, we miss you) made us nostalgic and excited for housing life post-Covid, but sank it in the rankings. Overall, pretty solid.
8. Adams: Bank Account
Okay, not gonna lie, this one broke our hearts a little. First of all, this video has us ENVIOUS of Adam’s gold walls and puppies. The professional level rapping had us racing to keep up (maybe consider doing Rap God next year??) and the ~gorgeous~ cinematography gave freshmen hoping for Adams an amazing view of the best spaces in and around the House. But, the sound quality was on par with a Zoom recording. Also, the unique reasons to love Adams were few and far between. As always, they had a lot to live up to following 2019’s smash success, but next time we’d spend less time pointing out what other people are saying about your House’s cons and talk up the perks (see Eliot’s vid if you need an example). Show us more of that Adams spirit we know and love!!
9. Positions: Pfoho Edition and Quincy Edition 
Oof, this conundrum almost imploded our rankings. It was definitely the Housing Day version of showing up to prom in the same dress as someone else, so we feel that it would be unfair to pit these two against each other. Most of our writers had no idea Pfoho had that many amenities, so way to make use of the video to show off the perks of your House! Quincy definitely won the wordplay contest (whole separate category next time around?) with some ~amazing~ lyrics. Considering they both tackled a song by the goddess herself Ariana Grande, we HAVE to acknowledge the bravery while also unfortunately deducting some points for creativity. Both videos featured fantastic singing, glorious Quincy and Pfoho House spirit, and some awesome shots of each House — above all, both very solid videos competing against a tough bracket this time around.
10. Currier: Currier Treestyle
This rendition of Drake and Giveon got us deep in our feels as we were mesmerized by the vibin’ Birch tree. As we sat there contemplating our lives, Currier House went full out on team spirit and smooth lines to coax their way to our hearts. But, Currier landed near the bottom of the ranking for more than one reason. First, somehow, the sound quality was worse than Adams (not an easy feat). Second, definitely lacking the necessary hype for Housing Day. If you can’t take shots (of Oatly, obviously) to a Housing Day video, did it really accomplish its mission? Lastly, the lyrics were solid, but the rapping itself was… subpar. Sorry, y’all, but the competition has raised our standards.
11. Dunster: Dunster is a good house.
… dawg what?
Why did the beginning feel like a Home Depot commercial? We’re confused. Also, it has some dAy iN tHe LiFE oF a HarVarD StUdENt YouTuber vibes. In all seriousness, while Dunster’s video wasn’t as hype as years past, it was informative and all thirteen minutes of it got us feeling some mega Dunster love. Unfortunately, everyone on the Blog has a two minute attention span, so we’re not really sure what happened in those last 11 minutes.
Ranking aside, congrats to all the Houses for making these amazing videos — while they may be hard work even in a normal year, we can’t imagine all the love and tears that went into them this year. For all the freshmen that are either cheering with friends or their parents who have no idea what’s going on, stay excited! For the freshmen sobbing in the corner, it gets better. At the end of the day, get ready for an amazing three years in your new homes!
