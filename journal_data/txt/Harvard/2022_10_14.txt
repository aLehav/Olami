After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It sometimes feels like a quiet moment is a moment wasted. I’ll notice the silence while I’m sitting on the bus or folding laundry and I’ll turn on a podcast soon after. My friends watch lectures on 2x speed and turn on Netflix while doing homework. I often do assigned readings an hour before class, so I only have time to skim them before the thoughts are lost to the next assignment.
Social media enables an unprecedented volume of content at our fingertips, going beyond its predecessors — the printing press, newspapers, radio, television — which were already criticized for their damaging effects on American culture and democracy. Today’s media contains magnitudes more content in every shape and size. More than 400 hours of video are published to YouTube every minute. Podcasts discuss topics from frog facts to the constitution, and YouTube videos teach skills from high school chemistry to songwriting. Arguably, technological media innovation enables greater access to information and more opportunities for learning and dialogue.
However, modern readers often experience the opposite — they’re overwhelmed, fatigued, and distracted. We’re reaching information overload, and conversely, content creators are facing an oversaturated landscape. Most Twitter trending topics last for less than an hour, and influencers and celebrities know that any hate or fame they receive is short lived. In many ways, more actually isn’t better.
Take the news as an example. The New York Times publishes around 230 pieces of content daily, and writers can produce as many as five articles in a day. Not only is it harder to produce higher volumes of quality journalism, but articles are likely to be glossed over unless they trigger an emotional reaction or otherwise go “viral”. It’s a mutually damaging relationship: Readers have less time to digest, so writers spend less time writing, and writers focus on writing things that capture attention, so readers scroll through their feed mindlessly until something catches their attention.
This leads to a reactive digital culture, especially when sharing media. In 2020, Twitter began prompting users to read an article before retweeting it, which reportedly increased article reading by 33 percent three months later. However, they haven’t reported any updated statistics since 2020. One 2016 study finds that 59 percent of links on Twitter aren’t clicked on before they’re shared.
It’s not just Twitter — TikTok, Reddit, and other social media platforms seem designed to display public perception as much as the content itself. After watching a YouTube video or Tiktok, I almost always read the comments to gauge the general sentiment, often before I’ve formed my own opinions. Similarly, many Reddit forums cultivate a group mindset where an entire subreddit holds shared opinions. Users who approach these subreddits as passive readers will often simply accept the mainstream view, while active posters will usually contribute well-accepted opinions to garner upvotes.

Instead of passively accepting content served to us, we as consumers must be intentional about what media we consume and how we consume it.
Cal Newport writes extensively about intentional consumption in a cluttered and distracted world in his books, Digital Minimalism and Deep Work. In Digital Minimalism, he details the ideology of a digital minimalist as a person who continually analyzes digital tools and aggressively eliminates whatever doesn’t align with personal values. In Deep Work, he defines a distraction-free, mentally strenuous thinking state in which you produce more creative or original thoughts. Combining these two ideas, we can reclaim control over our relationship to media and generate more independent thoughts by choosing which media we consume and reading them in a mentally straining way — that is, not skimming or simply accepting someone else’s opinion.
Quiet is an underrated treasure in a digitally cluttered world. Listening, not posting, is an increasingly rare skill. We’re urged to respond quickly by an unrelenting global conversation, but we often end up repeating sentiments we’ve read online or accepting thoughts because “everyone thinks so” without ever reconsidering.
Preserving solitude for deep thinking after reading is just as important as the reading itself, especially if we’re to empathize and be in dialogue with others, not just react.
The daunting reality of social and political polarization, and the resulting societal harm, comes down to a lack of understanding. Slower media consumption won’t magically address every issue, but it’ll help people build empathy in a time when social media feeds us dehumanizing narratives. Behind every photo, post, article, podcast is a person and often a story of many, many more people that deserves our listening.
Once you take time to consider what you’re consuming, you might find sympathy for people you wouldn’t have expected to. You might find joy in a slower, more intentional lifestyle not constantly inundated with information. You might find that you have less to say, and that’s not a bad thing. You might be inspired to create something of your own, and enter into a more thoughtful conversation with real people behind the online usernames.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Her name meaning “miracles”, mi mamá is 5’8” with curly, brown pelo malo and a warm smile and laugh. Her skin is freckled by the sun, an imprint of her youth in Puerto Rico. And oh, how I love how she speaks — in English and Spanish. Beyond what meets the eye and ear is a brilliant woman — the first in her family to leave the island, get a Ph.D., and surpass socioeconomic barriers limiting those before her. Milagros don’t happen without hard work, and to that, she is the epitome of her name. To me, she is incredible and beautiful. But to many, it is hard to look past what meets the eye and ear, and they hastily make assumptions about her.
Growing up, I never thought mamá sounded different from my friends’ parents. But although I felt she spoke like everyone else, everyone else thought she spoke like “Puerto Rico.” I ceased to hear her voice from her mouth and began to hear it only through the warped tongue of others. Each instance of people mocking her accent and gleefully using it to enhance their punchlines distorted my perception of what it meant to be Puerto Rican. I became increasingly aware of others’ impatient facial expressions at the start of her sentences and realized that her experience as a Puerto Rican in America was far more different than I’d imagined.
When mamá came to Iowa for graduate school, she spent most of her time with international students. They bonded over how professors spoke obnoxiously slow to them, how classmates mocked their accents, or how they missed home (especially during the freezing Iowa winters). The frequent microaggressions from American students and professors led her to find comfort with those who shared her identity as an outsider — but she did not find this comfort in other Hispanic students.
Partly in an attempt to escape the Puerto Rican stereotype and partly due to prejudice within the community, mamá sought non-Hispanic companions. The Latin American diaspora is wonderfully diverse: Each Spanish-speaking province and nation has a unique history and substantial differences in their Spanish. However, this uniqueness is unfortunately not always celebrated in the Hispanic community; Western influence and colonization have sowed divisions and created a hierarchy of Latine ethnicities. Within this hierarchy, there exists the stereotype that Puerto Ricans don’t speak the “right” type of Spanish. The quick and informal nature of the Puerto Rican dialect has birthed the untrue assumption that Puerto Ricans are less intelligent by nature. With every other Hispanic nation claiming to have the “better Spanish” while generally looking down upon Boricuas, a world absent of this divide feels impossible.
Even within the Caribbean, western beauty standards stemming from colonization influence how Latine individuals are judged and judge each other. Pelo malo is linked with being unkempt, lower-class, and dirty, while pelo lacio is smooth, desirable, beautiful, and professional. This same narrative exists in America, making up yet another layer in our intricate web of biases.
Because accents have become the flag bearers of stereotypes, Puerto Ricans often struggle between quiet assimilation and being proud of our heritage. Puerto Rican history, traditions, and even our importance in the American political eye have diminished due to the stereotype staining our reputation.
There is also a double standard in America between Western and non-Western accents. People are drawn to narrators like David Attenborough and relatedly find British people more intelligent, sophisticated, and attractive simply because of their type of accent. This is not a privilege Puerto Ricans, Hispanics, and other non-Western people have. British people are a blend of familiarity and foreignness, tolerably exotic. Since the cultural similarities between Americans and Brits are greater, Americans feel comfortable with their othering qualities. But due to xenophobia ingrained in American society, anything too different is scary. So, we assign assumptions to the people we don’t understand, thus birthing stereotypes that perpetuate cultural divides.
Accents tell a story that we will never begin to understand unless we listen. Our general impatience for those who speak differently burns the bridge between their unique perspectives and our own. And let’s not forget that Hispanic accents typically mean that person knows at least two languages — more than the average American.
But not all is bad for non-native English speakers. Mamá described a silver lining to being Puerto Rican in America: her accent provides comfort. She is known for translating for Hispanic families in my town’s public schools. Sometimes at the supermarket, strangers ask her in Spanish questions they didn’t feel comfortable asking the employees. She even expressed how it was only after she came to America that she learned to love her pelo malo after years of straightening it, wearing it naturally to emphasize her identity to others. The connections Mamá’s identity allows her to make are beautiful, and so is being Boricua. It’s about time America hears and sees this beauty too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the most common complaints at today’s American dinner table is that “No one in Washington is talking about the issues that really matter.” As political elites jostle over narrow issues like RINO-hood and other partisan flashpoints, many Americans see Capitol Hill’s suit-wearers as overlooking more tangible concerns — like, say, low and decreasing economic mobility. This worrisome gap between Congress and the U.S. populace is one that Harvard can, by virtue of its many fingers in American politics, help fill, improving its own national image in the process.
And, with anti-elite sentiment on the rise, improve Harvard must. The school’s strategy here should target both representation and outreach, taking care to build classes geographically representative of the U.S. and university initiatives that reflect a determination to leave no sect of our country overlooked.
Symptoms of Harvard’s poor national outreach are easy to find. The school frequently fields attacks from populist talking heads (who are themselves emblematic of pervasive, defensive distrust among American voters). In late August, for example, Tucker Carlson gleefully ridiculed former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, a current visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
“Naturally, you would think Bill de Blasio would have a shining career as a homeless person himself after his time in office,” Carlson jeered on his eponymous talk show. “Well, there’s one place in America that would hire Bill de Blasio: Harvard University.”
Perhaps it isn’t surprising that Harvard is a favorite target of Americans justly angry with broader political elitism — in addition to its aura of wealth and prestige, the school churns out national politicians like no other. At the dawn of the 117th Congress in 2021, 54 out of 435 voting members could lay claim to a Harvard degree, 40 of whom were Democrats. In this sense, contempt for Harvard, in all its (purported) Congress-controlling glory, looks a lot like contempt for the dimly lit cogs and wheels spinning in our nation’s capital.
If its label as a retreat for coastal gentry isn’t sufficient reason to engage in some image rehab, Harvard has a moral obligation to care for the health of American democracy. The mission of Harvard College, to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” has no meaning if those future leaders are seen by their constituents as totally indifferent to real human needs.
Trust in institutions is the sine qua non of democratic stability; in a public sphere marked by rising polarization, increasingly inexperienced leaders, and partisan fracturing, continual distrust threatens total upheaval.
This is not to say that Harvard and its students have not made meaningful steps toward connecting with Americans from areas underrepresented in the College. For one, the Institute of Politics presently hosts a former Wyoming governor and former West Virginia secretary of state as visiting fellows, importing valuable perspectives from two of Harvard’s least common student home states. In a similar vein, a new student organization called the Harvard Appalachian Student Association has launched programming designed to promote higher education as attainable to Appalachian students, at top-ranking universities especially.
Both initiatives promise to help draw Harvard’s institutional gaze toward neglected regions like Appalachia and the Mountain States, bridging the gap between Harvard and areas likely to hold political views associated with a higher incidence of resentment for elite universities (not to mention reducing Harvard students’ seeming contempt for lower-income, less educated, more conservative voting blocs).
But there is more work to be done. For one, Harvard College Admissions should make geographic diversity a higher priority; as a 2015 Crimson feature reported, 51.5 percent of non-international Class of 2018 students were from New York, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts, states which together hold 23.2 percent of the U.S. population. This is a grave failure.
Harvard professors should make a more concerted effort to create curriculums representative of America as a whole, too — if economic convergence between the U.S. and China offered a good case study for the several-hundred-person Econ 10B: Principles of Economics class, so too could convergence between underserved Appalachia and its more prosperous neighbors.
With just a few targeted efforts, the University can simultaneously fortify its reputation against populist vitriol and fulfill its self-professed mission to support American democracy and educate its leaders. An insular Harvard helps no one but its direct affiliates, but a Harvard whose institutions embody humility and open-mindedness has the capacity to pacify some of our country’s deepest and most destructive fault lines.

Earlier this semester, our Editorial Board rejoiced in the fact that we had finally reached a new normal. Yet even as we shed mandatory masking and thrice-weekly testing, we were unable to eliminate midterms and other fall staples. As we prepare for a seemingly-endless barrage of exams and papers, we asked our members to reflect on this season with humor while also capturing the unique sentiment of a cohort experiencing the full renaissance of “normal” student life.
I’m looking forward to the way everything looks in the fall — it’s just such a pretty season. There’s a tree in bloom on Plympton street, across from the building where the publication you’re reading was crafted: The tree is red, yellow, and orange and the leaves are big. The tree has started to shed. Every time I walk by 14 Plympton St., I look first at the building and then the tree; I’m reminded of some fundamental truths — autumn in Cambridge is beautiful, and there will always be people in 14p.
—Shanivi Srikonda ’24
I like the red and green and yellow leaves. They remind me of home — of my mom, saying, “Oh, Sterling! Aren’t the leaves beautiful?” It is my senior fall, and in some ways, things are as fresh as first year. Some relationships are re-invigorating, some are forming anew. Some remain, some fall away. I’m learning to be OK with it all, to let the leaves fall and grow again, where they may.
—Sterling M. Bland ’23
I expect to see every single one of you go all out for Halloween. I’m talking fake blood by the bucketful, mechanical arms powered by tiny servos, or rhinestone-studding every inch of visible skin. Give me drama! Halloween is the one night (or series of nights, for us college students) of the year when it’s acceptable to do anything you want with your physical form — as long as it’s not boring.
—Christina M. Xiao ‘24
Fall means pies! With October in full sway, it is now time to eat as many pies as you want. From the classics like pecan pie to the random everything-but-the-kitchen-sink pies, it is now the most socially acceptable time to eat pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is the one delicious, classic cliché that I am most excited about.
—Hea Pushpraj ’25
Known for spooky season, apple-picking, and beautiful foliage, October epitomizes my love for the fall. It’s finally socially permissible to break out my Timbs and laugh at the horde waiting inside Starbucks for their pumpkin-spiced lattes (you know who you are). Plus, the weather inspires the hardest fits. October has everything to deem it the best month, but I refuse to call it such: slandered by its most infamous alias, cuffing season never fails to make me gag. Between couple’s costumes and pumpkin patch dates, nothing makes me want to inspire a horror movie more. Call me a hater, but this cliché has to go. You don’t actually like that person – it’s just October.
— Maia Patel-Masini ’25
October is the best month of the year. Not only does the cold weather make us stronger, but it’s a month for sweaters and screenings of “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.”
— Brooks B. Anderson ’25
There’s nothing quite like the betrayal of a rain-dampened leaf masquerading as something crunchy — a stomp-able entity. Coming from California, where October is dry to the point of destruction, these soft, two-faced leaves were a new species to me. But even now, three autumns later, my boot still seeks out every promising leaf on the walk to class. The fallen foliage, blending like sunset on the Cambridge sidewalks, is too inviting not to.
—Eleanor V. Wikstrom ’24
Every October, the windows of The Crimson’s Sanctum come alive with a mosaic of red, orange, and fading green leaves from the tree in the courtyard across the street. Usually, the tree reminds me of my favorite fall traditions to come: birthdays, big sweaters, warm drinks, and eventually snow. This year, it’s a pesky landlord reminding me that my residence within the four walls of The Crimson is almost at a close.
—Raquel Coronell Uribe ’22-’23
Midterm season means tiny treats around every corner. Stopping to steal the last few Earl Grey Tea packets in Winthrop’s dining hall before heading across Kaneb courtyard to cozy up with my laptop for a handful of hours. A packet of peanut M&Ms from the nearest vending machine. A cafe au lait from Clover in between my 9 and 10:30 a.m. sections — and (if I’ve really earned it) another one before lecture at 1:30. Don’t worry about the caffeinated chihuahua shake, it’ll pass.
—Haley A. Lifrieri ’24
The end of September means the end of Capital One Café’s 50 percent off deal and the beginning of October and haunting midterms. I’ve always hated coffee, but to sustain this undead status for midterms, I came to love coffee: to wake myself up to study, to keep studying, and to distract myself from studying for half an hour. But without the sale, I cannot pay full price for a mediocre (and colorfully inconsistent) chai latte. Now I await the return of Starbucks in Harvard Square in November — if I am paying $6 for a coffee, it better be good.
—Brian Baltazar Pimentel ’23
Copious volumes of iced coffee and daily references to my “Days Until Thanksgiving Break” countdown.
— Gracia A. Perala ’25
I have recently discovered two things that have made my midterm season much more bearable: 1) Dumplings are one of the best foods to ever exist and 2) Dumpling Kitchen is open until 2:15 a.m. (at least according to Uber Eats). After a long night in Lamont (and I’m talking long-long — Social Studies readings can be brutal), trudging back to my dorm room tastes a bit sweeter when I’m met with a beautiful brown bag of dumplings in front of the Kirkland gates.
—Nicole B. Alexander ’24
As I trudge through midterm season, there is nothing I look forward to more than going to sleep after a long day of studying. The stress-induced fatigue of academic pressure or soothing relief after finishing a paper or exam makes the dreamless rest all the better. Even though midterms are relentless, and the rising sun just shines a light on a new set of assignments, the precious hours of sleep are exactly what I need to get through another day. Plus, it’s almost December anyway — right?
—Libby E. Tseng ’24
I took a break for the long weekend and went to Disney with my dad: I photosynthesized and savored every sip of my iced lattes. As a self proclaimed cold-blooded human, I knew I’d return to hot lattes as soon as my plane landed back in Massachusetts (my fall-midterms season is unofficially sponsored by vanilla lattes). Post-trip, I’m feeling stressed, but refreshed, and ready to pull some all-nighters.
—Abigail V. Mack ’25
Walks across the Yard, skirting between tables to chat with friends in Kirkland dining hall, traversing up the stairs of Smith Campus Center to find a cozy nook to study in for the afternoon — these are my pockets of peace.
Movement throughout the day lets me catch a breath, slow down, and appreciate the fleeting moments. Whether I am three hours deep into an intensive organic chemistry exam review or exhausted beyond measure from a dance practice that ended at midnight, I always find time to slip into the common room and share a laugh with my roommates or trek to a swinging chair in the courtyard for a Facetime check-in with my brother. And with that, the shadow of midterms subsides, and all is well.
—Alvira Tyagi ’25
As much as red spiced chicken and brain break help, it’s really solidarity with friends that keeps me going through midterms — that is, solidarity in exhaustion and abject dread about deadlines and exams.
—Lucas Gazianis ’24
Compartmentalization has kept me together. Midterm season (arguably the second half of the semester in its entirety) has a tendency to upend plans I made for the semester. Not this time though! I am actively trying to set boundaries between the different parts of my life. I structure preparing for my midterms around my week, and not my week around my midterm. Having midterms doesn’t mean everything else in my life has to pause. It isn’t the easiest thing to do but I continually find new ways of compartmentalizing.
—Joshia Ochieng ’24
Sheer inertia has kept me going this midterm season. There’s a thousand things that make me happy (certain friends, home-cooked meals in my new kitchen, the right smile from the right person, and this board in particular) and a couple thousand that don’t (midterms, tripping on the same stone twice, little sleep, seeing closeness twisted into distance). Throughout it all, nothing has kept me going but the knowledge that I was already going — that I’m on track to get my degree, that I wake up every day in a Harvard dorm, with views to a Harvard library to a bunch of Harvard emails reminding me of my Harvard work. That to not keep going would require more effort than to merely follow through.
Maybe that’s what keeps all of us on track: We are already here, following a fenced, carefully crafted crimson path. Whether that’s good thing, or just the execution of pre-programmed days, I’m not quite sure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The value of Harvard University’s endowment fell by $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2022 after the Harvard Management Company delivered a 1.8 percent loss on its investments — its first year of negative returns since 2016.
The losses, which brought the endowment’s total value to $50.9 billion, represent the third-worst annual investment results Harvard has seen in the last 20 years, coming in stark contrast to the record-breaking 33.6 percent returns the University enjoyed last year.
The figures were released by Harvard on Thursday in the University’s Annual Financial Report, which offers a rare glimpse into Harvard’s finances and investment strategy each October.
Harvard’s negative returns come as high inflation and rising interest rates continue to rattle financial markets. In a note announcing the results, HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar wrote that the primary reason behind the endowment losses was “the poor performance of global equity markets.” The S&P 500 fell by 11 percent during fiscal year 2022, which ended in June.
Despite the losses, Harvard officials say they are satisfied with HMC’s performance. In a note included in the report, University treasurer Paul J. Finnegan and Harvard Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister wrote that the returns were a “very good result given the significant declines in both the equity and bond markets in the past year.”
Several of Harvard’s peer institutions also experienced endowment losses during the last fiscal year. MIT’s investments lost 5.3 percent, while Cornell reported a 1.3 percent loss. Yale reported a slight positive return, at 0.8 percent.
The endowment distributed $2.1 billion toward Harvard’s operational budget in fiscal year 2022, representing 36 percent of the University’s annual revenue, according to the financial report. Harvard ended the fiscal year with a $406 million budget surplus.
In his note included in the report, Narvekar announced that the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing board — approved a proposal that will “moderately increase” the risk level of HMC’s portfolio “over a multi-year period.” HMC formed a risk tolerance group in 2018 to assess how the endowment could take on more risk in its investments while balancing the University’s need for budgetary stability.
“This increase will eventually make our risk level more consistent with that of various peers, although it will still be lower than some,” Narvekar wrote.
Last year, despite record-breaking totals, Harvard’s endowment performance trailed that of many of its peers, which Narvekar attributed to the “opportunity cost of taking lower risk” than some other institutions.
HMC has drastically scaled back its investments in nonrenewable energy sources in recent years, which Narvekar said contributed slightly to its overall losses in fiscal year 2022. Harvard announced it would allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire and it has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its portfolio by 2050.
“A number of institutional investors leaned into the conventional energy sector, through either equities or commodity futures, adding materially to their total return,” Narvekar wrote. “HMC did not participate in these returns given the University’s commitment to tackling the impacts of climate change, supporting sustainable solutions, and achieving our stated net zero goals.”
In a departure from past practice, HMC did not release a breakdown of the endowment’s performance by asset class in the report. The change comes following a restructuring at HMC that has shifted the vast majority of the endowment’s assets to external managers, which “made simplified allocation reporting increasingly arbitrary,” according to HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan.
“Individual investments can straddle multiple asset classes and HMC wants to avoid reporting with false precision,” McKiernan wrote in a statement.
HMC had previously maintained an in-house investment team while also hiring external managers to oversee portions of the endowment, an approach Narvekar phased out upon his arrival in 2016.
In his note, Narvekar also cautioned that the newly released figures may not reflect the actual current market value of some of the endowment’s assets. HMC’s venture capital investments returned “high single digits” despite the “deeply negative performance of relevant public equity indices,” Narvekar wrote.
“The more private assets an investor had in its portfolio in FY22, the stronger their performance,” he wrote. “This is somewhat counterintuitive and may indicate that private managers have not yet marked their portfolios to reflect general market conditions. This phenomenon does make us cautious about forward-looking returns in private portfolios.”
In his closing remarks, Narvekar wrote that the contrast between HMC’s recent losses and its historic gains last year highlights the importance of focusing on long-term investment returns.
“We remain confident that the steps we have taken — and those still in process — to construct a portfolio that serves the University’s long-term interests will allow Harvard to maintain and increase its critical support of students, faculty, and research for generations to come,” Narvekar wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 13, 2022, at 4:56 p.m.
Harvard ended fiscal year 2022 with a $406 million budget surplus, its largest in at least the last two decades, as revenues rose above pre-pandemic levels following two consecutive years of decline.
The University brought in $5.8 billion in revenue over the last fiscal year — up 11 percent from fiscal year 2021. The rise was driven in part by rebounds in revenue streams that suffered during the pandemic, such as tuition and room and board. More enrolled students were on Harvard’s campus last year than at any point in school history due to the return of undergraduates who deferred enrollment during the pandemic.
Expenses also rose by 9 percent, an increase that was muted by staff shortages and supply chain challenges that prevented the school from spending more.
The figures were released by Harvard on Thursday in the University’s Annual Financial Report, which offers a rare glimpse into Harvard’s finances and investment strategy each October.
“The difficulty in hiring people and underlying supply-chain issues were common problems across the country this past year,” Harvard Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister and Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan wrote in a note included in the report. “The combination of the temporary boost in revenues along with temporarily suppressed spending drove a significant portion of the $406 million surplus.”
Consistent with previous years, Harvard’s largest revenue source was its own endowment, which distributed $2.1 billion toward the University’s operating expenses, accounting for about 36 percent of total revenue. The distributions represented 4.2 percent of the endowment’s market value.
Endowment distributions made up a majority of the revenue at three Harvard schools — the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Harvard Divinity School, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The schools least reliant on the endowment in fiscal year 2022 were the Harvard Business School, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate School of Education, which all received roughly 20 percent of their revenue from the endowment.
Harvard increased spending on financial aid by $70 million during the past fiscal year. In March, Harvard College expanded its financial aid program to allow students from families with annual incomes below $75,000 to attend for free — an increase from the previous $65,000 threshold — starting from the Class of 2026.
Cash gifts to the endowment totalled $584 million in fiscal year 2022 — up from $465 million in fiscal year 2021. Current use gifts totalled $505 million, down from $541 million in the previous year.
The Harvard Management Company reported a 1.8 percent loss on its investments during the past fiscal year, its first year of negative returns since 2016. Despite the losses, Hollister and Finnegan wrote in the report that the University’s financial condition “remains very strong” due to “ample levels of liquidity, comparatively low levels of debt, and ready access to borrowings as needed.”
Hollister and Finnegan characterized the negative endowment returns as a “very good result given the significant declines in both the equity and bond markets in the past year,” but added that the University “remains cautious” in its administration of endowment funds.
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in the report that Havard remains prepared for potential financial headwinds.
“Though we find ourselves in a better public health situation today, there remains instability in the global economy and markets, which will continue to influence the University’s financial resources,” he wrote. “Fortunately, prudent planning and sound management have put us in a strong financial position that, along with the generous support of alums and friends, enables us to fulfill our mission.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a report found that Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences faces an “increasing and unsustainable” amount of non-research work, the school is holding discussions to collect feedback on the report’s recommendations, FAS Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview Wednesday.
“I’m eager to hear from more of the faculty as they dig into the report and maybe suggest some other ways in which we can follow through on the spirit and, in some cases, specific recommendations that came out of that report,” Gay said.
Gay shared the report, which was released by the FAS Faculty Workload Committee, with the faculty last month. The school convened the committee in fall 2021 as part of an FAS strategic planning initiative.
The initiative extends from the work of the FAS Study Group formed by Gay in November 2020 to examine the school’s “​​financial sustainability, organizational flexibility, institutional resilience.”
Published in spring 2021, the FAS Study Group’s final report pointed to a lack of channels for addressing faculty concerns related to the workload of providing student support, fulfilling citizenship responsibilities, teaching, and researching. It recommended the FAS initiate conversations on equitable workload distribution and “develop new mechanisms for more intensive review of the faculty activity reports.”
Based on the findings of the FAS Study Group, Gay charged the Faculty Workload Committee with examining the “non-research workload” of faculty at the FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Non-research work includes instruction, mentorship, committee and administrative work, bureaucratic tasks, and diversity, inclusion, and belonging efforts, according to the committee. The term “workload” also includes research.
The report stated that “female or historically minoritized faculty members” bear a disproportionate “abundance of hidden labor,” adding that they are often sought out by students and other faculty who share similar identities.
“Unequal distribution of work engenders an environment in which some faculty benefit at the expense of others who sacrifice both their research time and their work-life balance,” it stated. “The current situation—both the growing amount of administrative work and the unequal distribution of this work—is untenable.”
The Faculty Workload Committee found three main trends in faculty activity reports from 2017 to 2020. First, the amount of non-research work varies across and within divisions. Second, female faculty members advise more graduate students and serve on more committees than their male counterparts. Third, faculty who serve on more committees tend to have more advisees than their colleagues.
The committee also found that Arts and Humanities faculty teach significantly more courses on average than faculty in Social Sciences, Sciences, or SEAS.
This year, the FAS is piloting changes to the faculty activity report. Rather than reporting their yearly activity during a set period in January, Gay said faculty will be able to access the portal throughout more of the year.
Gay said Wednesday that the FAS is also asking department chairs to examine any patterns in the distribution of workload across faculty in their departments.
“We’ll also pinpoint if there are issues that suggest, for example, that maybe tenure-track faculty are overburdened in some ways — I don’t know or think that’s the case — but again, encouraging them to bring that lens as they analyze some of the data about workloads within their own departments,” she said.

Central Rock Gym rocked Harvard Square with its grand opening in the Abbot Building this past August.
Hundreds of people turned out for the gym’s Harvard Square opening on Aug. 12, according to the location’s general manager, Che Hartman. The gym currently has rock climbing programs but will soon expand to offer yoga and fitness classes.
In an interview, Hartman attributed the great turnout of the Harvard Square opening to the gym’s existing customer base.
“The word gets out really quickly,” she said. “Our already existing Central Rock family knew we were coming.”
Hartman added that the location’s first few months “have been amazing”.
Since the opening of its first location in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2009, Central Rock Gym has expanded to 15 locations in New England and New York.
Hartman said both Harvard and MIT students have frequented the new gym thanks to its convenient location close to the Harvard Square T station and Harvard Yard.
Another neighbor of Central Rock Gym is the new location of El Jefe’s Taqueria, a beloved Harvard Square hot spot.
Hartman teased a potential partnership with the restaurant, saying they have been “absolutely the best.”
“They plan on hooking up our members and are more than happy to grow a partnership, which is awesome,” she said.
Another upside of the gym’s location, according to Hartman, has been its proximity to foot traffic.
“The nice thing about where we’re located, is you’re walking the streets – you can see right into the gym, and you can see people on the walls,” she said.
“Just the visibility of us from people walking by has been amazing,” she added.
Hartman also said the gym welcomes newcomers.
“A lot of people in the Cambridge area that have no idea what rock climbing is, or maybe do but didn’t know that we’re here, can actually see our space, and they will kind of mosey on up,” she said.
Central Rock Gym’s Harvard Square location offers student discounts at the beginning of each school year. This year’s special ended on Oct. 1, but the gym continues to offer a discounted membership for anyone aged 22 and under.
Reflecting on the business’ first couple months, Hartman acknowledged stress associated with the opening but said a highlight has been the customers.
“But the first day as soon as people started coming with smiling faces — it’s very cheesy — but that’s been the best part,” she said.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 reflected on the state government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and other health policy issues in a panel at the Harvard School of Public Health on Thursday afternoon.
Baker, who has led Massachusetts throughout the pandemic, discussed navigating the challenges of lockdowns, testing, and monitoring during the rampant spread of Covid-19 with his former chief of staff, Steven Kadish, a current Harvard Kennedy School senior research fellow.
Through Baker’s second term as governor, Massachusetts experienced record Covid-19 cases, at times peaking among states in the Northeast in Covid-19 deaths per capita.
Since the pandemic’s onset, the state had reported more than two million Covid-19 cases and more than 21,000 Covid-19-related deaths as of Thursday evening, according to a New York Times database.
Despite the CDC’s collection of the genetic code of the Covid-19 virus in January 2020, Baker said the slow process in developing a test proved to be a serious challenge.
“The CDC had been given a pretty simple format to develop a test in January,” Baker said. “This was March, and we still didn’t have a test to speak of.”
Baker said the state’s Covid-19 command center — headed by Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders — required assistance from departments across the state bureaucracy.
“[Sudders] told us what she needed from the other parts of the state government, and then we went shopping and brought a whole bunch of people into the command center who were working in other parts of health care,” he said.
In mid-March that year, Baker said more than three million masks ordered by the Massachusetts government “disappeared” after the federal government took them to be distributed “to places they thought were more important.” In response, Baker recounted how he used the New England Patriots’ private plane to fly personal protective equipment over from Alaska.
“We did that route with charter flights seven or eight times over the course of the next couple of months to get all kinds of stuff — swabs and gowns and gloves,” Baker said.
Kadish, who served as an advisor to the governor throughout the pandemic, added that the use of charter flights to deliver supplies after the 2010 Haiti earthquake inspired the Baker administration to use the Patriots’ plane.
“We figured out when other airports were closed that if we could get people’s private charters to be filled with medical equipment and medical professionals, that they could land in the D.R. — the Dominican Republic — and then drive into Haiti,” Kadish said of the 2010 emergency response.
Asked about the pandemic’s impact on underserved populations, Baker said the state partnered with public health non-profit organization Partners in Health when planning its Covid-19 response to focus on “hard-to-reach communities.”
Aside from the virus, Baker noted food insecurity as a major issue during his tenure. He said the state used The Ride — a program that provides transportation to residents with disabilities in Greater Boston — to bring food to residents around the state.
“The Ride ended up becoming a food delivery business over that period of time — sort of like Uber Eats, but no one charges you for it,” Baker said.
During Thursday’s panel, Baker said a “really high-octane social media environment” has led the public to overlook government accomplishments because positive work “doesn’t really generate much news.”
“If you are boring, you don’t get follow-up,” he said.
Outside of the public health issues posed by the pandemic, Baker, a Republican, stressed that some of his more instructive experiences in government have been working with people across the political spectrum, including Kadish, who is a Democrat.
“Most of the most important lessons I’ve learned over my life come from people who didn’t agree with me,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard faculty members and student and alumni organizations signed onto a letter last week urging the committee searching for the school’s 30th president to select a “climate champion” as the University’s next leader.
Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard sent the letter to the presidential search committee on Oct. 4, four months into the University’s hunt for its next president. Seven other student and alumni organizations — including the Student Labor Action Movement and Harvard Forward — signed onto the letter, along with 21 faculty members from Harvard Faculty for Divestment.
“We know Harvard will have to face the challenge of a climate emergency that grows more dire every day,” the letter reads. “The new President must be willing and able to put Harvard’s substantial resources toward combating climate breakdown and community devastation, and refuse to support the companies responsible for such disaster.”
The letter lists three criteria for a climate-forward president: experience in fostering climate research and education, willingness “to manage the endowment in a truly responsible way,” and eagerness to engage with local neighborhoods most impacted by the University’s expansion into Allston.
Alice A. Jardine, a professor of Romance Languages and Literatures who signed the letter, wrote in an email that selecting a leader who can help effectively combat climate change should be a top priority for the committee.
“There is only one matter I care deeply about with regard to the presidential search: the next president of Harvard must be ready to lead in a very dynamic, public way every initiative possible to meet the challenge of climate collapse,” Jardine wrote. “If we do not save the planet, nothing else any of us does will matter.”
The letter opened with an acknowledgment of steps Harvard has recently taken to mitigate climate change, including the creation of the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability and the appointment of a vice provost for climate and sustainability. In September 2021, after a decade of pressure, the University announced that it will allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire.
Still, signatories urged the University to bar fossil fuel companies from funding climate research, to promote climate justice initiatives, and to become more transparent about its development in Allston.
The letter also included demands regarding the management of Harvard’s endowment. It called on the University to accelerate its fossil fuel divestment, reinvest in climate solutions, update its 2050 decarbonization plans, and subject the endowment to democratic oversight.
Some signatories said they hope the letter galvanizes the committee to think seriously about how Harvard’s next president can be a climate leader.
Music professor Alexander Rehding said his “fervent hope” is that the gravity of climate change will push searchers to consider it as a key issue during the process.
“To me, it feels like an absolute no-brainer,” he said. “I realize there are many other interests and other groups that have certain interests. I hope that the urgency of climate change is such that it will sway minds.”
Psychiatry lecturer Jim Recht, another signatory, said the letter has “a tragic quality” because Harvard could have taken more action to tackle climate change years ago.
“If they had made different decisions at that time, they would be recognized as the world leader or a world leader in the fight to mitigate the climate crisis,” he said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that the search committee received the letter, but declined to comment.
The presidential search committee began soliciting affiliate input over the summer. Last month, the committee announced the faculty, staff, and student advisory groups it will consult during the search.
“In the selection of a new president, there is an opportunity to regain some lost ground,” Recht said.

For the 11th consecutive year, Harvard fell short of financial contributions requested by the city of Boston under a program in which nonprofits are asked to voluntarily give the city money in lieu of taxes.
Under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, or PILOT, the city requests voluntary contributions from nonprofit “educational, medical, and cultural” institutions with property in Boston valued at upwards of $15 million. The institutions, which are exempt from paying property taxes as nonprofits, are asked to pay 25 percent of the property taxes they would have paid if not for their nonprofit statuses.
In fiscal year 2022, Harvard contributed a total of almost $10.8 million — 79 percent of the nearly $13.7 million request, according to city data. This fiscal cycle marks the fifth year in a row that Harvard paid 79 percent of the city’s PILOT request.
The 2022 payment includes $6.8 million in “community benefits credit” — programs run by institutions that are considered by the city to “uniquely benefit Boston residents.”
Harvard cites the Arnold Arboretum, Harvard Law School Pro Bono Program, and summer academies hosted on campus for underserved high school students as community benefits. Fifty percent of an institution’s PILOT payments can come in the form of such programming.
Many other large area nonprofits — including Boston University, Tufts University, Boston College, the New England Aquarium, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum — also fell short of the city's fiscal year 2022 PILOT request.
Boston is home to many nonprofits, making much of the city's land tax-exempt. The PILOT program is meant to “offset the burden placed on Boston taxpayers to fund City services for all property owners,” according to the city of Boston's website.
Harvard not paid the full amount requested by the city under PILOT since the program’s inception in 2011.
In a statement, Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa defended Harvard’s contributions to the city.
“As a nonprofit, Harvard’s robust engagement with its host communities, including the City of Boston, takes many forms,” she wrote. “The University reliably makes PILOT payments, pays municipal taxes on all non-exempt property, and works directly with the community through meaningful, and--increasingly more critical--community programs, initiatives and outreach.”
“These local benefits are an important extension of Harvard’s mission, serve thousands of local residents every year, and reflect years of collaboration between the University, its neighbors, and city partners,” she added.
Harvard’s 11th year of payments that fall below the requested amount comes as the University is moving ahead with ambitious development plans in Boston's Allston neighborhood, where the school owns roughly one-third of the land.
In a statement, Boston City Councilor Elizabeth A. “Liz” Breadon, who represents Allston-Brighton, called for reforms to the PILOT payment system.
“As the Boston Institutional Master Planning process for Harvard kicks into gear in the not-too-distant future, City and institutional leaders should review the efficacy of the PILOT program and more clearly define how community benefits are evaluated,” she wrote.
Breadon also called for further cooperation between Harvard and the city.
“I believe that overall, the City of Boston under-leverages the resources of its many nonprofit institutions of higher learning,” she wrote. “I look forward to strengthening partnerships with institutions like Harvard.”

Political journalists Jonathan Martin and Alexander I. “Alex” Burns ’08 discussed the aftermath of the Trump presidency and the 2022 midterm elections at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Thursday.
Martin, a New York Times senior political correspondent, and Burns, an associate editor at Politico, discussed their new book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” which includes reporting on the runup to the 2020 presidential election and the first year of the Biden administration.
The journalists discussed former President Donald Trump’s influence on the Republican Party as he weighs another presidential run in 2024.
“I think we’re certainly not in a post-Trump era, as far as we can tell right now,” Burns said during the event. “But I think there are a lot of reasons to believe that he individually is on the decline politically.”
Martin said GOP voters’ embrace of figures such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is an indication that the party may be ready to “get on to the next thing.” But the future of the GOP is “not going to be a rejection” of Trump’s politics, he said.
“It’ll be more of an extension of it than anything else,” he said.
Martin said Trump “looms over every campaign” in the 2022 midterms, even though he is not on the ballot.
“Traditionally, the reason that the party out of power does well in midterm elections is because they’re able to prosecute a referendum-style campaign on the party that does have power,” Martin said. “That’s been complicated this time around because the shadow of Trump looms so large that it’s not a pure referendum, because voters are still thinking about the last guy in office, who wants to run again.”
Burns and Martin also discussed how Congress has functioned since Trump left office in 2020. When Trump was in the White House, Burns said, many Republican lawmakers were in “survival mode,” trying “to stay one step ahead of the sort of cyber bully who runs their party.”
Now, he said, they have the “breathing room” to work on policy issues more.
The Senate has passed several bipartisan pieces of legislation since Biden took office, including an infrastructure bill in November 2021, gun legislation in June 2022, and an expansion of health benefits for veterans in August 2022.
Martin said Congress has been successful in passing more legislation over the last two years because of a “pent up feeling in the Senate, in both parties, of, ‘Why am I here?’”
“The Senate Republican conference is still reflective of a pre-Trump era,” he said. “You’ve got lawmakers who are plenty conservative, but they’re just not Trumpists. They want to make laws.”
But, Burns said, the policy accomplishments of the last two years are not breaking through to many voters.
“I think that everybody — from the far left to the center-left to the center and the center-right — has had this sense that, ‘If we could just get some stuff done, the American people would reward us for that in one way or another,’” Burns said. “And I think there’s not a whole lot of evidence that that’s likely to happen in this election.”

Each October, Harvard’s Annual Financial Report offers a rare window into the University’s finances and investment strategy. Here’s a closer look at the data revealed by this year’s disclosures.


The fiscal year 2022 endowment losses partially offset the historic gains Harvard enjoyed the year prior, which brought the University’s endowment to a historic high of $53.2 billion at the time. Several of Harvard’s peer institutions also reported investment losses in fiscal year 2022.
At the same time, the University enjoyed a $406 million surplus — its highest in at least 20 years — as revenues rose above pre-pandemic levels following two consecutive years of decline.
The rise was driven in part by rebounds in revenue streams that suffered during the pandemic, such as tuition and room and board. Harvard enrolled more students last year than at any point in school history due to the return of undergraduates who deferred enrollment during the pandemic.
Expenses also rose by 9 percent, an increase that was muted by staff shortages and supply chain challenges that prevented the school from spending more.
The endowment distributed $2.1 billion toward Harvard’s operational expenses in fiscal year 2022, representing 36 percent of the University’s annual revenue. Three Harvard schools — the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Divinity School, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — received the majority of their revenue from endowment distributions.
Harvard’s endowment, now valued at $50.9 billion, is composed of an aggregate of more than 14,000 individual funds, many of which donors have earmarked for a specific purpose. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has more endowed funds than any other Harvard school or department, at $20.4 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard players hoping to play professionally, Saturday afternoon’s matchup against Howard (1-4, 0-0) will mark an opportunity to play in a professional environment. The Crimson (3-1, 2-0) will face the Bison at 4 p.m. at Audi Field in Washington D.C., which hosts Major League Soccer (MLS) side D.C. United and the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL)’s Washington Spirit. It will be the second of Harvard’s three consecutive nationally televised games, as the contest will be aired live on ESPN3. The game is the marquee event of the second annual Truth and Service Classic, a collaboration between Howard and Audi Field and a two-day celebration of community service and sports at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The first edition of the series took place on Sept. 18, 2021, as the Bison lost, 48-32, to Hampton.
“HBCU football is definitely important to everybody. It’s important to the communities that they represent,” said senior defensive back Khalil Dawsey. “It’s definitely something we’ve been looking forward to for a while now, so just being in that atmosphere, being around them and trying to contribute and supplement some of the good things they do.”
In addition to celebrating the long and decorated history of Howard football, which dates back to 1893, Saturday’s matchup will be just the second time the two teams have met on the gridiron. In 2019, the Crimson hosted the Bison at Harvard Stadium and walked out victorious, 62-17. That year, Howard went just 2-10 with an average point differential of -28.3. But head coach Larry Scott’s team has made significant strides since then, as although the Bison sit at just 1-4 this season, their point differential is much better: -2.4. Howard’s improvement continues a nationwide trend of increased quality in HBCU football.
The Bison’s most recent opponent will be a familiar one to Harvard fans: Yale. The Bulldogs are currently tied with the Crimson at 3-1 overall, including 2-0 in the Ivy League. However, Yale struggled mightily against Howard, eking out a 34-26 victory. The Bison defense held quarterback Nolan Grooms – who looked unstoppable at times in last year’s edition of The Game – to just 111 yards passing at a 41.7% completion percentage, one touchdown, and an interception. With a much-improved passing defense, the onus will be on senior quarterback Charlie Dean to get off to a strong start.
“Just getting it going early,” said junior tight end Tyler Neville on the key to dissecting Howard’s secondary. “Just simple stuff early, and then we can take the top off when need be. But hitting everything short early.”
The Harvard offense will have to get off to a better start than it did last Friday against Cornell, when the unit didn’t get into the end zone until the second half. Dean will have to demonstrate a strong connection with his top targets early on, including Neville, who scored his first career touchdown in the 35-28 win over the Big Red, and the Ivy League’s second-leading receiver, senior wideout Kym Wimberly. After pacing the Crimson with 453 receiving yards last year, Wimberly opted to return to Cambridge for his senior season, and has been on a complete tear to start the season, amassing 29 catches, 374 yards, and three scores already. His average of 93.5 yards per game, through four contests, would be the third-best rate in program history, and his 7.25 receptions per game would rank second all-time, behind the legendary Carl Morris ’03’s 9.0 in 2002.
But for the contributions of Wimberly, Neville, and sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch (11 catches for 223 yards so far in 2022), the star of the Harvard offense on Saturday will likely be senior running back Aidan Borguet. Phil Steele’s preseason choice for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year has built on his brilliant 2021 campaign with an even better senior year; through four games, he has amassed 501 yards and six scores on 82 carries. Cornell was unable to stop him on his 28 carries last Friday, bringing him down in the backfield just once, and Howard has a much more porous rushing defense, ranking just 97th in the nation and allowing 197.6 yards per game. On Oct. 1, it allowed Yale to amass 366 yards on the ground on just 40 total carries. The 9.15 yards per carry was the most efficient performance in Bulldogs program history by nearly two yards.
“We’re going to destroy the C-gap,” explained Neville, referring to the gaps outside the offensive tackles. “They have these [defensive ends] who like to slant down. We’re going to take advantage of that. We’re going to run the rock.”
For the Bison to limit Borguet on Saturday, they will need a strong performance from defensive tackle Marcus Brown, whose three forced fumbles in four games rank second in the FCS. The six-foot-five Houston native has broken out this year after seeing minimal playing time in his first two Howard seasons. The Crimson will also have to avoid defensive back Kenny Gallop Jr., who leads the team with 34 tackles overall and forced a fumble against Yale. Meanwhile, sophomore linebacker Terrance Hollon’s two interceptions pace the Bison. Brown, Gallop, and Hollon have been key contributors to a Howard defense that allows just 182.2 yards per game through the air, the 16th stingiest rate in the country.
Just like they take away the pass, the Bison also have a relatively pass-heavy offensive scheme, led by veteran quarterback Quinton Williams. The senior had done a relatively strong job protecting the ball this season before throwing two interceptions against the Bulldogs two weeks ago, recording three games in which he completed at least two-thirds of his passes. He had arguably his best game in the win over Hampton on Sept. 3, completing 21 of his 31 passes for 339 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. Williams also has his fair share of strong targets to throw to: grad student wideout Antoine Murray has 371 yards and three scores in five games, including two in which he hit the century mark. Additionally, junior wide receiver Kasey Hawthorne had his first 100-yard game in the loss to Yale. The aggressive Howard offense is capable of producing big plays, and Harvard fans can expect Williams to take his fair share of deep shots against a Crimson defense that has conceded 269 yards per game through the air – 99th in the country – and produced just one turnover.
“They like to throw downfield, try to hit teams vertical,” Dawsey explained. “We’ve kind of struggled with that, honestly.”
Running back Jarett Hunter will probably not feature much in the Bison’s game plan against Harvard, which boasts the sixth-strongest rushing defense in the country. The Crimson’s defense is led by its talented defensive line, including junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who leads the time in tackles with 26 a season after being a finalist for the Jerry Rice Award, given to the top freshman in the country. The six-foot-three, run-stuffing specialist has also added two sacks this season, aiding a Harvard defense that has taken down the quarterback behind the line 15 times in four games – tied with Yale for the ninth-most prolific rate in the country. After a 4.5-sack performance in the season-opening win over Merrimack that garnered him FCS Defensive Player of the Week honors, senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec ranks seventh nationally. Lining up across from Leskovec, senior defensive lineman and captain Truman Jones notched the second two-sack game of his career in the Oct. 1 loss to Holy Cross. His first came against Howard in 2019, when he recorded 3.5 sacks.
Despite its proficiency against the run, the Harvard defense has struggled mightily through the air, particularly with penalties. Senior cornerback Alex Washington, senior linebacker Jack McGowan, and Dawsey were all flagged for pass interference penalties in the Holy Cross contest, and the defense was hit with a few key whistles in the win over Cornell as well. The Crimson gifted the Big Red a fresh pair of downs on four occasions, including twice on third down, and were flagged 12 times for 125 yards in total. After being one of the most disciplined teams in college football last year, Harvard has been flagged 9.75 times per game this season, which is the third-worst rate in the country. Dawsey, Washington, McGowan, and senior safeties James Herring and Victor Tademy will have to be careful to avoid pass interference penalties against the aggressive Bison, as all five whistles blown against Harvard’s secondary this season have occurred in one-on-one deep shots against physical receivers where the cornerback failed to get his head turned around.
“We just got to stay disciplined there,” Dawsey said. “We’re just a couple of guys trying to make some plays at the end, and at least it wasn’t an effort thing, so it’s something we’ve been focusing in on [in] practice, making sure we’re staying disciplined and not doing too much after the whistle.”
Despite the Crimson’s 3-1 record, this season has been marked by tight games, with four contests that were each winnable by either squad. But the gauntlet will only get tougher, and if Harvard wants to claim its ninth Ivy League title since 2000, it cannot afford such a slim margin for error. When asked what he wants to see from his team in the final non-conference tuneup, Neville was clear:
“I want to put up a lot of points. A lot of points. And we haven’t had a dominating performance yet this season, and that’s what we want to do. We want to come out and dominate.”

“While we were very impressed with your application and qualifications, we regret to inform you that we cannot offer you [insert position here] at this time. We hope you’ll consider applying for this position again in the future and wish you luck in your future endeavors”
Tough.
But I feel you. Getting this email is just annoying.
Because Dear-Everything-That-I’ve-Been-Rejected-From-Ever, I wish you would be honest and just say it: “We didn’t want YOU so too bad” or “Sorry you suck,,, be BETTER” instead of hitting me with more polite euphemisms than a Harvard admin delivering bad news. Because do you?? Do you really wish me luck in my future endeavors? And if you were so impressed with my qualifications, why didn’t you just give me the job?? And listen, I know I’m qualified. I’m SO qualified. In fact, I took LS1a.*
*Note from the editor: the writer in question did not actually take LS1a #explainsalot
So for all of you that have been in these shoes, next time you get hit with one of these emails, 1) don’t give up because, as your mother tells you, you ARE a star, and 2) keep reading for an effective way to respond to your rejection letter. Because maybe they didn’t want you (#rude), but you still deserve the chance to hit them with a spicy reply and mic-drop moment before you make peace with the fact that you will, regretfully, not be part of a Particular College Consulting Group this semester.

Dear Person Reading This Email, 
While I am very not impressed with this copy-pasta email you sent me and the fact that you didn’t want me (because I’m pretty cool), I regret to inform you that I will be pretending that I never got this email. Because I didn’t think it was very nice. And also, as I said, I’m pretty cool. I took LS1a.
It’s too bad for you that you don’t want me to join your org, because now you’ll never know my quirky icebreaker fact that I took three hours to come up with. It’s also too bad for me because I’ll never have the chance to learn exactly what Consulting/Finance/Wine is. But that’s also fine I guess because you just shamed inspired me to remember that nonprofit I started in high school for my college application for the good of society, and now I’m going to be a better person right after my next punch event. 
All this being said, I still don’t like rejection and I’m giving you one more chance to take me back. Otherwise, I will be very sad. For what it’s worth, my mom agrees with me and thinks I deserve this job too. 
Yours in unhappiness,
*Insert name here*
I have no data to back up this claim, but I can guarantee that this email reply will win over at least a few of the cold-hearted people who rejected you. However, I cannot be held responsible for whatever happens to you when you decide to send this email, so, in the rare occurrence of a blocking, roasting, or permanent blacklisting, you’re on your own.
In all seriousness, rejection SUCKS. And getting an impersonal rejection email sucks even more. Just know that as hard as it seems to believe sometimes, there is a club, group, or internship out there that is the right fit for you! Rejection happens to all of us, but remember to keep your head up and not take it too personally — you are a star, and it’s not just your mom telling you that, it’s a Flyby Blog guarantee, too <3
