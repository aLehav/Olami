Y al ver que inútilmente te envío mis palabras 
llorando mi guitarra se deja oír su voz. 
The day his brown eyes meet her brown eyes,
the guitar hustler sings an off-key song of poverty
as passengers swing on and off el micro,
the small green busses of Lima.
His jutting head stock sways with the melody,
serenading eyes that have learned to take no notice.
His brown eyes have learned to take no notice
as vendors shoulder their way through the jungle of limbs,
shouting tamarindo-chicha-choclo,
competing with him for spare change.
The arms, legs, and heads crammed in el micro 
sway as the small green bus swerves around missing manhole covers:
the putrid mist from open sewer lids wrinkles noses.
Amid the overcrowding, the hustlers, the vendors
her brown eyes have learned to take no notice,
so, on the way home from the hospital where she is a secretary,
when the sweet garbage stench washes in and
mixes with the body odor of the guitar hustler
shoving a jingling cup into her chest,
she looks over his black hair as the city lights blur past.
Her forehead glistens with humidity; droplets roll down her spine.
Her hair frizzes like blonde cotton candy.
Compressed in the aisle,
her sweaty knuckles brace her to the back of a seat,
and as the guitar hustler moves on, her stare slips,
and her brown eyes meet his brown eyes.
He’s seen her get on. He’s been waiting to say something,
thinking of the right words as he sings along
She’s the only blonde in a sea of brown,
and in the jumble of legs and sweaty heads and jutting
elbows,
his brown eyes meet her brown eyes.
She responds by pushing her way through the people
to exit el micro,
but there’s something about her worth
following. He shoulders past the tamarindo
vendor,
catches up to her on the street
grasps for her fingertips, and their eyes meet.
The kiosk sells single cigarettes, and she doesn’t even
smoke, but there’s something about him worth smoking
for.
She coughs, cough-coughs.
Her brown eyes meet his brown eyes, and the
question marks exhaled from her lungs
hanging in the air between them
become ellipses,
which he flirts with:
Cansado de llamarte, con mi alma destrozada 
comprendo que no vienes porque no quiere Dios, 
y al ver que inútilmente te envío mis palabras 
llorando mi guitarra se deja oír su voz…

Dance is physical in a way no other art forms, and not many jobs, are. In a world that demands that everything be done virtually, dancing became virtually impossible in the ways that it has existed before. When dancers can’t share space in studios, training is limited to what can be accomplished in living rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms — on unsuitable floors with obstacles in every direction. Without peers, coaches, or the promise of performance, it is easy for a dancer’s motivation to falter.
As dancers’ primary purpose — to perform, to tell stories, to bring joy — has been almost entirely stripped away, we have, alongside the rest of the world, found ways to evolve. Like those of many other industries in the COVID-19 pandemic, some of these adaptations have turned out to be positive developments that we should carry forward. One of the most beneficial shifts has been increased accessibility for students and audience members alike.
The pandemic has afforded us the necessary opportunity to expand how we think about dance training and allowed us to chip away at the industry’s wall of exclusivity. For students of dance, the barrier to entry can be rather steep: from tuition to studio access to shoes — not to mention the often rigid and traditional atmosphere. Streaming classes online, however, has opened up a host of new possibilities and allowed us to reach a wider audience. The pandemic so far has led to the production of dance classes of almost every level and style, with the ability to stream live or on demand, taught by all kinds of world class teachers and professionals.  These classes have created more space for dancers with disabilities, and have often been low cost or free — creating a far more equitable place for learning. Of course, these online classes cannot match the experience of an in-person class with a teacher who can provide individual corrections and other students who support and push you. Nevertheless, they are valuable and valid ways of learning that can help expand and fill in the gaps in the world of dance training.
We should also carry forward the ways in which we have had to rethink performance and how we share dance. Streamed or filmed performances as well as other virtual materials have great value, and should remain in some capacity even when live shows start to trickle back in. In a recent keynote I was fortunate to attend, Randi Zuckerberg argued that theater (and performing arts in general) should be expanding and building an online presence in order to stay successful. Just compare how easily sporting events can be streamed on cell phones to how difficult it is to fly to New York City and pay a steep price to see a Broadway show.  Though live performance is an unparalleled experience, streaming or otherwise expanding the ways in which people can access the performing arts may prove to be essential to the industry’s continued survival. For example, Bolshoi Ballet in Cinema has already demonstrated how dance companies can successfully expand their productions into the digital sphere and reach a broader audience of moviegoers.
Dance has historically been a highly exclusive world, and we still have a long way to go. But in a time when nothing about the world is the same — when powerful demands for social change are being voiced and heard — perhaps this can be the impetus for dance to reevaluate how we share our art, and whom it reaches.
—Sara Komatsu ‘23’s column “Backstage at the Ballet” explores anything and everything ballet-related, from its moments of joy and despair to the broader, systematic issues within it.

If Ryan Murphy has one thing, it’s range. From “American Horror Story” to “Glee,” and from “Pose” to “Scream Queens,” the screenwriter and producer has proven time and time again that he can (and will) write any type of story. This continues to ring true in Murphy’s latest venture, the Netflix original psychological thriller series, “Ratched.”
A spinoff series based on the character Nurse Mildred Ratched (the incomporable Sarah Paulson) from “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” “Ratched” takes place in 1947 and opens with a shocking murder sequence in which a young man, Edmund Tolleson (Finn Wittrock), slays a group of priests in their own home. After the brutal killings, Tolleson is apprehended and transported to Lucia State Hospital, a leading psychiatric hospital known for its unorthodox mental health treatments. Although the series opens with Tolleson’s murders, it ultimately follows Mildred Ratched as she manipulates her way into a nursing job at Lucia State and rises to head nurse.
At the hospital, we meet the callous head nurse Betsy Bucket (Judy Davis); the sex-obsessed, ingenue nurse trainnee Dolly (Alice Englert); and the founder and head doctor of Lucia State, Doctor Richard Hanover (Jon Jon Briones). Along with those who work at the hospital, Ratched meets California's sadistic, chauvinist governor George Willburn (Vincent D’Onofrio) who is up for re-election and his campaign manager Gwendolyn Briggs (Cynthia Nixon). Each of these characters plays a role in Ratched’s life as she juggles her new job, coming to terms with her homosexuality, falling in love with a woman, and hiding a damning secret that both explains and threatens her position at Lucia State.
Fans of Paulson and Murphy know that this pairing isn’t unfamiliar. Paulson has starred in both “American Horror Story” and “American Crime Story“ and the pair’s close working relationship is evident in the seamless fit between writing and performance. No one other than Paulson could have acted this role the way Murphy wrote it.
From sharing heartfelt moments with her lover to convincing a patient at the hospital to end his life, Mildred Ratched is a complex character — the ultimate anti-hero. The combination of Murphy’s masterful writing and Paulson’s precise yet nuanced acting leaves viewers unsure as to whether they should be rooting for Ratched’s success or her demise.
Another remarkable feat of “Ratched” is its visual appeal. For a show that takes place primarily in an asylum, “Ratched” has surprisingly warm visuals — rife with bright, saturated colors akin to those used in more heartfelt, happy shows and reminiscent of the colorful ballroom scenes in “Pose.” Details such as the nurses’ teal-blue uniforms, white fluorescent lights of the hospital, and grandiose shots of the green California coastline create a sense of lightheartedness, as if its creators were trying to make the audience forget that the show is a thriller.
Not even the beautiful colors or Ratched’s stylish 1940s fashion can distract from just how gory “Ratched” is. The horrific murder sequence in which Tolleson kills the group of priests is immediately followed by a shot of the bright blue Pacific Ocean. A scene in which Doctor Hanover performs an icepick lobotomy takes place in a well-lit white room populated by the nurses in their blue uniforms. It is this juxtaposition of bright colors and — quite frankly, gratuitous — violence that makes “Ratched” even more jarring for viewers. At times this contrast works in the favor of the show, making scary scenes more shocking than they otherwise would have been. At others, it is tonally confusing and more distracting than anything else.
The story also does not unfold smoothly. “Ratched” has many intertwining yet distinct subplots, which at times, becomes confusing and overwhelming. While these varying story lines do eventually resolve, getting there is taxing. Many of the supporting characters have their stories told through these subplots, but sadly, most of them do not get the ending they deserve. The likable characters just end up dead and the evil ones evade prosecution.
Another wrinkle in the fabric of the plot is Nurse Ratched’s backstory. The backstory itself is not the issue; in fact, it provides much-needed exposition into the character’s life and why she is as complex as she is. The issue is its timing. By the time viewers finally get a glimpse into Ratched’s dark, twisted past, they are already six episodes into the eight-episode season and are left with more questions (arisen from the many subplots) than the backstory answers.
Despite its pitfalls, “Ratched” has an undeniable charm. Even with the gratuitous violence, confusing subplots, and questionable time management, the episodes of “Ratched” move at a steady, upbeat pace, making its eight installments bingeable. Murphy’s storytelling and Paulson’s acting transport viewers to a surreal 1940s dreamscape (or nightmare-scape, rather), making the show the perfect, sick, twisted, escapist fantasy. Its ending strategically sets the series up for a second season, one that viewers are bound to anticipate after getting caught up in the life of Nurse Mildred Ratched.

Picture ‘60s soul duo Sam & Dave’s “Hold On, I’m Coming” blasting on a record player in a New York City high rise apartment. The record player rests on a side table next to an olive velvet chaise longue and a zebra skin throw rug, while a rotary dial telephone sits on a bright orange desk opposite an upright piano. Homoerotic paintings line the walls. The men are dressed in brightly colored sweaters, ascots at their necks. The 2020 film “The Boys in the Band” transports viewers back in time to 1968. The carefully-crafted sets and costumes conjure a wistful nostalgia for the lost era. In “The Boys in the Band,” seven gay friends throw a boozy birthday party, where a party game reveals the deep anxieties and hardships they have faced on account of their sexualities.
“The Boys in the Band” was originally a play by Mart Crowley that premiered off-Broadway in 1968, just one year before the Stonewall Riots. The play was one of the first sympathetic depictions of gay men in a time when homosexuality was largely rejected as taboo. The show was then brought back on Broadway in 2018 for its 50th anniversary, and the production won the 2019 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.
The same Tony Award-winning cast is also featured in this 2020 film adaptation. In real life, all nine cast members are openly gay men, which is a refreshing departure from the precedent in gay cinema of casting straight actors in gay roles. Perhaps the three most highly regarded gay movies, “Brokeback Mountain,” “Moonlight,” and “Call Me by Your Name,” all feature straight actors. This casting choice is a testament to the progressiveness of the production team and to the great strides that have been made for the LGBTQ+ community since the inception of the story in the sixties.Yet despite the progress made by the gay rights movement in the last 50 years, the tragic stories told in “The Boys in the Band” remain relevant today.
Throughout the movie, the main character Michael (Jim Parsons) refers to the “icks.” “Icks” is the phrase Michael coins to describe the day-to-day struggle of being gay. “Icks. Anxiety. Guilt. From that split second when your eyes pop open.” In many ways, “The Boys in the Band” is about the universality of the “ick” feeling among gay men, as each gay character lives with the everyday “icks” on account of his sexuality. Michael, who was raised Catholic, perceives himself as a sinner; Harold (Zachary Quinto) struggles with growing older in the superficial gay community; Emory (Robin de Jesús) struggles with being femme in the cutthroat hierarchy of gay culture; Hank’s (Tuc Watkins) coming out forces him to leave his wife and two daughters behind; even Donald, (Matt Bomer) who seems the most put together, connects his sexuality with family trauma. In an interview about the film, Matt Bomer, who plays Donald, said of the characters in the story, “They’re not clichés.” The characters in the movie are well-drawn and feel complete, as if they were real people. In fact, Mart Crowley openly admits that he based the characters off of people he knew. The depth of the characters and their raw humanity make the characters relatable, thus making “The Boys in the Band” a success.
Unfortunately, there is one downside to the movie. As with any drawing room play that has been adapted for the screen, the viewer is acutely aware that “The Boys and the Band” was once a play. Although the story remains relevant and the actors do a brilliant job, the movie at times feels corny, simply because the lines were intended for the stage instead of the screen. However, this awkwardness is a small price to pay for the message and drama of the story.
At the end of the movie, Michael laments, “Show me a happy homosexual and I’ll show you a gay corpse. If we [the gay community] could just not hate ourselves so much.” “The Boys in the Band” focuses more on the internalized unhappiness of the gay man than on the external prejudice that was rampant in the Sixties. As a result, the core themes of the movie remain true today. Today, being gay is still an “icky” experience for many gay men on an individual level — an experience that many still internalize, despite the social progress that has been made.
“The Boys in the Band” is a must see.
