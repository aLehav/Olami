Keep your friends close, as the old adage goes—and in “Everybody Knows,” which opened the Cannes Film Festival in competition, keep your former lovers closer. In “Everybody Knows” (“Todos lo Saben”), Penélope Cruz plays Laura, a mother who brings her two children to her hometown in Spain to attend her sister’s wedding. Once there, they reunite with Laura’s extended family, which includes Paco (Javier Bardem), a family friend who owns a local vineyard. Her adolescent teenage daughter, Irene (Carla Campra), quickly shacks up with Paco’s mischievous nephew, who scandalously informs her that her mother and Paco are old flames. Although “Everybody Knows” begins as an idyllic picture of family life in a Spanish village, it quickly spirals into psychological thriller territory when a family member is kidnapped from their bed during the wedding, and Laura begins to receive ominous threats via text from unknown numbers. With Paco’s help, Laura must scramble to scrape together $300,000 in ransom or risk the death of a family member—and despite both of their seemingly successful marriages, Laura and Paco’s complicated, secretive past returns to haunt both of them yet.
Director Asghar Farhadi strikes a chord with the intense, Spanish-language family drama, capitalizing on the versatility and chemistry between Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz, a real life husband-wife duo. Yet the family drama occasionally veers toward maudlin melodrama, Cruz’s hysterics a smidge too performative, the whole trauma slightly too choreographed. It’s a gripping story, to be sure, but one rooted in thriller tropes rather than fresh material. The substance is there, but it’s slightly tired, especially for Farhadi, whose filmography includes  “The Salesman” and “A Separation”—both Oscar winners with unique perspectives and previously untold stories. The title of “Everybody Knows” is unwittingly self-referential: Though plot twists are surprising in their particular minutiae, “everybody knows” roughly how the film will play out, even a mere 20 or 30 minutes in.
Major plot points of “Everybody Knows” that feel like they ought to be carefully revealed are predictable from the outset. Namely, it’s clear that Cruz’s Laura and Bardem’s Paco are meant for each other, and that is by no means a spoiler—even the trailer makes sure to linger on their long gazes and physical contact. Paco cares and Laura depends on his support too much for their relationship to stay platonic, particularly amid conflict with their respective spouses. Laura’s husband Alejandro (Ricardo Darín) is absent for much of the film, stuck in their Argentina home “for a work engagement.” Meanwhile, tension builds between Paco and his wife, Bea (Bárbara Lennie), whose mounting distrust and lingering resentment toward her husband’s ex manifest first in passive aggression, then outright confrontation. (Much of the melodrama stems from these interactions, which evoke a forced and seemingly exaggerated kind of anger from each character.) All of this is to say that the “conflicted loyalty” that Laura has between Paco and her husband seems like a lost cause.
Yet for all its predictability, the loose ends that should be tied by the ending of “Everybody Knows” still linger in ambiguity. Cinematically, the suspense is delicious—Farhadi’s camera lingers on telling evidence or artistically rendered symbols, including the mud caked on someone’s shoes, the slice of scissors against damning newspaper clippings, and the ominous, foretelling clanging of a church bell. But the substance of the film’s plot is missing. When the culprits behind the kidnapping are unmasked, their identities are surprising, but their motivations still unclear—Farhadi delivers the melodramatic suspense of the build-up, but misses the satisfaction of the revelation, all the anticipation of the thriller without the pay-off. By the film’s end, everybody knows what’s happened, and who did what. The remaining question is why.

The Cannes Directors’ Fortnight celebrated its 50th anniversary with a bang—or rather, a bird call—in its opening, Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra’s “Birds of Passage” (“Pájaros de Verano”). The crime thriller chronicles the rise and fall of an indigenous family of the Wayuu people in the ’70s, when “gringos” bring the marijuana industry to Columbia. Zaida (Natalia Reyes) has just become a woman of marriageable age, and Rapayet (José Acosta) sets his eyes on her despite his low status within the group. There’s no way he’ll get the money to provide the required dowry for her—50 goats, 20 cows, and five necklaces made of valuable stone—nor will he gain matriarch Zaida’s mother Ursula’s (Carmiña Martínez) approval without great difficulty. But Rapayet’s uncle Peregrino (José Vicente) is the revered, highly respected word messenger, and he vouches for Rapayet, provided the ambitious young man can issue the dowry. Once Rapayet gets into selling marijuana to Americans, there’s no stopping him from getting what he wants—from Zaida to more money than he could have ever dreamed of. But several foils—Rapayet’s best friend and business partner Moises (Jhon Narvaez), Ursula, and Rapayet’s brother-in-law Leonidas (Gredier Meza)—threaten not only his family, but peace across the families of the Wayuu. In “Birds of Passage,” Guerra and Gallego create a Shakespearean play set in ’70s, indigenous Columbia with expert pacing, understated but effective acting, and an eye for exquisite cinematography.
The film is not Guerra’s first—his previous film “Embrace of the Serpent” (which Gallego produced) won the Arthouse Cinema Award at the 2015 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight, was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards—but “Birds of Passage” marks Gallego’s first turn behind the camera, and the collaboration does not disappoint. The married couple uses the Guajira desert as an ethereal backdrop, shooting landscapes that are nearly overwhelming in their immensity. The scenery jumps back and forth between arid emptiness and lush green fields, ripe with marijuana crops, a juxtaposition that mirrors the rivalry between Ursula and Rapayet as the family’s leaders. Whereas Rapayet embodies the future, a break from a more classic way of life for the indigenous Columbians—his calculating dark side eventually positions him as the marijuana kingpin of the Wayuu people—Ursula represents the traditional: She guards the family talisman, interprets her daughter’s dreams of foreboding danger, and clashes with Rapayet’s own idea of what it means to protect the family. And yet, both are two sides of the same coin; despite their differences, their common goal of rising up the ranks while staying true to the Wayuu legacy they try to pass onto Zaida and Rapayet’s kids is a conflict the film hints will end in blood.
And it does end in bloodshed, which begins with Rapayet’s transformation once Moises betrays him. The result is a cast of characters whose nearly blank facial expressions throughout resonate more than the reverberating cricketing of the insects plaguing the desert. Acosta and Martínez both barely emote in their respective roles, chilling the audience with a single glare that speaks to the power they hold. The actors speak more with their eyes than anything else, the screenplay not doing justice to the affectation of cold control they both embody. Indeed, at the beginning of the film, a character says “If there’s family, there’s respect. If there’s respect, there’s honor. If there’s honor, there’s word.” But as the characters gradually lose each, Gallego and Guerra rely on what little but effective physicality their actors use. Their performances aren’t grand in the traditional sense, but in a family where tradition rules, there’s little need for it in the acting.
Where the acting is brilliantly muted, the pacing of the film, which is told in five “songs,” is similarly a slow burn, with bits of violence—both explicitly portrayed and subtly suggested—interspersed throughout. The film succeeds thanks to Guerra and Gallego’s wise inversion: They gradually depict less and less violence to build up the tension until the very end, lulling the audience into a false sense of security before surprising with a bang that rings louder in the dead of the desert than the shootout at the end of “Scarface.” It’s the play on the sounds of nature with gunshots that paradoxically lingers in “Birds of Passage,” a simultaneously vivid and restrained thriller of a film that provides a snapshot into the lives of a people whose home and work lives inextricably intersect to devastating results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cannes reporters Mila Gauvin II and Caroline A. Tsai offer a daily blog round-up from the 71st annual Cannes Film Festival in France. 
If you asked me what I thought I’d be doing on the first day of Cannes, my answer would have been sipping rosé with Timothée Chalamet on the Croisette and collecting designer-business cards from the Hollywood nouveau riche by the stack, on the prowl for last-minute summer internships. Or maybe I would be glamming up for a glitzy after-party and tottering around in Louboutins, or exchanging numbers with Cate Blanchett and double-cheek-kissing George Clooney. Bises, à la Française! (In all of these visions I’m, like, 20 pounds lighter, super outgoing, and really enjoy piloxing and “superfoods.”)
Instead, I ended up sobbing in a stranger’s bathtub at 10 p.m., hypoglycemic.
Record scratch. Freeze frame. So you’re probably wondering how I got here.
Upon our arrival in the Nice airport at 5:30 p.m., we watched the same four Louis Vuitton suitcases circle Baggage Claim Six until I was willing to admit that my checked bag was probably somehow lost during our transit from London Heathrow to Nice, tragically in checked-bag limbo. Most likely floating aimlessly in the English Channel. Despite what the city of Nice might suggest, this revelation was not, in fact, nice. A gate agent informed us through gritted teeth that we had two options: We could either leave on our free journalists’ shuttle to Cannes, catch the premiere of the opening movie (Farhadi’s “Everybody Knows”), and chance a morning luggage delivery from the airport (which, in all likelihood, would be a total flop (!) since it was le festival and everyone and their cat was waiting for a “missing” luggage. Everyone and their glamorous, purebred cats with their cat-sized Louis Vuitton suitcases). Or we could wait until 8 p.m. for the missing luggage to be delivered on the next flight from London, then hop on the train (which cost no more than five euros, tops) to Cannes around 8:30.
After vividly imagining myself turning up to a red carpet premiere in the clothes in my carry-on (a Harry Styles: Live on Tour T-shirt and sweatpants with HARVARD on the butt), I decide that Mila and I will wait for the luggage, with the full knowledge that we are missing the red carpet premiere of “Everybody Knows.” Sorry Penelope Cruz! Finally, the moment of truth arrives, and after several harrowing moments of cop-outs, the One True Luggage with the rainbow band appears on the conveyor belt, like manna from heaven, on Baggage Claim Six. Miracle of miracles!
With all three hefty luggages in tow, Mila and I finally escape the Sixth Circle of Hell and, after a few directions from a well-meaning gate agent, emerge cheerfully into the Seventh: a convoluted schema of cartoonishly crooked sign-posts toward the Gare St. Augustin. Meanwhile, it’s getting dark, and Google Maps says we’re, like, thiiiiiiiiis close to the station—just cross the highway with perpetually oncoming traffic!
In a death-defying game of Human Frogger, Mila and I cross the highway, fat American Samsonites in tow, all the while continually screaming. Drivers give us the stink eye, as if they’re somehow above sprinting in front of moving vehicles. At last, I can see the pink SNCF about 100 feet ahead, when behind me, Mila calls my name.
A passerby has alerted her that the SNCF workers are all on strike, and there will not be another train to Cannes until 5 a.m. the next morning.
At this point, I’m partially ready to run back to the highway and throw myself into moving traffic, but Mila takes charge and recommends that we call an Uber. It’s 55 euros, but it’s also getting dark and Cannes is miles away, so we board a Peugeot and get whisked off to Cannes, where the romantic Riviera adventure can finally start, in all its rosé-drinking, Chalamet-schmoozing glory. Right?
Wrong. When we get dropped off at the hotel where our Airbnb host works, all the ushers begin stacking our luggage on a bellhop cart and welcoming us to the festival. Context: This hotel is the kind of hotel where paparazzi stake out outside to catch actresses getting into their Mercedes, flanked on either side by security detail. Every visible surface is made of marble. They’re treating us like we’re undercover celebs sporting college gear and sneakers to blend in with the proletariat. When we inform them it’s not a costume, they look confused, alarmed. Who are we, and what are we doing here?
Tension mounts. We’re sitting on furniture that costs more than our tuition. The staff keep nervously glancing at us, as if every time they look away, we might have dematerialized into thin air. But every time they check—damn it—they’re dismayed to find that we are still there.
Finally, the host appears. She looks nervous. Did the staff see us come in with our bags? They did? Oh, god. Keep calm and follow me out of here.
Wondering whether we have accidentally signed up to be accomplices in a heist of some kind, we wordlessly follow her out of the lobby. She turns to face us and holds a key. In very rapid, very confusing French, she instructs us that we must cross a street, then stay to the left. To the left there is a seafood restaurant and an aesthetic shop (“An aesthetic?” Mila repeats in French. “Like... for skin? For nails?” “Aesthetic,” she replies cryptically, as though we should know this already). Keep going. Keep going. And you will see it: the building. Go to the first floor. It’s the apartment that’s right there. On the right. Does that make sense? Do we understand?
Mila and I nod reluctantly, and the host hands us the key. “How should we work out payment?” she asks.
Uhh, what? Money already left our bank accounts, lady. We’ve already paid in full.
Oh. She seems surprised, but shrugs, and says she’ll see us at home later, maybe around three.
(The website lists the property as an “entire home,” which Mila and I had assumed to mean not a see-you-at-three, cohabiting situation. Her unexpected presence is shock #2.)
Already there are some red flags, but it’s approaching midnight, so Mila and I trudge down the street with our luggage again. Leggy blonde girls in rompers keep passing us, their badges bouncing around like gold medals. Meanwhile I’m sweating again and Mila and I keep exchanging hopeless glances, like, This is it? This is Cannes? Already, it feels like we were misled. I want to file a complaint with the universe: Excuse me, god? I was told there would be Chalamet.
We get to the apartment building (after a brief, strange encounter with some badgeholders who hand us their poorly-designed business cards too eagerly), squeeze into a rickety elevator from the ’70s, and arrive at the first floor expecting to see “the apartment that’s right there, on the right.”
To our right, there are three separate doors. Each door has at least three keyholes. Is this some kind of logic puzzle, some socio-litmus test? We try to wiggle the key into each keyhole, to no avail. We try the apartments on the left. After we try one, we hear the lock click from the inside. Someone thinks we’re intruding.
We call the host several times with the last dregs of our dwindling phone batteries. She does not pick up for five minutes. Finally, on the fourth call, she picks up. Hello? Did you misunderstand my basic instructions? It’s the apartment on the right. On the right!
Mila approaches the door and jams the key into the slot. The door swings open. We hang up, somewhat embarrassed.
The room we discover inside is musty and in disarray. There’s a bed made in the corner, which slightly resembles the pictures on the Airbnb listing, but seems lumpy and uninviting. There’s a weird smell, which I can only describe as hairspray and death. The lighting is ominously dim, and we fumble around for light switches. We turn on the kitchen lights. Dirty dishes crowd the sink. The rest of the room is still bathed in relative darkness.
I notice a lamp in the corner and fumble for a switch. Out of my peripheral vision, I notice there’s another room where the host must be sleeping tonight. Behind me, Mila turns on her phone flashlight to help me find the switch.
And that’s when I see it.
In the bed, I can make out the shape of disembodied pair of legs.
“Oh my god,” I say, barely breathing. “There’s a person in here.” I chance another glance at the darkened room and notice that there are, in fact, two sets of legs. Multiple bodies on beds, unmoving. Actual human corpses? Sex dolls? What the fuck is going on here?
I turn back toward Mila, and can see the visible flit of panic through her eyes. More rapidly than I have ever seen any human being move, Mila collects all of the miscellaneous belongings we have carelessly set down, amassing them into a pile.
In the bathroom, I plug in my phone charger. Mila frantically Googles hotels with vacancies. This is when the events of the past 48 hours, from the lost luggage to the highway running to the sex dolls, compounded by intense and unparalleled sleep deprivation and hunger, finally sink in. I consider myself a pretty emotionally stable person, but if there’s anything that I could justify as a reasonable stimuli for distress, it’s the sight of two sets of disembodied humanoid legs. So I do what any rational person does when they are quarantined in a stranger’s bathroom in Cannes: I start sobbing.
Luckily, Mila is level-headed enough to calm me down. We start telephoning relatively cheap hotels. They’re all completely booked, or they have one suite left, which costs 1000 euros per night. Another costs 800. Affordable! So affordable! A bargain! A real steal!
Finally—blessedly—a hotel seven minutes away says they have a vacancy for two adults. It’s 400 euros a night, but at this rate, we have already been in an apartment that feels vaguely like the set of “The Exorcist” for too long. We book the room. We hightail it out of there and leave the key under the mat.
Once in the hotel room, we decompress. I cry a little more, residually, out of sheer relief. We both call our parents. We book a new hotel room for the rest of the stay, which is cheaper than 400 euros per night, but not by much. But after the harrowing ordeal we have endured today, we are willing to bite the bullet and drop some cash.
So in short, Mila and I have been in Cannes for approximately 10 hours, and we have not seen a single movie, much less met any celebrities. But at least, we are happy to inform you that we are no longer cohabitating with sex dolls, which has set the new bar for the quality of my travel. If there is no sex doll encounter, I will have had a really solid vacation.
Tune in tomorrow for the next installment of Cannes Par Jour! Bizarrely, and I never thought I would say this, but hopefully, it will be completely devoid of sex dolls. (We make no promises.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 1960 in Montana. Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Jeanette Brinson (Carey Mulligan) lead a stiflingly normal life in American suburbia. They’re both infuriatingly self-centered: Jerry behaves like a petulant child, while Jeanette overcompensates for his immaturity by doggedly trying to reinvent herself, first as a YMCA swim instructor, then as the mistress of Warren Miller (Bill Camp), a recently-divorced car salesman whose visible leering is enough to make anyone squirm. Jerry and Jeanette’s toxic bickering comes at the expense of their terrified teenage son, Joe (Ed Oxenbould), who spends the majority of film heavily breathing or sprinting away on the verge of an anxiety attack.
After Jerry abandons his family to fight forest fires raging in the mountain ranges of Montana, Jeanette pulls Joe along on her adventures, each a more traumatizing ordeal than the last—and one begins to wonder how far the Brinsons’ turmoil can go before it catches flame and destroys everything in its wake. The opening film in the Critics’ Week at Cannes, Paul Dano’s directorial debut elegantly and powerfully portrays a nuclear family unit in all its complexity, imbuing each character with nuance. “Wildlife” situates itself at the intersection of suburbia and fears of conformity, the peak of American Dream disillusionment and loss of faith. It is an intimate look at what happens when dreams fail and conventions collapse.
Co-written by Dano and Zoe Kazan and based on the 1990 novel by Richard Ford of the same name, “Wildlife” features dialogue that feels proverbial, the kind of timeless language that would not feel out of place in a classic literary work, yet still feels accessible and relevant enough to mean something. “I feel like I need to wake up,” says Jeanette in one scene, “but I don’t know what from, or to.” In another film, her confession could be mawkish, or pretentious, but in “Wildlife,” it is neither, becoming a tender moment of vulnerability from mother to son.
It helps, too, that Dano and Kazan’s lines are uttered beautifully in the hands of the right actors. Carey Mulligan delivers a forceful performance as Jeannette, adeptly crafting a rounded picture of a woman who refuses to allow her failing marriage to stunt her personal growth as she resiliently bounces from job to job, her cheerful smile slicked on her face like a robotic mask; as she enumerates her various qualifications (she can type! answer calls! take notes!), even in the face of rejection after rejection. But Mulligan’s depth of performance is put to the test as Jeannette becomes more and more unstable, seeking different—and unhealthier—outlets for self-fulfillment. Jeannette is a blatantly bad mother, but a fascinating character sketch in the era of Feminine Mystique—a little bit Daisy Buchanan, a little bit April Wheeler, in her last-ditch attempts to become a fully self-actualized person after years of withering in ’50s housewife boredom.
Mulligan and Gyllenhaal play off of each other brilliantly, knowing when to aggress and when to seethe quietly. Gyllenhaal, who has limited screen-time, also commands attention when his character gets it. His masterful control of expression and volume shape a fragile picture of masculinity. And the storm of familial chaos that they create leaves Joe in its wake, whose sense of filial duty and intense inner agitation is played adroitly by a perennially uncomfortable Ed Oxenbould.
Everything about “Wildlife” ought to be unoriginal—after all, it’s a classic tableau of suburban discontent, “Death of a Salesman” meets Betty Friedan meets “Revolutionary Road”—and yet, it is remarkably fresh. Kazan and Dano’s script, as well as Dano’s keen eye for personal trauma, hones in on what makes these people human, even in their least human moments. The tragedy is in both parents’ unyielding subscription to the American Dream, no matter how many times it disappoints them—and in the ensuing role reversal, in which Joe takes on adult responsibilities to compensate for their parental neglect. “I’m too well-liked. They don’t want small people like us to get ahead,” Jerry tells Joe after he is fired from his job, almost directly echoing lines from Arthur Miller’s seminal play. And later, Jeanette tells Joe, “Some people will float to the top. It’s a happy ending for the right people.”
Who, exactly, are “the right people”? Certainly not the Brinsons, for whom life implodes again and again, an ongoing destruction that each deals with in their own, ill-advised way. It’s not enough to run away, like Jerry, or to try to find oneself, like Jeannette, or try to hold it all together, like Joe. The only thing left is to let nature run its course.

It’s the peak of the ’80s rock and roll era in Leningrad, Russia, and Viktor Tsoi (Teo Yoo) is looking for his big break. He finds it with the help of well-established rock connoisseur and band leader, Mike (Roman Bilyk), who helps him finetune his sound and hone his stubborn artistic inclinations. In the meantime, Natacha (Irina Starshenbaum), Mike’s wife and mother of his child, grows attracted to Viktor, his alternatively laidback and snippy attitude gradually seducing her away from her husband. Though Natacha likes Viktor’s “slacker” image, it unfortunately doesn’t sit well for those with the connections he needs to launch his star, but his talent is undeniable and warrants a platform that Mike is willing to help him earn. After all, as Mike asks, “a blue collar boy also has the right to a voice, doesn’t he?”
The answer? A resounding yes in Kirill Serebrennikov’s latest feature film, “Summer,” (“Leto”) which chronicles the rise to fame of real life rockstar, Viktor Tsoi, from under the wings of his pseudo-mentor, Mike Naumenko, of the Soviet rock group Zoopark. Serebrennikov is no stranger to being a revolutionary—he’s been on house arrest since August 2017 on embezzlement charges—and it shows in his psychedelic dream of a film. In part over-stylized mini-rock musical, and in others, cinematic manifestation of the music at the heart of the movie, “Summer” toes the line between genuine and overambitious.
Someone famous once said good artists copy, great artists steal, and—for Serebrennikov’s sake—some artists borrow from the discography of legends, as “Summer” does. The soundtrack to the movie is a collage of classic ’80s rock songs, from the Velvet Underground and Blondie to Tsoi and Naumenko’s songs themselves, an homage to the rock and roll canon: The music brings to life a decades-old time period with just the insistent strum of a guitar, the subtle beat of a bass, the nonchalant tone of a singer’s voice. Serebrennikov uses the music that defined an entire generation to define “Summer,” adding a rhapsodic texture to the film that permeates it with a certain livelihood. At times, that vivacity reaches a breaking point, reaching a state so grandiose the pseudo-biopic unexpectedly phoenixes into a not unwelcome musical. The film takes on a new dimension especially when its musical palette seeps onto the screen, at times literally coloring in the black and white scenery. For example, as Mike stands in the pouring rain outside a phone booth, a stranger slams the phone down after the machine eats her change away twice. As they trudge along, soaked to the bone, the woman starts to sing, her dress cartooned a squiggly red. Against the backdrop of a film shot largely in black and white, the color is a stark break away from the character’s desolation, a necessary refuge from a scenery that eventually becomes uncompromising in its grayness.
That’s not to say the black and white hue consistently detracts from the film. On the contrary, the monochrome point of view the audience takes on imbues the film with a nostalgia evocative of the singers’ spirit. And that’s why the few splashes of color the director sporadically sprinkles throughout the film are so potent: They appear in the shaky camera presumably held by one of the artists’ friends, the point of view of a true member of the world Serebrennikov brings back to life, and not a passive witness in the audience.
Serebrennikov does make sure, in an absurd, nearly self-deprecating way, to actively engage the audience in moments of nonsense. When some of the band members break into song on a train, several guards beat them into submission. “Warning: high voltage,” reads a sign one member holds, “this did not happen.” The same phenomenon occurs later on, when one musician shoots another in the chest, killing him before the latter rises up to continue giving his artistic input on a song. The game drags on too long, however, when at a concert the crowd—which had previously always been sitting still, subdued in their seats—rises up to jam along to the shrill of the band’s electric guitar. The reality is much more disappointing, the trick cheapening into a false alarm meant to awaken an audience from the lull of the narrative.
Indeed, all too soon, the snippets we get of Viktor’s burgeoning career seem to loop endlessly in what prolongs the viewing experience for what feels like hours. The film becomes stylistically oversaturated, suffused with one too many elements it tries and barely manages to juggle: a love triangle, a neverending soundtrack, a black and white and occasionally colored shade, and a moody ambiance the film inevitably takes. The screenplay’s lyricism—”Without a flowering twig, who needs a garden?” asks Mike in a question that in retrospect reads as flowery as its content—is the nail in the coffin, stylistically oversaturating what ends up becoming an overambitious attempt at immortalizing, this time cinematically as opposed to just musically, two leaders of the rock and roll movement in Russia. Though individually, the film’s constituents promise a beautifully composed film about two men, a woman, and the music at the center of it all, together they overwhelm in a summer that never ends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The arrest of an undergraduate student on April 13 has generated many important questions and surfaced deep feelings of concern among University affiliates. Last week, University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of a committee that will “seek to gain an understanding of how the College, HUHS, and HUPD responded to (and were able to respond to) events such as those that occurred in this instance.” As the committee undertakes its review, I write to share with you the core values that guide the work of the Harvard University Police Department and how we approach maintaining safety and security on campus.
Since I began serving as Chief in 1996, the HUPD has worked tirelessly to transform and maintain a professional and progressive atmosphere within the Department, to ensure that we are in the best position to effectively serve Harvard’s vibrant and diverse educational and research community. As part of our departmental mission and philosophy, we at HUPD are committed to providing a safe, secure, and welcoming environment for everyone. To fulfill this mission, the Department has actively engaged in a community-oriented problem-solving philosophy. This philosophy requires members of the HUPD to establish partnerships with all segments of the community. These partnerships are the foundation of effective problem solving and crime prevention.
The HUPD's relationship with the community is vital to achieving our mission. I have made earning this community’s trust and respect a priority in my time here at Harvard. Over the past two decades, we have worked with diverse groups of students (both undergraduate and graduate), faculty, and staff, as well as nationally recognized experts, toward this effort. As an example, in 2015, HUPD became the second university police department in the country to cycle all of its officers through procedural justice training, which emphasizes fairness and transparency. We also regularly conduct reviews of our community engagement and outreach efforts with the help of recognized experts in public safety organizational performance.
As the head of the Harvard University Police Department, I have set high expectations for my officers and myself, and it is my hope that every interaction that students, faculty, and staff have with a member of the force is a positive one. Has the HUPD ever fallen short of meeting its own expectations? Yes. I wish it were otherwise, but I am proud of the fact that those moments have been exceedingly rare and that the HUPD has used them—and the criticism they have generated—as opportunities to improve. I realize that as a Department, “we are only as good as our last interaction.”
I speak for the entire department when I say that we are honored to be members of the Harvard community. It is deeply satisfying to work with people within an institution whose core belief is in the promise of bringing individuals from vastly different backgrounds together to seek understanding, to ask and answer questions, and to foster mutual respect. Our purpose is to maintain a safe and secure environment within and towards these goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Psychiatrist and former Harvard Medical School associate professor Lester Grinspoon has contributed to the psychiatric field for over 45 years. He has conducted substantial amounts of pioneering research on schizophrenia and how to treat it, published dozens of papers and books, and held leadership positions at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center for years. Still, Grinspoon is best known for his research into marijuana. Although controversial when published in the 1970s, his contribution to the understanding of cannabis has been crucial to the modern marijuana legalization movement.
Yet his research has not always been looked upon fondly. Grinspoon says he was snubbed for a promotion from associate professor to full professor at the Medical School twice—in 1975 and again in 1997. It was never explicitly explained why he was denied the position, though his colleagues and supporters have pointed to his marijuana research as the reason for his rejection. Grinspoon recalls one dean calling it “too controversial” in a 1975 conversation. Nevertheless, Grinspoon retired in 2000, continuing to publish new research in this field as recently as 2014.
Recently, his allies sparked a campaign against these perceived wrongs, calling for the medical school to grant him an emeritus professorship for his contributions. Although a spokesperson for the Medical School bluntly stated that Harvard doesn’t offer professorships retroactively, the campaign cites biases at Harvard “during the dark decades of the war against marijuana” as the reason Grinspoon was not made a full professor and as the justification for awarding him this title now.
Given the circumstances surrounding his promotion, we believe these biases may well have had a significant effect on Grinspoon’s attempt to become a full professor. While we do not necessarily support action concerning whether or not Grinspoon should be awarded an emeritus professorship at this time, we do believe that Grinspoon’s contributions to the fields of psychiatry and marijuana research should not simply go up in smoke. We urge the University to review its promotion procedures and to consider whether a title change is appropriate given the likelihood that cultural prejudice may have played a role during his professorship considerations.
The immense good Grinspoon’s novel research has done for not only his discipline but for societal issues and law reform is difficult to dismiss and warrants recognition. It has been used to fight for the decriminalization of marijuana possession, which has disproportionately affected communities of color. Grinspoon’s research has also been indispensable in the budding legalization of marijuana in nine states, including Massachusetts.
The historical stigma associated with marijuana is yet another example of the academic consensus on a topic changing over time. Unfortunately, when it is incorrect or based on biases, this consensus has the ability to impede the scientific community from recognizing empirical, scientific research like Grinspoon’s. The only way to rectify these cultural influences on research is to openly acknowledge past mistakes and to update our understanding of what is and isn’t of scientific value.
In the future, we hope that researchers and members of the Harvard community make every effort to recognize novel contributions irrespective of societal trends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am a junior in the Chemistry department and a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate organization dedicated to combating sexual violence on campus. I have also been campaigning for our union among eligible undergraduate voters and in the Chemistry department.
I decided to support and organize for the union in the aftermath of the revelation of sexual harassment allegations against Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez. I have witnessed and experienced sexual harassment and assault in my time at Harvard and within the Chemistry department, where I have done research for the past two years.
In my own experience and those of others who have spoken to me, the University has repeatedly demonstrated its inadequacy in preventing sexual violence and supporting survivors. After my sexual assault, I went to OSAPR, a University-wide resource for crisis counseling, for an intake appointment, and was told that I would receive an email in a week about assigning me to a counselor and scheduling future meetings. I never heard back. Even this most basic support was denied to me.
Later, in conversations with undergraduate and graduate students, I learned that my experience was far from unique. Existing University structures have repeatedly failed our students. The University has repeatedly shown that it cares more about maintaining its prestige and reputation than the wellbeing of its members. The Dominguez case is horrifying and disgusting, but tragically not surprising to anyone.
As one progresses in academia, the power dynamics only become more imbalanced, along with the gender ratio. Fear of retaliation and reciprocity prohibits graduate students from speaking out about experiences of sexual harassment, academic bullying, and mental health issues. Their entire academic careers are dependent upon their departments and advisors. In deciding whether or not I wanted to go to graduate school, I made myself answer the question: Would I stay in graduate school and academia if it meant I was going to be sexually harassed and possibly raped (again)? And ultimately I answered yes, partly because I want a future in which no one else has to answer this question. I want to help build that future in the academic field that I love.
Students opposed to the union have valid concerns about the process going forward, mostly regarding the specificities of a contract governing vastly different departments. I, too, had concerns, but ultimately I saw that the benefits of the union outweighed the potential disadvantages. What unites us is more powerful than what divides us. I can only encourage students with such worries to get more involved with the bargaining process. Make your voices heard. Represent your interests. This is how democracy works.
Some may argue that they do not want to expend their energy campaigning for issues when the status quo is satisfactory, that these union politics are distracting from their learning or research. Well, I too would love to focus on my learning and research, without having to worry about sexual harassment and discrimination. Unfortunately, I do not have that privilege. The issue of sexual violence, and many other issues our union addresses, is one that severely affects and distracts many members of this institution.
This election can be seen as a referendum on sexual violence at Harvard. The Crimson exit polling data shows that students who voted for unionization were more than twice as likely to disapprove of the University’s handling of sexual misconduct. Existing University structures routinely prove unreliable and inadequate. We must take this responsibility into our own hands. Our union will give us a platform to take action rather than suffer in silence.
Our union is made up of our students. We have the power to shape it, and to address the issues we care about. I am excited to participate in the newly-formed Time’s Up Committee within Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers dedicated to addressing issues of sexual harassment and discrimination across Harvard. We will work to ensure that our first contract includes substantive protections and accommodations for survivors and a serious commitment from the administration to address this crisis, whether in the form of regular campus climate surveys or expanded Title IX trainings. Structural problems need structural solutions, and our union gives us a new way to demand safety and justice—crucially, a venue that will not be controlled by Harvard but by us.
Silence and inaction not only get us nowhere, but protect and thereby encourage perpetrators and the culture that produces them. Any reluctance to improve current structures is an act of neglect of the crisis of sexual violence on campus. I am thrilled that the university has agreed to bargain with students, to hear our voices and respect our rights. I encourage all who care about issues of sexual misconduct on campus to get involved so we can shape a better Harvard together.
Kay T. Xia is a junior in Adams House studying Chemistry and Visual and Environmental Studies. She is a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better and an organizer with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 10, 2018 at 5:26 p.m.
Harvard could deny recognition—and exemption from the College’s sanctions—to student social groups whose graduate boards it determines exert too much sway over the organizations, according to a new plan released Thursday and an interview with administrators Wednesday.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced the six-page plan in an email sent to students Thursday. The document outlines the system the College will use to determine which social organizations receive recognition and thus freedom from Harvard’s social group penalties.
Specifically, the plan details three new tiers of recognition—each with different responsibilities and privileges—that the Office of Student Life can confer on student groups. The document also announces administrators’ plan to form a new “leadership council” comprising students who head recognized social groups.
This all-volunteer council will “support and inform” the development of other social organizations, according to the plan. Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller said in the interview the council may help determine which of the three tiers social groups vying for recognition ultimately achieve.
The College’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The policy released Thursday mandates “local governance and autonomy” as a requirement for College recognition; and Miller said in the interview Wednesday that the College will specifically review the role of graduate boards. This scrutiny could pose a hurdle for some of Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs, should they seek recognition—The Crimson reported in 2015 that some clubs’ graduate boards play an active role in determining the groups’ policies and membership.
Groups in all three tiers will have to submit gender breakdowns of their membership to the College in order to gain recognition, per the document announcing the plan.
Social organizations will not have to release names of members nor any other identifying demographic information, according to the document. The Crimson previously reported Harvard was considering requiring gender demographics as a condition for recognition.
In the months following the official debut of the sanctions in May 2016, several formerly single-gender social organizations adopted gender-inclusive membership policies. To date, at least seven have done so, including the Fleur-de-Lis, the KS, the Aleph, the Oak Club, the Sab, the Seneca, and the Spee Club.
The final recognition plan breaks once and for all with some social group members’ belief that, in order to be free from the sanctions, all their organizations need do was adopt gender-neutral membership practices.
In addition to providing membership breakdowns, social groups will now have to submit “governing documents” to the College in order to gain recognition, Miller said in the interview Wednesday.
The College will in part use these documents to decide whether groups have “local autonomy”—meaning the group makes “all policy decisions without obligation to any parent organization, national chapter, or charter, and without direction, interference or pressure from any such entity,” according to the document outlining the new recognition framework.
Miller in particular said the College will explore whether graduate boards exert too much influence. He said he plans to hold conversations with social groups about the role their graduate boards play before granting the organizations recognition.
“I would probably want to know and understand better how it’s laid out in the constitution or governing documents they submit versus how it plays out in practice,” he said.
Miller said that, when graduate boards become too directly involved in the day-to-day operations of social groups, it crosses “that hard line where we don’t want students to go with these organizations.” He suggested that, in an ideal situation, club graduate boards would serve a “simply advisory” role.
Graduate boards at some final clubs have historically helped shape both the long-term vision and, at times, the mechanics of daily life in Harvard’s social groups. In one example, the historically all-male Fox Club’s graduate board in fall 2014 blocked an effort to go co-ed spearheaded by some undergraduate members. Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, the then-president of the group’s graduate board, said at the time any “major” changes would need approval or consultation from the club’s graduate board.
As undergraduate members of single-gender final clubs have negotiated the decision whether to go co-ed in the wake of the sanctions, members of club graduate boards have proved powerful and outspoken allies—particularly for those hoping to resist the penalties. The historically reserved all-male Porcellian Club sent a highly unusual statement to The Crimson criticizing the sanctions in April 2016 and also commissioned a statistical report scrutinizing the College’s policy.
More recently, some graduate club leaders have helmed an effort to lobby against the penalties on Capitol Hill.
The plan's mandated examination of social groups' local governance and autonomy could also affect campus fraternities and sororities' relationships with their national chapters. Each of the three Harvard Greek organizations that went gender-neutral in the past two years—the Aleph, the KS, and the Fleur—disaffiliated from their national umbrella organizations (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Kappa Sigma, and Kappa Kappa Gamma, respectively) as part of that process.
The three categories of College recognition outlined in the new policy comprise “Interim Recognition,” “Full Recognition,” and “Recognition with Distinction.” Each comes with a different set of requirements and benefits granted by the College—and each ensures member groups are exempt from the sanctions.
Interim Recognition forms the “minimum standard of recognition” for all social groups. To enter this tier, groups do not need to adopt gender-neutral membership policies by the time they apply for recognition, but they must demonstrate a commitment to going gender-neutral down the road.
Groups must prove this commitment in five ways: by submitting information regarding their current gender breakdowns, by submitting documents that “affirm a commitment” to going gender neutral, by appointing at least one official to serve as liaison between the group and the College, by demonstrating “local autonomy and governance,” and by adopting “required designated trainings” around topics like “sexual assault prevention and alcohol harm-reduction.”
Groups in this tier will gain College recognition and freedom from the sanctions for one year, with an option to extend their interim status for another year if necessary.
Following the completion of the interim period, groups can apply to advance to the next tier, Full Recognition.
To gain Full Recognition status, organizations will have to fulfill the same responsibilities as groups in the Interim Recognition tier. But groups in this category face additional requirements: they must provide a “recruitment schedule” to the College and offer “yearly programming” to all members around topics including “anti-hazing awareness,” “sexual assault prevention,” and “harm-reduction strategies around drugs and alcohol.”
In exchange, groups will receive “priority access” to Harvard-controlled spaces including the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub and the Student Organization Center at Hilles, “access to on-campus spaces for events and for meetings,” and College “support of recruitment” as well as eligibility for “leadership development programs,” according to the plan. Groups in this tier will also earn access to certain College resources including “event advising and planning” and “finances and fundraising management,” the plan reads.
Groups in the Recognition with Distinction tier—the highest of the three—must fulfill the same responsibilities as do organizations in the Full Recognition tier. But they face three key added requirements: first, they must develop “recruitment processes which are both open to all students and designed to promote diversity (including gender diversity) in the group’s membership and governance.”
Second, organizations in the third tier must offer a program for members that “reduces financial barriers to participation.” Finally, these groups must partner with the College to offer “yearly programming which substantially advances the group’s understanding and behavior” around topics like sexual assault prevention and alcohol and drug harm reduction strategies.
In exchange, highest-tier groups will receive all benefits accorded to organizations falling in the Full Recognition category, plus additional privileges including eligibility for College-awarded “additional financial awards… to support select events,” per the document. These groups will win an “award of distinction” from Harvard during the student leadership awards held each spring, according to the plan.
In the Wednesday interview, Miller said groups that achieve this tier will be those that go “above and beyond” in their efforts to comply with the College’s policies.
“It’s really for a certain organization who really is committed to learning and rewarding itself with this distinction recognition level,” he said. “It’s certainly not for everyone to take on.”
Miller said the financial awards the College will grant to groups in this tier “won’t be substantive” but will be enough help groups reach “a more diverse, inclusive kind of membership.” He said he does not yet know the specific dollar amount for these awards.
Groups in any of the three tiers will be required to hold recruitment processes that are open to the entire College student body, Miller said.
In order to gain College recognition, groups must file an “initial submission of materials” by August 15, 2018 and must hold an “in-person meeting” with College administrators “at the beginning of the fall term,” per the document detailing the plan.
An earlier draft version of this plan, obtained by The Crimson and outlined in an email sent to leaders of some social organizations by a College administrator, also included a three-tier system for determining the level of privileges allotted to student social groups. The draft version of the plan did not discuss requirements pertaining to local governance and autonomy, though it did detail the now-mandated gender breakdowns.
In the Wednesday interview, Miller said the College will not decide whether to recognize groups solely based on submitted gender demographics.
“We have not made any conversations about quotas, numbers, percentages,” he said. “I mean, we are not going to really just kind of take what they say and really kind of use that as a reason to recognize them or not.”
“What we will do is use this as an opportunity to better understand how they are being inclusive,” he added.
Referencing the fact that groups do not need to go gender-neutral to achieve the lowest level of recognition, Miller said the new plan is designed especially to entice groups that are currently single-gender to begin collaborating with the College.
“We… understand that there are groups who are currently single-gender and so that’s why we were thoughtful in our processes to really give an account of groups who currently are single-gender but are interested in gaining recognition and also going gender-inclusive,” he said.
He added it would be “ideal” if those single-gender groups began to “engage with us in that level one of recognition.”
In pursuing recognition under the new framework, groups across all three tiers will  interact primarily with the Dean of Students Office—a new office that will oversee residential life, diversity and inclusion initiatives, student experience, and student advising for the entire College starting in July.
Miller said he sought input from five to eight social groups interested in gaining College recognition as he worked to craft the plan announced Thursday. He declined to give the names of the groups.
President of the Aleph David P. Cohn ’19 wrote in an emailed statement that the Aleph is one of the groups that worked with Miller in developing the new framework.
“Our leadership has been meeting and working with the administration since before we made the decision to form a new group last spring,” Cohn wrote. “We are excited that the administration is finalizing its plan for social group recognition and plan to seek recognition for the next academic year.”
President of the Fleur Tiana M. Menon ’19 similarly wrote in an emailed statement that the formerly all-female group worked with the College on the policy and plans to apply for recognition under the new framework.
“We've enjoyed working alongside Dean Alex Miller and his team on the new policy. They've been consistently accommodating in integrating the suggestions we’ve voiced to them,” Menon wrote. “We are excited for the opportunity to continue contributing to a healthy campus social life at Harvard through pursuing recognition.”
In her email, O’Dair wrote that the plan announced Thursday draws on suggestions listed in a Feb. 2017 report issued by a committee tasked with recommending how to implement the sanctions. That report recommended that groups seeking College recognition should “make substantive changes to meet Harvard’s policy of non-discrimination in their organization’s policies, practices, governance, and membership.”
In particular, the 2017 report recommended groups seeking recognition should outline to the College their “plans to achieve diversity” and “processes for open new member selection processes”—two disclosures now required under Thursday's plan.
In the interview Wednesday, Miller discussed the probable role of the student-composed leadership council the College plans to form. Dubbed the Social Organization Leadership Council, the group will have some involvement in helping determine what tier social groups seeking recognition achieve, Miller said. He said he does not yet know to “what degree” students on the council will weigh in on that decision.
“There would be some student involvement in the recognition process,” he said.
The council will also collaborate with College administrators to “assess the impact of this recognition process during the 2018-2019 academic year,” per the policy announcement.
In her email, O’Dair wrote that the plan announced Thursday represents a significant step forward in promoting “values including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination” at Harvard.
“Harvard College seeks to build a community where every student can thrive,” she wrote. “Today’s announcement represents an important step in helping to ensure that we are building such a community.”

Before announcing its penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, College administrators conferred in private with final club members, alumni, lawyers, and student leaders. After the policy was announced, an even broader conversation erupted across campus, one that would persist among Harvard faculty, students, and administrators for years.
Were the sanctions legally sound? Did Harvard need more social organizations, or fewer? Was freedom of association under attack? Did final clubs and Greek organizations have positive or negative presences on campus? From late-night dorm room conversations to sections in sociology classes, Harvard affiliates scratched their heads and debated these questions.
In May 2016, after months of closed-door deliberations, the College broke with its decades-long precedent of turning a blind-eye to unrecognized Greek organizations and final clubs and announced penalties on members of single-gender social organizations.
At that point in time, though, no students on campus were subject to the penalties. The policy would not kick into effect for students until the Class of 2021, who would not set foot on campus for another 14 months.
Beginning with the Class of 2021, the policy bars members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student organizations, becoming captains of varsity sports teams, or receiving College endorsement for certain post-graduate fellowships.
After over a year of discord amid student and faculty opposition to the policy, it was formally adopted in a fall 2017 decision by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, at the end of the Class of 2021’s first semester on campus.
Furthermore, many of this year’s freshmen have not yet faced the decision about whether to join an unrecognized single-gender social group, since final clubs do not allow students to “punch” until the fall of their sophomore year.
As clubs who have not complied with the sanctions continue to recruit members, they face a class whose opinions on final clubs and Greek life have increasingly soured.
“I don’t plan to rush. I never planned on joining. Frats aren't really my type of thing,” Hunter D. Mollett ’21 said.
Mollett is one of 19 freshmen interviewed about their opinions of the sanctions for this story. Of the 19, 18 said they did not plan on joining a single-gender social organization.
The Crimson’s annual survey of incoming classes found that interest in joining Greek organizations and final clubs has been waning in recent years. When surveyed four years ago, 45.2 percent of members of the Class of 2018 said they were “somewhat” or “very” interested in joining a sorority, fraternity, or final club. That figure dropped to 41.7 percent for the Class of 2019, and then to 36.7 percent for the Class of 2020.
Surveyed last summer, only 27.6 percent of the incoming Class of 2021 indicated interest in joining these organizations.
The first class of students affected by this policy has reacted to the sanctions in a variety of ways.
Some freshmen have already joined groups that recently became co-ed, including the Fleur-de-Lis, the KS, and the Aleph.
Several will wait until next fall to “punch” final clubs or “rush” sororities and fraternities as sophomores. Others will consider joining a single-gender social group.
“I never thought about [joining]. I didn’t even know final clubs existed until I got on campus. They were just never something I was interested in. You have to be the right kind of person to actively know about them and actively pursue being a part of those organizations,” Fatoumata Mbaye ’21 said.
Lila J. Williams ’21 said she originally was interested in joining a sorority but was deterred by the policy. Despite understanding the “motivations behind it,” Williams found the policy “limiting.”
“I think I would have liked to rush a sorority had there not been the sanctions, so I did feel a little bit limited, especially during second semester, when I came in motivated to make more friends,” Williams said. “I think that’s something that would have been nice and would’ve helped with that.”
When asked if she would still consider joining a social group, Williams said she “would consider it, but that’s too much work.”
“I don’t want to go through the whole rush process,” she said.
Meanwhile, several freshmen had negative opinions of single-gender social groups. Amir K. Hamilton ’21 said he would be “limiting” himself by joining one of these organizations.
“I think it's kind of gross that you'd want to arbitrarily limit your social sphere in some way to just, like, half of people. And so I wouldn't want to be part of any sort of single gender social organization,” Hamilton said.“Mostly because my friends are of various genders and I feel like if I were to put myself in a place like a final club where that sort of stuff isn’t really a thing, I’d be limiting myself.”
Ethan M. Schultz ’21 agreed with Hamilton’s belief that these organizations can inhibit diversity among friend groups.
“Part of the reason I came to Harvard was for its diversity, and so I think that by going to a final club or joining one, I'll be eliminating one of the benefits that I was looking for in a university. So I generally approve of the sanctions by the administration,” Schultz said.
Asked about some final club graduates' negative response to the sanctions in a recent interview, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pointed in part to the College's mission.
"At Harvard, we have a very specific mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders for our diverse and interconnected society," Khurana said. "We do not believe that it is effective to basically institutionalize segregation."
Some students interviewed had mixed views on social groups.
While a majority of surveyed incoming students in the Class of 2021 indicated they were not interested in joining a single-gender social group, only 35 percent of students surveyed said that they found the sanctions at least somewhat favorable. Meanwhile, over 40 percent found the penalties at least somewhat unfavorable. Over 5 percent indicated they did not have enough information about the sanctions.
Hamilton said it would be “gross” to join a final club. But he said he does not wish to prevent others from doing so.
“With the whole sanctions thing, I’d be more on the side of, like, if people want to do that they can, but I don’t want to be part of that myself,” Hamilton said.
Cesar A. Haig ’21 said he does not have a strong opinion of single-gender social groups.
“I mean, I largely think if people want to participate in an organization, people should be able to participate in that organization... There are co-gender organizations and there are some single-gender organizations,” Haig said.
“It seems like some people really enjoy it, and it doesn’t seem like that many people have a problem with it," Haig said.
Emily A. Romero ’21 said she ultimately does not believe that single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations have a place at Harvard.
“I do believe that single-gender organizations do not belong on this campus, and after everything that’s happened, they should not be allowed the freedoms that they’ve had. But I don’t know if sanctions are the solution,” she said.
As Haig, as well as his classmates in the first class to be subject to the College’s policy, try to make sense of the complex story of the sanctions—much of which unfolded before their arrival on campus—he believes tensions over the future of single-gender social organizations will eventually die down.
“They’re just organizations, and if it becomes a problem that they’re single-gender, people are probably going to move to other organizations. It’s like economics and stuff, right? I’m really bad at Ec10,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services recently won three medals from the National Association of College and University Food Services for residential dining, retail sales, and food waste management.
Harvard won a gold medal in the large-school division of the residential dining concepts category. In order to apply for the award, dining services are required to supply the association with their menus, marketing materials, and nutrition facts.
“It’s a pretty comprehensive process,” said Bruce Calvert, director of residential dining operations. “The entry basically outlines every piece of the program that we run.”
Dining services are then judged on the variety of their menus, availability of nutritional information, and operating hours, among other factors.
HUDS’s entry for the residential dining prize spanned 58 pages. It highlighted the service’s efforts in “promoting healthy choices and enduring knowledge about food preparation, sustainability, nutrition, and community.”
Akeisha K. Hayde, executive chef for residential dining, attributed HUDS’s success in part to efforts to incorporate student choice and feedback in menu offerings.
“Students were concerned about the different cooking oils that we were using, so we switched from canola to using things like olive oil,” she said.
Hayde also pointed to the make-your-own bars available at undergraduate dining halls, which she said HUDS has expanded and diversified this year, as a strong point in Harvard’s entry.
In addition to the gold medal, HUDS earned two silver medals from the association.
The first silver, for retail sales, was awarded for the recently renovated café at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Laurie Torf, retail area general manager, said the café’s design and fresh food make it particularly attractive.
“Every station is enticing,” she said, mentioning the café's pizza, pad thai, and salad offerings. The cafe’s pizza menu rotates through 18 different types of pies, according to the prize application.
The application also noted the café’s commitment to providing a wide variety of nutritious, locally sourced food.
“That whole concept, it’s in trend, and people like that,” said General Manager for Harvard Kennedy School Dining Serie Demelo.
The second silver medal was in waste management, awarded as part of the association’s sustainability awards.
Andrew Camuso, senior general manager for Annenberg, the College’s freshman dining hall, said HUDS donates food not taken from the servery to families in need. Freshman entryways can volunteer to package meals for consumption in partnership with Food for Free, a Cambridge-based charity that works to combat food insecurity.
The program delivered 27,000 meals to food insecure families in and around Cambridge in 2017, according to the application. It cost Harvard about $29,000 to administer in total.
Camuso said that HUDS tracks the amount of food left on plates and uses that information to inform students about the amount of food waste and examine its own practices to minimize waste.
HUDS’s application states that these  “food waste audits” have kept plate waste to a “nominal average” of 1.5 ounces per meal served.
The National Association of College and University Food Services honors dining services across eight categories. Its president, Patricia Klos of Tufts University, wrote in an emailed statement that its awards inspire excellence in food services.
“The NACUFS awards program provide member schools the opportunity to showcase their most innovative, expressive and successful initiatives in the areas of menus, sustainability and nutrition,” she wrote. “To be recognized by one’s peers is among the highest honors an association can bestow.”

As they prepare to negotiate with the University over wages and benefits, members of Harvard’s newly formed graduate student union have created a new body—called the Time’s Up committee—to advocate for individuals who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.
Members of the union’s organizing committee voted to form the group around two weeks ago, Time’s Up committee member Kelly “Kay” T. Xia ’19 said. The move comes after students voted to authorize Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers to collectively bargain on behalf of eligible student assistants in April.  University officials have said they plan to bargain with the newly formed union.
Roughly 10 people crowded into a CGIS conference room for the committee’s inaugural meeting Wednesday night. Though most attendees supported or organized for the HGSU-UAW in the run-up to the April unionization election, levels of prior engagement with the union varied among attendees, according to union organizer Erik Baker.
“To me, it just reinforced our intuition that this is an issue that has the potential to build some really strong and broad coalitions on campus that fight for good change,” Baker said.
At the off-the-record meeting, committee members discussed helping the union’s bargaining committee create a contract provision providing protections against sexual harassment for student assistants, though no set plans have been made for what that clause might look like, Xia said.
“We've seen that at other schools often the union can be another venue to provide support and recourse for survivors,” Xia said. “We're also hoping to be able to do some research on what is feasible and desirable to have in a contract like that.”
Going forward, the committee’s “next steps” will involve “listening and building connections” with students to understand what protections members of the union want to gain, Baker said.
“One example that we talked about during the campaign would be better chronic mental health care services, which obviously extends beyond this specific issue, but is particularly salient when it comes to the question of supporting survivors,” Baker said.
The committee also plans to provide training for its members to help them “[handle] disclosures and sensitive conversations” with members of the union regarding experiences with sexual harassment.
“When you announce yourself as an organizer for a cause like this, sometimes people with these sorts of experiences will come to talk to you about it, and we just want to make sure everyone is somewhat trained to handle these as sensitively as possible,” Xia said.
The committee plans to convene weekly throughout the summer, both in closed committee meetings and information and feedback sessions open to the public.
“It'll be a chance for us to give a little bit more information on what we're hoping to accomplish to them, but also to hear from people about what their department climate is like and what sort of changes they'd like to see,” Xia said.
“I think as these go forward through the summer, that'll really help us shape what sort of changes we'd like to see on campus and in specific departments,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years, staffers manning Harvard’s information desk in the lobby of the Holyoke Center had grown accustomed to hearing a common refrain from confused tourists.
“Where’s Harvard?”
With an unassuming steel-framed door sandwiched between Au Bon Pain and a local Cambridge bank, visitors could be forgiven for thinking they’d taken a wrong turn upon entering the Center.
The Holyoke Center—recently renamed the Smith Campus Center—is set to reopen in September 2018 after a two-year renovation that aims to transform the building into a hub for affiliates and the broader Cambridge community.  Harvard first began renovations for the Campus Center in April 2016 after receiving a donation of an undisclosed amount from Richard A. Smith and Susan F. Smith.
The significance of the Center as many visitors’ first impression of Harvard is key to Senior Director of University Planning Tanya Iatridis’s vision for the makeover.
“The Smith Campus Center will offer a new front door to Harvard,” Iatridis wrote in an email. “We’re confident that the entire project will greatly enhance the public realm, enliven the area, create a usable year-round amenity, and result in a more cohesive and collaborative community.”
When completed, the Smith Campus Center will stand out as the crown jewel of University President Drew G. Faust’s Common Spaces initiative.
Launched in 2008, the mission of the initiative is “to bring the University community together” and “to create areas on campus where students, faculty, staff, and visitors can engage with one another, discover and try new things, or simply relax,” according to its website.
Common Spaces has implemented multiple projects such as the 2013 renovation of the Science Center Plaza, the rainbow chairs in Harvard Yard, food trucks and pop-up concerts in the Plaza, and seating areas on the steps of Memorial Church.
When completed, the Smith Campus Center renovation will be the final and largest installment of the initiative during Faust’s tenure.
“The new Campus Center will be for everybody,” Director of Common Spaces Julie A. Crites wrote in an email.  “Through the space, we aim to strengthen the sense of community for everyone on campus. We also hope the Campus Center will encourage interactions between students, faculty and staff, as well as members of our community and visitors to campus.”
The University solicited input from a multitude of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents in its planning for the Campus Center, according to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.   In order to proceed, the University obtained the approval of the Cambridge Historical Commission, the Harvard Square Advisory Council, the Cambridge Planning Board, and the Cambridge Board of Zoning, O’Rourke wrote in an email.
Planners also gathered feedback from faculty, staff, and students by conducting around 25 focus groups and collecting 6,000 survey responses to inform design plans for the Campus Center, according to O’Rourke.  Participants were asked for their opinions on a range of topics, including the furnishing of the Center. In the fall of 2016, hundreds of members of the community participated in a furniture showcase that involved testing out and providing feedback on potential furnishing options.
Some responses to the University’s queries—which also asked about campus spaces in general—led to offshoot projects for the Common Space initiative, including the chairs in Harvard Yard.
Harvard planners also spoke to members of the community to identify preferences for food venues to be located within the Campus Center. Desirable attributes for the eateries that emerged from these conversations included being locally-based, diverse, sustainable, and affordable, according to O’Rourke.
University officials announced earlier this year that there will be eight food vendors in the Campus Center. The seven confirmed vendors include Bon Me, Swissbäkers, Blackbird Doughnuts, Pavement Coffeehouse, Saloniki, and Whole Heart Provisions.
“When complete, the Smith Campus Center will be a dynamic, vibrant, central gathering space for the Harvard community, Cambridge residents, and for the many visitors who visit our campus every day,” Vice President for Campus Services Meredith L. Weenick ‘90 wrote in an email.
Planners consulted Harvard Square chess players to help develop plans for outdoor chess spaces around the Campus Center, according to O’Rourke. Considerations being taken into account include ensuring that the chess boards—to be imprinted on outdoor tables—be of international size and that the seating be made of wood rather than concrete, which gets cold more easily. There will be chess areas by the Campus Center on Mt. Auburn St. as well as on Massachusetts Ave.
The general public will be able to access all of the first floor of the Campus Center and most of the second floor, excluding office spaces. The Center will include restrooms in the welcome area that are available to the public, and anyone will be able to purchase food, access Harvard visitors’ information, and purchase tickets to Harvard events.
The move to renovate the Center did not always go smoothly with tenants and its neighbors.  Several businesses previously hosted by the Holyoke Center—including Harvard Student Agencies’ cleaners operators—were required to vacate the space during renovations.  Adjacent vendors have also complained that renovations have depressed their revenues and disrupted foot traffic.  Last August, the parent firm of shuttered Mediterranean restaurant En Boca filed a lawsuit against Harvard, arguing the University had misrepresented the extent that renovations would interfere with local businesses.
The final renovations to the Smith Campus Center will maintain the original architectural framework of the Holyoke Center as designed by Josep Lluis Sert when it opened in 1966, according to Iatridis.
“Key design strategies include a comprehensive design approach that reinforces Sert’s original vision of activating the street level, maximizing transparency, enhancing connectivity and circulation, and integrating and improving access to daylight and landscape,” Iatridis wrote in an email.
Glass walls have been installed throughout the first and second floors to give an open feel to the building and allow in natural light, enabling observers to view the back wall of the Center from the entrance.
The building’s sustainable design includes systems for rainwater collection and reuse, a glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, and the use of sustainable building materials, according to O’Rourke. Greenery is set to cover some of the walls in the lobby.
The first floor will also feature an indoor courtyard enclosed by four glass walls. The courtyard, landscaped by Michael Van Valkenburgh, will feature plant species that are indigenous to New England, changing color with the four seasons.
Owing to their size, the trees will have to be lowered from the top into the courtyard over the side of the Center.
Upon entering the Smith Campus Center, visitors will be welcomed by a large information desk, a wall map of campus, a ticket office, and Pavement Coffeehouse.
By proceeding into the building, they will end up in the “Harvard Commons,” a large, airy space fit to host approximately 1,600 people and floored with white tile. Bleacher-like steps provide a casual seating area, along with more standard forms of seating.
The Commons will also include a stage for student performances and other events. A large screen can be lowered over the stage, which planners envision will be used for  movie nights and presentations.
Glass doors and wooden rafters in the roofs of the Commons are intended to reduce noise so that other spaces in the Center can be used for quiet work while events are taking place.
The second floor is aimed towards quiet study, with isolated study spaces, couches, tables, and four fireplaces. Parts of the floor will be carpeted.
Indoor bridges connecting sections of the second level lead to collaboration spaces, two multipurpose rooms, and a space for Undergraduate Council and Graduate Council meetings, for which access will be limited to Harvard ID holders. Some spaces will be reservable by student groups.
Two express elevators will go straight between the first and second floors of the Center to the tenth floor without stopping at the administrative floors in between. The tenth floor, only accessible to Harvard affiliates, will be split into two wings.
One wing, dubbed the “River View Commons,” will be a designated social area with windows facing southwards towards the Charles River and Allston. It will include a game room, a small stage for informal concerts,  lounge spaces, and a room that can be reserved for classes and other meetings.
The other wing, which has yet to be named, will provide spaces that are intended for scheduled meetings and events. The entire wing will be available for events.

UPDATED: May 23, 2018 at 4:45 a.m.
Sitting on the desk of assistant professor Sarah E. Lewis '01 in the History of Art and Architecture department is a black-and-white family photo of her grandfather, Shadrack Emmanuel Lee, as a teenager. Lewis, who views much art and photography in her work, singled out the image as the most precious to her.
Lewis’ grandfather was expelled from high school in 1926 for asking why the textbooks neglected to include the accomplishments of non-white figures. Turning to art and jazz, Lee never finished high school.
Close to a century later, Lewis cites her grandfather as a source of inspiration for her current work. Lee chose to pursue art rather than politics or activism, while his granddaughter currently explores the connection between art and social justice.
Lewis, a rising star in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, holds a joint assistant professorship in the Department of History of Art and Architecture and the Department of African and African American Studies.
Outside of the classroom her impact is also widespread. Not yet 40, she has kept busy, authoring the book, "The Rise: Creativity, the Gift of Failure, and the Search for Mastery," which has been translated into seven languages. She guest edited an issue of Aperture magazine entitled "Vision & Justice," which received the 2017 Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography. She also served on President Obama’s Art Policy Committee, and this spring, she helmed the New Yorker Photo Department’s Instagram account for four days.
“I grew up right in heart of midtown Manhattan,” Lewis explained. “So that became my normal and I think what has created and sustained the level of energy I like to keep around me.”
Despite balancing a number of commitments outside the classroom, Lewis has attracted attention for her undergraduate teaching. This semester, 120 students showed up for 12 available spots in one of Lewis’ seminars during shopping week.
This academic year, she taught a General Education lecture course African and African American Studies 132Z: “Vision and Justice: The Art of Citizenship” as well as two seminars, African American Studies 185X: “What is Black Art? African American Cultural Production from the Early Republic to Civil Rights,” and History of Art and Architecture 271K: “Picturing America: Photography, Race, and Citizenship.”
For her Picturing America seminar, Lewis took her students to Washington D.C. this semester to visit the newly constructed Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture. Hannah Hardenbergh ’19, a history and literature concentrator who took the course, recalls meeting and Skyping with the artists featured in the class.
“She is really dedicated to the work that she’s doing,” Hardenberg said. “Honestly, she’s made me think about art a little bit differently and has inspired me to consider academia and art history.”
Lewis said her Vision and Justice Gen Ed course inspired her Aperture publication in 2016. Both the class and the publication focus on the intersection between culture, art, and social justice, an area that Lewis believes is largely “underexplored.” Lewis said she was surprised at how much attention the Vision & Justice issue received, which is now in its third print run.
“[Vision & Justice] has become the framework for thinking through this nexus and the relationship between artistic production, culture, and justice,” Lewis said. “It looks at effectively the counter narrative that artists of color had created to offer an unseen sense of dignity and humanity and interiority regarding black life in the twentieth and twenty-first century."
The Vision & Justice Aperture publication features photographs from both African American and non-African American photographers coupled with commentary by present-day scholars, writers, poets, playwrights, and curators. The publication includes an essay on Frederick Douglass by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and a dialogue between cinematographer Bradford Young and his colleague Ava DuVernay, director of Selma and several other films.
Mirroring Lewis’s own publication, one assignment in Lewis’s Gen Ed Vision and Justice course asks students to assemble their midterm essays into a class book. Each student selects an image, linking it to a Supreme Court case of their choosing. Aperture magazine then publishes five of Lewis’ students’ essays each year as an expansion of the Vision & Justice issue.
"That’s one way in which it’s really a living document as well,” Lewis said.
Lewis is proud of the diversity in her classroom, noting that the students in her Vision and Justice class “showed no racial majority.”
"When you question whose identity is normalized through that community, when everyone’s identity counts in equal measure, there’s a kind of bond and a fellowship you can create,” Lewis said. “That’s really been one of the most rewarding parts of teaching the class."
Students also grapple with Harvard’s own history. Vision and Justice students study the Zealy daguerreotypes, a controversial series of photos of slaves taken at the behest of Harvard professor Louis Agassiz in 1850 in an effort to bolster polygenesis theory. Lewis said the Harvard Art Museum, where the daguerreotypes are now housed, stands on the land where Agassiz’s house used to be.
“The history of photography is weaponized from the start. It’s used as a tool to sort of honor human life through the portraits we all celebrate, but also to denigrate it,” Lewis said. “And [my students] are able to see the way in which it became a tool for racial science through this class."
Nick T. Wyville ’20 took Lewis’ Vision and Justice last semester. He praised the course, saying that he came away with a deepened understanding of history as well as a newfound ability to analyze and interpret art.
“I would say that I learned a lot about the contemporary implications of that art, not only the art that we studied, but the implications of what we see in our visual world today,” Wyville said.
Wyville, inspired after taking Lewis’ class, took a road trip through his native state of Alabama. He saw both confederate and civil-rights-movement monuments and viewed this “dichotomy” of the South in a new light.
As an undergrad at Harvard, Lewis was a Mather House resident and concentrated in Social Studies and History of Art and Architecture graduating magna cum laude. While she originally planned to be pre-med or concentrate in Visual and Environmental Studies, she discovered at Harvard that she preferred the history of art to the making of art.
"I thought there must be something written about the connection between art, race, and justice, and at the time, there really wasn’t much,” Lewis said.
An ambitious undergrad, Lewis began working on her book "The Rise" while at the College. She also was involved with Harvard Model Congress and the Black Arts Festival. As a senior, she was awarded the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.
"As soon as I stepped on campus the first time I visited [Harvard], I felt as if anything was possible. Any interest you had could be supported,” Lewis said.
Even with her busy schedule, Lewis found time for fun—and can be thanked for beginning the YardFest tradition.
“There was no live music here at the time. The only thing we had was the Primal Scream. That was the only kind of valve release we had as a collective,” Lewis said. “I created something called the Harvard Concert Commission, with three other friends, which has now become YardFest apparently.”
Lewis has worn many hats besides that of teacher, including those of author and curator. "The Rise" examines the “improbable foundations of the path-breaking, creative, innovative works."
"The bridge between "The Rise" and my current work has to do with a question I identified at the end of writing "The Rise." "It’s effectively this: where would we be in society without the arts getting us to overcome collective failure?” Lewis said.
When asked about what research she is most proud of, Lewis pointed to the work currently on her computer.
"When a musician was asked once what his favorite work was, he said, and I feel the same way, always the next one. I’m most proud of what I think is to come,” she said.
Suzanne P. Blier, one of Lewis’s colleagues in the History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies Departments, advised Lewis when she was an undergrad at the College. Blier said Lewis has always been “wonderfully thoughtful” and “incredibly warm.” Having known Lewis for many years, Blier finds Lewis’s “emotional intelligence” particularly striking.
“She’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met in terms of what people call emotional intelligence, how you deal with the world around you,” Blier said. “I also sense that she’s one of those great people who over the course of the time since I first knew her has had such an array of experiences. She wears those, she carries those, engages those, a whole set of experiences which have enriched her life.”
Blier added that Lewis was the “most stylish person in class” as an undergrad and that she continues to be the most stylish today.
Lawrence D. Bobo, chair of the Department of African and African American Studies, praised Lewis for her contributions to the faculty.
“She is a leader of growing stature in the art world, convening scholars to think about art in social change efforts and the fulfillment of democratic ambitions,” Bobo wrote in an email. “The African American experience and contribution has, of course, profoundly influenced art worlds and our national culture. Sarah is bringing all of that richness to Harvard with a special insight and ingenuity all her own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard social science professors criticized President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, saying it will hurt America’s global credibility and could speed Iran’s progress toward obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The Iran Nuclear Deal—officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—was negotiated under the Obama administration in 2015 to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb in the next 10 years. Under the plan, the United States and the European Union revoked economic sanctions on Iran’s oil and gas industries and provided other economic incentives. In return, Iran reduced its stores of enriched uranium, decreased its number of active nuclear reactors, and submitted to regular checks of its nuclear facilities by international monitors.
The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs released a collection of statements from fellows and affiliates expressing their individual opinions on Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal and reinstate economic sanctions.
Many of the scholars are part of the Belfer Center’s “Iran Project," which connects Harvard and Iranian scholars to increase understanding of contemporary Iranian affairs. Though they agreed that the nuclear deal was flawed, many said the United States's exit won’t fix its problems.
Professor William H. Tobey wrote in a statement that if Trump’s main objections to the deal were its failure to compel total nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and its relatively short duration, then reinstating sanctions and giving Iran a window to reinstate their nuclear program only exacerbates those problems.
Kennedy School fellow Nawaf E. Obaid disagreed, however, calling the reversal “a much-needed move to correct a historically catastrophic policy by the Obama administration.”
Some professors said they worried that leaving the deal will make America a less effective negotiator and thus a less significant global power.
“If the United States can’t signal that it is committed to deals that it makes, then the value of diplomacy in negotiation is undermined, and other countries won’t negotiate with the United States.”  Iran Project Director Payam Mohseni said.
“Trump is accelerating the retreat of America’s singular global leadership role,” R. Nicholas Burns, Kennedy School professor and former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs wrote in a statement.
Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield disagreed.
“This repeal puts pressure on our allies and on Iran to make this happen,” Mansfield wrote in an email, referring to calls for renegotiating the Iran deal. “And with a Europe made more active by American prodding, America will be stronger too.”
Some said the move may disillusion young, previously America-friendly Iranians and may empower conservative “hardliners”—supporters of Ayatollah Khameini—who initially opposed the deal.
The decision to withdraw will be “the first major bitter experience” with the West for Iran’s youth, Mohseni said. Mohseni, Burns, and Kennedy School Professor Matthew Bunn all warned that “hardliners” may now seek to discard the deal and pursue nuclearization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty and staff across Harvard will be required to complete an online training on the University’s sexual and gender-based harassment policy starting in the fall, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie Lapp informed them in an email Wednesday.
The decision follows a series of sexual harassment allegations against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez that have surfaced in recent months amid the #MeToo movement, which has brought down a slew of prominent men in various industries over similar allegations. Dominguez was placed on "administrative leave" in March and shortly after announced his retirement.
In their email, Garber and Lapp nodded to the societal reckoning #MeToo has provoked and connected it to Harvard.
“As recent events across society have demonstrated, sexual and gender-based harassment remains a deeply ingrained problem. It can impose enormous human costs, personally and professionally,” they wrote. “It undermines our shared aspiration to ensure that all members of this community have the opportunity to thrive.”
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that the new requirement is not in response to the allegations made against Dominguez.
“Yesterday’s announcement is yet another step forward in our endeavor to continually improve our efforts to proactively address concerns of sexual and gender-based harassment,” she wrote.
Garber and Lapp wrote that the purpose of the training is to remind faculty and staff of the University's policies and their “responsibility as members of the community.” They pointed to various training programs the school already requires of its students and in-person training sessions for faculty and staff, but added that the updated and newly mandatory online module is necessary to ensure uniform understanding of Title IX policies and resources.
“The step we will take in the fall will provide a common baseline of training to all faculty and staff,” Garber and Lapp wrote.
The University has worked in over the past two years to implement the 2016 recommendations of a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention, which called for trainings for students, faculty, and staff across Harvard’s schools.
The task force specifically recommended that schools mandate that all students complete annual online modules around sexual assault prevention. Roll-out of these modules has been uneven across schools, however. The College debuted the first online module for students in 2016, and offered two versions this academic year—one for incoming students and one for returning students—though students are not penalized for failing to complete them. Many graduate and professional schools have since developed similar modules for students, though not all are mandatory.
The training module is also open to faculty and staff, and some schools already encouraged their faculty and staff to complete it, according to Jackson. The new requirement intends to standardize the practice across the University.
In addition to announcing the new training requirement, Garber and Lapp said University President Drew G. Faust has asked a University-wide committee that has worked since 2015 to review the University’s Title IX policy and procedures to consider specific questions regarding how sexual and gender-based harassment occurs, how Harvard can prevent it, and how the University deals with allegations of misconduct. Garber and Lapp invited staff and faculty to share their thoughts with the committee via email.
Donald H. Pfister, the chair of the committee, said in an interview that even though the committee was asked to consider these questions soon after the allegations against Dominguez became public, they were not specifically related to the Dominguez case.
“We were asked by the president to specifically look into these questions of the imbalance of power and authority and that happened soon after all these revelations came out, so we’ve spent time thinking about how it is in this academic community that we can make sure that people who are feeling these and being subjected to these kinds of events can come forward, can feel that there’s some level of resolution and so forth,” Pfister said.
Pfister also said his committee had discussed trainings, but not the specific timeline for this new initiative. The committee generally meets bi-monthly, Pfister said, to review a series of issues related to sexual harassment, including Title IX procedures and reports produced by University investigators following TItle IX investigations. Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution is charged with carrying out these investigations.
“In our evaluations we felt that the reports that were being produced were both very, very long, and very, very technical. So, we made suggestions that this should be evaluated—the language and the length of the policy should be looked at,” Pfister said. “[The Office for Dispute Resolution has] been working at that and trying to make these documents much more approachable.”
Though the committee has provided recommendations directly to specific University offices, Pfister said there are no plans currently for the committee to conclude its work or produce a full report on the efficacy of the current policy and procedures, which the University put in place in 2014.
“There is no timeline,” Pfister said. “We have been very consistent in saying that over the years that it’s an ongoing venture.”
Pfister said he sees the new policy mandating faculty and staff trainings as an “educational venture,” but that the University would need to devise some kind of measurement to actually judge its impact.
“I think what the training is aimed at is for people to understand the policy, to understand what is appropriate and what is inappropriate activity and if you’re subjected to this kind of activity, where to get help and where to go,” Pfister said. “The effectiveness—we’ll have to see and determine whether there’s a metric we can use in some way to evaluate the effectiveness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than one in seven surveyed undergraduates reported their emotional health has had a negative effect on their academic performance in a recent wellness survey conducted by Harvard University Health Services in partnership with the Undergraduate Council.
The survey, sent to students in late February, saw 15.7 percent of respondents report that their emotional health “fairly often” or “very often” negatively impacted their academics. Asked about the state of their overall emotional health, roughly 78 percent of respondents reported it to be  either “good,” “very good,” or “excellent,” while about 22 percent reported their overall emotional health as “poor” or “fair.”
The questions in the survey were designed to paint a picture of the emotional well-being of the student body and their awareness of support mechanisms in place to address mental health concerns.
Fifteen percent of survey respondents reported a currently diagnosed mental health disorder.  Nonetheless, the rates of diagnosed mental health conditions at Harvard—depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse problems—are significantly lower than national college student rates, according to the survey.
However, close to 45 percent of respondents indicated they have concerns about whether they suffer from an undiagnosed mental health condition.
“Such concerns may be indicative of students’ need for more clarification and understanding of clinical vs. non-clinical mental health issues,” the report reads.
Concerns about undiagnosed conditions showed significant gender differences.  While close to 28 percent of female respondents reported concerns about anxiety and 23 percent reported concerns about depression, just 16 percent of males reported they are concerned about anxiety and 21 percent about depression.
The survey, which is conducted biannually, was designed in part by the Undergraduate Council.  The Council passed legislation in early February to conduct a separate survey on mental health, but ultimately agreed to join forces with HUHS in order to gain more “comprehensive” data, according to UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19.
HUHS Executive Director Paul J. Barreira cautioned in an emailed statement that the results may not reflect the opinions of the undergraduate population as a whole, due to the relatively low response rate.
“With a 35.8% response rate to this voluntary survey, the respondents are likely not representative of the entire student body, as those with strong feelings may be most inclined to respond,” Barreira wrote. “Therefore, we must be cautious in interpreting the data.”
The survey results were weighted to correct for an imbalanced response rate between  respondents of different genders, according to Karen Pearce, Director of the Harvard College Institutional Research Office and a co-author of the survey.
“However, the data is helpful in identifying trends and engaging in conversations with the entire College community about ways that we can improve emotional and physical wellbeing of students,” Barreira added.
The survey also found that large percentages of students do not know the location of peer counseling offices on campus.
While slightly over 50 percent reported they knew the location of Room 13, an all-night student-run counseling group located in the basement of Thayer Hall, less than 20 percent knew where the offices of ECHO, Contact, Response, or Indigo were located.
UC Vice President Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said in an interview Tuesday that the lack of awareness among students about the whereabouts of peer counseling groups reflects a need to increase assistance for these groups and help to publicize their existence.
“That speaks to the fact that we need to be supporting our peer counseling groups even more than we are currently,” Boucher said.  “Peer counseling groups offer a tremendously valuable resource to Harvard’s campus in the sense that they are a resource and a set of people that a lot of students turn to when they are going through difficult times.”
“It is apparent to me that something is not working well with our communication right now,” Boucher added. “And when I say our communication, referring to Harvard’s strategy broadly for advertising peer counselling groups.”
A spokesperson for HUHS could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.
Boucher said he would seek to use the Council’s reach to better advertise the availability of peer counseling groups to undergraduates.
This year’s results showed improvements in some areas relative to the 2016 iteration of the survey.
The proportion of undergraduates who reported they knew at least two people they could “open up to” about private feelings increased to 79.9 percent from 73.3 percent in 2016.
In the wake of the survey, HUHS will seek to form a student advisory committee to discuss potential policy responses to the survey results, according to Zhang.
“HUHS is pretty committed to making sure that there is student input as we continue to design surveys and as we continue to take the results of this survey and put them towards actionable policy changes,” Zhang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently relocated to Harvard Square, the Cambridge District Homeless Court has begun holding sessions in the First Parish Church, which stands at the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Church Street.
While the court has held only a handful of sessions at its new location thus far, according to Judge Roanne Sragow, who presides over the court, the change has improved accessibility for the homeless, and increased the court’s ability to carry out its mission.
The Court changed locations twice in the past two years, first relocating from Medford to the Salvation Army Church on Mass. Ave in Central Square,  before arriving at its current location at First Parish Church.
The Court was moved due to the difficulties the homeless faced in trying to reach its previous location in Medford, which was not well-connected by public transportation, according to Sragow.
The difficulty in reaching the court in Medford meant that many homeless defendants failed to appear in court. This kept the court from being able to reduce the recidivism rate among the homeless as it hoped, Sragow said.
“What was happening was that the default rate was rising tenfold," she said. "They just couldn’t make their way over to the court in Medford. Often, they were arrested on the way to the court."
But Sragow said the move from Medford to the Salvation Army Church in Massachusetts Avenue helped change this, increasing accessibility for Cambridge's homeless population, a sizeable portion of whom reside in the Square.
“The most amazing thing about moving from Medford was that first day word got out we only had a few cases on the list, but the room was packed because everybody there who had a Court case showed up and they were so happy that they didn’t have to agonize over heading to court in Medford,” Sragow said.
Though the court’s move to the Square is fairly recent, it has been operating since 2011. It was first established under Massachusetts’s Homeless Court Program, which aims to remove the legal challenges encountered by the homeless.
The specialty courts established under the program were tasked with the responsibility of resolving minor misdemeanors and outstanding charges against homeless individuals. The court aimed to resolve such charges quickly because these charges often prevented homeless defendants from obtaining housing and employment later on.
While the Cambridge District Homeless Court is tasked with the same core responsibilities of the Massachusetts Homeless Court Program, it has taken it upon itself to further extend the scope of the services the specialty courts provide.
“We are assisting people to find housing and detox. We have had people show up that we have had to take immediately to the hospital for health issues,” Sragow said.
Denise A. Jilson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said having a specialty court that serves the homeless in Harvard Square is “very important—especially given the kind of 'homeless' court that Judge Sragow presides over."
"It is full of empathy, compassion and goodwill,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­One spot up for grabs. Three teams. One final regular-season series.
The 2018 Harvard baseball squad is the best Cambridge has seen in years—under its belt are a Beanpot title, wins over strong ACC and CAA teams, and a long-elusive overall record of, so far, over .500. But the season is on the verge of closing, after which the 2018 Crimson baseball team, for all its accolades, will be no more.
Before it moves on, though, the newfound Bad Boys of Boston look to add one more feather to its cap: an Ivy title.
A tense final weekend of regular-season Ancient Eight play looms for Columbia, Dartmouth, and Harvard, as all three will be vying for the chance to play in the 2018 Ivy League Championship Series, which pits the top two teams of the regular season in a title-deciding three-game set on May 19-20.
Yale, atop the table with a 14-4 conference record, are essentially guaranteed a spot. Dartmouth at 11-6-1, Columbia at 11-7, and the Crimson at 10-8 are locked in a three-team tango for second. Cornell sits fifth at 8-10 and is mathematically eliminated.
Here’s how it’ll go down: on Sunday (11:30 AM), Harvard (20-19, 10-8 Ivy League) opens a big three-game series with Dartmouth (16-20-1, 11-6-1) at O’Donnell Field in Cambridge, Mass.
In conjunction with Columbia taking on Cornell on Saturday and Sunday, the two series will decide who plays on in 2018 to the championship series and who hangs ‘em up.
“We knew we had a really talented group coming in[to the year],” junior center fielder Ben Skinner said. “The expectation was to win an Ivy League championship this year, and we’re currently in a spot where we have a chance to do that.”
Here’s what would need to happen for each team to clinch a spot in the Championship series:
YALE GETS IN
The red-hot Bulldogs are close to being guaranteed a spot. The only way Yale doesn’t get in is exactly thus:
Penn sweeps Yale. Dartmouth sweeps the Crimson. Columbia sweeps Cornell.
The tiebreaking procedure for Yale and Columbia, both hypothetically sitting at 14-7, goes the way of Columbia. Notably, the Lions beat the Bulldogs 2-1 in their head-to-head regular season series.
Dartmouth would then play Columbia for the title and Yale would be left on the outside looking in.
All the Bulldogs have to do is win just one game to clinch a spot. Literally everything would have to happen exactly as described above for things to go wrong for the defending Ivy champions.
DARTMOUTH GETS IN
The Big Green is also in a very good spot. Dartmouth controls its destiny entirely—if it sweeps Harvard, it’s in. If it wins two and Columbia doesn’t sweep Cornell, it’s in. If it wins one and Columbia drops two of three to Cornell, it’s in.
As long as it wins at least as many games as Columbia does this weekend, without getting swept by the Crimson, Dartmouth will be in.
Trouble looms for the Big Green if it loses all three, as then Harvard would surpass Dartmouth and the Big Green would be eliminated.
COLUMBIA GETS IN
Columbia has been in second place for most of the season, but the Crimson’s and the Big Green’s late-season rise have the Lions sitting on edge.  Columbia will thus look to regain control of the second slot with a good series against Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y.
There are a multitude of scenarios in which Columbia gets in, but the gist is that it needs to win at least two of three against the Big Red and get a little help from the baseball gods along the way.
In other words (assuming Yale takes care of business and clinches):
If Dartmouth sweeps Harvard, Columbia is out.
If Dartmouth takes two of three, Columbia needs to sweep Cornell.
If Dartmouth takes one of three or gets swept, Columbia needs to win at least two of three.
If Columbia can only muster one win against the Big Red, it’s automatically eliminated.
HARVARD GETS IN
The Crimson can keep it simple stupid.
The only path to a Championship series berth is to sweep Dartmouth and hope that Columbia wins no more than one against Cornell.
Anything less than a sweep of the Big Green means that Harvard’s 2018 season, the best it has had in more than a decade, is over, and that the Crimson’s first Ivy title since 2005 will have to wait another year.
“Coming into the year, there was a different feel [than in the past],” junior first baseman Pat McColl said. “We had a lot of talent and we had the chance to be good. Coming in, we definitely had those expectations. It’s always good to be playing for something the last weekend.”
PREVIEWING HARVARD – DARTMOUTH
O’Donnell Field, under a forecast of cool, partly-cloudy, rain-free weather, will be the site of Harvard’s most important series of the year on Sunday and Monday.
After a long two-week break for final exams, the Crimson will head back out to the for a crucial three-game set with Dartmouth.
Harvard hopes that the friendly confines can will the Crimson to a three-game sweep of the Big Green—Harvard is 4-2 at home and Dartmouth is 5-16-1 away from Hanover, N.H.
On the other hand, the Big Green is likely the second-hottest team in the conference. Dartmouth is on a five-game win streak and has won six of its last seven.
Moreover, the way the Big Green has dispatched of its opponents of late is downright scary—it routed Middlebury, 12-1, on Wednesday, and outscored Princeton by a combined score of 36-6 over a three-game sweep last weekend.
“We know, coming in, that Dartmouth is going to be a good team,” McColl said. “So we’ll be ready.”
The Crimson, on the other hand, has been good, but not that overpowering. Harvard is coming off an error-filled series loss against Cornell and a sweep against Princeton in the last two weeks.
Importantly, the team has had an extended chance to catch its breath after a flurry of games to end April. The Crimson looks to use the extended two-week rest to put on a good showing as it tries to qualify for the Championship series.
“Game one’s always really important,” said Skinner of the keys to the series. “We’re focused on the first one right now…we want to come out strong.”
To try and slow Dartmouth, Harvard will likely tab its best two pitchers to start the first two games—senior righty Noah Zavolas, who threw a no-hitter earlier this season, and junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a strikeout machine on the mound.

Both hurlers sport a sub-3.00 ERA, with Zavolas sitting at 2.81 and Rosenblum-Larson at 2.84. They’ve worked 64.0 and 57.0 innings, respectively, numbers that lead the team.
The Crimson pitching staff will look to limit a Dartmouth offense spearheaded by junior Sean Sullivan and sophomore Blake Crossing, who lead the team with .320+ batting averages and .435+ on-base percentages.
Moreover, just behind them lurk senior Dustin Shirley and sophomore Michael Calamari, sluggers who’ve hit a combined nine homers on the year and sport .430+ slugging percentages. The duo has also driven in a combined 53 runs.
Harvard’s usual suspects on offense, however, match up just as well on the stat sheet.
McColl and junior outfielder P.J. Robinson have combined for 60 RBI. Robinson, in particular, leads all players in the series with a meaty .487 SLG%. He also joins junior Skinner as the only Crimson players with an OBP% of over .400.
Senior Matt Rothenberg, potentially playing in his final games in a Harvard jersey, caught fire awhile ago, hitting an 11-for-20 hot streak before going 2-for-11 in Ithaca.
Sophomore two-way player Hunter Bigge, sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson, senior outfielder Austin Black, and junior catcher Jake Allen will look to join the team’s category leaders in leading the offense this weekend. Freshmen Buddy Mrowka and Tommy Seidl, important role-players this year, are also in the core mix that carries the team.
Harvard will honor its graduating seniors—Zavolas, Rothenberg, Black, pitcher Garrett Rupp, and captain John Fallon—before the second game on Sunday.
“We’ve got some nice weather and a chance to see the boys get a couple W’s,” Skinner said. “We would love to see a lot of students out there [at O’Donnell Field]. We’ve got a pretty big fanbase…we’re expecting standing-room only.”
McColl echoed that sentiment.
“It’ll be nice being at home,” McColl said. “The weather has finally flipped, so this’ll be one of the best weekends. We have an all-grass field, so it definitely benefits us.”
“We’ll see how many people we can get out there. It’s going to be fun, competitive baseball, and it’ll be meaningful. If anyone can come out, it’s going to be good weather, and it’ll be a fun time.”
