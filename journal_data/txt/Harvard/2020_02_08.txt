After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 9, the Academy Awards will announce its 2020 list of winners. As far as nominations go, “Joker” leads the pack with 11, followed closely by “1917,” “The Irishman,” and “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood” with 10 apiece. “Marriage Story,” “Little Women” and “Parasite” all received six nominations. Here is a complete analysis of the 17 categories eligible for live action feature films (see a breakdown of Best Picture odds here). Who will win? Who should win?
Best Director
Bong Joon-ho (“Parasite”), Sam Mendes (“1917”), Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”), and Quentin Tarantino (“Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood”) were all shoo-in nominees after being recognized at the Golden Globes, the Critics Choice Awards, the British Academy (BAFTAs), and the Directors Guild of America (DGA). But the door was open for a fifth film. Enter Todd Phillips, whose “Joker” was the second worst reviewed film (by aggregators) to receive a Best Director nomination in the 21st century. It’s a baffling pick to say the least, considering 2019 offered a plethora of incredible options.
But regardless of who was nominated, Best Director is shaping up to be an inevitable win for Sam Mendes for his real-time, one-take World War I phenom “1917.” Mendes won the DGA, BAFTA, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (also sharing the Critics Choice Award with Bong Joon-ho). The DGA win in itself makes Mendes a frontrunner: The DGA has predicted the Academy Award winner correctly 17 of the last 20 times, with exceptions including Steven Soderbergh winning the Oscar in 2000 over Ang Lee and Roman Polanski winning in 2002 over Rob Marshall. The last time someone lost Best Director at the Academy Awards after winning the Critics Choice, Golden Globes, DGAs, and BAFTAs was Ben Affleck for “Argo” (2011), when Affleck was snubbed from an Academy Award nomination. One can argue that Bong Joon-ho deserves the award for helming the original satire-thriller masterpiece “Parasite,” or Martin Scorsese for his elegiac, introspective “The Irishman,” but Best Director is Sam Mendes’ to lose.
Should win: Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”) or Bong Joon-ho (“Parasite”)
Will win: Sam Mendes (“1917”)
Best Actor 
This awards season started as a conversation between two favorites: Adam Driver’s subtlety in “Marriage Story” and Joaquin Phoenix’s showy physicality in “Joker.” But Phoenix swept the Golden Globes, Critics Choice, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards (the largest voting branch of the Academy), and the BAFTAs. The last time an actor lost the Academy Award after clearing house like that was Russell Crowe (“A Beautiful Mind”), who lost to Denzel Washington (“Training Day”) at the 2002 Oscars. Crowe lost an insurmountable lead in 2002 due to special circumstances — circumstances that won’t perturb Phoenix (who has yet to win an Academy Award over the course of four nominations).
Should win: Adam Driver (“Marriage Story”)
Will win: Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker”)
Best Actress
Pundits have penciled in Best Actress as Renée Zellweger’s (“Judy”) award since her film’s premiere at the Telluride Film Festival. There is simply too much narrative to avoid Zellweger; “Judy” marks her prestige drama comeback as the actress receives her first Academy Award nomination after being nominated back-to-back-to-back from 2002 to 2004. It will also give the Academy an opportunity to honor Hollywood legend Judy Garland, whom Zellweger plays, since Garland herself never won an Oscar. Like Phoenix, Zellweger won at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, SAGs, and BAFTAs, so it would be a surprise if the Oscar went to anyone else. But if there is an upset, the second place on most ballots should be Scarlett Johansson for “Marriage Story.”
Should win: Renée Zellweger (“Judy”)
Will win: Renée Zellweger (“Judy”)
Best Supporting Actor
Tom Hanks (“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”) finally scored a delayed nomination after being snubbed for “Captain Phillips,” “Saving Mr. Banks,” “Sully,” and “The Post.” In “The Irishman,” Joe Pesci returned from retirement with arguably the best role of his career as the quietly powerful mob boss Russell Bufalino, and Al Pacino redeemed his late career with an electric performance as Jimmy Hoffa. But look for Brad Pitt to steal the award for a charismatic (arguably leading) role as Cliff Booth in “Once Upon A Time … In Hollywood.” All other nominees (including esteemed British thespian Anthony Hopkins) have received Oscars before, but Pitt hasn't, and the Academy often hands out Supporting Actor wins like lifetime achievement awards. Pitt also swept awards season, and he is in a firm position to take home his first acting Oscar on Sunday.
Should win: Joe Pesci (“The Irishman”)
Will win: Brad Pitt (“Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood”)
Best Supporting Actress
This is Laura Dern’s award to lose. Her performance in “Marriage Story” already won at the BAFTAs, SAGs, Critics Choice, and Golden Globes. This is the first year since the first Critics Choice Awards in 1995 where the four major awards bodies leading up to the Academy Awards have been unanimous in their acting picks. However, Laura Dern is also the most likely to be upset, because she’s nominated in the same category as Scarlett Johansson for “Jojo Rabbit” in a year where Johansson is double nominated (a feat that has only happened 12 times in Academy Award history). It wouldn’t be a total shock to see Johansson get some love in the Supporting Actress category, but it would be a historic upset.
Should win: Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”)
Will win: Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”)
Best Adapted Screenplay
Tasked with a script that cuts between five decades and balances a dozen characters, Steven Zaillian’s "The Irishman" screenplay achieves the impossible: It maintains thematic consistency within a three-and-a-half hour mob epic. However, after snubbing Greta Gerwig for a directing nomination, there is momentum for the Academy to recognize her in any category it can, even though her screenplay wasn't nominated at the Golden Globes. But even Gerwig's newfound drive was short-lived, and her screenplay for "Little Women" only won at Critics Choice. "Jojo Rabbit'' has surged in the past week with back-to-back wins at the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and BAFTA. The winner at the WGAs for Best Adapted Screenplay has gone on to win the Oscar 13 of the last 20 times.
Should win: Steven Zaillian (“The Irishman”)
Will win: Taika Waititi (“Jojo Rabbit”)
Best Original Screenplay
The intricacies of Noah Baumbach’s "Marriage Story" screenplay help wield extremely personable characters. Its success lies in its thought-out, well developed details, which flesh out the tiniest personality traits into believable character tropes. Unfortunately, "Marriage Story" has so far been overlooked in awards consideration, and it hasn't won a single major screenplay award. Instead, this year's awards season produced two favorites: Quentin Tarantino for "Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood," which won the Golden Globe and the Critics Choice Award, and Bong Joon-ho for "Parasite," which won at the WGAs and the BAFTAs. There is an overlap in the voting bodies of both the WGA and BAFTA with the Academy, but no overlap with the Globes or Critics Choice. There's also a caveat: “Parasite” won the WGA, but “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” was not eligible. Still, the winner at the WGAs for Best Original Screenplay went on to win the Oscar 14 of the last 20 times, and there is so much upward momentum for "Parasite" (which also won the SAG Best Ensemble award and shared Best Director at the Critics Choice) that it might well edge out "Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood" in an unpredictable race.

Should win: Noah Baumbach (“Marriage Story”)
Will win: Bong Joon-ho (“Parasite”)
Best International Feature Film
"Parasite" is going to win this award: It's the biggest lock of the night.

Should win: “Parasite”
Will win: “Parasite”
Best Cinematography
Roger Deakins winning Best Cinematography for "1917" is almost as sure a lock as "Parasite" winning Best International Film. Deakins exploded into a runaway lead, and deservingly so. From impeccably controlled lighting over unnaturally long takes to innovative camera rigs that maximize intricate set designs, his work in “1917” pushes the limits of what's possible in the cinematic medium.
Should win: Roger Deakins (“1917”)
Will win: Roger Deakins (“1917”)
Best Film Editing
Editing is an ingrained part of the storytelling in “The Irishman,” which is complete with voiceovers, exaggerated whips, and freeze frames which illustrate three-time Academy Award winner Thelma Schoonmaker’s style within her long standing collaboration with Scorsese. However, the American Cinema Editors (ACE) awards matched 15 of the last 20 Best Film Editing Oscar winners, and this year they selected “Jojo Rabbit” for comedy and “Parasite” for Drama. Editing is looking more and more like a prize for “Parasite,” which is perfectly paced and features pristinely timed montages. “Ford v Ferrari” also has some upset potential after winning at the BAFTAs.
Should Win: Thelma Schoonmaker (“The Irishman”)
Will Win: Yang Jin-mo (“Parasite”)
Best Original Score
Randy Newman’s deeply melodic tones sing of heartbreak and hum sweetly in your head long after "Marriage Story" concludes. “Marriage Story” soars largely due to this series of lullabies laced with nostalgic familiarity that made audiences fall head first for Baumbach’s witty characters. In stark contrast, Thomas Newman’s rhythmic percussion controls the tempo of war epic “1917": It helps breathe the relentless war experience to life on the big screen. While both scores excel in attaining their respective goals, the Academy is likely to lean towards the technically superb “1917,” even though most awards bodies have awarded Hildur Guðnadóttir's “Joker.” This is because Thomas Newman has been nominated 15 times with no wins, and the Academy has a habit of balancing out winners.
Should win: Randy Newman (“Marriage Story”) or Thomas Newman (“1917”)
Will win: Thomas Newman (“1917”)
Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing
Sound editing does not mean sound mixing. It just so happens that the Academy often treats them as the same. Sound editing is the manipulation of individual sounds, while sound mixing is how those sounds are interwoven. Both categories are down to two frontrunners: "Ford v Ferrari" and "1917." Both are technical masterpieces, but the Academy frequently awards the film that will end up with more wins, and in this case, that means "1917" (which recently won the award at the BAFTAs).
Should win: “Ford v Ferrari” or "1917"
Will win: “1917”
Best Production Design
Production Design is down to three frontrunners: "Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood," which recreates 1960s tinseltown to nostalgic perfection, "1917," which relies on meticulous planning to create sets measured to the actors' very steps to preserve the one-take illusion, and "Parasite," which built everything from the ground up, including the clever design of the two-levelled house. But "Parasite" has an edge here; the house is almost a character in the film, as it plays such an integral part of the plot. It also won the Art Directors Guild (ADG) award for Production Design for a Contemporary Feature Film, a branch that overlaps with the Academy. But "Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood" won at the ADGs for Production Design for a Period Film, and no one apprecaiates Hollywood production design more than Hollywood professionals.
Should win: “1917”
Will win: “Parasite” or "Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood"
Best Makeup and Hairstyling
This award has "Bombshell" written all over it after it swept at the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards (which overlaps with Academy voters) with three wins in three nominations. It's the only award that "Bombshell" is in serious contention for, and the use of makeup and prosthetics to transform Charlize Theron into Megyn Kelly alone probably deserves an Oscar.
Should win: “Bombshell”
Will win: “Bombshell”
Best Visual Effects
It's incredible to think this might be the only category that Martin Scorsese's mob epic will walk away with at the end of the awards ceremony. The de-aging technology from Industrial Light and Magic was truly revolutionary work, and the Academy frequently awards prestige films in this category over blockbusters. De-aging was a poignant part of the story in "The Irishman" in a way that it simply wasn't for other nominees. It also won two awards in two nominations at the Visual Effects Society Awards.
Should win: “The Irishman”
Will win: “The Irishman”
Best Costume Design 
While the Costume Designers Guild chose to select "Jojo Rabbit," it's also important to realize that they somehow managed to snub "Little Women" for a nomination. It's possible that Gerwig's film was released too late for voters, but with "Little Women" nominated in the Academy and picking up a win at the BAFTAs, it's on a good pace to win at the Oscars too.
Should win: “Little Women”
Will win: “Little Women”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health professor Michael J. Grusby will step down from the three top administrative posts he holds at the school this month, Dean Michelle A. Williams announced in an email to School of Public Health affiliates Friday.
Grusby currently serves as the Executive Dean for Administration, acting dean for academic Affairs, and Senior Vice Dean for Institutional Planning and Policy. His departure from all three roles comes after a Crimson investigation last month found that faculty repeatedly weighed voting no confidence in Williams, citing a toxic culture perpetuated by her and Grusby.
Grusby will take a sabbatical starting this month, according to Williams’s email. He remains a professor of molecular immunology at the school.
Professor of Health Decision Science Jane J. Kim will take over permanently as Dean of Academic Affairs, effective Monday, per the announcement. Kim has served as a co-chair of the Faculty Council and of the Committee on the Advancement of Women Faculty. She has also been a member of the school’s Committee on Education Policy and the steering committee of the Zhu Family Center for Global Cancer Prevention.
Katherine A. “Katie” Hope — the school’s chief financial officer since 2011 — will fill the role of Executive Dean for Administration.
The announcement makes no mention of a new Senior Vice Dean for Institutional Planning and Policy — a position created under Williams’s deanship.
In February 2018, Williams announced that Grusby would serve as acting Dean for Academic Affairs in an “interim period” as she sought a permanent dean. He served in the role for nearly two years.
In his three administrative roles, Grusby concurrently managed finances, administrative offices like human resources, and academic affairs. Some senior faculty said they found his large portfolio concerning because they believe the role of the academic dean should be to serve as a check and balance to the school’s dean on behalf of the faculty.
Additionally, current and former faculty, staff, and administrators told The Crimson that they did not feel comfortable bringing complaints to human resources because Grusby oversaw it, and that they had broader concerns about his treatment of faculty and staff, which they perceived as demeaning and disrespectful.
In November 2019, a group of nine anonymous junior faculty emailed a letter to former University of Michigan Public Health Dean Kenneth E. Warner, who chairs the Harvard School of Public Health’s visiting committee, expressing concerns about Grusby’s behavior, management style, and “large amounts of power.”
They added that they believed a vote of no confidence in Williams — who they said had failed to address perceived issues — may have been the “only recourse” to address their concerns.
In her email to affiliates, Williams praised Grusby’s “significant contributions to the leadership of the Dean’s office,” citing “multimillion dollar cost savings” he brought about by reducing compliance risks, his launch of the “groundbreaking” Apple Women’s Health Study, and his efforts to reduce food insecurity among School of Public Health affiliates.
“Michael has been a valued colleague, offering knowledgeable insights, wise counsel, and successful, effective implementation strategies as we support and advance Harvard Chan’s research, teaching, and communication,” Williams wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The free throw seemed like a formality, the next blow in what felt destined to become a crushing Harvard loss. Azar Swain had just done the impossible: with his Yale Bulldogs down by four points with a few ticks shy of six seconds to go and inbounding the ball from under their own basket, he raced up the court, threw his body into the defending Rio Haskett to draw a foul, and launched a prayer… that was somehow answered, with an assist from the backboard.
All Swain — who had converted his first eight attempts from the charity stripe — had to do to complete the four-point play and send the game to overtime was make a free throw. But the Crimson’s streak of heartbreaking losses would not reach three, as Swain’s free throw clanged off the front rim and out, stunning what seconds before had been a raucous Yale crowd and allowing Harvard to escape Payne Whitney Gymnasium with a 78-77 victory on Friday evening.
In many ways, this game was the mirror image of last weekend’s near-comebacks against Penn and Princeton. Then, the Crimson (14-6, 3-2 Ivy) fought back valiantly from two daunting deficits and fell just short. Friday, Yale (16-5, 4-1) never led but clawed back from two separate double-digit deficits, including a 13-point chasm with five minutes to play. The Bulldogs came ever so close to tying the game, but this time it was Harvard who would earn a crucial victory.
“We are putting ourselves in these 50-50 positions,” senior guard Christian Juzang said. “If [Swain] makes that free throw, we’re going to overtime and it’s a 50-50 game. We just have to work on closing games, especially on the road, and building towards that full 40 [minutes]. I’m proud of how we fought. I think we were deserving for most of the game, but I think we’re a step closer. I think that’s a mistake we won’t make again going down the stretch so I’d rather knock it out now than in the tournament.”
Swain nearly robbed the Crimson of its big win. It was bombs away in the second half for the diminutive junior guard, who is capable of scoring a lot of points in a hurry. He scored Yale’s first eight points of the second half, punctuated by a deep step-back three to cut Harvard’s lead to eight. And he was not done, either. Time after time, Harvard threatened to put the game away, and the Brockton, Mass., native always had an answer. Swain’s 27 second half points came on 11 shots and his four made threes in the period ranged from difficult to — most obviously when Haskett gave him that bump — seemingly impossible.
Before the unthinkable near four-point play, though, it appeared that the Crimson had done just enough to lock up a win against the Ivy League’s leaders. Twice in the last 1:10, the Bulldogs sent Juzang to the line with Harvard up by two. Juzang had missed a few free throws late in a tight win over Dartmouth a few weeks ago and then had stayed in the gym after that game working on his stroke from the charity stripe. The work paid off, as Juzang hit all four free throws, twice extending the Crimson’s lead back to four.
“In my mind, there are very few people I’d choose over [Juzang], if any, in a pressure free throw situation,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “He was dialed in and I had all the confidence in the world that he was going to bury them.”
But Juzang’s clutch free throws sandwiched two misses from the line from sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood, including one on the front end of a one-and-one, giving Yale just the slightest chance to get back on level terms.
Kirkwood was otherwise exceptional again, following up his efficient 21-point performance against Princeton last Saturday with a team-leading 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting. In the absence of senior guard Bryce Aiken, who remains out with an ankle injury and did not travel with the team this weekend, Kirkwood has continued to look like Harvard’s best offensive option and the one the Crimson goes to for a bucket when it needs one.
Against a defense that coming in was statistically best in the Ivy League, Harvard’s offense was humming for most of the game’s first 35 minutes, especially at the end of the first half, when a scalding seven minute stretch in which it connected on 10 of its 12 attempts, including four of its five from long range, and scored 24 points, stretching the lead to 13 at halftime.
“We played a tremendous basketball game against a tremendous team, and so we’re very proud of it, very happy with it,” Amaker said. “We recognize how devastating that could have been if that didn’t turn out the way it did, but having said that we did a lot of good things prior to that last possession."
The Crimson, which ranks near the bottom of college basketball in assist rate, notched 23 assists, seven more than its previous season high. Juzang led the way with a season-high nine helpers, continuing what has been a remarkable midseason turn of events for the senior. Relegated to a bit part for much of the first part of the season, Juzang has filled in as the starting point guard in Aiken’s stead admirably, no more so than Friday.
Juzang and Kirkwood were joined in double figures by junior forward Danilo Djuricic, who scored a season-high 17 points, and senior forward Robert Baker, who added 10. Djuricic’s points came on just nine shots and always seemed to come at vital moments of the game. It was an assertive Djuricic drive and tough reverse layup that forced Yale out of the zone they briefly turned to in order to jar Harvard out of its rhythm.
“My teammates got me in great positions to score the ball and on back cuts, when I was driving in and would make a cut, they were looking for me tonight,” Djuricic said. “So I was just going to go in there and try and go in strong and either draw a foul or finish the bucket. So credit to my teammates for finding me in position to score.”
As is often the case, Baker made his biggest impact on the defensive end. The Crimson outscored Yale by 13 points in the 25 minutes he played thanks largely to his three blocks and numerous contests at the rim. His versatility became apparent when, after Swain tried to exploit what he thought to be a mismatch, Baker stayed with the speedy guard and blocked his jumper, springing Kirkwood the other way for a layup and extending Harvard’s first half lead to 12 points.
Despite Baker’s defensive impact, the Bulldogs managed to stay in the game thanks largely to their two junior stars. They got almost 80 percent of their scoring from Swain and junior big man Paul Atkinson, who poured in 28 points on hyper-efficient 11-16 shooting. It was Atkinson who kept Yale in the game in the first half. He was the only Bulldog to score in the game’s first six minutes and ended the half with 17 of their 32 points.
The Crimson had a difficult time dealing with Yale’s 6’10” forward, who has nearly doubled his per game scoring from last season. All too often, Atkinson received the ball deep in the paint and needed only to lay the ball in or, on one occasion, throw down a monstrous dunk. He got all three of the bigs tasked with defending him — Chris Lewis, Mason Forbes, and Baker — into foul trouble, and Lewis in particular was often outmatched on both ends, committing four fouls in his 23 minutes and finishing with just four points.
Atkinson’s only blemish on the night proved costly to Yale in the end. A decent 71 percent free throw shooter on the year, he nonetheless looked uncomfortable at the line throughout, especially in the first half. The Florida native hit just one of his six first half free throws, and most of the misses were ugly. He steadied himself in the second half, connecting on five of his six attempts as Harvard continued to have no choice but to send him to the line, but the damage had been done.
Yale’s loss was its first at home this season. The Bulldogs entered the game as healthy favorites, having won six straight games — including their first four Ivy League games — by double-digits. But they again struggled to defeat the Crimson on their home court, losing for the eighth time in nine years.
“We just came together,” Juzang said. “I think it showed a lot about all five of us on the court and the bench still being involved. I’m really proud of the guys the way that we were able to weather those storms and bounce back with our own runs and big plays.”
The victory keeps Harvard from falling below .500 in the Ivy League for the first time since 2016. The Crimson will look to follow up this remarkable win with another one Saturday at Brown in the last game of Harvard’s four game road trip. The Crimson then returns home next weekend for its first meetings with Cornell and Columbia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard dealt Yale its first loss in Ivy League play this season at Lavietes Pavilion Friday evening, surpassing the Bulldogs by a final score of 66-57 in a game that featured four competitive quarters of action.
Making an infrequent appearance in the Crimson’s (12-6; 3-2 Ivy) starting lineup, co-captain and junior forward Rachel Levy led Harvard’s charge against Yale (14-4; 4-1 Ivy) on both ends of the court. In 34 minutes of play — the most Levy has ever played in one game for the Crimson — she did it all.
Levy grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds, nine of which were on the offensive end, and notched 14 points. She fired up her teammates by diving on the ground for loose balls, chasing down and rejecting Yale players at the hoop, and drawing a charge.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith described Levy’s performance as “immense.”
“I felt she was a junior captain and she was going to carry the team, and I thought she was great in both ends of the floor,” Delaney-Smith said.
Levy found herself in the starting lineup after her co-captain, senior guard Mackenzie Barta, sustained an injury against Princeton last weekend that prevented her from suiting up against Yale.
“Playing without ‘Kenzie is really hard. I think we all wanted to show up this weekend and give a little bit more just for that reason and play for her,” Levy said. “I know that's definitely weighing heavy on my mind. I just wanted to go out and remember the game could be taken away at any point, and it kind of just motivated me to go out and crash hard. Do everything hard. Just play because I love the sport.”
Levy said her teammates shared her sense of urgency.
“I think everybody came out really intense and ready to go,” she said. “Everybody's ready to step up and that's awesome. I think we're going to win a lot of games with a different game plan. We’re going deeper into the bench.”
Junior guard Matilda Salen contributed off of the bench for the Crimson Friday evening. Salen gave maximum effort in her 17 minutes of playing time, grabbing 5 rebounds, scoring a basket, and tallying a steal. Hot off the bench in the first quarter, Salen grabbed a defensive rebound, dished the basketball to a teammate ahead of her, and sprinted to the opposite end of the court. Trailing the play, she cut back door, caught the basketball, and layed it in off the glass.
“[Matilda’s] been stepping up so much this season, and it's so great to see,” Levy said. “She comes in and she's a huge defensive asset for us. And there's no question when she's on the court. I know she's a hustler. I know she's a player and she's gonna have my back if I get beat, she's gonna have everybody's back. And she's gonna crash hard. She's a really dependable player.”
Going into the game, Harvard knew Yale would defend the Crimson in a high pressure woman-to-woman defense, just like other teams have been doing all season.
On Friday night, Harvard was ready.
The Crimson capitalized on Yale’s high pressure by attacking the paint. Out of position, Bulldog players struggled to get between Harvard players and the hoop. As a result, the Crimson staked out an 18-8 lead to finish the first quarter, scoring almost all of its points exclusively from inside the paint.
Yale made inroads in the second quarter, however. Bulldog players offered a glimpse of how they’ve managed to rise to the top of the Ivy League leaderboard: they engaged Harvard players by aggressively attacking the paint and then dished to their teammates who caught the basketball wide open in front of the rim. Yale’s No. 2 Camilla Emsbo, who stands at 6 feet 5 inches, laid in 8 of the Bulldog’s 23 points in the second quarter. Harvard answered with only 11 points of its own, which put the Crimson down by a basket heading into the locker room at halftime.
In the third quarter, freshman guard Lola Mullaney fueled the Crimson’s surge on offense, just as she has done numerous times this season. In the quarter alone, Mullaney contributed 12 points. She erased Harvard’s deficit on multiple occasions by finishing at the rim, maneuvering passed her opponents and cradling the basketball to successfully get to the hoop. In addition to scoring in the paint, Mullaney knocked down two consecutive triples to give the Crimson a lead. Mullaney eventually finished with 19 points.
Harvard went into the fourth quarter ahead by one point. When the final buzzer sounded, the Crimson had surpassed Yale by nine points and had tarnished the Bulldogs' perfect conference record.
With five minutes to play in the game, senior forward Jeannie Boehm rolled toward the hoop off of a screen for Mullaney and caught the basketball at the left short corner of the floor. She immediately went to work in the paint, backing down her defender, Emsbo, who, off rhythm, stumbled to the ground. With her left hand, Boehm floated the ball into the hoop to put Harvard up by five points, sealing the Crimson’s victory.
Tomorrow afternoon, Harvard will host Brown, who has yet to win a game in Ancient Eight competition this season. The Crimson has won 15 of its last 17 games against the Bears. Tip off is scheduled for 4 p.m. at Lavietes Pavilion.
