After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not inevitable that every new story of drug running be compared to “Breaking Bad,” but Ridley Scott’s latest film “The Counselor” starts from a place of similarity: it traces the tragic consequences for an entrant in the amphetamine trade. But beyond the premise, the film’s contrasts with the AMC series are more revealing. “Counselor” takes place not in the suburbs, but in the glitzy enclaves of the ultra-rich, of Ferrari Californias rather than Pontiacs. Its morally tarnished central character, played magnetically by Michael Fassbender, does not dominate the film. Most importantly, it’s not plot-driven—“The Counselor” is a grossly stylish thriller that makes up for story deficiencies with its visuals, dialogue, and performances.
 
Fassbender’s character, a lawyer called only “counselor,” wants to settle down with his girlfriend (Penélope Cruz), but his Bentley and palatial house are beyond his means. He goes into business with eccentric drug-runners Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt) as well as Reiner’s paramour Malkina (Cameron Diaz), and when their shipment is seized by a Mexican cartel, all hell breaks loose. The film concludes with painful but predictable repercussions for the criminals—it’s a straightforward morality tale with no plot twists.
 
The story, though, is the least consideration of the script, the first written for the big screen by Cormac McCarthy. The Pulitzer-winning novelist won his mainstream fame from the bleak landscapes of “No Country for Old Men” and “The Road,” but here his imagery has gone gaudily wild. Feast your eyes on Reiner’s multicolored suits and Tyler Durden sunglasses, Malkina’s chunky jewelry and cheetah-print tattoos, her live cheetah pets’ rhinestone collars—the film’s super-saturated tableaux make every scene engaging. The costume designers deserve great credit, as do Scott and the music supervisors, who pair cartel killings with hip-hop and throbbing club beats for a entrancingly hedonistic vibe.
 
McCarthy’s dialogue is just as remarkable. He’s funny, upping the playful chaos with unexpected one-liners. Reiner’s description of a peculiar sex act—supported by Bardem’s superb comic timing—ends with a flabbergasted Reiner uttering, “You see a thing like that, it changes you” and is one of the most brazen pieces of humor writing in recent film.
 
The script alternates clever, tense tête-à-tête conversations with astonishing monologues, which would feel long-winded were they not so lyrically masterful. These are what makes “The Counselor” exceptional—McCarthy’s grand themes of hubris and inhumanity take precedence over insubstantial plot. The piece de resistance of the monologues, on grief, and Pitt’s line “If your definition of a friend is someone who’d die for you, you don’t have any friends” reflect on isolation. As the counselor gets desperate, McCarthy brings in religion’s inability to help, the counselor’s expletives of “Jesus!” and “God!” sounding more useless the more he repeats them.
 
The performers are up to McCarthy’s lines, and they wonderfully play up their characters’ eccentricities. Bardem is clownish as Reiner, shrugging and bouncing around; Pitt is less impressive as the guarded Westray, but he’s still charmingly cagey. Diaz alone falls short: as Malkina, her femme fatale performance works only when forced theatricality seems part of the character, and her flat delivery makes McCarthy’s richer lines sound like recitations to a class.
 
Best of all is Fassbender, though, in a performance of emotional highs and lows. He sometimes affects the unsettling neutrality that has become his trademark, but McCarthy’s script also has him let desperate tears trickle and burst into bitter, shivering sobs. Fassbender happy is a rarer treat in his filmography, and never has he been more disarmingly giddy than in a romantic moment with Cruz’s character. It’s a magnificent performance—but he does not awkwardly overshadow his co-stars (see: “X-Men: First Class”).
 
In the director’s chair, Scott steers clear of grittiness. The camerawork is fluid and precise. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski excels in smooth, vast flyover shots of cities; on the small scale, his close-ups capture characters’ faces perfectly in his narrow depth of field. From auto-body workshops and dirty Ciudad Juárez streets, Scott frames moving paintings, compositions that evenly balance each stray dog and streetlamp. The film is beautiful—a striking aesthetic for a contemporary drug thriller.
 
Such unconventionality is what makes “The Counselor” great. It eschews the complex plotting and urban realism of so many films of its genre, replacing them with gorgeous cinematography, heady monologues on love and death, and zany characters. The film is like a diamond its central character examines in an early scene—sparkling, though not flawless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Two decades after the premiere of “Power Rangers” defined the childhood of millions, the show is still airing new episodes, but everyone knows the best episodes aired in the ‘90s. These classic episodes are still around thanks to the wonder of Netflix. In honor of the children’s show’s 20th anniversary, here are the “Power Rangers” series of the '90s ranked in order of awesomeness.

 
5. “Power Rangers Zeo”Aired: 1996Zords: ZeozordsKey Villains: Rita Repulsa, Lord ZeddSpecial Ranger: The Gold Ranger
 
Don’t really remember this particular season? You’re not the only one. Despite the fact that “Zeo” retained most of the cast from the previous season, “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,” the series was lackluster due to a dearth of memorable new villains or Zords.
 
4. “Power Rangers Lost Galaxy”Aired: 1999Zords: Galactabeasts (Lion, Condor, Gorilla, Wolf, and Wildcat)Key Villains: Trakeena, Psycho Rangers
 
The last series to air before the new millenium, “Lost Galaxy” marked a decline in the quality of the series because of a lack of familiarity. Few actors from the previous season, “Power Rangers in Space,” returned, and except for the Psycho Rangers, all of the villains were new and unexceptional. Even the Power Rangers’ mentor Zordon was absent from “Lost Galaxy” because he died in the season finale of “In Space.”
 
3. “Power Rangers Turbo”Aired: 1997Zords: Turbozords (Red Lightning, Mountain Blaster, Desert Thunder, Dune Star, and Wind Chaser)Key Villains: Divatox, General HavocSpecial Ranger: The Phantom Ranger
 
This season of the “Power Rangers” was characterized by a zaniness that was best exemplified by the episode in which the Rangers were baked into a giant pizza. “Turbo” improved on “Zeo” and set the stage for the stellar “Power Rangers in Space.”
 
2. “Power Rangers In Space”Aired: 1998Zords: Mega VehiclesKey Villains: Psycho Rangers, Astronema, Darkonda, EcliptorSpecial Ranger: The Silver Ranger
 
This was the season that sealed the fate of “Power Rangers” rip-off “Big Bad Beetleborgs,” and it’s easy to see why. A huge improvement over “Zeo” and “Turbo,” “In Space” was a classic season that featured interesting new villains as well as a darker tone that blurred the line between good and evil. Especially effective was the revelation that the season’s main antagonist Astronema was the Red Ranger’s sister.
 
1. “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers”Aired: 1993-1995Zords: Dinozords, Thunderzords, and NinjazordsKey Villains: Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd, Goldan, Ivan Ooze (from “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie”)Special Ranger: The White Ranger
 
You just can’t beat the original. “Power Rangers in Space” came close, but the original Rangers made their way into our hearts and they've stayed there. The first series had everything a child (and arguably an adult) could want: humor, action, high school students with superpowers who fought monsters in their free time. Everything in this series was on point: the Zords, the villains, the battles. Even the movie had all of the hallmark awesomeness of the series as a whole.

UPDATED: Oct. 26, 2013, at 12:43 p.m.
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences will seek to raise $2.5 billion in its portion of The Harvard Campaign, FAS campaign co-chair Carl J. Martignetti ’81 announced to hundreds of alumni, donors, and affiliates gathered at an official launch event Saturday morning in Sanders Theatre. 
That goal, which comprises a little more than a third of the record-breaking $6.5 billion the University hopes to raise in the coming years, makes The Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences the largest subset of the overall fundraising effort.
Martignetti told the crowd that the campaign has already raised just over $1 billion to date from 93,000 individual gifts, meaning that the average gift has been almost $11,000. 
“[The FAS goal] is very ambitious by any measure,” Martignetti said. “[The future] is right there for the taking, at our fingertips—the chance to move Harvard to a whole other level, a whole other place.”
Reflecting on FAS’s educational mission in the morning’s keynote address, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith told attendees that in the face of disruptive technology, the personal exchange of ideas must remain paramount to the Harvard experience. To that end, Smith said that the FAS campaign’s six priorities—Financial Aid, House Renewal and the Student Experience, Leading in Learning, Faculty and Our Scholarly Enterprise, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Dean’s Leadership Fund—represent “our heritage and our future.” 
Each priority, he said, “has a simple concept at its heart: making sure Harvard continues as a place of discovery for people leading positive change in the world—scientists and scholars, poets and entrepreneurs.” 
While campaign leaders did not offer financial goals for each of the priorities during Saturday morning’s events, campaign literature distributed to attendees shows that FAS aims to bring in roughly $600 million for Financial Aid, $600 million to fund Faculty and Our Scholarly Enterprise, $500 million for House Renewal and the Student Experience (split between $400 million for the former and $100 million for the latter), $450 million for SEAS, $150 million to fund Leading in Learning, and another $250 million to fund the Dean’s Leadership Fund.
The campaign launch comes at a critical time for FAS. In the Dean’s Annual Report for academic year 2012-2013, which was released to faculty earlier this month, both Smith and Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 said that FAS has yet to fully recover from the damage inflicted by the financial crisis. Both administrators said that the body was looking towards the campaign as a source of sustainability for FAS.
“Our priorities are clear and urgent,” Smith said Saturday, adding later, “Our campaign makes the bet that place still matters, especially this unique place. We believe in the power of the chance meetings that occur every day across this campus. We believe in the power of direct engagement. People impact one another in truly profound ways—that is a truth across time.”
Though it remains the largest piece of the University’s total goal, FAS’s proportion of the overall funds has dipped slightly since the last University-wide campaign, which ran from 1994-1999. During that campaign, FAS was projected to account for a little more than 46 percent of total funds raised, compared to an expected 38 percent today. The 1990s campaign ultimately raised $1.1 billion for FAS.
In her own remarks Saturday, University President Drew G. Faust emphasized the centrality of FAS to the University’s mission and campaign, arguing that the body represents not only the Harvard’s history but the engine that drives it forward. 
“What we do here is about more than helping our students along a path they have defined for themselves,” Faust said. “In many ways, this campaign asks of us what we ask of our students: reach higher, dream bigger, and raise our sights even higher.” 
In addition to Smith, Faust, and Martignetti, attendees gathered in Sanders Theatre Saturday morning heard remarks from FAS campaign co-chairs Paul B. Edgerley, Sandra M. Edgerley ’84, Glenn H. Hutchins ’77.
After the event in Sanders, donors and other guests could choose to attend any one of a series of symposia hosted by faculty and administrators across campus. Topics for the symposia included residential life, financial aid, and digital education, among others. This weekend’s attendees were also invited to eat lunch in the Science Center Plaza, and then to attend the football game against Princeton.  
The weekend began with an invitation-only dinner Friday evening for donors and campaign organizers inside a heated tent in the Science Center Plaza.
Campaign planners were expecting roughly 1,000 alumni, administrators, donors, and other University affiliates to be in attendance for this weekend’s festivities, far more than the few hundred that were on hand for the University-wide launch Sept. 21.
This weekend’s celebration in Cambridge comes just two days after Harvard School of Public Health announced at a gala in downtown Boston that it will seek to raise $450 million in its own fundraising drive. At the launch, which was attended by supporters of the school, HSPH campaign co-chair Jonathan S. Lavine said that HSPH had already raised $167 million toward its goal. 
Other schools across the University are expected to roll out their own campaigns in the coming months.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard’s FAS campaign will fund the House renewal project’s full estimated pricetag of more than $1 billion. In fact, campaign funds are only expected to pay for $400 million of House renewal.

Laura Bellamy ’13 and Jillian Dempsey ’13, though finished with their playing careers in Harvard’s Bright-Landry Arena, are still carving marks into the ice of the Crimson’s hockey program.
Bellamy finished her senior season with a 0.92 goals-against average, the best single-season mark in Harvard history. She stands at No. 2 on Harvard’s all-time charts with 19 career shutouts.
Bellamy also led the Crimson to two NCAA tournaments and an Ivy League conference title, and was a 2012 ECAC Hockey Student-Athlete nominee.
Following the departure of head coach Katey Stone, who has left for this season to coach the USA women’s ice hockey team to the 2014 Winter Olympics, Bellamy was named an assistant coach for the Crimson squad.
Interim head coach Maura Crowell called Bellamy’s voice a fresh one and stated that she provided a unique outlook on the coaching staff.
“It’s a great resource for us in terms of even giving tours, what things she can point out, and things that she knows that we don’t necessarily know,” Crowell said. “Obviously, having played with 90 percent of the kids in the locker room gives us a real good look at personalities and motivations for different players, so that’s nice, because they are very comfortable [with her].”
Junior captain Marissa Gedman echoed the sentiment.
“It’s good because a lot of us feel so comfortable with her.  Just a familiar face—she knows the team; she knows how things work,” Gedman said.  “Not that [Crowell and Moore] don’t, but she’s just another asset to that coaching staff that’s unparalleled in the league just because that perspective is so rare.”
Junior forward Samantha Reber has watched Bellamy smoothly transition into her new role.
“We’re lucky, we’re beyond lucky,” she said. “Some would think that the adjustment would be tough, but it’s been great, and I think it was the best choice for our team.”
Bellamy jumped on the opportunity to obtain the coaching position.
“She acted fast about the job.  She was very interested in it,” Crowell said. “It worked out that she was the best candidate, and it’s been great.”
Gedman added that she is also excited to have a former teammate on the coaching staff.
“I can’t even put it into words,” Gedman said.  “As a teammate, she was awesome.  She was one of my best friends.  As a captain, I can’t think of anyone better for the job.  I obviously miss her as a friend, but as a coach she’s even better and she can totally handle it, which is really cool.”
Also now a recent graduate, Dempsey has not strayed far from Cambridge as a second-round selection in the CWHL draft for the Boston Blades. The former co-captain finished up her senior season as a three-time team MVP, netting 24 goals and dishing out 21 assists for 45 points total.
Dempsey ended her college career ninth on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list, and was a first-team selection for the All-Ivy League and All-ECAC hockey selection. Crowell expressed support for Dempsey, saying that the team members “know she’s going to be around.” Crowell added that she hopes the team will attend one of Dempsey’s Blades games this season.
“She’s such a great representative for our program and everything we want out of our players,” Crowell said.
Gedman added that “[Jillian] eats and breathes Harvard hockey, so it’s always nice to see her around.”
She also emphasized that the team would continue to cheer for her wherever she played.
“I know everyone is going to support her on the Blades, and I hope she makes a run at the next Olympics, so we’re all behind her for that,” Gedman said.
But the support goes in both directions.
“I know she’s going to come to the games because she’s still a huge supporter,” Reber said. “She’s always texting us and checking up on us, everything like that.”
Reber commended the two former players in general for everything they have brought and continue to bring to the team.
“They both were leaders on and off of the ice.  That was a huge part of their personalities and a reason why they were our captains last year,” Reber said.  “A lot of people look up to them still, so they’ve definitely left their mark on Harvard hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 13 seconds left in the 2012 Harvard-Princeton matchup, Tigers backup quarterback Quinn Epperly lobbed up a 36-yard pass that somehow found its way into wide receiver Roman Wilson’s hands to complete a stunning fourth-quarter comeback.
One year later, the duo would connect again to beat Harvard, but this time, Epperly would need three overtime periods to pull out another victory. After trading touchdowns, and then field goals, in the first two overtimes, the Princeton defense forced the Crimson to settle for a field goal. On the Tigers’ ensuing possession, Epperly found Wilson at the back of the end zone for the game-winning score.
"Roman was actually my second option, and he made it one heck of a play,” Epperly said.
The Crimson (5-1, 2-1 Ivy), led by junior quarterback Conner Hempel, back at the helm after missing two weeks due to injury, attempted to orchestrate another comeback after trailing the Tigers for much of the game, but it was to no avail as Princeton (5-1, 3-0 Ivy) triumphed again, 51-48, on Saturday at Harvard Stadium.
“We struggled at times on both sides of the ball, and it wasn’t a work of art, but our kids played so hard that we willed the thing to overtime,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “In the end, they just made one more play that won the game.”
At the end of the third quarter, Harvard suffered a huge loss when senior center David Leopard went down with the score tied at 28.
“He’s an All-Ivy caliber center,” Murphy said. “[Senior left guard] Nick Easton did a tremendous job [replacing him] under the circumstances, but he’s never played the position before in a game.”
The loss of Leopard weakened an already injury-riddled offensive line, which had given up five sacks even before the veteran center went down.
Two plays after Leopard left the game, Hempel scrambled out of a collapsing pocket, but a swarming Tiger defense knocked the ball loose and fell on top of it. The ensuing drive saw Princeton move down the field and regain the lead, 35-28, as Epperly hit receiver Seth DeValve in the end zone.
On a crucial drive with six minutes left and trailing, 35-28, linebacker Mike Zeuli came barreling through the line and sacked Hempel to set up third and 21. On the next play, Hempel threw up a long pass that was picked off by corner Jacoby Johnson.
But then the defense, which had stepped up in the second half and forced three consecutive Princeton punts, answered the call again. Senior cornerback Brian Owusu punched the ball out of DiAndre Atwater’s hands, and senior safety Jaron Wilson scooped it up and returned it to the Princeton 19 yard line. Hempel connected with senior tight end Tyler Ott three plays later to tie the game, 35-all.
“We knew we needed a big play down the stretch. There wasn’t a lot of time left, so as a defense we take it upon ourselves to create turnovers,” Owusu said. “The opportunity presented itself today.... We were just giving the offense the best chance to make plays themselves.”
The defense came up with another stop on the next drive to give the offense the ball back with 1:42 remaining in regulation, but false start penalties backed Harvard up, forcing backup kicker sophomore Andrew Flesher to attempt a 50-yard field goal, which missed wide left to bring up overtime.
Epperly, who faced little pressure from a depleted defensive unit that had lost linebacker Connor Sheehan last week, torched the secondary with 321 yards and six scores with no picks. Hempel, in contrast, was sacked seven times and threw two interceptions along with 307 yards and four touchdowns.
“I thought Conner did a good job hanging in there,” Murphy said. “They put a lot of pressure on us, threw a lot of blitzes, and we had to piece things together. It wasn’t constantly in a great rhythm, but I thought Conner played very well considering the amount of pressure they brought.”
Penalties, which have troubled Harvard all season, became a problem again on Saturday. The Crimson tallied 11 penalties for 79 yards, including the two which put Flesher’s would-be game-winning field goal out of reach.
Harvard’s red zone became a familiar place for the Princeton offense in the first quarter. Within the first 15 minutes, the Tigers found themselves inside the 20-yard line on three separate occasions—every one of their first-quarter drives.
On the first drive of the game, Epperly drove Princeton down 75 yards for the first score. A missed two-point conversion gave the Tigers the early 6-0 lead just three minutes into the game.
The Crimson defense appeared to have gotten a stop on Princeton’s following drive, but a Harvard defender ran into the punter, extending the Tigers’ drive. Princeton moved all the way down to the one on the drive, but the defense came up with a goal-line stand.
When Harvard’s offense couldn’t capitalize on the turnover, the ensuing field position in Harvard territory led to another seven points for the Tigers.
But once the second quarter began, the momentum shifted. The Crimson scored 14 unanswered points to take the lead on sophomore Paul Stanton’s longest run of the year, a 60-yard sprint to the end zone that gave Harvard a 14-13 lead.
A costly mistake by Hempel led to another Princeton score. Under pressure, Hempel threw a free-for-all that defensive back Philip Bhaya plucked out of the air. Two minutes later, Princeton turned the mistake into eight points, as Epperly hit receiver Conner Kelley for a score and converted the two points afterward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after the program recorded its first-ever NCAA tournament win, Harvard men’s basketball has been getting increasing hype leading up to its Nov. 11 season opener against Holy Cross. The team, which returns four starters from a year ago, was ranked just outside the top 25 in the USAToday preseason poll, coming in at No. 32. The Crimson also fell barely beyond the top 25 of ESPN’s Future Power Rankings, which measure the team’s potential over the next three years, at No. 26.
NBCSports.com ranked Harvard as the second-best mid-major in the country, behind only Wichita State, which was five minutes last year from the tournament final. Junior swingman Wesley Saunders was named to the site’s preseason mid-major All-American second team, with sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers earning honorable mention honors.
In addition to taking home the preseason Player of the Year hardware from NBCSports, Sporting News, and Lindy’s Sports Annuals—which ranked Harvard 26th in the country—Saunders was also named to the preseason Lou Henson All-America team honoring the top mid-major players in college basketball.
Returning senior forward Kyle Casey was named to the Lindy’s Sports Annuals and College Sports Madness preseason All-Ivy second teams, but was left off both first team lists for Cornell forward Shonn Miller, who averaged 11.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game in his junior season, when he made the All-Ivy first team and led the Big Red in scoring. In Casey’s junior season, when Miller was just a freshman, the Medway, Mass. native averaged 11.4 points and 5.5 rebounds a game while shooting 51 percent from the field.
Chambers, who last year was the first Ivy League freshman in conference history to ever be named to the All-Ivy first team, was named a top-ten national point guard by Lindy’s Sports Annuals. Chambers was also honored as the best playmaker and best NBA prospect in the conference. The returning Ivy League Rookie of the Year was nominated in 2012 for the Bob Cousy award for the best point guard in the nation.

Earlier this week, we learned that Harvard University Dining Services will stop serving Barilla pasta in Harvard dining halls after Barilla’s chairman Guido Barilla told an Italian radio station that his company would never feature a gay family in its advertising.
With its decision to boycott the company's pasta products for the foreseeable future, Harvard will no longer be a source of revenue for Barilla. This almost sounds like divestment, and we all know that divestment is kind of a big deal. In fact, the University has recently reaffirmed its anti-divestment stance with respect to its investments in the fossil fuel industry, a controversial move provoking varied reactions.
While we at Flyby are fairly certain that President Faust does not know or care much about the matter of Barilla divestment, we wondered what it might look like to reframe her recent letter justifying the University's stance on fossil fuels and apply her language to the Barilla issue.
Here's what we came up with:
Dear Members of the Harvard Community,
Barilla pasta’s advertising strategy represents one of the world’s most consequential challenges. I very much respect the concern and commitment shown by the many members of our community who are working to confront this problem.
While I share their belief in the importance of addressing Barilla pasta, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that a university boycott is warranted or wise.
We should be clear-sighted about the risks that boycotting Barilla pasta could pose to HUDS’ capacity to propel our important research and teaching mission. Significantly constraining pasta options risks significantly constraining dining satisfaction.
Barilla pasta provides more than one-third of the pasta we distribute to University dining halls each year. Its nutritional value and texture are crucial to our institutional ambitions—to the support we can offer students and faculty, to the intellectual opportunities we can provide, to the research we can advance.
Universities represent a very small of Barilla's pasta sales. If we and others were to stop purchasing, that pasta would no doubt find other willing buyers.
Boycotting is likely to have negligible financial impact on Barilla pasta. And such a strategy would diminish the influence or voice we might have with this industry. Boycotting pits concerned diners and institutions against companies that have enormous capacity and responsibility to promote progress toward a more fibrous future.
Harvard has a strong interest in marshaling its academic resources to help meet society’s most important and vexing challenges, and there is no question that Barilla pasta’s marketing strategy must be prominent among them.  We will continue to do so, through the energy and ideas of our faculty, students, and staff, in ways that are true to the purposes of our pasta consumption and that best take advantage of the University’s distinctive capacities as an academic institution.
Sincerely,Drew Faust

Only three students attended a discussion last week with Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith about what they want to see in the next Dean of the College. It was on a Thursday night, and it was in the Quad, but that’s still pretty embarrassing.
Flyby put together some suggestions for administrators to keep in mind for future events if they want to attract some student attendance.
1. Free food
2. Free food
3. Advertise the free food
 4. The free food must taste good
 
Think back to all the successful discussions and events that you’ve attended. Regardless of the subject matter or setting, one variable held constant in every situation: there was fantastic food. The last discussion session in your House common room may have been practically empty, but we bet there was a line out the door for Insomnia Cookies at your last study break. [1]
5. Host it on any day EXCEPT a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.
If you think that your average student is going to choose a sit-down meeting with a dean over going to a party, you need a reality check.
6. Include buzzwords in the event title.
Let’s think, are students more likely to open an email with a subject title of “Discussion about the New Dean,” or “SEX, CONDOMS, FREE NOCH’S”? (Again, the importance of free food can not be stressed enough.)
7. Quad = No
Best case scenario, you will get two students from Cabot, and maybe one from Pfoho or Currier, to come to your talk in Cabot d-hall. You will get exactly zero students from Dunster or Mather, or any River House, for that matter.
--
[1] Of course, there are exceptions to the rule, such as mandatory attendance rules for comp events or discussions with celebrities such as Lady Gaga.

To kick off the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ $2.5 billion capital campaign, Harvard administrators and faculty spent Saturday morning wowing supporters and friends of Harvard with tales of all the amazing things students and researchers are doing on campus. It’s no surprise they tried to play this angle up—after all, a good chunk of the money Harvard hopes to raise will go towards improving teaching and enhancing the learning experience.
 
However, in preparing the campaign literature distributed to attendees this weekend, it looks like campaign organizers might have underestimated the mathematical abilities of Harvard’s teachers and learners. You may recognize the chalk-drawn mathematical rule being demonstrated in the top photo from your eighth grade geometry class.
Happy solving, everyone!
