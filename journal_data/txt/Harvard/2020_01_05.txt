After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nominations for the 77th Golden Globe Awards are out, and the winner is … Netflix?
The awards — presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) — honor achievement in film and television. In the era of ascendant streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, those categories are beginning to feel somewhat outdated.
This didn’t, however, stop streamers from sweeping the competition this year. Netflix scored a record 34 nominations, more than any other studio (the runner-up, Sony Pictures, earned just 10). And of the five nominees for Best Motion Picture in drama, three are Netflix productions — including Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story,” which garnered six nominations, the most of any film this year. Netflix also led in TV, scoring 17 nominations (including four each for “Unbelievable” and “The Crown”).
HBO, seen by many as Netflix’s main competitor in the TV awards race, snagged 15 nominations. It’s a close second, but given HBO’s historic dominance as a producer of prestige TV, that’s not much to brag about. Neither is the HFPA’s snub of the network’s flagship drama “Game of Thrones”: The show’s divisive final season received just one nomination (for Kit Harington’s portrayal of Jon Snow). On the other hand, HBO’s hit miniseries “Chernobyl” received four nominations, bringing it into a three-way tie with Netflix’s two frontrunners in the same category.
No female filmmakers were nominated for Best Director of a film — not a new trend, considering that in the past 70 years, fewer than ten women have been nominated for the category. A surprising exclusion this year, however, was broadcast networks (creating a bit of an embarrassing situation for NBC, who hosts the awards). It’s a first in Golden Globes history, but not all that surprising given the bland medley of police procedurals, family sitcoms, and reality TV competitions that pervade NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox.
While it’s true that Netflix has transformed the way we access entertainment, audience tastes seem to have mostly held steady. Parts of this year’s lineup of Hollywood heavyweights — which includes Al Pacino, Eddie Murphy, and Meryl Streep — read like a “who’s who” of 1980’s Hollywood. (In fact, those three actors were all nominees in the 1984 Golden Globes as well). Not that we’re complaining. There’s something nice about seeing Martin Scorsese’s name up in lights again — even if it is under a Netflix logo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patagonia, the outdoor clothing brand known for its environmental activism, has opened a new store in Harvard Square.
The California-based company now occupies the space at 39 Brattle Street previously filled by the shoe store Beyond. The store will celebrate its opening with a party on Jan. 31 from 6 to 9 p.m., complete with food and drinks from local vendors and live music.
Since opening in mid-December, store manager Jay Kleman said the store has been busy meeting the demand of locals looking to venture into the outdoors during the holiday season.
“We can help you get outfitted for any sort of trip, any sort of sporting event, anything you really need to be outfitted for even if that’s walking the dog through Harvard Square in really nasty New England weather,” Kleman said.
Like its Newbury Street counterpart, Patagonia Cambridge carries a variety of garments and gear for the outdoors, while also specializing in trail and ski gear.
“We’ve been looking at Cambridge as a location for a good while and know we have a really strong community base here in Boston, so we wanted to offer another location across the river for everybody in this area,” Kleman siad. “And really what we’re trying to do is work together to create an experience that’s really seamless between both stores.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Patagonia’s opening in the square was “certainly additive.”
“People like the retail experience in the shop,” she said. “And from what I could tell, just from the few days before Christmas and since then, it’s a popular destination, so that’s great.”
While Patagonia’s sales span the globe, the company prides itself on environmental sustainability and activism, co-founding the One Percent for the Panet program, which donates at least one percent of its sales toward local environmental non-profits.
“The money goes back right to groups that we work with here in the Boston area,” Kleman said.
The store’s first local partner is Elevate Youth, an organization that brings young people from urban environments into the outdoors through rock-climbing outings and ski trips.
“That’s kind of what we really like to do, getting people into the outdoors, building those connections so that we can really tackle our environmental problems together,” Kleman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite carrying a four-game skid into the three-week holiday break, the Harvard men’s hockey team managed to close 2019 on a high note, picking up three of a possible four standings points in a two-game series against a ranked Arizona State squad.
The positive trend stalled this weekend, however. The No. 16/15 Crimson, eager to build a streak of winning hockey as it did in November, opened the 2020 portion of the schedule with a one-point weekend.
On Friday, the group suffered a 6-1 defeat in the barn of conference foe Quinnipiac. The following evening, Harvard (7-5-2, 6-3-1 ECAC) skated to a 3-3 draw with Princeton in the historic Hobey Baker Rink.
After spells of inconsistency derailed the Crimson’s impressive six-game unbeaten stretch to begin the campaign, the team is still battling its inability to bring a reliable brand of winning hockey to the ice each night.
“This past weekend was a little bit more difficult for us,” Harvard captain Nathan Krusko said. “A lot of the same problems arose: a lack of a complete effort for the full 60 minutes…and then our inability to have a consistent effort and energy throughout the game, really for the entire weekend. It’s good that it’s not too late in the season for us, but these are lessons that we have to learn pretty quickly here if we want to make a run at the end of the season.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 3
On Saturday, the Tigers (2-11-4, 0-7-3) erased an early two-score deficit and even took the lead before a third-period powerplay goal from Crimson freshman John Farinacci knotted the game at 3-3.
A clean zone entry by the man-up unit primed a one-timer from the high slot by sophomore blue-liner Jack Rathbone. Farinacci was lurking at the goal line to the right of Princeton net-minder Jeremie Forget (3 GA, .897 SV%), where he picked up the rebound and put it home.
Five minutes of bonus hockey could not determine a victor, so each team took home a point.
Farinacci’s tally six minutes into the final frame came as somewhat of a relief. Earlier in the frame, the Tigers found twine on a powerplay of their own, courtesy of junior forward Luke Keenan, and in doing so seized the lead after Harvard’s early 2-0 advantage.
The go-ahead goal was a pretty display of powerplay puck-moving. From the left point, junior defenseman Mark Paolini zipped the puck inside the slot to freshman forward Adam Robbins. The rookie fended off the Crimson penalty killers closing in around him before dishing a backhand feed to Keenan, who was waiting on the weak side to bury the one-timer.
“I thought we had a really, really good first period,” said Harvard junior defenseman Reilly Walsh. “[We] kind of took the foot off the gas and took some penalties. [We] slowed the game down and gave the momentum back…. We came out with a tie there, which isn’t the result we really look for.”
While the Crimson was glad to squeeze a point out of the affair, a tie against an ECAC bottom-feeder is far from satisfying for a ranked program with NCAA Tournament aspirations.
“Everyone’s aware of everyone’s record when they go into games,” Krusko said. “We didn’t play a mature game. We have to give credit to Princeton. They fought. We can’t expect to walk into game and think that, because we have some talent…or because we have a good start that teams are going to just break.”
In-game lapses have cost the squad crucial results this season — Saturday’s second period, in which Princeton potted two pucks and dominated in shots, 13-4, was no exception. Nonetheless, this weekend’s clash with the Tigers provided some positives, such as a two-goal night from the powerplay, now ranked eighth in the nation at 26.0 percent effective.
QUINNIPIAC 6, HARVARD 1
On Friday, Harvard became the next victim in the Bobcats (11-7-1, 6-3-1) ongoing winning streak, now at five games.
A mere 90 seconds into the contest, Quinnipiac defenseman Karlis Cukste put his team ahead with a point shot that snuck under the pads of goaltender Mitchell Gibson (3 GA, .850 SV%).
While the visitors were able to even the ledger before the first-period horn — thanks to Farinacci on the man advantage — a barrage of Bobcats goals in the following 40 minutes allowed the hosts to skate by comfortably. As part of the offensive outburst, Cutske was one of six Quinnipiac skaters to log multiple points in the triumph.
“It kind of just seemed like they wanted it more,” Walsh said. “That’s something that we have a little bit of inconsistency with — putting the pedal to the metal for all three periods…. We kind of learned how hard it is to win on the road, and teams aren’t just going to roll over because of what happened earlier in the season.”
Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 relieved Gibson of his net-minding duties after the second period, which featured one goal and one assist apiece from Bobcats top-line forwards Odeen Tufto and Ethan de Jong.
Over the course of their careers, the two dynamic linemates have done significant damage against Harvard, with Tufto logging nine points (2–7—9) in six appearances and de Jong recording five (3–2—5) in four outings. Each player has been held scoreless just once when matched up against the Crimson.
“[Tufto and de Jong] are guys that you consistently see on the score sheet,” Krusko said. “[Those] guys like to play a really fast game. I think Tufto is pretty consistent on the draws as well…. They’re very skilled players, they’re very fast players, and they’re very dangerous.”
Tufto and de Jong also managed to sting senior goaltender Cameron Gornet (3 GA, .700 SV%), who replaced Gibson in the crease for the final frame. They contributed to two of the three tallies that Quinnipiac added in the stanza, distancing their group from Harvard.
In November, the Crimson defeated Quinnipiac handily in an early-season statement game. Friday’s result, though, muddies a comparison between the two teams and elevates the importance of the remainder of the conference schedule in deciding ECAC tournament seeding.
Harvard now turns to a marquee game on its schedule, an additional non-conference matchup with storied rival Yale at the famed Madison Square Garden in New York.
