After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


This review contains spoilers for the fourth episode of “Big Little Lies” Season Two. 
You’d think after one murder, Monterey denizens would learn their lesson about costume parties. Still, in an effort to salvage her daughter’s mental health amidst her husband’s bankruptcy scandal, Renata (Laura Dern) throws a disco-themed bash for Amabella’s (Ivy George) eighth birthday. Paisley-patterned shirts and hippie headbands abound. (Do we have enough word count to point out the ludicrousness of throwing a ‘70s-themed party for an eight-year-old? No?) It’s the last great hurrah for the Kleins, who have just lost their Aspen condo, Palm Beach vacation home, and yacht, so this party better be all about “pure, unmitigated joy.”
No such luck. Predictably, for a group of people lodged in an explosive nexus of affairs, grudges, and secrets, tension breaks out almost immediately after Renata’s saccharine greetings. Nate (James Tupper) literally snatches Ed’s (Adam Scott) wig. Meanwhile, Celeste (Nicole Kidman) and Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz) both admit they regret going along with the lie about Perry’s death, a gentle criticism that Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) takes as a personal affront. “Are you blaming me?” she asks, indignant. Bonnie offers a shrugged response: Well, you did originate the lie, so…
To be fair, Madeline’s also on edge about her fragile marriage with Ed, and Celeste does her best to dispel her best friend’s anxiety. Regardless, Celeste is right that this lie “has had quite a shelf life.” Which begs the crucial question: Do none of the Monterey Five — a Silicon Valley titan and former attorney among them — know how to hire a lawyer? Celeste’s deceased husband was a rapist and serial abuser. Surely attributing his untimely death to an accidental fall was less legally tenable than telling the (already persuasive) truth, that these women acted in self-defense.
Unfortunately for Celeste, at least someone in Monterey knows how to hire a lawyer: Her mother-in-law Mary Louise (Meryl Streep), after witnessing one too many of Celeste’s breakdowns, deems her unfit to care for Max and Josh (Nicholas and Cameron Crovetti) and initiates the season’s long-anticipated custody battle. “Big Little Lies” makes its allegiance to Celeste obvious, especially when Mary Louise, resident rape apologist, continually exhibits such reproachable behavior. There’s no doubt that she’s the antagonist, especially after she rents an apartment right in Jane’s building. Yet the case against Celeste is building, as Mary Louise expresses to an increasingly convinced Jane: a secret drawer full of various pill bottles, reckless driving, and lo, a shirtless bartender strolling through the Wright residence post-one-night stand. It might be time for Celeste to whip out her old law school textbooks, because a full-fledged custody battle is clearly in the pipeline, and it doesn’t look good for her.
Elsewhere, another concerned mother fears for her child: Elizabeth, witnessing the tense exchange among Bonnie, Madeline, and Celeste, warns her daughter that she doesn’t “like the energy in this house.” She’s clearly intuited that the pure, unmitigated joy that Renata intended with the party is clearly performative, a tiny band-aid over a festering wound, or as Ed says to a frustrated Madeline, “a dog and pony show in front of all of Monterey.” Bonnie insists that it’s just Elizabeth’s “weird imagination,” and we’re inclined to believe her, until Elizabeth collapses while leaving the party. Her foreboding visions of dark water evolve to include Bonnie, drowned and floating lifelessly. Whether it’s just a psychological evocation of Bonnie’s mood, or a harbinger of something more ominous, this can’t portend anything good.
Yet somehow, all these plotlines feel somewhat inconsequential. Between the custody battle and the drowning prophecy, predictable seems to be the unfortunate descriptor for this season’s “Big Little Lies,” which has overtly announced every plot point that could’ve been an enigmatic twist. The strongest suit of the first season was its overarching mystery: There’s a murder, but the identities of killer and victim are both unknown. Here, Season Two seems hasty to unspool each storyline as it happens: Someone drowns, and it’s Bonnie. Ed finds out about Madeline’s affair, and he’s angry. The teleplays are full of GIF-able one-liners and quips in the name of fan service, which is why Season Two’s overall lack of substance does little to stymie the loyal viewership of the television equivalent of a campy summer beach read — surely if viewers have come this far, they’ll stick around until the finale. But why, exactly, “Big Little Lies” keeps going without much of a propulsive storytelling mechanism, a suspense factor keeping us hungry for the next episode, is beyond any understanding. Perhaps that’s the biggest mystery of all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C. — It’s 8:57 a.m., and I’m close to running late as I arrive at the gate. I place my bagged lunch in a little bin that goes through the X-ray scanner, and I pass through the metal detector. Exiting the checkpoint, I always feel as if I’m stepping into another world; I’ve left behind the hustle and bustle of the tourists and Beltway commuters who pack the metro cars and streets each morning.
It’s only a short walk down a quiet driveway before I make my way up the steps of the east entrance of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The EEOB, as it’s called, is a vast complex — a rare instance of French Second Empire architecture that stands out in a city known for its neoclassical constructions. The entrance is as imposing as the rest of the building. I pass under three balconies, each supported by a dozen columns — of which there are literally a thousand built onto every part of the exterior. The front doors swing open to reveal the diagonal black-and-white checkered floors that canvas the hallways, combining into one massive chessboard.
My morning walk ends with a climb up four staircases, which form magnificent spirals from one floor to the next. This is the most magical part of the commute — no, not the stairs (even though they are incredibly ornate) — but rather a series of unassuming rooms that line the stairway. Together, they tell the story of a country’s experience of living, as the proverb goes, in interesting times.
At the foot of the stairs, I catch a glimpse of Room 180 on my left. It was once occupied by Richard Nixon, who couldn’t get used to the Oval Office and instead came across the street to complete his work here, in his private study. The taping system he installed tells us that Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger ’50 regularly huddled in Room 180; it was here that they planned much of the operation to secretly establish contact with the People's Republic of China, then in self-imposed exile and isolated from both the West and the Soviet Union. That initiative culminated in Nixon’s historic visit to China. Without the developments in this room, the Cold War may not have concluded in the 20th century, a nation of 1.3 billion might still be closed off to the world, and, more personally, my parents would never have been able to come to America — or for that matter, even have met each other in Louisiana as young graduate students.
Ascending to the second floor, I pass by Room 208, formerly the office of twenty Secretaries of State; the last of that old guard was George C. Marshall Jr., who planned the rebuilding of a continent. Rounding the staircase, I see out of the corner of my eye the number 302, which entered the American psyche as the office of Oliver L. North; here was the nerve center from which he coordinated the illicit Iran-Contra operations in the 1980s.
Finally, reaching the fourth floor, I make a right at the meeting space known as the Indian Treaty Room. It’s a quiet space where the lights are often turned off in the mornings and the outside is nondescript, except for a small plaque and a sign above the entrance that reads “Library.” Seventy-five years ago, it was filled with representatives from around the world, here for the signing of the U.N. Charter and Bretton-Woods agreement that laid the groundwork for a post-war order. The endpoint of my commute is two doors down from a room that, as Acheson would remark, was present at the creation.
It’s on mornings like this that I remember these hallways were once walked by a youthful Navy Department official (and former Crimson president) named Franklin D. Roosevelt ’04, a military aide named Dwight D. Eisenhower, and economists with names like Robert M. Solow ’44 and Kenneth J. Arrow.
And with that, I’m at my room. It’s a small one by most standards, one of more than five hundred in the building. But that’s how it should be, in a place that appropriately dwarfs the individual — one that has seen the rise of a republic from the ashes of the Civil War to the helm of the modern world.
People will come and go, and summer interns like me will soon be forgotten. But there will be a constant; it has stood here for a hundred and fifty years, and it will stand here for many more, keeping watch as a long yet unfinished story is slowly written inside.
I am a bit glad that my time here is so limited; I can’t help but think that it would be a shame if these checkered floors lost their luster. I’m reminded a little of being at Harvard, where it’s far too easy for me to look down at my phone as I walk through the Yard, often forgetting the magic of a place that is so special. It’s a funny sort of habituation that sneaks up on all of us. Other editors have written far more eloquently about it in these pages, and it’s from them that I gain a new degree of recognition.
So, this summer, I’ve given myself a mission: I’ll try to dance around the erosion that comes so inevitably with the passage of time — just long enough, I hope, to remember the same feeling of awe on my last day as I did on my first.
Eight more weeks to go. It’s 9:00 a.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of uncertainty, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed guidance on Friday for higher education institutions — including Harvard — required to pay a new tax on their endowments.
The 58-page document, the office’s first attempt to write regulations for the tax, outlines various legal definitions and terms associated with the tax. This language is necessary for understanding how it will be implemented, according Robert Kelchen, a professor studying higher education finances at Seton Hall University.
“I don’t think there’s anything terribly surprising,” Kelchen said. “I think the biggest takeaway is this is a really complex regulation to define — even what counts as an eligible student has to be defined.”
The tax, passed in December 2017 as part of a Republican-backed tax bill, targets university endowments worth more than $500,000 per student with a 1.4 percent excise tax on returns. State universities and schools with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students will be exempt, according to the IRS guidelines.
The controversial tax has long met resistance from Harvard. After its passage, then-University President Drew G. Faust deemed the tax “unprecedented,” predicting it “will weaken our ability to support students and research.” The University has lobbied extensively against the tax in the nation’s capital both before and after it passed.
In the year and a half since its passage, Harvard has awaited guidance on how to file the tax. The new guidelines were released just before the end of the first fiscal year for which Harvard will have to pay the tax, as the tax applies to fiscal years that started after Dec. 31, 2017 and Harvard’s fiscal year begins July 1.
University administrators have estimated that, if Harvard had been required to pay the tax in 2017, it would have cost the University roughly $43 million.
The proposed rules are now open to a 90-day public comment period, for which the IRS has laid out specific areas for which it seeks feedback.
For example, the IRS requested comment on a technical point about student-loan interest rates. The guidelines state that the interest students pay on loans with below-market rates may not be considered investment income since it is a form of scholarship to students, yet the guidelines also noted the difficulties in determining what the market rate would be in many cases.
“Comments advocating an exception for the interest received on student loans should explain how these concerns could be addressed. It would be helpful if such comments also provide information regarding the number of student loans applicable educational institutions make each year, how they set the interest rates on those loans, and whether the rates are set below market, or at market rates,” the guidelines read.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to specifically state whether Harvard would submit a formal public comment in an emailed statement. She wrote, however, that the University was opposed to the endowment tax and would keep advocating for its repeal.
“We are working to analyze the proposed guidance released late on Friday and legal requirements of this new tax,” she wrote. “We will continue to work with policy makers and others in the higher education community to push for Congress to re-examine this misguided and damaging provision in light of the Congress's stated goals of increasing access and affordability.”
Still, Kelchen said attempts to repeal the endowment tax will most likely fall short given the tax’s bi-partisan backing and a growing desire to have colleges pay more to the government.
“This is something that has been talked about for at least a decade and it’s a policy that has gotten at least some support from the left and the right politically. I think there is more pressure now for even nonprofit colleges to pay more taxes,” said Kelchen, pointing to cities like Boston and Pittsburgh, which have tried to get universities to make voluntary payments to the city.
“The door is opening for more local communities or even states to try to get revenue from colleges as well,” Kelchen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz is asking a federal judge to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, who implicated Dershowitz in a sex ring run by billionaire Harvard donor Jeffrey E. Epstein.
Giuffre first sued Dershowitz in April, alleging he defamed her in the wake of a 2018 Miami Herald report that Epstein abused Giuffre and dozens of other underage girls in his Palm Beach, Fla. home in the the mid-2000s. In a separate 2015 lawsuit, she alleged that Epstein forced her to have sexual relations multiple times with Dershowitz, who served as Epstein’s lawyer when the billionaire was first taken to court over sexual misconduct in 2006.
In documents filed in Southern New York District Court Wednesday, Dershowitz argued Giuffre’s suit was “designed more for the media than for the Court.”
He moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that her claims surpassed the statute of limitations because they “were originally published by Dershowitz in early 2015 after Giuffre first leveled her accusations against Dershowitz,” according to a memorandum in support of the motion.
The memo also asserts that Dershowitz’ defense of Giuffre’s “scurrilous allegations” is protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Dershowitz served on a six-person legal team that, in 2007, struck an extraordinary plea deal for Epstein, according to a Miami Herald investigative report. Despite facing a potential life sentence, Epstein — who once cultivated personal friendships with Harvard administrators and maintained an office near campus — spent only 13 months in county jail. An FBI probe into his actions was also shut down as part of the deal.
In the defamation suit, Giuffre states Dershowitz accused her of perjury and extortion to deter her from discussing allegations against Epstein and himself. She is seeking a trial by jury in her defamation suit and at least $75,000 in damages
Dershowitz’s motion to dismiss comes after he said in an April interview with The Crimson that he welcomed the suit, that Giuffre’s allegations constitute perjury, and that he has evidence that will exonerate him.
He said in another interview Thursday that he maintains that Giuffre committed perjury, adding that in a case like the one against him, “any lawyer would file a motion to dismiss.”
“I have been calling this woman a liar since the day she accused me. I will continue to call her a liar until the day I die,” Dershowitz said Thursday.
Joshua Schiller — a lawyer for Giuffre — wrote that Dershowitz’s motion to dismiss is a “desperate act” and shows his “inability to deal with the merits of the serious, documented charges brought against him” in an emailed statement Friday.
“Mr. Dershowitz has repeatedly and loudly said how anxious he was to have a court determine the merits of those charges, but now filing a motion to dismiss, he has demonstrated how false his assertions were,” Schiller wrote. “He is on the run from these troubling charges, but he can’t hide from them.”
