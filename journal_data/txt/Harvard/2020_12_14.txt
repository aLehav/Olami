After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the Harvard Crimson sat down with April Kelley and Sara Huxley, executive producers of the female-led horror film “Rose” which debuted at the 2020 BFI London Film Festival. The Crimson spoke with Kelley and Huxley about horror viewed through the lens of women, their switch from acting to producing, and the hardest scene to film.
The Harvard Crimson: Thanks so much for sitting down with us! For our first question: how does horror change when it’s created by women and viewed through their perspective?
April Kelley: They give them a sensibility. They really ground their characters and shape them with a lot of heart and nuances. I think if women can do anything, it's nuances and multiple messages all at once.
THC: You both seem to have an acting background — why switch to producing?
AK: When I was in the second year of my drama school, we had to do a presentation on what you'll be doing when you're not acting that isn't soul destroying. And I presented starting a production company and my tutor pulled me over to one side and said: 'would you like to do something a little bit more realistic, and come back next week?’ And I registered the company two weeks later, and haven't looked back. When you get behind the camera, you understand so much more about the scope of production. You [can] take control of making parts for people, giving opportunities to people, and driving more diverse female characters.
THC: What was the most difficult scene in the film to create?
Sara Huxley: It was the last scene, the big climactic scene. It was the hardest to shoot — it was the only thing that we had to do proper pick-ups on. We were assembling on site, and we were under so much time pressure. It's choreography, stunts; we put most of our money into that day. We had a stunt coordinator, we had special effects. And it was even harder when we got into the edit, just getting the pace right, because it's such an important scene.
JC: What's one thing that you learned making this film or something that surprised you about it?
AK: Why don’t we say each other's? So I think Sara would say, always, always have a production accountant in the budget.
SH: Just about to say that.
AK: We were on such a tight budget Joy, I was the production accountant. So we finished the production, and then we needed to actually submit the tax credit. Luckily, [I have] a few accountants in my family, but that was hard! And let me guess April's — Oh, yeah, another thing that we both learned, although the location was amazing, was always have WiFi! Our WiFi… was so bad, and there was no phone signal. It was a kind of a double edged sword: it was really lovely, because we just went completely off the radar. And we did old school paper call sheet drop offs through everybody's cabins at night, and people just had to be where they were told to be the next morning. So that was great — but we had to drive three or four miles up the road to telephone our phones and sit in our car to send emails!
THC: What do you think your next project might look like?
AK: We've got a few features. One is a horror comedy — [an] all female-led feature film, which is a lot of fun. And then another short we did called "Edith" that stars Peter Mullan and Michelle Fairley, which is directed by Christian Cooke. And then some more shorts, because we really see shorts as the gateway to testing our talent and our ideas. All that stuff is so important; I don't think we’re ever going to stop making shorts.
THC: Anything else that I forgot to ask you or anything else that you think our readers should know about?
SH: I just hope people really enjoy it! It's so hard when you make a film and you're in it and you know every single scene has so much context — from how it was to shoot the scene, to what happened on that day to how the crew was feeling to discussions about the music or sound effects. It’s hard when you're in it to kind of know if your film’s good anymore, so we just really hope people enjoy it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my all-time favorite movies is “Ratatouille,” which is about chefs (both human and otherwise) in a Parisian gourmet restaurant who contend with the sharp reviews of a food critic named Anton Ego. I recently rewatched it, for probably the seventh time — though it was my first since starting as an opinion writer. This time, a different part of the movie stuck out in particular. I found myself replaying Ego’s speech toward the very end of the film. The once-biting critic — after seeing the unexpected source of genius behind an incredible dish of, yes, ratatouille — comes to a new realization about his role in the world:
“In many ways, the work of the critic is easy — we risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and theirselves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.”
The same goes for people like myself and others who publish opinion articles. When you’re writing one of these, it’s far easier to come up with criticism than praise. Opinion writers look for controversy, and then don’t hesitate to pile on when they see a fumble.
It has something to do with the fact that people like myself live by the pen. Regular columnists write on a schedule; every other Wednesday, they have to look for a complaint to lodge about the world, about other people, about campus. And there’s usually plenty of subject matter available, if one thinks hard enough. Occasional op-ed writers aren’t much different. At The Crimson, somebody has to write an op-ed each day, and when you sign up for a slot as an Editorial Board member, you usually try to come up with something interesting to say — if only for your own satisfaction (because let’s face it, no op-ed writer wants to write a boring article).
Which is not to say that the criticism made in these pages is not valid. But the tradeoff is that in the process of finding criticism, it becomes easy to miss the bright spots, and to look for how the glass is half empty. And this doesn’t just apply to opinion writers — every one of us has done this, probably regularly.
Often, these criticisms become self-perpetuating in a way; we all learn to regurgitate the same few. It’s easy to instinctively criticize administration decisions before considering what their decision constraints actually were. When did we last actually sit down and think through that? And how many of us, as first-years, criticized Harvard students going into management consulting, without understanding in detail what they do or why? (Full disclaimers: I don’t have a particularly great love for the University’s administration, nor will I enter management consulting.) But I certainly am guilty as charged.
I’ll let you in on a secret. I actually wrote this article after watching “Ratatouille” while struggling with writer’s block; you caught me. But, quite conveniently, Anton Ego’s not wrong. We can all be a little less harsh on those who submit themselves — often involuntarily or accidentally — to our judgment. Maybe, God forbid, we can even occasionally assume best intentions from other people.
Normally, I might give this kind of article a zinger of a final sentence, so you’d think this opinion writer was extra clever, and by extension, that my criticism was also kind of clever. Today, though, I’ll simply submit the idea that we can use the absence of opinion articles in the next few weeks to recognize that every new day doesn’t have to come with a new piece of criticism. After all, life as a student at Harvard College could be a whole lot worse. It’s likely the case that the glass we’re looking at is probably 99 percent full — and always has been.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I kept getting on my roommate’s case this fall for not breaking up with her boyfriend, but I’ve become just as much of a broken record. All my roommates are tired of hearing me hash out the same points over and over on whether I should take another gap semester, somehow thinking a new resolution will emerge from the same set of incomplete information.
Uncertainty and indecision have characterized 2020. I always just went along with college, expecting to take 32 classes, live in a dorm for eight semesters, graduate in four years. And I would have been perfectly satisfied with that trajectory. But the pandemic shook the foundations of the status quo.
To avoid indecision, we often go with the default option. As behavioral economists have discovered, setting defaults are an effective way to nudge people towards making a certain decision. That’s why there’s so much discussion, for example, over whether our privacy settings should be defaulted to opt-in or opt-out.
I suspect, incidentally, that the fear of uncertainty is a big motivation for Harvard students flocking toward finance and consulting — even bigger than the desire for wealth, the usual culprit cited. Those industries have become our default options. It’s not about coveting what’s above so much as being scared of what’s below. For Harvard students there’s a lot of below. Or at least we’re worried there’s a lot of below. And along with fear comes the desire for stability — which these careers promise, from the very recruiting process that takes place on campus. We want to be excellent, and it’s in our reach, but it’d be easier if someone else could just tell us what to strive to be excellent in.
I myself felt this pressure especially when the pandemic first hit. I thought the pandemic ruined all my plans, but then I realized: I had no plans.
Friends were locking down their trajectories — accepting return offers in finance and tech, applying to graduate school and fellowships. No option called out to me in that way though. If I too feared the unknown, I also didn’t think that no knowns seemed much worse. Via summer internships and college extracurriculars I’ve explored three or four industries, but that’s very few in the set of plausible futures. Yes, indecision is a recurring theme here, but it’s not irrational to see it as an optimization problem. This summer I really liked the company I was working at and the work I was doing, but couldn’t I like other companies and other paths too?
So the pandemic gave me time. Time to experience the events of this fall in a virtual newsroom. Time to take another summer internship, possibly to try something else. And hopefully time to be more intentional about my senior year, whenever it starts. For all Harvard offers, and all that I am eager to return to, it may not have been the best place for me to resolve those questions, especially in its current reduced form.
Indecision, of course, can be a privilege. It was mine this year, given that one of my biggest crises revolved around a voluntary decision over whether to attend college and push off a graduation date. With the security that nothing too bad can happen, I genuinely have the freedom to grapple with the uncertainty.
In some ways I appreciate the state of not knowing — or rather, of finding out. That was my job this year, to learn more through reporting stories. You always make progress, adding a drop to the bucket of total knowledge in the world, both for yourself and hopefully for others. But there’s never an end. Nor do I want one. Certainty can be something to strive for but not something to obtain, as 2020 keeps reminding us.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council launched a weeklong campaign last month to support a project aimed at explaining how the University collects and uses student data.
The campaign — dubbed the Transparency Project — started as a final project created by Yousuf Bakshi ’23 and Anjali Chakradhar ’23 in the class Computer Science 105: “Privacy and Technology,” taught by Computer Science professor James “Jim” H. Waldo. Bakshi and Chakradhar are Council members who represent Mather House and Cabot House, respectively.
The project — a collaboration with newly formed club Harvard Undergraduate Initiative for Technology and Society — aimed to bolster student awareness about data privacy, Chakradhar said.
“We want to help build the next generation of data-aware citizens who can then go on to advocate for themselves and other people,” Chakradhar said. “We thought that the best place to start was right here.”
The Council decided to publicize the project in a general meeting on Nov. 15, passing legislation that Bakshi and Chakradhar wrote to establish the project and use the Council’s social media channels to increase exposure. The legislation, which passed unanimously, asserted that “Harvard students are largely unaware of what data is collected on them by the University, creating an unchecked system with students functionally unable to advocate for their own privacy rights.”
Content covered in the project — now published on the Council’s website — includes a map of video surveillance around Harvard Yard, a review of the exam proctor software Proctorio, and what data Harvard can access from students’ University Google Drives.
Timothy J. “Tim” Bailey, a spokesperson for Harvard University Information Technology, and University spokesperson Jason A. Newton did not respond to a request for comment on the project.
According to Bakshi, members of Yale’s College Council reached out to Undergraduate Council leadership to work with Bakshi and Chakradhar on establishing a Transparency Project at Yale. The Yale College Council did not respond to a request for comment.
Bakshi and Chakradhar also said they already have plans for future iterations of the project at Harvard.
“A lot of students are really interested in finding out what Harvard does differently,” Baskhi said. “That’s something we should definitely look at next time.”
They also said they were happy with the results of this year’s project.
“We really hope that students have learned a lot about their data privacy and will take this into the real world,” Bakshi said. “I really hope that people now take their data privacy seriously.”

Harvard Summer School suspended all study-abroad programming for the summer of 2021, citing concerns over the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Administrators in Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, the department in charge of summer study-abroad programs, determined that it would not be in students’ and faculty members’ best interests to carry out summer programming for 2021 given rising global COVID-19 case counts, according to DCE spokesperson Harry J. Pierre.
The decision falls in line with previously announced policy; University Provost Alan M. Garber, in a Nov. 17 email to Harvard affiliates, announced that all University-related international travel would remain prohibited until further notice.
“With COVID-19 cases rising across the United States and the world, the prohibition on University-related travel, both international and domestic, remains in effect until further notice,” Garber’s email read.
With study-abroad programming planned up to nine months in advance, DCE administrators also noted the challenges of anticipating the travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine measures students may have to take when they arrive at their destinations, according to Pierre.
Pierre also said administrators made careful determinations based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations, which advise that study abroad programs cease operations.
“The CDC recommends that Institutes of Higher Education (IHE) consider postponing or canceling upcoming student foreign exchange programs,” the State Department’s website reads. “In addition, the CDC recommends IHE consider asking current program participants to return to their home country.”
The agency’s warnings preclude any possibility of students to congregate in-person during their time abroad, according to Pierre, because social distancing measures and repeated lockdowns would interrupt in-person exchanges. Students abroad may also face difficulties going home should new travel restrictions, family emergencies, or health concerns arise, he said.
The CDC has a four-tier system with the highest, Level Four, advising that people avoid non-essential travel. As of Dec. 14, 2020, only 61 countries and territories are at Levels One and Two, according to the CDC’s guidelines. The United States is currently at Level Four.
Currently, United States passport-holders are not able to enter countries in the European Union. Countries that do permit American citizens require them to meet a variety of requirements before entry, including receiving a negative COVID-19 test result within 24 to 96 hours, undergoing a mandatory two-week quarantine period, or opting into a travel health insurance program.
The summer study-abroad program will announce information about Summer 2022 programming in Sept. 2021, according to the program website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cancellation of Ivy League athletics due to the coronavirus has provided a respite for some of Harvard’s student-athletes, while causing others to lose their sense of purpose, they said.
During normal times, Harvard athletes spend several hours each day with their teammates on campus practicing their sport. Now, during the pandemic, they spend their time doing at-home workouts, interacting with teammates and coaches over Zoom, and trying to fill the void left by the absence of competition.
To recreate his experience on campus, football player Eric J. Wilson ’21 said he and four of his teammates lived together in Bethany Beach, Del. this semester, training together at a local gym and on the beach. His team also tried to stay connected through virtual chess and video game competitions.
Still, Wilson said the experience did not compare to playing football at Harvard.
“When you work your whole life for something, and then you’re told you can’t play, or you can’t participate in it...that just compounds and adds onto itself, kind of creating a dumpster fire of a semester for mental health,” he said.
“It’s not due to a lack of support from the school, from the football team,” he added. “It’s just — it’s so hard.”
Harvard’s Athletics Department offers a host of resources to support student-athlete mental health.
In 2019, the department teamed up with Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services to launch the Crimson Mind and Body Performance Program, which provides mental health services tailored to undergraduates on varsity sports teams.
Darryl Lemus and Melissa Nauman, Harvard mental health clinicians who work with student-athletes and coaches, wrote in an emailed statement that the program’s staff members are “working hard” to provide support for student-athletes regardless of where they are living this semester.
“We continue to offer our services virtually, including one-on-one therapy, workshops and team talks,” they wrote. “We have adjusted the themes of our programming to address current student-athlete stressors, including issues of loss of sports season, decreased structure, and a lack of physical contact with teammates.”
To support athletes during the pandemic, Harvard Athletics emails bi-monthly newsletters to athletes offering miscellaneous health information, ranging from nutritional tips on “building your plate” to single-leg strengthening exercises.
Even so, Student-Athlete Advisory Committee president Matthew R. Thomas ’21 said the discontinuation of athletics has eroded his “sense of identity.”
“Without a larger goal in mind or other people to know that I am working towards it with, it’s hard to sometimes find my footing and realize my motivation for doing what I do,” Thomas said.
“As a senior, all of that is only magnified now, knowing I may never do that again,” he added.
To promote athlete mental health, last year SAAC unveiled the Student-Athlete Wellness Leader program — which designates an athlete on each of Harvard’s varsity teams to help their teammates navigate the University’s health and wellness resources.
Heavyweight rower Jillian T. McEneaney ’21 said the semester’s remote format has limited her role as a head Student-Athlete Wellness Leader.
“Normally, whereas I’d see everyone on my team every day and get to have a personal conversation with them all, it’s been much more difficult to reach out and see how people are doing,” she said.
Without the ability to refer student-athletes to in-person wellness resources — such as workshops led by CAMHS clinicians — Student-Athlete Wellness Leaders are left to recommend online resources to their peers, according to McEneaney.
“We direct them to more online resources, but it’s not the same effect,” she said. “A lot of people say they’d rather not have an impersonal discussion online instead of being face-to-face with CAMHS providers.”
Women of Harvard Athletics, a student-run organization that aims to support female student-athletes, has also offered mental health support during the pandemic, per fencer Maria A. Theodore ’23, one of the group’s board members.
In September, the group hosted an event on the subject of “intuitive eating” — an issue Theodore said she believes is particularly salient during quarantine.
“What I struggled with at the beginning was not training all the time. I have to fuel my body differently. I'm not burning as many calories as I was on campus so I need to kind of adjust,” she said. “That became a little stressful and I was like, ‘I can’t have this, I can have this, I can't have this.’ And it was taking a toll.”
While some student-athletes said they miss the structure and purpose that sports provided them, others said the pandemic has given them a break from their lives on campus — when they juggled Harvard academics and Division I athletics.
Theodore said she had developed fatigue from giving “100 percent on both athletics and academics” on campus.
“I’ve taken more time for myself and care for myself,” she said. “I think it has allowed me to breathe a little bit more and gather my thoughts a little bit better.”
To prioritize her mental health this past semester, Theodore said she takes walks, practices yoga, and sings.
Harvard women’s basketball and lacrosse player Margaret P. “Maggie” McCarthy ’22 said she has taken advantage of the cancelation of sports to pursue new opportunities. McCarthy, who is on a gap year, spent a month backpacking in Colorado.
“I've always been on the go and working to the next thing, but I never imagined taking a gap year, but now I have the opportunity to do that,” she said.
Theodore, a Classics concentrator, said she has adopted the Latin phrase “mens sana in corpore sano ”as her motto during the pandemic. It translates to “a healthy mind in a healthy body.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Anthropology department has formed eight subcommittees — alongside hiring an external consultant and launching faculty outreach efforts — in order to address longstanding climate issues that surfaced this summer.
An investigation by The Crimson published in May revealed that three male faculty — former department chairs Theodore C. Bestor and Gary Urton and professor John L. Comaroff — faced allegations of sexual harassment, and that dozens of current and former students felt the department's culture placed women at a disadvantage.
In the ensuing months, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay placed both Urton and Comaroff on paid administrative leave pending investigations; Urton retired in August. In an early December interview, Gay declined to comment on the progress of the investigations or whether they are ongoing.
Three days after The Crimson’s story, the department announced the establishment of a standing committee in late May to “work to dismantle” structures that contributed to “an environment in which abuses continue to manifest and go undetected.” Alumni and current students also petitioned the department to make significant changes to improve its culture.
Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian wrote in an email Sunday that the committee’s work is progressing despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with a goal of releasing recommendations by the end of the academic year.
“While this effort was precipitated by allegations of misconduct, it is intended as much more than a reparative exercise,” she wrote. “Our self-study is a longitudinal analysis of key aspects of departmental culture and practice from admissions and hiring to curriculum reform, advising, community building, and professionalization.”
“We would recommend that every academic unit at Harvard take on a self-study of this kind,” she added.
Professor Christina G. Warinner, who is heading the full standing committee, said the committee members — which include 28 faculty, department staff, undergraduates, graduate students, museum staff, and alumni — spent a long time developing the committee’s structure to make sure people would feel safe reporting issues and confident those concerns would be addressed.
“Hearing directly from each other, from different people who are in different positions, is critical to identifying and solving problems, improving communication, and basically strengthening our community,” Warinner said. “So this was really important to have broad participation, and I’ve been so pleased with how many people have come forward and been willing to share and participate.”
Subramanian and Warinner both said their faculty colleagues have been receptive to the reforms and committee work.
The eight subcommittees each focus on a different domain identified as a need by the full committee, such as department diversity, advising, professional development, and accountability. They will each meet twice a month during the spring semester, beginning by collecting feedback through outreach and ultimately developing subcommittee reports that the full committee will integrate into its final recommendations.
Anthropology concentrator Madeline C. Heilbrun ’22, who is serving on the professional trajectories subcommittee, wrote in an email that she’s confident the standing committee will be able to effect “meaningful change.”
“Our efforts are not simply checking the box of responding to the allegations, rather we are diving deep into the issues and having difficult conversations in a supportive, open environment,” she wrote.
Still, some students said they feel the committee’s efforts are not expansive enough.
Ph.D. student Aurora F. Allshouse said the committee is doing its best but failing to address less overt forms of faculty misbehavior — including emotional abuse, bullying, racism, and misogyny — which she said still take place in the department.
“There is no oversight unless it reaches violence, there is no oversight just for the day-to-day bullying or harassment and stuff like that,” she said.
She and fellow Ph.D. student Melina Seabrook — who both serve on subcommittees — said they were explicitly told the standing committee could not address certain behaviors unless they crossed a certain line of severity. Allshouse and Seabrook said they worry that if faculty are allowed to get away with microaggressions and other less serious misbehavior, it will escalate into serious abuse such as sexual harassment.
“That’s how it starts — if he knows he can get away with, like, insulting and belittling and making small gendered comments to you, he knows he can get away with more,” Allshouse said.
Seabrook added that students are grateful for Warinner’s work on the committee and wish even more faculty would take up the cause.
“Tina has done such incredible work since she’s gotten here, but it is almost embarrassing that it is taking a young, untenured woman to come into this department and try and enact the change that should have been done 20 years ago,” Seabrook said.
Subramanian declined to respond directly to Allshouse and Seabrook’s statements, but wrote that it will take time for the committee to rebuild trust and empower vulnerable members of the department to speak out.
“The past nine months have revealed power dynamics and fault lines that are not limited to relations between faculty and students,” she wrote. “Understanding and addressing these dynamics takes time and we are working hard to do so while ensuring that we are continuing the critical teaching and advising work of an academic department.”
Beyond the standing committee, the department also hired a crisis management consultant, Edith Onderick-Harvey, to help organize the standing committee and assist with communications. Onderick-Harvey declined to comment for this story.
Anthropology has also been active in FAS’s cross-disciplinary cluster hire of three to four faculty specializing in ethnic studies, hosting two anthropologists to speak at virtual events in November as part of the search.
Separately, both the department's social anthropology and archaeology wings have organized speaker series to bring in outside scholars' perspectives. The archaeology faculty also created an informal career development seminar series and a Slack workspace for camaraderie.
In the spring, the department will host bystander, Title IX, and field research ethics training workshops and look to improve its advising, according to Subramanian.
Warinner, the standing committee chair, said she recognized the urgency of addressing many of the department’s issues, but noted the importance of spending time to find solutions which will endure.
“I know a lot of us wish we could move faster, but I think that in order to do our work well, we also need to take the time to really reach out, to listen, and to speak to a lot of people,” she said. “So that’s what we are taking the time to do.”
