After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an ambitious and varied program, the Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc) gave its first concert of the year this past Saturday. Directed by Yuga J. Cohler ’11, BachSoc tackled smaller, more esoteric works before launching into a shaky attempt at Beethoven’s renowned seventh symphony. Under the gilded lettering of “Beethoven” in Paine Hall, the orchestra opened with Giaochino Rossini’s overture to “L’Italiana in Algeri” of 1813. Rossini is almost always certain to entertain, but this rendition conveyed more fluff than spectacle. Opening pizzicato passages fell together in a rather silly dance, often muddled and uncertain. Ultimately, however, Cohler led BachSoc to a driving, forceful conclusion. Here, vigor stood in for precision.
BachSoc followed this opening piece with “Three Places in New England,” a challenging programmatic work by American insurance-agent-cum-radical-composer Charles Ives. Cohler and company navigated Ives’s eerie landscapes with strong dynamic contrasts. A slow, grinding build to a grating climax marks the first movement, recalling Civil War colonel Robert Shaw and his 54th Regiment. A boisterous folk-march follows in the middle movement, which at points could have accompanied rigorous head-banging in its near-deafening cacophony. A desolate and sparse finale resembled the first movement, but without dramatic build. Although one must appreciate BachSoc’s attempt to program contrasting, surprising works, their concert’s combination of Rossini and Ives was truly bizarre.
BachSoc finished the night with an impassioned—although perhaps not nuanced—offering of Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 7 in A Major.” Despite overall rhythmic clarity and well-conceived dramatic pauses between sections, a lack of dynamic balance plagued this performance from the start. Especially in the famous second movement, the brass completely overpowered the string sections, ridding this profound narrative of all drama. The third movement, however, skipped along with appropriate jaunt and zest. Several mishaps in the brass section almost derailed the final Allegro con brio, which came to a powerful (i.e. “loud”) yet abrupt conclusion. And there Beethoven remained, poised above the Paine Hall stage, probably thinking, “A für effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 3-3 tie with Yale last night, the Harvard women’s hockey team bounced back this afternoon with a dominant 4-2 win over Brown. The win came from the efforts of sophomores Josephine Pucci and Jillian Dempsey, and tri-captains Liza Ryabkina and Kate Buesser.
The Crimson had some initial trouble finding the back of the cage in the first period, in which Harvard outshot the Bears, 13-7. Success finally came with 1:29 left in the first period. Pucci halted a breakout attempt by Brown and made a quick switch from defense to offense, winding through her opponents until she found the top  corner of the goal.
The second period was a different story, with the Crimson coming out strong and banging in back-to-back goals. With just under 10 minutes to play in the second, Ryabkina took a pass from sophomore Kaitlin Spurling and buried the puck in the back of the net. 58 seconds later, Dempsey made her mark, finishing the rebound of a shot from freshman Gina McDonald.
After Harvard took a commanding 3-0 lead, the Bears pulled together a comeback effort through the pair of goals from Erica Kromm in the second period and Alena Polenska in the final period. But the Crimson closed the deal with Buesser’s goal following back-to-back penalties by Brown.
The Crimson is now 1-0-1 and faces conference rival No. 2 Cornell Nov. 5 in Ithaca, N.Y.

In celebration of Halloween, Harvard Square businesses are participating in Harvard Scare, a set of local deals and events taking place this weekend. Here are some of the sweetest steals.
Boloco will be selling two original size burritos for $9 after 7 p.m. from Friday until Tuesday.
If the deal really strikes your fancy, you can recycle the obscene number of foil wraps you acquire by turning them into a costume. (The Tin Man, anyone?)
Then, take that aluminum-chic costume on over to Uno Chicago Grill or The Upper Crust on Sunday to participate in the establishments’ costume contests. The victor takes home a $50 gift card from either establishment.
Or, add some spook to your study break with special Halloween inspired flavors at toppings at BerryLine, such as the “Brain Matter” flavor. Halloween may be scary, but midterms are horrifying.

What could possibly be manlier than a full English breakfast of sausage, eggs, and bacon, slathered with butter and cream?
How about a high sperm count?
According to the Daily Telegraph, researchers at Harvard Medical School found that a diet rich in saturated fats (such as a hot breakfast) can reduce sperm count by nearly half. The effects of such a diet are also non-discriminatory—fat and thin men experienced the same negative effects.
After examining the diets of 91 men seeking fertility treatment, a research team led by Dr. Jill Attaman determined that those in the highest third of saturated fat intake had 41 percent fewer sperm than those in the lowest third. A similar conclusion was made about the effects of monounsaturated fats. On the other hand, it was found that a higher intake of polyunsaturated fats (such as the omega acids in oily fish) improved fertility.
Experts say this study is important because it shows a man can lead to a couple’s infertility just as often as a woman can.
Surprisingly, doctors recommend eating a well-balanced, healthy diet to combat the issue.
