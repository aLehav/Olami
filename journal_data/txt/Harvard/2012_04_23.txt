After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Tuesday, officials from the Government Services Agency were paraded before a Congressional committee and interrogated about the agency’s $823,000 conference in Las Vegas. This same week, U.S. officials opened an investigation on a group of Secret Service agents who threw a hotel room party, possibly involving prostitutes, while waiting for President Obama’s arrival in Colombia. These scandals have led politicians on both sides of the aisle to denounce the “culture of fraud, waste, and corruption” among Washington bureaucrats. During the GSA hearing, Transportation subcommittee chairman Jeff Denham commented that given activities like these, “We wonder why there is so much mistrust in government.”
Congressman Denham, you should not be so quick to judge. It is not mistrust in bureaucratic officials and their inclinations to party, but mistrust in our nation’s political leaders, that is truly damaging. Over the past 30 years, Congress’ approval rating has fallen from a pretty bad 39 percent after the 2012 election to an abysmal 12 percent in the latest polls. It is Congress’ inability to tackle effectively the defining issues of our time that is truly detrimental. While Congress berates these bureaucrats, it is distracted from more important matters. Our country still has no clear plan about our energy future. We still lack a plan to fix our broken education system. Our infrastructure continues to crumble while Congressional officials opine on government employees’ sex lives.
This is not to say that these scandals should be ignored or thrown under the rug. Government agents hosting parties in Las Vegas or partying in Colombia while on official government business is indeed outrageous, and offenders should be dealt with harshly. Those directly involved in these incidents should be fired if the investigators find evidence suggesting that such punishment is appropriate. The directors of agencies that allow scandalous abuses of power to take place under their watch should also be investigated. However, these investigations do not need to be a matter of public concern. Moreover, members of Congress should not use scandals in government agencies to distract Americans from the real issues at hand. They must not harp on agency abuses in order to cast themselves, in contrast, as exemplar government officials and defenders of the taxpayer.
Last summer, Congress muddled through negotiations over how to decrease our deficit and deal with our debt problem. Many politicians focused on the need to cut waste, fraud, and abuse, and ignored the more important need to raise taxes and enact entitlement reform. In the end, Congress’s inability to focus on core issues simply kicked the can down the road. It eventually passed on the responsibility of deficit report to a supercommittee, and enacted automatic cuts if this supercommittee failed to find those cuts (which it did). Still, those automatic cuts are tepid, and Congress can cancel them if it wishes to. Congress has still failed to address key, foundational issues, leaving Americans with a temporary and unsustainable solution to the deficit crisis. This uncertainty is worse for the taxpayer than the recent GSA and Secret Service scandals. It is no less wasteful for our money to be thrown away on unnecessary interest payments than on bureaucrats’ parties.
The United States rates a respectable 7.1 out of 10 on the Corruption Perceptions Index. Unlike many countries, in which government employees regularly embezzle and abuse taxpayer dollars, America has a fairly good record on government accountability, and structures to investigate any abuses. These parties were singular incidents and to portray them as otherwise is disingenuous.
Therefore, it would do the country well for Congress to quickly deal with these transgressions and get back to work that really matters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The deterioration of American community has become an increasingly examined problem in social science. Some of its major descriptors include Charles A. Murray ‘65, the W. H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and, more recently, the author of “Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010”; and Robert D. Putnam, the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of “Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.”
I was interested in what my graduating Harvard friends and I could do to stave off the decline of American social capital—social networks and the trust and norms of reciprocity that result from them—that both scholars identify. In Coming Apart, Murray argues that, since the 1960s, there has been a qualitative divergence between a “new lower class” and a “new upper class.” The vast majority of Harvard graduates end up in the latter group. As Murray writes, the new upper class “share tastes, preferences, and culture” more so than ever and has become “increasingly isolated” along residential, economic, educational, and (often) political lines. This split, then, signifies damage to “the American project”—the capacity for individuals to live their lives as they choose and to join together to solve common problems—and to our community more broadly.
I asked Murray what members of my graduating class could do, the 22 year-olds who will leave the Harvard bubble in May, but he answered with a gloomy outlook. “Not much,” he said. “A great deal of social capital…is generated by the exigencies of family.” Since most of us will graduate Harvard without spouses and children, we will lack these “motivating forces.” But he did offer a few pieces of advice: we should learn our crafts and get to know the world around us, move to neighborhoods with high socioeconomic diversity, or find jobs in cities unusual for young Harvard graduates, like Kansas City or Des Moines. Murray, a libertarian, does not believe the government can fix these problems; they must come from citizens themselves.
Putnam, whose course Government 98qa: Community in America I’m currently taking, offered a more optimistic forecast for our cohort. “The generation of young people who were caught in their impressionable years by the moment of 9/11 seem to have been permanently marked by it and to be more civic-minded than people even a few years older than them,” he told me, while cautiously noting that it is unclear how long this civic spiritedness will last.
He pointed out, however, that a recent rise in volunteering has likely resulted more from a desire to boost resumes than from a dedication to service. Nevertheless, research shows that people who participated in extracurricular activities in high school remain more civically involved 50 years later. According to Putnam, “being involved in community activities doesn’t merely have to be a matter of burnishing your resume.” Additionally, while he appreciates community service that focuses on individuals, Putnam recommends that young people focus on the “larger picture”—addressing the social structures that render some students illiterate, not just tutoring on an individual basis. Doing so will require changing public policy and becoming involved in civic life and politics.
Harvard students have always been involved in the communities around us. Being active in high school was necessary for admission. Much of what brought us to Harvard was a surefire confidence in our own self-realization: leadership credentials, extracurricular achievement, individual smarts, and work ethic. But as Amy Poehler said in her Class Day speech last year, “you can’t do it alone.” A ticket to Harvard was a singular reward for a fundamentally collective effort; we wouldn’t have gotten here without the support of the friends, family, teachers, and organizations we worked with. Since arriving at Harvard, we’ve continued to share in communal activities, and college has been an ideal model of a social capital-filled world. We have lived together, formed study groups, supported each other in plays and concerts, and played intramural sports. Just because we graduate doesn’t mean we have to stop engaging with our communities in meaningful ways.
As Murray said to me, “the affluent people in this country…have gotten very good at living glossy lives.” But, he added, “they aren’t textured lives.” No matter whether we came from or are headed to the new upper class, living and working together has made our time in college textured. Our experience creating rich communities at Harvard ought not stay here. We might not need our own families to recognize the problems of our neighborhoods, host potluck dinners, start bands, join clubs, and become deeply involved in the public sphere—in other words, to do the stuff of social capital—because Harvard has already given us practice.
In our own small ways, then, we have the opportunity to help rebuild American community. Whether we do so is, as Putnam told me, up to us.

Last Monday, the Harvard community welcomed the news that professor Stephen J. Greenblatt of the English Department received a Pulitzer Prize in the category of General Nonfiction for his book “The Swerve: How the World Became Modern.” The Pulitzers, awarded annually, recognize special achievement in the fields of letters, drama, and music and are among the highest honor that a writer can receive. Professor Greenblatt’s book, which describes the discovery of Lucretius’ epic poem “On the Nature of Things,” its vibrant narrative, and its connection to modernity, justly merited the award.
We would like to congratulate professor Greenblatt for his accolade at the same time as we recognize the numerous high-profile prizes that Harvard affiliates have received in the recent past. James Wood, who is also a professor in the English Department, was two weeks elected to a fellowship at the prestigious Royal Society of Literature. He joins the company of such names as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Butler Yeats, and will have the opportunity to confirm his membership using either Lord Byron’s quill or Charles Dickens’s pen. In another coup for the humanities, Briggs-Copeland Lecturer Henri Cole obtained the prestigious Jackson Poetry Prize, accompanied by a lucrative financial purse. To mention just one last outstanding example, the two recipients of last year’s Nobel Prize in Economics both count Harvard as an alma mater. Thomas J. Sargent, currently at New York University, received his Ph.D here, as did Christopher A. Sims ’68, also an alumnus of the college.
Such positive news as these awards, and the many others collected by Harvard affiliates, should be vaunted at our university. Harvard has enormous prestige, but our institution should not ever be content to rest on its laurels or even for a moment look to past achievement without prioritizing what can be accomplished in the future. Each new accolade received by a Harvard affiliate not only grants personal recognition where it is well deserved, but also clearly enhances the reputation of the University as a whole. These awards serve as confirmation that, nearly four centuries after its establishment, Harvard continues to be a vibrant hotspot for original thinking.
In the case of professor Greenblatt in particular, it is heartening to see that professors can produce work that balances innovative scholarship with popular appeal. Academia should be concerned not only with the depth of its research, but also with the breadth of its reach. Works like “The Swerve,” whose author is widely credited with formulating the theory of New Historicism, help make scholarship accessible to mass audiences, an interaction that benefits wider readers and academia alike.
On a different note, it is reproachable that the jury for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction did not elect a winner among the three finalists. The judges declined to offer the award, noting that none of the finalists—Denis Johnson’s “Train Dreams,” Karen Russell’s “Swamplandia!” and David Foster Wallace’s posthumously published “The Pale King”—had received the necessary majority. Prizes like the Pulitzer are crucial for stimulating interest in promising authors, especially during this difficult time for the publishing industry. It is perhaps especially unfortunate that the judges chose to snub David Foster Wallace, whose tragic suicide in 2008 deprived the literary world of one of its brightest stars. This would have been a fitting occasion to honor his memory, and his work. Wallace once studied philosophy at Harvard, and a Pulitzer for him would have been yet more welcome news. However, at least as far as prizes are concerned, we are proud to note that Harvard has had plenty of good news in recent days.

Harvard University offers a wide variety of social events for students, but few are quite as expansive as Yardfest. As someone who has devoted time to running this event over the past few years, there was nothing that disappointed me more than hearing students complain about how unhappy they were with the event. While I was largely uninvolved with the process this year, I was acutely aware of the limitations faced by the Harvard College Concert Commission and the College Events Board in the selection of artists. While some students may have been pleased with the selection, the level of enthusiasm for this iteration of Yardfest was the lowest I’ve ever witnessed. It’s easy to pin blame on the CEB and HCC for the quality of the event, but as someone who has helped select artists, having a small budget doesn’t leave much room to hire most musicians. It is also counterproductive to blame the university for providing limited funding—there are plenty of important economic issues at Harvard that probably require more attention. However, I do believe that this event can and should be improved. Most other schools avoid the problems we face by charging for tickets, and I think that this can be done at Harvard without compromising the essential mission of Yardfest.
Based on my interactions with the administration and planning organizations, Yardfest was envisioned as an event to unite the student body for a day of music, relaxation, and fun. At a university that is extremely vigilant of the exclusivity it can breed, unifying the undergraduate population is a valiant goal. There aren’t many other opportunities to do this—Harvard doesn’t turn 375 years old every year, house formals can’t accommodate everyone, and neither can dorm parties or Final Clubs. Given the unique nature of this event and its ability to bring together over six thousand students who are generally busy with their demanding personal and academic lives, structural changes should be implemented to improve the event. If Harvard truly cannot contribute more funding to the event, I think the best option would be to charge students a small sum of $10 or $15 for entry.
Most of our fun events at Harvard—like formals and senior week—cost money. For those who can’t afford these events, Harvard has graciously established the Student Events Fund. Given that Yardfest happens once, the cost is minimal, especially if students know their money expands the pool of artists the HCC and CEB can choose from. Not only would this make it easier for these organizations to bring more artists who may appeal to a wider audience, but it would also make compromise between these groups easier. This, I believe, would lead to more appealing and musically diverse lineups.
When I was on the artist selection subcommittee, our petty fights stemmed from scarcity of resources rather than an inability to find artists that we thought the student body, regardless of their music tastes, would have a great time listening to. Anyone who has friends at other colleges knows what our Yardfest lineups could look like. Those lineups don’t happen because these colleges provide unlimited funding for the event—they happen because students buy tickets. While in an ideal world the event would remain free and attract the likes of high-caliber and popular musicians, that’s not the world we live in. Economic realities make that unlikely in the near-term, but if Harvard really cares about making Yardfest the special and exciting event that it is supposed to be, it should seriously reconsider charging for entry. Maybe I’m in the minority, but I think great music and a day with all your fellow undergraduates is well worth paying for.

In a reversal of the typical pattern of many a campus conversation on the Middle East, the Israel Conference at Harvard on Thursday and Friday aimed to discuss ways that Israel can help the rest of the world rather than ways that the world can help solve problems in Israel, organizers of the student-led symposium said.
The two-day series of panels and speeches, which brought more than 20 prominent speakers from around the world to Harvard, was organized by a group of 11 students from the College, Business School, Kennedy School, and Law School.
The event focused on Israel’s innovations in the fields of technology, medicine, humanitarian aid, and education.
“We wanted to show a different face of Israel that is more nuanced, multidimensional, and holistic,” said Yoav B. G. Schaefer ’15, one of the student leaders of the event who fought in the Israeli army before coming to Harvard. “This is for people to see how Israel is changing the world.”
At the opening panel on Thursday evening, Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, appeared with Dan Senor, bestselling author of “Start-Up Nation,” and history professor Niall Ferguson. They discussed the historical and political conditions that contributed to Israel’s high-tech success.
The 64-year-old country of 7.6 million people churns out more start-up industries, venture capital firms, and NASDAQ companies than vastly more populous and more politically stable nations like Japan, China, and India, Senor said.
More than 600 people attended the opening event, which had to be moved to a bigger room at the Business School to accommodate the crowd.
“Israel is becoming synonymous in a lot of circles for innovative thinking,” said Zaki Djemal ’15, another former Israeli soldier who helped lead the conference. “We do not deny that there are still a lot of problematic issues with our country, but before delving into them, you have to acknowledge what is good already.”
Friday’s panels on economic development and social entrepreneurship did just that. Guests included Dov Moran, the founder of the company that invented the USB flash drive; Yoav Medan, who invented a noninvasive surgery method; and Yariv Bash, an aeronaut who hopes to make Israel the third nation to land on the moon.
The struggle for peace in Israel did underscore much of the discussion about technological innovation.
At the conference, the organizers announced the winner of their Peace Challenge, which judged essays on ways to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Kennedy School student Joel Braunold won the prize for his proposal to build extra village housing in the north and south of the country to facilitate resettlement.
Former U.S. Ambassador Dennis Ross repeatedly quoted Braunold’s proposal in his closing speech at the conference and praised his plan as “fitting his general hybrid model for peace diplomacy.”

Descending upon Harvard en masse, prospective members of the Class of 2016 scurried from event to event this weekend to get a taste of life on campus before making their final decisons.
Roughly 1,300 prefrosh attended Visitas, the visiting program for admitted students, according to the College’s Admission Office. Throughout the weekend, these new admits could be seen wandering campus, maps in hand, attending a variety of programs meant to acquaint them with all that Harvard has to offer.
University President Drew G. Faust welcomed the prospective freshmen and their families to Visitas in Sanders Theatre on Saturday. According to the Admissions Office, upwards of 300 prefrosh and their families had to watch the welcome address by simulcast in an overflow room in the Science Center.
In her address, Faust praised the many opportunities for growth and discovery that the College provides its students.
“Harvard is about trying new things because they’re interesting, because you’re curious,” she said.
Faust sympathized with the difficult decision many prospective students face when choosing a college—describing Harvard as a committed lover and the prospective students as the fickle one. “We think you belong here....You’re still trying to decide if you want to confirm our relationship status,” she said, using a popular turn of phrase inspired by Facebook.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 opened his welcome with an allusion to Jeremy Lin ’10, a New York Knicks player who rose to international reknown after a string of sensational performances earlier this year.
“I should start by welcoming you to Jeremy Lin’s college,” Fitzsimmons said.
Fitzsimmons urged prospective students to choose wisely when selecting where to spend the next four years.
“We want you to look carefully to decide which college is right for you,” Fitzsimmons said.
When prefrosh exited Memorial Hall and the Science Center, they were greeted by blasting music and the smell of barbecue. The event, hosted by Asian cultural groups at Harvard, was one of the more than 100 events put on by student organizations to introduce prefrosh to Harvard’s extracurricular scene.
Besides events hosted by student groups, prefrosh could take their pick of performances, social events, and a number of panel sessions, which discussed topics ranging from gap years to the advising program.
Many new admits said they enjoyed their weekend at Harvard.
“I really like the environment,” David Ding said. Ding said he particularly enjoyed “Visitas Thinks Big” and found the professors’ lectures engaging.
Others prefrosh said they found choosing between the variety events overwhelming.
“It’s hard to figure out what to go to,” Bethany L. Donovan said. “The extracurricular fair was totally bewildering.”
Prefrosh Mimi Yen said she wished the College organized events with alumni who graduated from the high schools that prefrosh currently attend.
On Monday, prefrosh are encouraged to attend classes and many academic departments will hold open houses.
The Class of 2016 saw the College’s lowest admit rate to date—only 5.9 percent of applicants were accepted.

Swimmers from across the Boston area competed on Saturday to raise money for cancer research, at a Swim Across America fundraising event at Blodgett Pool.
The event, which is part of a national campaign, challenges participants to raise money by swimming for two hours straight. Teams swam a relay-style race, competing to swim the greatest total distance. Extra distance was added to teams’ totals for their fundraising efforts. For every $100 raised, teams were awarded with 100 yards extra distance.
“There’s the college teams—Harvard and Tufts—and then there are people in their 70’s who are swimming,” event organizer Janel S. Jorgensen said. “Its all about having fun and trying to make a difference.”
The event was the first of its kind to be held at Harvard, but Swim Across America has been raising money for cancer research since 1987. This particular event raised over $55,000, according to Jorgensen.
Swim Across America has hosted events at colleges and recreation centers, as well as outdoor open water swims. In one notable event, competitors swam under the Golden Gate Bridge.
The organization often partners with Olympic swimmers to raise awareness as well as money. Harvard’s own Olympian, Alex M. Meyer ’10, who has previously participated in the event, came to cheer on swimmers at Saturday’s event.
The former Harvard men’s swimming co-captain, who sported a Swim Across America zip-up, said that he is proud to have participated in Swim Across America events and plans to in the future.
“This is obviously a great cause,” he said.
Kim Goodwin, a cancer survivor and organizer of one of the teams, said that each member of her team was either a cancer survivor or was impacted by the illness.
“We’re all here because we have goodness in our hearts, and we’re trying to fight to find a cure for cancer,” she said. “But we’ve all lost someone or have [known] someone affected by cancer, and some of us are survivors.”
In between laps, Goodwin said that the event had a lively atmosphere and spirit.
“It’s great because you see somebody else raising, and everyone has a sort of competitive spirit, so it encourages you to raise more,” she said. “It’s wonderful to see people you never expected to donate donate...and sometimes even more than they can probably afford. It’s great to be a part of something.”

Thirteen new student organizations, whose missions range from fostering a vibrant social scene to facilitating emergency medical services, were approved for recognition by the Committee on Student Life last Thursday.
The 13 were among the 30 groups that sought official recognition from the College. Seven applications were deferred, and eight were denied.
Team HYPE of Harvard College will make its debut on campus this fall. The organization’s mission is to enhance the school’s social scene by creating fun and inclusive environments for undergraduates, according to its founder and captain Beau M. Feeny ’13.
“It will serve as a central body to augment social experiences at Harvard,” he said.
The club will provide event and publicity consulting services to other student organizations. Feeny said that Team HYPE will attempt to generate enthusiasm at campus-wide events, such as YardFest and athletic events.
CrimsonEMS, a new student-run ambulance organization, will facilitate a heavily subsidized Emergency Medical Technician-Basic training course at Harvard. It will also connect students interested in working aboard an ambulance with MIT-EMS until the group is able to establish a campus ambulance service.
“We hope to offer real world medical applications in college for all students, and this will be the best way to understand what emergency services is like,” said CrimsonEMS Chair Elliot J. Stein ’13.
Stein said that the benefits of recognition include the club’s ability to advertise to the general student population, apply for UC grants, and have a table at the student activities fair.
Members of The Nostalgics—Harvard’s first and only motown and soul band that has been performing during campus events since its founding in 2010—cited similar reasons for applying for recognition.
Charles G. Gertler ’13, one of three founders of The Nostalgics, said that recognition will give the band access to resources reserved for official student organizations such as grant money, rehearsal space, and the activities fair where he said he hoped to recruit new members.
Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13, another founding member, said they were concerned the band, whose membership is mostly comprised of juniors, might dissolve following the graduation of the Class of 2013. Gertler and Naddaff-Hafrey said that recognition will allow them to institutionalize the group and ensure its future after they leave Harvard next May.
“It lets us perpetuate what the band stands for and what is unique to The Nostalgics rather than what is unique to the founding members,” Naddaff-Hafrey said.
While the OSL administers the College’s recognition process for new organizations, the decision is made by  students on the Undergraduate Council, faculty and administrators.
Each semester, the Office of Student Life reviews proposal packets that have been submitted by students interested in creating a new student organization, according to its website.
There are currently more than 400 recognized student groups on campus, according to Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life David R. Friedrich.

UPDATED: April 24, 2012, at 7:10 p.m.
Harvard girls still looking for the perfect dress for a spring formal were in luck on Saturday when they had the opportunity to peruse a wide selection of dresses all priced at $15 at an event celebrating the launch of The Social Dresswork, a website that will allow students to rent dresses from one another throughout the year.
The rules were simple: browse the racks of dresses supplied exclusively by fellow Harvard students, find one you like and rent it for $15, and then return it to the owner by May 6. According to Laura A. Evans ’13, the founder of The Social Dresswork, the event, which was held at the Free People store in Harvard Square, was intended to serve as a pilot for an exchange process that will eventually take place online.
“What we are planning on doing at this point is having the renters go to owners’ room if they see a dress they like on the website so that they can try it on and decide whether or not they want to rent it,” Evans said. “But we understand that people have different comfort levels, so the launch party was a chance to find out how girls feel about this process and get feedback before we put up the full working program in the fall.”
According to Evans, she was inspired to create the website, along with her co-founder Ethan Barhydt ’13, when she transferred to Harvard from the University of California, Berkeley, after her freshman year and discovered that at Harvard, many clubs and organizations require formal wear for events throughout the semester.
“I didn’t want to recycle the same ones over and over,” she said. “But after I went to the store and dropped $300 on two new dresses, I thought there has to be another way to do this.”
Evans initially tested the idea for her final project in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” She later become a finalist at the i3 Innovation Challenge, a program that allows student start-ups compete for project grants and incubator space.
Evans said she plans to continue to pursue the project, with hopes to expand the site to a national level.
“My goal is that this will become an online rental marketplace on every college campus in the country,” Evans said. “Right now we are hoping to create a platform so that that opportunity is available.”
Evans reached out to fellow CS50 students and i3 competitors, Merrill H. Lutsky ’15 and Erik C. Schluntz ’15, who created PollVaultr, an online survey system that Evans used to collect customer feedback at the launch party.
“It’s great to have two i3 startups collaborating like this,” Schluntz said.
According to Lutsky and Schluntz, those who attended the launch party responded fairly enthusiastically, largely reporting that they had no qualms with the idea of renting or lending dresses to strangers.
“Just knowing that the girls who would be wearing my dresses are within the Harvard community makes me feel much more comfortable,” Deirdre E. Clute ’14 said.
Others expressed excitement about the convenience the website would provide.
“I am always asking friends if I can raid their closet for events and formals,” Sara D. Li ’14 said. “Now, it is like this website does all the work for me, and everyone’s closets are in one place.”

Currierites old and young cut cake and sipped sparkling apple cider at their House’s 40th birthday party on Sunday.
In a video message, University President Drew G. Faust said, “As President, I am not at liberty to name favorites,” but added that she feels a special connection to Currier, the only undergraduate House in which she has spent the night. Faust cited her friendship with former House Master Barbara G. Rosenkrantz, Harvard’s first female House Master and her personal friend, as explanation for her having slept at Currier.
The birthday celebration included a special dinner, a tree-planting, student concerts, and a ceremony that recognized important members of the Currier community.
As the event opened, students and alumni chanted, “Whose House? C-Haus,” while others shoveled soil over the roots of the newly-planted crabapple tree in the courtyard.
House Master Elizabeth A. Ross said, “The tree is a symbol of Currier. It is really important that we have a tree,” adding that the previous tree had died two years ago.
When everyone returned indoors, Lavinia M. Currier ’79, daughter of Audrey B. Currier ’56, the House’s namesake, gave opening remarks that honored her mother’s legacy.
“She would have been a tree-hugger,” Currier said.
The event took a particular focus on the history of Currier House’s female residents.
Currier’s first House Master, Jerome S. Bruner described Currier’s female residents as being, “tough like nails.”
After Bruner’s speech, celebrants watched a video of Currier’s history that highlighted the House’s notable residents which include Bill Gates, Yo-Yo Ma ’76, and Caroline B. Kennedy ’80.
The birthday party also marked 40th anniversary of Currier’s first graduating class, with many alumni attending Saturday’s festivities.
Blockmates Irene F. Herlihy ’89 and Michelle E. Zavez ’89 said that they felt a strong sense of community while spending their undergraduate years in Currier.
Macken said she decided to come to the celebration because she wanted to reunite with classmates in a closer, cosier setting than a class-wide event might offer.
Alumnus Francis M. Kulash ’76 said he loved living in Currier because he preferred the more open environment of the Currier buildings that foster community.
The party culminated with student performances, which included sets by the Radcliffe Pitches and the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones.
As the event winded down, House devotees chatted about their love for Currier over cake—one cake featured the House crest and the other was topped with chocolate-covered strawberries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 23, 2012, at 11:55 p.m.
Curious George Books & Toys, a once-popular specialty store located at 1 JFK Street, reopened last Wednesday under new ownership.
Owners Adam S. and Jamie S. Hirsch have sought to reinvent the store, which has been a fixture in Harvard Square for decades, as a fresh and dynamic destination for tourists and residents of the Boston area.
As Harvard Square’s only independent children’s bookstore, Curious George Books & Toys carries books ranging from the Curious George series to “Twilight” to classics such as “Jane Eyre” and “Wuthering Heights.”
“We want to continue to get children of all ages excited about reading,” Adam Hirsch said.
In addition, the store also sells puzzles, toys, and children’s clothing with unique designs.
The owners have established ties with NBC Universal and Houghton Mifflin—the publishers of the Curious George series—to gain access to their brand and library of Curious George imagery.
The Hirsches have initiated a rebranding campaign for the store, which has included efforts to build its online presence, which Hirsch said he hopes will increase awareness of the store beyond Cambridge and across the globe.
“We’re going to be creating a lifelong relationship with our patrons,” Hirsch said.
According to Hirsch, the project has been a long time in the making. Over the past three months, the store underwent major renovations, including fully gutting the interior and revamping the store with higher ceilings and large windows.
Hirsch said that he had hoped to create a space that—while fun and whimsical—was also easy to navigate for parents with strollers.
“We want people to look at the store and say ‘wow,’” Hirsch said.
Today, the store is bright and airy with colorful murals and expansive windows overlooking Harvard Square.
Five panels along the walls of the store recount the story of Curious George’s history in Cambridge.
According to Hirsch, the authors of the series, H. A. and Margret Rey, spent the last forty years of their life in Cambridge after fleeing Nazi-occupied Germany and France. The idea for Curious George was born in Cambridge.
“We see ourselves as stewards of the Curious George brand,” Hirsch said.
Curious George & Friends, the bookstore which previously occupied the location, shut its doors in summer 2011 admist a series of closings of independent bookstores in the Harvard Square area.
Given the current precarious economic climate for small businesses, Hirsch said that he is aware of the risks of opening a bookstore at this time.
Hirsch said that in order for his store to remain afloat, “there has to be an element of uniqueness.”
He hopes that their reinvigorated economic model, unusal selection of goods, and iconic location will allow Curious George to once again become a mainstay of the Cambridge community.
The store will host its official grand opening on Saturday, April 28.

Thirteen new student organizations, whose missions range from fostering a vibrant social scene to facilitating emergency medical services, were approved for recognition by the Committee on Student Life last Thursday.
The 13 were among the 30 groups that sought official recognition from the College. Seven applications were deferred, and eight were denied.
Team HYPE of Harvard College will make its debut on campus this fall. The organization’s mission is to enhance the school’s social scene by creating fun and inclusive environments for undergraduates, according to its founder and captain Beau M. Feeny ’13.
“It will serve as a central body to augment social experiences at Harvard,” he said.
The club will provide event and publicity consulting services to other student organizations. Feeny said that Team HYPE will attempt to generate enthusiasm at campus-wide events, such as Yardfest and athletic events.
CrimsonEMS, a new student-run ambulance organization, will facilitate a heavily subsidized Emergency Medical Technician-Basic training course at Harvard. It will also connect students interested in working aboard an ambulance with MIT-EMS until the group is able to establish a campus ambulance service.
“We hope to offer real world medical applications in college for all students, and this will be the best way to understand what emergency services is like,” said CrimsonEMS Chair Elliot J. Stein ’13.
Stein said that the benefits of recognition include the club’s ability to advertise to the general student population, apply for UC grants, and have a table at the student activities fair.
Members of The Nostalgics—Harvard’s first and only motown and soul band that has been performing during campus events since its founding in 2010—cited similar reasons for applying for recognition.
Charles G. Gertler ’13, one of three founders of The Nostalgics, said that recognition will give the band access to resources reserved for official student organizations such as grant money, rehearsal space, and the activities fair where he said he hoped to recruit new members.
Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13, another founding member, said they were concerned the band, whose membership is mostly comprised of juniors, might dissolve following the graduation of the Class of 2013. Gertler and Naddaff-Hafrey said that recognition will allow them to institutionalize the group and ensure its future after they leave Harvard next May.
“It lets us perpetuate what the band stands for and what is unique to The Nostalgics rather than what is unique to the founding members,” Naddaff-Hafrey said.
While the OSL administers the College’s recognition process for new organizations, the decision is made by  students on the Undergraduate Council, faculty and administrators.
Each semester, the Office of Student Life reviews proposal packets that have been submitted by students interested in creating a new student organization, according to its website.
There are currently more than 400 recognized student groups on campus, according to Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life David R. Friedrich.

Approximately 40 Boston-area high school students grappled with gender and identity on Saturday at a day-long conference led by the Athena Program.
Since 2008, Athena, a mentoring group focused on gender empowerment, has held a conference as the culmination of semester-long discussions between mentors and their teenage mentees. But this year was the first that Athena included male high school students among their mentees.
This semester’s conference was entitled “Growing Up Gendered,” and featured several rounds of workshops and a keynote address delivered by Chiwen Bao, a lecturer in the Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality.
Students could choose from workshop activities ranging from “Spoken Word: ‘Creation Stories’” to “SAT Strategies” to “Relaxation Station: Yoga.”
“We want to expose people to the broad range of issues that you can bring a gender lens to,” said Athena Director Keri A. Hartman ’12.
Many of the students who attended the conference will be first-generation college students or come from immigrant backgrounds, Hartman explained. The workshops are designed not only to broaden their thinking about gender, but also to give them practical advice.
The conference closed with a coffeehouse, during which Athena mentors encouraged students to express themselves. The group had dwindled to about 10 students by the end of the day. One boy broke the silence by standing up to perform a piece of spoken word poetry that he had composed in a conference workshop.
“This is what I made in the spoken word thing,” he said, before breaking into verse. “In the beginning, there was everlasting darkness sprouting from every corner,” he recited.`
Another student shared his spoken word piece about sharing a kiss with a friend on a snowy day. He followed the poem with an a cappella rendition of Katy Perry’s “The One That Got Away.” Three girls stood up to read an excerpt from “The Vagina Monologues,” inspired by a workshop on the play.
The conference also included a session during which female graduate students discussed their own career paths.
“My favorite part was just talking with grad students about what their lives are like now, what struggles they have, and relating to them,” said Rachael D. Saiato, an Athena mentee.
Saiato and a friend, Adriana L. Fernandez, seemed enthusiastic about the conference and left smiling and chatting.
James R. Sares ’12 said that the inclusion of male mentees added a new dynamic to the conference.
“There is still a focus on women and that is key because women are oppressed, but we try to look at how women are oppressed and how that connects to the construction of gender itself,” Sares said.

UPDATED: April 23, 2012, at 10:00 a.m.
An accomplished artist and cherished member of many Harvard extracurricular organizations, Wendy H. Chang ’12 will be remembered for her infectious laugh and outgoing personality, friends and family said after her death on Saturday.
An English concentrator and resident of Lowell House, Chang charted a lasting legacy in Harvard’s community, friends said. The cause of her death was unconfirmed as of press time.
About 300 students attended a memorial gathering for Chang held Saturday in Lowell House—a crowd so large that the memorial had to be moved from the Junior Common Room to the Dining Hall.
“It was a testament to the kind of life she led,” said E. Jordan Taylor ’12, who knew Chang through the Bee social club and attended the memorial.
Hanna Y. Choi ’12 said, “She was such an important part of the Harvard community and so many other communities within.”
Chang was also an inactive Crimson news editor.
Taylor recalled a time that Chang, whom she remembered as an “amazing cook,” prepared a steak dinner for a friend who had wanted to cook the meal for a boyfriend. Chang pretended that she hadn’t been the one to cook it, Taylor said, and refused to take credit even when she almost got caught.
“She was definitely the type of person who would go above and beyond anyone else,” Taylor said.
Many others also remembered Chang’s outstanding cooking. Once, Chang cooked an entire duck with butternut squash macaroni and cheese for her fellow Bee members. President Sofia V. McDonald ’13 said that the women still talk about the delicious meal.
“She was and will continue to be the funniest, most vibrant, most good-natured, and enthusiastic person we know,” McDonald said on behalf of the Bee. “She was an inspiration to us all.”
Several friends remembered another distinctive quality: her laugh.
“You’d see her throw her head back, and she’d scrunch her nose and let out a cry of pure joy,” McDonald described. “If you were down the street and had no idea what she was laughing at, you would start to laugh too.”
Choi recalled, “She would light up our discussions with her laugh and her enthusiasm.”
Hana Bajramovic ’13, who met Chang when they were both costume designers for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, also recalled Chang’s “wonderful, resonant laugh that echoed through the halls.” Bajramovic said Chang impressed her not only with her humor and kindness but with her artistic ability.
“Even in the silly costumes we sewed for the Pudding, she could just do so much,” Bajramovic said. “She came in the first day to the costume shop where we work and all of the sudden sat at the sewing machine and started at it.”
“There was no learning curve,” Bajramovic added. “She was good at everything.”
Felix L. J. Cook ’13, a friend and fellow member of Crimson Key Society, said that Chang’s outgoing spirit perfectly suited the service organization.
“She embodied everything we were supposed to be—gregarious, fun, friendly,” Cook said. “She was just amazing to be around.... I don’t know what the Crimson Key will be like without her.”
Chang, an avid painter pursuing a secondary field in visual and environmental studies, further demonstrated her passion for the arts as a designer for the Harvard Advocate.
“She was a crucial figure in the life of the Advocate and the Advocate community,” said Julian B. Gewirtz ’13, who was the publisher of the literary journal during Chang’s second year as a designer. “It’s a really staggering and overwhelming loss.”
Gewirtz recalled that one day, when working on the layout for the Advocate, he told Chang he was going on a coffee run. She told him that there was an amazing drink at Crema Café that he needed to try—a white cranberry juice and rooibos tea called Red Nectar.
Gewirtz said he ordered the drink, because on these matters, “Always trust Wendy.” It was fantastic, Gewirtz added.
“And every time I have that drink, even long before today, I would always think, ‘Oh, Wendy’s Drink,’” Gewirtz said. “It is that kind of small gesture that she made, that cumulatively will be one of the many ways that we will remember her and extend her memory into our own lives, which I suppose is the only thing that one can do.”

Andrei H. Cherny ’97 has had many titles: youngest presidential speechwriter in history, bestselling novelist, Arizona assistant attorney general, Arizona State Democratic Party chair, business consultant, and research fellow, to name a few. And now he wants to add another: Congressman.
Cherny is one of the leading Democratic candidates for Arizona’s Ninth Congressional District seat, a new spot created after the 2010 census showed that the state’s population had increased enough to merit another Congressman.
Cherny, who reflects on the struggles of his immigrant parents and his own experience working his way through Harvard with the aid of student loans, says that his campaign centers on shoring up America’s support systems for the middle class.
“We really decided to [run] because of the crisis that I think we’re heading for in our country, where we’re seeing the ladder of upward mobility breaking down in the country...and a political system that seems rigged against those basic building blocks of America,” Cherney said.
Cherny’s bid comes fifteen years after he stepped onto the national political scene almost by accident while still Harvard senior in 1996. As a columnist for The Crimson, he wrote a column after the 1996 presidential election which analyzed Bill Clinton’s surprising come-from-behind victory and teased out much of the symbolic campaigning that had brought the incumbent back from the political dead.
The White House communications director came across the column and circulated it among the upper circles of the president’s staff and onto the desk of Clinton himself. The president liked it so much that he borrowed several phrases for his 1997 inaugural address and offered Cherny a job. Just 10 days after graduating, the Crimson columnist became the youngest speechwriter in White House history.
“[Clinton] said to me at the time that it was the best distillation of the ideas he had been trying to run on and govern on that he had read anywhere, and the fact that it was a column by a college student was something that tickled him,” Cherny said.
Cherny rose through the ranks of Democratic politics before turning to writing and consulting. After the terrorist attacks of Septemer 11, 2001, he joined the Naval Reserves.
In 2007, Harvard Law School professor and now-U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren used Democracy, a progressive journal that Cherny founded, to launch her campaign to start the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cherny was instrumental in finding early funding for her campaign and advocating her cause.
“I think I’ve had a career that was somewhat unique, and I’ve been lucky to have a foot in the world of ideas,” Cherny said. “For me it’s really a belief in the power of ideas, and the impact that they can make.”
Local political experts said that since Cherny grew up in California and has lived in Arizona for less than a decade, he is seen as a political insider, prized for his Washington connections but unknown to most voters.
“I think at this point, most people view Andrei as the frontrunner in the race, largely because he’s a guy that has connections to raise a lot of money,” said Jim Small, editor of The Arizona Capitol Times.
Small said Cherny’s biggest challenge will be getting his name out to voters, who are more familiar with his Democratic opponents, Kyrsten Sinema and David Schapira, both Arizona political veterans.
Political dollars should come in handy for that purpose, Small said, and the former state party chair will have plenty. Cherny’s campaign raised over $400,000 in the first quarter of 2012, far more than any of his opponents and the fourth most of any Congressional candidate in the country, he said.

Although the playing season is long over, the Twitter season never stops for the captains of the Harvard men’s basketball team.
Last week, we brought you our favorite tweets from co-captain shooting guard Oliver McNally. Apparently, the attention did not go unnoticed, since  an incoming captain stepped up his Twitter game this week.
Here are our favorite tweets from the week from and about the Harvard basketball captains.
1) Like most Harvard students, co-captain-elect junior point guard Brandyn Curry started his week by enjoying the beautiful weather and horrible artists at Yardfest. He tweeted this last Sunday:
“Today would be a bomb day if we actually had good artist performing for yardfest. Idk how Harvard decides to get these people”
If only we had a huge endowment to get better artists…
2) Curry continued to provide updates on his whereabouts throughout the week. According to his Twitter, he spent enough time at the IM innertube water polo tournaments to come to this conclusion:
“This intertube water polo actually pretty fun. I might have to play it next year #seniorspringtodolist”
Bold prediction for next year: Brandyn Curry will be the first Harvard athlete to win championships in Ivy League basketball and IM innertube water polo. #versatility
3) A few miles down the I-95, former Yale basketball player Greg Mangano, having closed the books on his college career, is seeing the light.  The Bulldogs’ big man gave one of Harvard’s finest this compliment via Twitter:
“Who knew hoopin with a dude from Harvard would be that good of a time this dude @KWright44 is a clown hahah”
Or maybe hooping with the dudes from Yale is just that bad of a time. Should have come to Harvard, Greg.
Those are the tweets of the week. Who knew tweets from Harvard hoops would be that good of a time?

On paper, it was an impressive weekend for the Harvard men’s soccer team. But, in reality, it was much more than that.
The Crimson welcomed the Cape Verde All-Stars on Friday night to Harvard Stadium before hosting the Haitian national team Sunday night. Both games drew over 1000 fans, most Cape Verdean and Haitian supporters sporting their countries’ colors or waving flags.
Friday’s game supported Coaches Across Continents, an organization devoted to social change through the implementation of soccer leagues in impoverished countries. Sunday night benefitted Partners in Health, a global health initiative, founded in part by Harvard professor Dr. Paul Farmer, that is assisting post-earthquake Haiti’s health infrastructure.
On the pitch, each shot, run, and pass finding a player in space was greeted by loud cheers and gasps, as the Boston area Haitian and Cape Verdean communities were well-represented at Harvard Stadium. Under Sunday night’s rain, most of the 1209 spectators rejected the covered seating high in the stands to be as close to the action as possible.
In addition to the charitable contributions and the cultural celebrations, Harvard was able to steal a 1-0 against Haiti after falling in penalty kicks to the Cape Verde All-Stars after a 1-1 draw in regulation.
“From our team’s standpoint, we work the entire spring towards these games,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “We’re building and building and building, so to be able to come out and play these games is exciting.”
HARVARD 1, HAITI 0
After failing to score until late in Friday’s loss to the Cape Verde All-Stars, Harvard’s offense came out aggressive in the Crimson’s Sunday matchup with the Haitian national team.
Harvard earned several early set pieces. Junior center back Richard Smith and sophomore left back Pascal Mensah both had looks at the goal off corner kicks in the first five minutes, but both attempts went wide.
But after the opening exchanges, Les Grenadiers began to find an attacking rhythm of their own and took control of the game.
Monuma Constant gave Haiti its best chance of the half in the 11th minute. Constant beat the Harvard backline and sent a shot through the legs of Crimson goalkeeper Brett Conrad.
But freshman center back Tyler Evans was there to make a sliding goal-line clearance before the ball could break the plane.
But as the half went on, both teams struggled to find holes in the opposing defense.
But towards the end of the half, Haiti’s one-touch style of play began to create chances. Donald Guerrier used his speed to beat the Harvard defense and then launched a low effort. But Conrad was able to parry, and the squads went into the locker room all square.
Much like the first half, the second stanza began with a flurry of opportunities and then settled into a battle of the midfield. But this time it was Haiti that came out with its foot on the pedal.
“In the second half, straight away, I think we noticed that we could pressure higher up the field,” Junot said. “Throughout the second half, we did just that and took away their space to play dangerous soccer.”
As the game went on, the Crimson began creating more chances, with sophomore forward Connor McCarthy delivering several crosses into the box.
In the 82nd minute, freshman forward Hiroki Kobayashi took control of the ball outside the box, slipped and recovered, and cut inside his defender before sending a low curling effort into the bottom right corner to give Harvard the lead.
But the Crimson was almost pegged back immediately when Les Grenadiers defender Millean Jean Alex’s 30-yard free kick glanced the crossbar.
But that was Haiti’s last attack, as the Crimson was able to hold on for the slim 1-0 victory.
CAPE VERDE ALL-STARS 1, HARVARD 1 (7-6 PENALTY KICKS)
In front of 1176 fans, most of them sporting blue and red scarves, Harvard began its international weekend by taking on the Cape Verde All-Stars under the lights Friday night.
And though both teams found the back of the net in the first half, neither team had a goal to show on the scoreboard for their efforts going into halftime.
A sweeping offensive move by Cape Verde led to a cross by Benvindo Barros, which was deflected five yards in front of goal. Danny Xavier found himself in the right spot and pulled off an acrobatic bicycle kick that beat Conrad but not the offside flag.
Seven minutes later, forward Zack Wolfenzon thought he had eluded the offside trap before slotting home, but the junior was also ruled offside.
But both Xavier and Wolfenzon would have something to show for their efforts before the end of the day.
Xavier put Cape Verde ahead five minutes into the second half, finishing a rebound from Zico Veiga’s volley off of a corner kick.
The Crimson struggled to find an answer for most of the remaining time, but the offensive urgency picked up in the final fifteen minutes.
And after several shot attempts went wide, Wolfenzon got on the end of a deflected header from freshman Tim Schmoll to even the score at one and send the game to penalty kicks.
Harvard was up 4-3 with a chance to win, but was unable to put the game away, and Cape Verde stayed perfect in sudden death to take the matchup, 7-6.
But for Junot, positive messages could be taken from the tight loss.
“My message to our group is to [find] the urgency to attack like [the final fifteen minutes],” Junot said. “I saw our fullbacks overlapping and our forwards willing to run at defenders and create opportunities.”

Saturday proved to be a long but successful day of racing and traveling for the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews.
The heavyweights challenged Navy and Penn in Annapolis, Md., taking four out of five races to capture the Adams Cup.
The No. 1 lightweights also competed in Annapolis for the Haines Cup, alternating races with their heavyweight counterparts. After a successful showing against Navy, the Crimson traveled to Princeton to face Georgetown and swept the four races of the afternoon.
HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. NAVY, PENN
The Harvard heavyweight first varsity eight defeated Navy by a narrow margin to take its thirteenth straight Adams Cup title.  The Crimson finished in 5:59.3, edging out the Midshipmen by 1.9 seconds. Penn finished third with a time of 6:11.9.
“It was always going to be pretty tough,” said junior Josh Hicks, three seat of the first varsity boat. “We had an eight hour bus ride which turned into a 10 hour bus ride on the way there. For Navy, it was their coach’s last home dual race, and Penn is always pretty stubborn as well.”
Harvard began the race with a strong start, but Navy stayed with the Crimson boat throughout the first 500.
“Our starts have been improving over this season, and we have been pretty proud of that,” Hicks said. “We got out in front and thought that hopefully we would be able to break open water pretty early, but Navy kept us honest and finished with overlap.”
By the 1000-meter mark, Harvard was leading Navy by about half a boat length. The Crimson tried to stretch its lead in the remaining meters of the race.
“Going into the third 500 is where we really tried to play our strengths,” Hicks said. “We are smaller guys, so we tried to play our fitness a bit more. We were able to push it out to about a length or so lead coming through the 1500.  And then, credit to them, [Navy] didn’t go away; they stuck at it, and bumped the rate up. We were fighting pretty hard towards the end.”
The second varsity eight also had a tight race, finishing in 6:05.76 with about a one second advantage over Navy. The third varsity and first freshman boats both beat the Midshipmen by a considerable margin, with the Quakers trailing in third. The second freshman eight dropped the only race of the morning, clocking in about 10 seconds behind Navy.
“It was interesting rowing in such open conditions in Annapolis,” Hicks said. “It was more of a river mouth that empties into a bay than a small, confined river. These are conditions that we don’t face too often on the Charles.”
But the Crimson seemed able to adjust to the Annapolis race course.
The challenging conditions allowed Harvard to gain practice for their most important upcoming away races of the season: Sprints and National Championships.
LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. NAVY, GEORGETOWN
The Harvard lightweights competed twice on Saturday, first against No. 8 Navy and then against No. 3 Georgetown, with only nine hours between the two races.
“It is really hard to gear up and race twice in one day like that,” said junior Erich Schultze, three seat of the first varsity eight. “Especially in the league that we race in, with a high quality of teams across the board, you can’t make mistakes.  Having to go through the whole process twice, we had to be both fortunate and strong [Saturday].”
The first varsity eight had a strong race against the Midshipmen, finishing in 6:11.0 with a 3.4-second advantage and allowing Harvard to capture the Haines Cup.
“We had a good start against them, and we were strong at the 1000-meter point,” Schultze said. “They took a really good move and came back into us again at the end of the race. But, we were fortunately able to hold them off.”
The first varsity boat was also successful in its second race of the day against the Hoyas.  The Crimson finished 4.5 seconds ahead of Georgetown, marking one of four Harvard victories of the afternoon.
The second varsity boat faced a different challenge. After losing to Navy by a considerable margin, the Crimson had to bounce back for a successful race against the Hoyas.
“At Navy, we struggled to find our rhythm, but at Georgetown we really found it,” said sophomore Benjamin Hughes, four seat of the second varsity eight. “Against Georgetown, we were able to get a good lead off of them in the first half and expand it in the second, which we hadn’t been able to do in other races. That was a positive mark for us because we were able to stay strong throughout the course of the race.”
The first and second freshman boats both defeated Navy, finishing in 6:22.1 and 6:45.0, respectively. According to Schultze, the victory over the Midshipmen carried special significance.
“Not only has Navy historically been one of our biggest rivals, but their home course is probably one of the most special courses in the league because of the history and intensity of the place,” Schultze said. “To go in there and get a win is one of the hardest things to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In each of the past two years, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team has knocked off Princeton, one of the traditional powerhouses in its sport. In 2010, behind freshman goalie Harry Krieger’s 13 saves, the Crimson stunned the then-No. 6 Tigers, 11-8, on its Senior Day for Harvard’s first win over Princeton in 20 years. Last season, behind 15 more saves from Krieger, Harvard knocked off the Tigers, 9-8, for the second straight time.
But in 2012, Krieger lost his starting job early on to freshman Jake Gambitsky, who has been up-and-down all year long. So facing the No. 13/14 Tigers once again in its final home game of the season, Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 turned back to Krieger for his first start in eight games, hoping for another big upset.
But despite the goalie switch, such magic was nowhere to be found on Saturday, as Princeton dominated Krieger and the Crimson en route to a 12-5 victory at Harvard Stadium.
“It was definitely not the way we wanted our Senior Day to go,” senior attackman Jeff Cohen said. “It was a bit of a letdown.”
So it was from early on, as the Tigers came out roaring from the start. Four minutes into the game, Tom Schreiber snagged a deflection in front of the net, and finding himself open, proceeded to blow a shot past Krieger. Four minutes later, Schreiber scored again—splitting two defenders and beating the goalie high—and moments after that, Kip Orban also escaped a pair of defenders and fired over Krieger’s left shoulder to put Princeton up, 3-0.
Harvard finally answered with four minutes left in the period, when freshman attackman Will Walker took a pass from sophomore Daniel Eipp and scored from close range. But Princeton quickly responded, as Orban beat Krieger from the right side, and a minute later, Mike McDonald took a pass in front of the net, spun left and scored. At the other end of the field, Tigers goalie Tyler Fiorito made a point-blank save on a solid look from senior Kevin Vaughan at the first-period buzzer.
“Fiorito is an All-American, and he played like it,” Cohen said.
Eipp cut the deficit to 5-2 four minutes into the second, juking Princeton’s Brendan DeTommaso to the left and beating Fiorito. But Harvard continued to turn the ball over as the period wore on while the Tigers added two more tallies. With 7:21 to go, Forest Sonnenfeldt beat Krieger from 15 yards out, and minutes later, Derick Raabe took a pass from Chad Wiedmaier in transition and fired in another goal on the run to make it 7-2 going into the break.
“They’re a good team, but it’s not really an excuse,” Cohen said. “They came to play harder than us [Saturday].”
The scoring continued for the Tigers just over a minute into the second half, when Schreiber took an underhand shovel pass at the left side of the net and fired a shot past Krieger to complete a hat trick. Two minutes later, Vaughan responded with a goal from the left side, and Cohen later made it 8-4 with his 45th score of the season. But the Crimson continued to miss chances to get closer than that, as Eipp hit the post with a ground-ball shot and later could not convert on an open look off a long outlet pass from his goalie.
Twenty-two seconds into the fourth, Krieger came out thirty yards from the pipes and took a big hit that knocked him out of the game and give Princeton an open net, as Schreiber’s fourth score made it 9-4. At the 8:35 mark of the quarter, Schreiber added an assist when he sprinted behind the goal from right to left and found Jeff Froccaro, who attacked from in front and beat Gambitsky.
Junior Jack Walker responded with a score for Harvard moments later off a pass from Vaughan to make it 10-5, but that was all the offense the Crimson was able to muster for the rest of the afternoon. Princeton’s Tucker Shanley and Chris White added late unassisted scores to put the game away.
Harvard outshot the Tigers, 40-35, and had a 22-18 advantage in ground balls, but Fiorito made 15 saves to make up for that fact.
“They outplayed us,” Vaughan said. “They were the better team [Saturday]. They did a lot of things right; they took advantage of our mistakes, and we didn’t do that.”
Indeed, it was not the performance Cohen, Vaughan, and their classmates had hoped for in the final home game of their careers.
“Harvard will always have a special place in my heart,” Cohen said. “I truly think Harvard Stadium is the best venue in college lacrosse. It was a beautiful day [Saturday], so it was a perfect scene...but the game didn’t go the way we wanted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two weeks into Ivy League play, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s playoff hopes were already grim. After opening its conference slate with back-to-back losses to Cornell and Penn, the Crimson sat at the bottom of the Ivy standings with just five league matchups remaining.
But six weeks and four straight conference wins later, the Crimson is right in the thick of the playoff hunt.
Harvard (8-6, 4-2 Ivy) moved one step closer to securing its second straight Ivy League tournament berth on Saturday afternoon, using a 7-1 second-half run to pull away from Columbia (2-12, 0-7), downing the Lions, 10-3, in New York.
With Cornell and Princeton’s weekend wins, Harvard remains in a tie with the Big Red and the Tigers for third place in the Ivy League standings behind Dartmouth (10-3, 5-1) and Penn (7-5, 5-1) heading into the final week of the regular season. The league’s top four finishers will punch tickets to the Ivy League tournament, where the recipient of the conference’s automatic berth to the NCAA tournament will be determined.
On Saturday, the Crimson had trouble distancing itself from a struggling Columbia team, leading by just one, 3-2, at the half. But in the final frame, it was a different story, with Harvard scoring four goals in the period’s first 10 minutes and then continuing on a 7-0 run. The Lions added one last score with 7:22 to go, but it was not nearly enough to erase the visitor’s lead, and the Crimson emerged on top, 10-3.
Junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault led the Harvard offense for the second straight game, finishing with a game-high four scores on nine shots. After averaging just 1.44 goals per game through the Crimson’s first nine games, Tetreault has been on a tear as of late. The junior has scored 14 times in Harvard’s last five games, including four in the past two.
“Danielle played awesome,” freshman goalkeeper Kelly Weis said. “She’s been working really hard on her shots. She’s extremely reliable. We know we can count on her to get big goals at crucial times.”
But the real story of the afternoon was the Crimson’s defense, which turned in its stingiest performance of the season, allowing just three scores on 16 shots.
Weis played a large role in the performance. The rookie, who entered Saturday’s contest ranked 16th in the nation in save percentage, stopped eight of the 10 shots she faced in 52:15 minutes of action. With the performance, Weis raised her season save percentage from 45.7 to 47.3 percent.
“[The defense] just [gives] me great angled shots,” Weis said. “The girls have no angles to shoot off. It’s all them—that’s the reason why the games are so low-scoring.”
Harvard’s defense also benefitted from the Crimson’s dominance of the ball. Harvard captured 12 of 15 draw controls (eight of nine in the second half) and caused 10 Lions turnovers.
The Crimson took advantage of the extra time with the ball, outshooting Columbia, 42-16, on the afternoon. In total, five Crimson players found the back of the net, including freshman midfielder Christine Thexton, who scored her first collegiate goal with 11:12 to go to put the visitors ahead, 8-2.
Tetreault got the scoring started less than five minutes after the opening whistle with an unassisted goal. The junior struck again one minute later to put the Crimson ahead, 2-0.
But the Lions responded. Columbia’s Camille Richardson and Taylor Gattinella added back-to-back goals to even the game at 2-2.
Tetreault tacked on her third score of the game with 12:42 left in the half to take back the lead, but the teams went into the break separated by just a single goal.
“Everyone was a little bummed [at halftime],” Weis said. “We were having trouble connecting in the goal scoring area so everybody was bummed that we weren’t doing what we wanted to do.”
But the Crimson wasted no time getting started in the second. Less than a minute in, sophomore attacker Chelsey Newman found the net. After a Tetreault score with 27:25 to go, Newman finished her second goal just more than two minutes later. Co-captain Melanie Baskind got in on the action with 20:11 to go, marking the fourth Crimson score in the period’s first 10 minutes.
The Lions were unable to respond, and Harvard continued to pile on the goals. Thexton notched her first score, and then junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen finished two more in the game’s final 10 minutes.
With 7:22 left on the clock, Columbia’s Katie Angulo snuck one into the net, bringing an end to a scoreless streak of more than 35 minutes.
The Crimson is back in action on Friday night against first-place Dartmouth at Harvard Stadium. Princeton also has a tough matchup ahead, as it hosts 5-1 Penn on Wednesday. Cornell, meanwhile, visits seventh-place Brown (6-7, 1-5) on Saturday. A Crimson win paired with a Princeton or Cornell loss would secure Harvard a spot in the Ivy League tournament, which begins May 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off its win over Yale at McCurdy Outdoor Track a week ago, the Harvard track and field team was given a dose of reality by some more formidable opponents this weekend.
In spite of a number of strong individual performances by members of the men’s and women’s squads, event wins were hard to come by for the Crimson, which competed in three meets: the Larry Ellis Invitational at Princeton, the MIT Spring Invitational, and the Mt. SAC Relays in Walnut, Calif.
“I was really pleased with how both of our squads competed over the weekend,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was a big invitational at Princeton…. We were able to work on some really good things, and I was pleased with how we went out there and competed.”
LARRY ELLIS INVITATIONAL
A majority of the track and field squad traveled to Princeton, N.J., over the weekend, where it squared off against a deep field that included Georgetown, UConn, and Ivy foes Cornell, Penn, and Princeton.
“The level of competition was outstanding, especially in the field events, where it took regionals-level performances to get into the finals,” Saretsky said. “It was great competition for us; there are a bunch of quality schools up and down the East Coast.”
Some members of the Harvard team rose to the occasion and earned top-five finishes in their respective events. Only one member of the Crimson squad took home an event win at the invitational, but he did so in style.
Junior Nico Weiler dominated his competition in the pole vault, clearing 5.31 meters to earn first place. His nearest competitor, Princeton’s Adam Bragg, earned second place with a clearance that was over eight inches below Weiler’s event-winning mark.
After scratching twice with the bar set at 5.31 meters, Weiler cleared it on his third attempt. The bar was then set to 5.46 meters, which would have bested the junior’s personal and school record by 0.10 meters. But Weiler was unable to make the clearance in each of his three attempts.
“[Weiler] is really dialed in right now,” Saretsky said. “He’s the type of athlete whose training is really geared towards May and June and even into the summer. So I think the best is still to come with him.”
Elsewhere at the invitational, high jumpers junior Mary Hirst and sophomore Jonathan Sparks turned in their outdoor personal-best performances.
Sparks finished in third place in the high jump by leaping 2.04 meters (6’8.25”).
Albany’s Alexander Bowen won the event by clearing 2.08 meters.
On the women’s side, Hirst cleared 1.76 meters (5’ 9.25), the fourth best mark in school history, to also earn third in the event. Hirst’s bested by a pair of UConn jumpers.
Sophomore distance runner Emily Reese, racing for the first time since the cross country season, had a second-place showing in the 3000-meter run, finishing in 9:56.54.
“I told [Reese] before the race that the goal was just to get [a] race under her belt,” Saretsky said. “She went out and executed [the] plan beautifully. She had a really strong finish, and it was good to see her back in action.”
MIT SPRING INVITATIONAL
Freshman Hannah Nunez highlighted the weekend for the track and field athletes who stayed in Cambridge to compete at the MIT Spring Invitational. The rookie finished in the top three in four different events: the 100m hurdles, the 200m dash, the high jump, and the long jump.
“Hannah had a great weekend,” Saretsky said. “I was pleased with her performances and how she is making the transition to being a multi-event athlete. To have such strong performances across those different events is outstanding.”
“I was happy with [my finishes], but not quite satisfied,” Nunez added. “I’m still working to improve, but it was definitely a step in the right direction.”
MT. SAC RELAYS
Freshman distance runner Adam Cotton was Harvard’s sole representative at the Mt. SAC Relays. Cotton, who was competing in just his first race of the season, finished in 20th place in the 1500m run with a time of 3:47.28, the seventh-best in Crimson history.
“I think a lot of people are underestimating the things that we can do,” Cotton said. “Everyone is getting healthy…so it will be exciting to see what we can do at [the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships] in a couple of weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In golf, as in most sports, poor weather conditions often lead to worse performances. But for the Harvard men’s golf team, torrential downpours, strong winds, and cold weather led to an improved score on Sunday and also the low round of the day.
Thanks to this strong Sunday showing, Harvard finished second overall, behind Rhode Island, at this past weekend’s Century Intercollegiate, hosted by Yale in Purchase, N.Y.
“We were just playing golf. We were just thinking a lot less, not thinking so much about our swings and mechanics and just trusting what we have,” captain Tony Grillo said
Sophomore Seiji Liu, who won the same tournament last spring under similar conditions, also attributes the team’s success in bad weather to a developed mental approach.
“Our team has historically played very well in extremely brutal conditions,” Liu said. “[By] playing in the Northeast, we never get good weather that teams out west or down south experience, so it’s a lot about playing smart and grinding out scores.”
The Crimson finished Sunday with 301 strokes and a total of 606 on the weekend at +38 overall, six strokes behind Rhode Island. The Rams’ Branden Chicorka was the overall individual winner with a score of +1 for the entire weekend.
Leading the way for the Crimson were seniors Grillo and Mark Pollak, who both finished tied for fourth for the tournament. In the final round, Grillo and Pollak shot a 76 and 75, respectively, to both finish at +6.
Sophomore Theo Lederhausen shot a 74 on Sunday—a seven stroke improvement from Saturday—to finish tied for 12th place at +13.
Liu’s final round of 76 placed him tied for 20th for the weekend at +15. The sophomore, who won last year’s event, said that three bad holes cost him a similar finish this year and that the errors proved even more costly given the strength of the current competition.
“Making stupid mistakes is going to be a lot more penalizing than in years past, so it is going to be critical for all of us to be very smart about how we approach every shot in the course in general,” Liu said.
But Harvard was still able to finish ahead of every other Ivy in the tournament. Dartmouth’s Peter Williamson, last weekend’s winner at the Princeton Invitational, was the only golfer to finish ahead of Grillo and Pollak.
“The Ivy League has grown extremely deep over the years, and it’s a very good conference now,” Liu said. “It’s getting better every year.”
Crimson freshman Akash Mirchandani’s score of 77 placed him at 16th at +14, tied also with fellow teammate Michael Lai, who shot a 75 on Sunday playing as an individual.
Saturday’s conditions were not as brutal, but after one round of golf, Harvard found itself in fourth place with 305 strokes, nine strokes off first-place Rhode Island with Dartmouth and host Yale in second and third, respectively.
Leading the Crimson was Grillo, whose score of 72 for the first round was tied for second best on the day.
“[Grillo has] been playing great,” Lederhausen said. “He’s a really good competitor. When tournaments come around, he loves the competition, and he usually plays well. He’s good getting the ball in the hole.”
Pollak, a fellow senior, was only one shot behind with a score of 73, tying him for fourth place.
Mirchandani finished the first day tied for 24th at +8. Rounding off Saturday for Harvard were Lederhausen and Liu, both of whom had scores of 81 and tied for 32nd place.
Sophomore Michael Lai posted an individual score of 81 as well.
With Ivy League Championships coming up the next weekend, the team is pleased with the way it has battled. After a fifth-place finish at the Princeton Invitational, held from April 14-15, and a second-place finish this past weekend, Harvard is looking to continue this progression.
“It was huge to have this a week before Ivies,” Grillo said. “And it wasn’t the worst thing for us to come in second, because our guys are still hungry. The pieces are definitely coming together at the right time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the final shot was marked good on Sunday afternoon, the Harvard men’s tennis team could breathe a sigh of relief. With Friday’s 5-2 victory over Yale at the Beren Tennis Center and Sunday’s 4-3 win over Brown at the Paul Bailey Pizzitola Memorial Sports Center, the Crimson (21-2, 5-1 Ivy) earned at least a portion of the Ivy League title for the first time since 2008.
But despite the accomplishment, the team did not appear at all fazed.
“Our coach made sure that we were not thinking about that,” freshman Alex Steinroeder said. “There was a little mention of it after we won Sunday’s match, but he said ‘The job’s not done. We have to take care of business next weekend before we can say anything about the league title.’”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
Despite a slow beginning to play, Harvard was able to quickly take back momentum against the Bears (16-7, 2-4) and earn its fourth consecutive victory on Sunday.
“Today’s match was tough,” co-captain Alistair Felton said. “We struggled playing away from home, and in a small indoor facility with loud fans, but the team coped well. In the end, we got the win. It was a long, long match, and it was very tough, so I’m so happy we won it”
For the first time in weeks, the Crimson did not gain an immediate advantage in the match as it lost the doubles point.
“It was a little surprising that we dropped the doubles point since we’ve been playing such good doubles recently,” Steinroeder said. “But I think losing it really got everyone fired up and made the singles players do their jobs. Even the guys that lost played well.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 2
Going into Friday’s match against the Bulldogs (13-10, 2-4), the Crimson was riding a 10-game winning streak against its rival. This matched proved to be no different, as Harvard blew past Yale, 5-2.
“That match was definitely much anticipated,” Felton said. “But once we got the doubles point it was all over very quickly. The team played very professionally. I thought we did really well.”
The Crimson began Friday’s match by taking the doubles point thanks to an 8-6 win courtesy of senior Jonathan Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz and an 8-1 victory from junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen. Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster suffered the only doubles loss of the day, 9-8 (8).
Harvard’s energy carried over into singles play, and the Crimson won four of six individual contests.
In the No. 1 slot, Pearlman handily took care of his Bulldog counterpart, 6-2, 6-3, as did Schultz, in the exact same fashion, in the No. 4 position. Andy Nguyen, who usually competes solely in the doubles portion of the match, proved his worth in singles play as he followed his teammates’ leads and won, 6-3, 6-1. Steinroeder was the next to come out victorious for the Crimson, as he finished off his day’s work, 6-3, 6-7, 1-0. Classmates Denis Nguyen and Shaun Chaudhuri could not quite pull off the same success, though, and were defeated, 1-6, 7-5, 1-0, and 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, respectively.
Felton attributed Harvard’s success in the two weekend matches to a team-wide “no fear” mentality.
“We are kind of going for the mindset that we aren’t trying to protect ourselves, instead we still have to prove ourselves and go and earn the win,” Felton said. “It’s the ‘no fear’ mindset that we tried to have throughout these matches. We were pretty successful at that.”
Steinroeder added to this, explaining that from now on, the thoughts of the team are largely focused on winning the entirety of the title.
“The seniors haven’t won an Ivy League title before,” Steinroeder said. “So all of us want to win the match next weekend to give them that first title. I know going into the year that was something they really wanted, and there has been such great senior leadership that that is something that we definitely want to do for them.”

The Harvard women’s tennis team entered this past weekend’s matchups with an outside shot at winning the Ivy League title. Having already lost two matches in conference play, the Crimson needed a pair of wins in addition to a few upsets  to land in first place in the Ancient Eight.
But Harvard’s chances were cut short by first-place Yale on Friday when the Bulldogs handled the Crimson, 6-1, at the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center in New Haven, Conn. Yale proceeded to beat Dartmouth, 6-1, on Sunday to secure the outright Ivy title and to preserve its undefeated record in the Ancient Eight this season. The Crimson also ended its weekend on a positive note, taking down Brown, 4-3, at the Murr Center on Sunday afternoon.
Junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana went perfect over the two days, winning both of her doubles and singles matches—all at the No. 1 position.
“When I went on the court, my mindset was that I was going to fight for every single point no matter what,” Tachibana said. “Sometimes it’s easy to get discouraged when you see your teammates not doing so well in their matches, but I tried to stay as focused as possible on my own court, and I guess that worked in the end.”
Tachibana’s doubles partner, fellow junior co-captain Kristin Norton, also had a notable weekend, finishing with a win in one of her two singles matches to add to the doubles victories she shared with Tachibana.
The duo of senior Samantha Gridley and freshman Kelly Whelan also took a win at No. 2 doubles spot against Brown, while Whelan continued her momentum into singles play, defeating the Bears’ Sarah Kandath.
“We were really focused on ending the season well,” Tachibana said. “Hopefully if we beat Dartmouth next weekend, we’ll end in third [place].”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
The Crimson began its matchup against the Bears stronger than its contest against Yale.
Harvard jumped out to an early 1-0 lead by taking the doubles point. Tachibana and Norton defeated their opponents, 8-2, while Brown’s Nikita Uberoi and Carissa Aboubakare took down sophomore Natalie Blosser and freshman Sylvia Li, 8-3, at the No. 3 position. At the No. 2 court, the match went into a tiebreaker, and the tandem of Gridley and Whelan beat their foes, 9-7.
Up 1-0 going into singles, the Crimson split the decisions. Brown took the No. 3, No. 4, and No. 6 matches over Blosser, Gridley, and Li, respectively. Blosser dropped her contest, 6-2, 6-4, before Gridley lost, 6-2, 6-3. Li fell 6-3, 6-2.
But at the No. 2 spot, Norton beat Jessica Harrow, 6-1, 6-4, and Whelan also defeated Kandath, 6-2, 6-3, at the No. 5 position.
The dual meet came down to the No.1 court, where Tachibana took on Misia Krasowski. Tachibana dropped the first set but came back strong in the next two, ultimately winning, 6-7 (5), 6-0, 6-2.
YALE 6, HARVARD 1
The Crimson began its weekend on Friday with a 6-1 loss to the Bulldogs on the road.
Yale, which came into the game sitting in first place in the conference standings, clinched at least a share of the Ivy League title with its victory over Harvard.
The Crimson, on the other hand, dropped its chances for the Ivy throne in the bout.
The day began slowly for the visitors. In doubles play, the duo of Tachibana and Norton took down Vicky Brook and Amber Li, 8-6, at the No. 1 spot. But the Bulldogs notched victories at the other two courts, and their two 8-2 wins gave the home team the first team point of the match.
In Harvard’s sole singles win, Tachibana battled Yale’s Elizabeth Epstein. All three sets went into tiebreakers. Tachibana won the first set, 7-6 (4), but lost the next, 6-7 (2). Finally, after an 11-point tiebreaker, Tachibana came out on top and gave the Crimson its lone point of the match.
Junior Camille Jania fell, 6-1, 6-0, at the No. 2 position, while Gridley was unable to win at the No. 3 spot, as her opponent came out on top, 6-2, 6-0. On the No. 6 court, Whelan also had a relatively short match, losing, 6-1, 6-3.
Norton and Blosser’s individual matches at the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively, went into tiebreakers. Norton won her first set, but dropped the next two, falling 3-6, 6-3, 1-0 (10-7). Blosser had a similar fate, losing the final two sets after opening with a victory, 5-7, 7-5, 1-0 (10-8).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe lightweights took to the Charles this past weekend to square off against No. 1 Wisconsin, No. 2 Stanford, Buffalo, UMass, and No. 8 MIT on Saturday and the Engineers once more on Sunday for the Muri Cup.
The heavyweights traveled to the Housatonic River to face Ancient Eight foe Yale for the Case Cup.
After a busy weekend for both crews, the No. 4 lightweight first varsity eight finished third behind varsity eight winner Wisconsin and runner-up Stanford, while the lightweight 2V won its race.
On Sunday, the Radcliffe lightweights ended their weekend with convincing victories against local-rivals MIT. With its win, the varsity eight retained the Muri Cup and Cambridge bragging rights.
“We had a good race,” junior lightweight rower Emma Lukasiewicz said. “We were able to stick with Stanford and Wisconsin up until the 1000, but then they pulled ahead and battled it on their own. We learned a lot from that race. We definitely found out what we need to improve on for our next races, so [Sunday] morning when we raced MIT we definitely acted on those improvements. We were pleased overall that our times were up there with Stanford and Wisconsin.”
In Connecticut, the heavyweights were outdueled on the Housatonic, forcing the Black and White to concede the Case Cup to Yale.
LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. WISCONSIN, STANFORD, MIT, UMASS, BUFFALO
The Black and White lightweights, coming off a strong start to the season against Georgetown two weeks ago, looked to feed off the momentum of its Class of 2004 Cup victory into a busy weekend filled with a strong lineup of possible national championship contenders.
After a series of heat races, four crews qualifed for the grand final: Stanford, Wisconsin, Radcliffe, and Buffalo.
With the start of the race, Radcliffe, Stanford, and Wisconsin all surged ahead, leaving Buffalo in last. By the 500-meter mark, Wisconsin gained a three-seat lead over the field as the Stanford and Radcliffe crews dueled for second.
Approaching the 750-meter point of the course, all three crews looked locked neck and neck. But by 250 meters later, Wisconsin and Stanford began pulling away from the Black and White. The Badgers and the Cardinal continued their quick pace down the river towards the finish line. At race’s end, Wisconsin emerged victorious, outlasting Stanford in the final meters of the race to win in a time of 7:24.9.
Stanford came in .8 seconds after Wisconsin, followed by Radcliffe (7:36.4) and Buffalo (8:09.8).
In the second varsity eight race, Radcliffe’s fortunes were reversed, as the Black and White 2V came from behind to defeat Wisconsin, Stanford, and MIT. At the start of the 2V race, Wisconsin took an early lead, five seats ahead of the Black and White. But in the final 500 meters of the race, the Radcliffe 2V found an additional gear and surged past the Badgers to win in 7:33.4, 4.5 seconds ahead of Wisconsin and nearly nine seconds ahead of third-place Stanford.
LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. MIT, MURI CUP
Following a Saturday packed with competitive races, the Black and White lightweights took to the Charles once more on Sunday in a clash against downstream rivals for the Muri Cup.
The Lightweights shined against the Engineers, cruising to victory in the 1V and novice races. In the varsity eight race, the Black and White dominated MIT, posting a time of 6:41.8, 33.8 seconds ahead of the Engineers.
“It’s a great tradition to race against MIT for the Muri Cup,” Lukasiewicz said. “The cup is named for the freshman men’s lightweight coach here at Harvard who is also a MIT alum, so it’s really neat to always have that dual meet with MIT on the Charles.”
“We had a great race despite the cold conditions,” Lukasiewicz added. “It was a tough race for both us and MIT [since] we had both raced the day before, but we had a great race and we are definitely headed in the right direction for the rest of the season.”
In the novice race, Radcliffe finished the course in 7:31.2, eight seconds before their Engineer counterparts.
HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. YALE
Looking to extend their ownership of the Case Cup one more year, the Black and White heavyweights took to the Housatonic against the Bulldogs. But unlike last season’s historic victory over Yale, the Bulldogs got the best of Radcliffe and retook the Case Cup.
In the marquee 1V race, Yale rowed to victory in a time of 6:46.0, 7.7 seconds ahead of the Black and White, who finished in 6:53.7.
In the second varsity race, the Radcliffe 2V topped its Yale counterpart, finishing 1.3 seconds ahead of the Bulldogs at 6:53.3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team has done it again.
After winning both of Friday’s games against Brown, the Crimson went on to sweep the Bears in two games on Saturday, 5-0 and 5-2, clinching the North Division title for the third year in a row.
This weekend’s four-game sweep of Brown (8-24, 5-11 Ivy), coupled with Cornell’s loss to Penn, also ensures that Harvard (28-11, 15-1) will have home field advantage for the upcoming Ivy League Championship Series against the South Division titleholder. This will be the second consecutive year that the Crimson hosts the series.
“Being able to play on our field, in front of our fans is such an advantage,” said sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange. “We’ve worked hard all season to secure hosting, and we’re looking forward to defending our title in our house.”
Despite all the good news, there was still one negative to this weekend’s play.
Last season, when Harvard played the Bears, the Crimson nabbed all four games as well, putting up 35 runs while allowing Brown to score just four.
But this year, Harvard’s victories were much closer. Though the Bears’ offense was still held to four runs, the Crimson plated a total of 14 runs, less than half of the 35 it scored in last year’s series.
One explanation for the fall in offense against the Bears, which have no pitchers ranked in the top 10 in Ivy League ERA, opposing batting average, or strikeouts, is the loss of Ellen Macadam ’11. The reigning Ivy League Player of the Year batted .453 in conference games and finished with a slugging percentage of .773 as last season’s co-captain.
“Losing Ellen was huge for our team,” senior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “She was such a consistent spark in our lineup. This year, everyone, one through nine, has stepped up. We know any and every girl in our lineup can be a catalyst for us. We’ve also had girls coming off the bench in pinch hitting situations come up big for us. This year our offense is so dangerous because every single spot in our lineup is strong.”
Alexander has stepped up in particular, ranking first in the Ancient Eight in hits (53), triples (4), and total bases (78).  Overall the Crimson offense tops the Ivies in batting average, hitting .295 as a team.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
In the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, sophomore pitcher Laura Ricciardone struck out seven to lead Harvard to a 5-2 victory against Brown.
The Crimson grabbed an early lead in the bottom of the first inning when freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz singled up the middle to bring home junior leftfielder Ashley Heritage.
Following a scoreless second inning, the Bears came back in the top of the third, knocking in a run to tie the score at 1-1.
Harvard responded in the bottom of the inning with another run, as Heritage scored on a passed ball to take back the lead for the Crimson.
After that, neither team put up a run until the second half of the fifth inning when Harvard plated in an additional two runs, bringing the score to 4-1.
Brown answered with a run of their own in the top of the sixth inning, reducing the deficit to two runs.
But the Crimson quickly increased its lead back up to three, as Alexander drove in sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson with a single down the right-field line.
The Bears were unable to muster a run in the seventh inning as Harvard won, 5-2.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 0
The Crimson silenced the bats of the Brown offense to earn a 5-0 shutout victory in the first game on Saturday. Stephanie Thompson—the Bears’ star slugger who is currently ranked second in the NCAA with a .489 batting average—went 0-for-1 with two walks.
Harvard was the first squad to get on the scoreboard in the bottom of the first inning when Alexander scored on a passed ball.
The Crimson then extended its lead to two runs in the second inning, as co-captain and first baseman Whitney Shaw ripped a solo homerun to right center.
In the third inning, Heritage touched home on a wild pitch, making the score 3-0.
The fourth inning featured another scoreless half for Brown while Harvard tacked on another run to increase its lead to four.
Rookie centerfielder Camilla Gibson singled to the shortstop, advanced to second on an Alexander single, and then came home on a throwing error by the Bears’ infield.
In what proved to be the game’s last score, the Crimson mustered its fifth run in as many innings to cement the 5-0 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having lost its top three receivers from last year, the Harvard football team entered the 2012 spring with questions at the position. But in the first drive of Saturday’s Spring Game, the annual inter-squad scrimmage, rising senior quarterback Colton Chapple showed that the Crimson  may have found its answers. With his first five passes, Chapple targeted five different receivers who had combined for just 23 receptions in 2011.
“The receiving corps I thought would have been a cause of concern,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “But with the emergence of guys like [sophomore] Ricky Zorn, [sophomore] Matt Brown, [sophomore] Andrew Berg, and [freshman] Seitu [Smith], that could end up being a fun group.”
By the end of the game, those five receivers had nearly matched last year’s output, bringing down 15 balls, with Zorn leading the pack with five catches.
“Ricky Zorn has probably come farther than any other kid at his position,” Murphy said. “He came in here as a quarterback, and now he is potentially going to be a very athletic, tough, fast, decent-sized receiver.”
In total, 12 players caught a pass for the Crimson offense as it battled the White defense to a 6-0 win. The annual Spring Game represents the end of the spring offseason and a preview of what kind of Harvard team will step onto the field in the fall.
The man throwing to the bevy of emerging weapons when the season gets underway will most likely be Chapple, the Spring Game’s starter. The Georgian was outplayed in the game by sophomore Michael Pruneau, who threw for 118 yards and the day’s only score on 9-of-19 passing.
But Chapple has a firm grip on the job for now thanks to his impressive performance as a starter during the middle of last year. In two games, Chapple racked up nine touchdowns and nearly 600 yards through the air.
“The thing about Colton is that when he was a freshman, I would not have predicted he would be as good as he is now,” Murphy said. “He’s improved everything: his mechanics, his arm strength, his accuracy, his leadership ability, his running ability, everything.”
Chapple didn’t show off much of that improvement Saturday though, completing just seven of his 15 passes for 44 yards. On the first drive of the game, the quarterback took a hit in the pocket and fumbled the ball, though it was collected by a teammate.
While Chapple appears to be the one charged with replacing outgoing Collier Winters behind center, the man tapped to fill senior Kevin Murphy’s large shoes at left tackle Saturday was freshman Anthony Fabiano.
“Fabiano is going to be the guy, but there may be competition from guys like Parker Sebastian,” Murphy said. “We have four guys we think can play tackle. I don’t know if we will be better on the line than last year, but we will be deeper.”
Running behind Fabiano and the rest of the line will likely be a combination of rising senior Treavor Scales and rising sophomore Zach Boden.
“Treavor clearly is the best player,” Murphy said. “Zach has tremendous potential, but…he’s got a lot of work to do. The 1-2 punch of Treavor and Zach is pretty exciting, but Zach’s got to take the next step, find a lower center of gravity, and become a better pass protector.”
Neither Boden nor Scales played Saturday. Boden is recovering from a high ankle sprain and Scales was held out of the game to protect him from potential injury.
On the other side of the ball, Murphy said no single player will be able to make up for the loss of Josue Ortiz, the 2011 Ivy Defensive Player of the Year.
“We have to be collectively better,” Murphy said. “When you have a guy who was defensive player of the year, you probably aren’t going to replace that guy.”
The defense is generally ahead of the offense at this point in the offseason because it requires less synchronization, but the low score of the Spring Game was also a result of missed opportunities on special teams. Sophomore kicker David Mothander missed field goals from 29, 30, and 40 yards away and had an extra point attempt blocked.
“Moth was very consistent last year, but quite frankly he hasn’t had a great spring, so we’ve got to get that figured out,” Murphy said. “But I’m very confident that we can get that squared away.”
Murphy said that Mothander may see competition for both kickoff and field goal duties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, unheralded Chicago White Sox lefthander Philip Humber recorded the 21st perfect game in MLB history, retiring 27 Seattle Mariners batters in order en route to a 4-0 victory. 11 years ago, a Harvard pitcher had a similar brush with history, facing the minimum 27 batters—but he did not quite achieve perfection.
Ben Crockett, perhaps Harvard’s best pitcher of the last 25 years, toed the rubber for the Crimson in an April matchup against Dartmouth with fiery stuff waiting to be unleashed from his right arm.
One after another, members of the Big Green were mowed down. Over half of them—14, to be exact—struck out, helpless before Crockett’s onslaught, which ended in a 10-0 Harvard victory.
Yet, despite facing only 27 batters and allowing no hits, Crockett did not record a perfect game. Center fielder Bryan Hale committed an error in the second inning, marring Crockett’s bid for one of baseball’s most uncommon achievements.
Still, after recording the final out, Crockett had pitched a no-hitter. Perhaps more impressive was Crockett’s efficiency in completing the feat; in addition to his 14 strikeouts, he allowed no walks and threw just 85 pitches.
But the postgame celebration of Crockett’s accomplishment was muted. With a loss in the first game of the day’s doubleheader, the Crimson was eliminated from contention for the Ivy League championship.
"This is the worst feeling in the world," Harvard coach Joe Walsh told the Crimson after the game.
Crockett went on to earn Second-Team All-American honors the following season, posting a 6-4 record and 108 strikeouts. Crockett then played five seasons in the minor leagues, but he never made it to the majors.

U.S. Senator Scott Brown stopped by Mr. Bartley's Gourmet Burgers to finally get a taste of the burger that bears his name Monday afternoon.
Surrounded by cameras and gawkers, Brown ate at the bar of the Harvard Square institution, sharing the meal with the restaurant's owner Billy Bartley.
"The Scott Brown," which comes with bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, jalapeños, and french fries, has been on the menu a while; but Brown said he had yet to taste it.
"I'm not a big jalapeños guy," Brown said, but he explained that he thought the spicy peppers nicely complemented the other flavors.
Not surprisingly, Brown passed on "The Elizabeth Warren" burger, named after Brown's Democratic opponent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, who will face Brown in the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race.
The trip into Warren's Cambridge stronghold was a rare one for Brown, but the Senator said that he has been frequenting Bartley's for years. As a college student at Tufts University, Brown explained, he used to make the trip into Harvard Square to enjoy a burger or stop by the Hong Kong Restaurant, a perennial late-night favorite for Harvard students.
In between bites, the Republican candidate reflected on his campaign's strategy for reelection.
"I'm just going to concentrate on doing my job," Brown said. "The best that I can do is remind people why they voted for me."

Reading period is fast approaching, and many Harvard students are wondering just how they’ll tackle the stacks of books beside their beds.
With no time to spare, they’ll stare them down each morning, and then peruse the Internet for videos of babies eating watermelon. Don't be one of those students. Before you spend another 20 hours watching season two of whatever show you’re watching this week on Netflix, check out these free Internet tools designed to help you focus during the weeks ahead.
Self Control
You probably do not have any. Luckily, this application takes care of that issue. Just type in your personal websites of weakness into the program’s blacklist and block them for an allotted period of time. Make sure you are committed to your choices—the application will not let you undo them until the timer runs out. Warning: Don't block websites you need in order to write your paper. This will not end well.
Spreeder.com
How often do you wish you could just read faster? Spreeder is an easy-to-use website that allows readers to do just that. The website posits that humans can consume text faster than does the inner reading voice—that is, the voice that aligns with how fast one can read a passage out loud. To use the website, just upload a chunk of text into the provided box. The program will flash the words onto the screen at an increased speed, forcing you to consume them before they disappear from sight. Determine through trial and error the speed that works best for you, and then set your preferences. Increase the speed setting periodically to further sharpen your skills.
Written? Kitten
Who wants to focus on writing papers when there are pictures of kittens to be consumed? This website knows what you want and rewards you for every 100, 200, 500, or 1,000 words (you set your own preferences) with an adorable picture of a cat. Some are stealthy, some are sly, and some are just really small kitties that look up at you with giant orange eyes. The kitten breaks are also a good time for you to copy and paste your work into a Word Document and compulsively save it on 100 different devices to avoid a hard drive crash disaster.
Focus Booster
Focus booster is an application based on the Pomodoro Technique, a method of studying that promotes timed intervals of focus interspersed with brief breaks for the brain.
A twenty-five minute countdown clock on the top of your screen marks the time in which you should focus intently on the task at hand. After each of the first three sets, you take a five-minute break. When you have finished your fourth interval, you can enjoy a longer, program-mandated 15-20 minute break. This is a great tool for those who work best with short intense spurts of concentration, and it prevents brief breaks from turning into hour-long Facebook binges.

This just makes things a little more interesting.
