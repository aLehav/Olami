After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days before indie pop band Vampire Weekend released their newest singles, the band tweeted for the first time since 2014. A few days later, they broke a five-year YouTube hiatus, and their Instagram revival got a head start with a picture of a broken TV in late May. Whereas Adele took a few months to recover from throat surgery and Justin Bieber took, debatably, four years to transform himself into a functional adult musician, it’s been over half a decade of silence since Vampire Weekend released their last album.
After a few personnel changes and lots of scrapped ideas, however, Vampire Weekend is finally ready to make their comeback — and their upcoming album, “Father of the Bride,” will appear in early 2019. The band will offer two new singles each month until its debut, the first set of which were released on Jan. 24. “2021” is a laid-back, interlude-esque number; at five minutes and nine seconds, “Harmony Hall” is bouncy, folksy, and far less brief. Still, for all the waiting, all the false starts, and all the tested patience, the resulting singles sound uncannily like — well, Vampire Weekend songs.
“2021,” the shorter of the two singles at one minute and 38 seconds, provides a fresh soundbite of a long-standing Vampire Weekend archetype. The song glancingly inspects what it means to have a legacy — a topic (time and its passage) that is familiar territory for the band. Fittingly, the song’s beat was originally written in the ‘80s by Haruomi Hosono, who composed it for the Muji stores in Japan. Hosono’s work adds a thumping energy to an otherwise bittersweet melody, adding “2021” to the storied canon of “sad Vampire Weekend songs with bouncy baselines.”
The element that gives “2021” its edge, however, is the scream-sung word “BOY” interjected like a percussion instrument in the song’s background. In a single about the passage of time, the word is a brusque reminder that the musicians are, in fact, no longer boys. The band was formed in 2006 when its members were students at Columbia University; 13 years later, Vampire Weekend is making music for a different world. The shrill “BOY” functions almost as a nod to this incongruence. The word fits oddly with “2021”’s gentle lyrics about passing years, and its bite deepens an otherwise simple number.
If “2021” offers a literal musing on the passage of time, however, then the more ambitious “Harmony Hall” provides a different take on nostalgia. The band’s second single relies less on the concept of legacies and more on the actual legacy that Vampire Weekend has already accrued. Over a decade into the band’s tenure, and Harmony Hall may be the most “Vampire Weekend” Vampire Weekend song ever written. It borders on prototypical. Even part of the song’s chorus (“I don’t wanna live like this,  but I don’t wanna die”) is taken word-for-word from the outro of their earlier song, “Finger Back.”
Beyond its literal self-referencing, “Harmony Hall” also works precisely within the niche that Vampire Weekend is known for. Like “2021” — and like most of their previous output —  it combines quasi-academic lyrics with sunshine-and-banjos instrumentals. Its words, on the other hand, are far more aggressively political. Instagram commenters surmise that the term Harmony Hall likely refers to a building at the band’s alma mater, and the resulting chorus throbs with resentment for elite power. “And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness / Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight / Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified,” the lyric goes. The last phrase, especially, has a sharpness to it. The line’s use of the second person and its disillusionment with authority (“a place you thought was dignified”) are relevant to many institutions of power — including Columbia, Harvard, and currently, the federal government.
But a listener could be forgiven for listening to “Harmony Hall” without thinking about politics. Lyrics aside, “Harmony Hall” is a bouncing, strumming, windows-rolled-down kind of song. It takes long guitar riff detours. It has a sing-along chorus. Even at over five minutes, it never overstays its welcome. “Harmony Hall” is just a hard song to hate. For a band whose last album was centered around death, the single is almost arrestingly cheerful.
Vampire Weekend could, of course, have taken greater risks with their comeback singles. They could have wandered further into the depths of alternative music, or deviated more aggressively from their previous style. But instead, they offered two unassuming, upbeat singles that align perfectly with the legacy that the band left behind them. Rather than challenge its listeners, Vampire Weekend gave them something nice to sing along to. And although Vampire Weekend’s past albums were praised for pushing boundaries, there is immense value in their current feel-good strategy. It puts Vampire Weekend in a promising, if unusual, position for their comeback album: the band may be able to pick up exactly where they left off. Unlike many of the cultural touchstones of six years ago, they still have the chance to be at least as good as one remembers. Old fans can only hope, then, that all of “Father of the Bride” lives up to the first songs’ cautious promise.

The LA indie rock duo Girlpool first made waves with their single “Chinatown,” a near perfect piece of millenial folk music, from their 2015 debut album “Before The World Was Big.” In the track, Harmony Tividad and Cleo Tucker tenderly reflect on their budding adulthood and the uneasy existential questions it poses, asking in the chorus, “Do you feel restless when you realize you're alive?” over soothingly-strummed guitar. Singing about their experiences growing up is nothing new for Girlpool. Now, with three albums and one EP under their belt, their music has grown and developed with them. Their latest release, “What Chaos is Imaginary,” like their critically-acclaimed second album “Powerplant” before it, is both a deepening of and departure from their previous sound. Tividad and Tucker skillfully balance the old and the new in a startlingly lovely and evocative listen.
“Lucy’s,” the album opener, begins with Tucker singing about “an unfamiliar place where you’d rather stay.” It’s a fitting beginning to an album that captures the band moving in new directions. Whereas Tividad and Tucker often sang in unison in past albums, here they frequently have distinct tracks featuring their independent voices. Tividad sings in a higher register and Tucker in a lower — between albums Tucker came out as transgender and began hormone replacement therapy which deepened his voice to a tenor. While Girlpool has always sounded confident — consider their 2014 self-titled debut EP featuring tracks like the wonderfully direct “American Beauty”: “It's not enough to watch a movie / Eat me out to American Beauty” — Tucker sounds especially self-assured on their latest release. In “Hire,” an album stand-out, Tucker reflects on new becomings and life under late capitalism — “Will I make the matinée with my newest life… are you gonna hire me?” — over pleasantly jangling, fuzzy indie rock backing. In the last third of the track, he lets loose with a handsomely raw-edged rasp, a satisfying conclusion to a stunning new song.
Girlpool are not only exploring new domains sonically, but also lyrically. They’ve always had a knack for verse, as shown by earlier releases. That’s not to say that this album is without more direct verses. “Pretty,” for instance, finds Tividad singing about outgrowing a dysfunctional relationship in relatively direct terms: “You were such an idol / Yeah, you were the whole world / Now you see you look / Pretty broken,” making a pun of the word “pretty.” Yet more often on this album Girlpool’s lyrics are decidedly less direct, and in lines that range from being dense with imagery to more lightly sketched they find an appealing poetry. The title track of the album is particularly striking in this regard. Over organ and string backing — a real departure for a band that previously used only guitar and bass — Tividad sings allusively about a series of experiences which, as she described in a press release, “culminated in [her] having horrific PTSD” which drove her “to redevelop a relationship with the world where I could find some illusion of 'safety' and belief in the fact that I could ultimately take care of myself." It’s a vulnerable track, both lyrically and sonically, and Tividad sings with moving strength. The concluding lyrics are particularly affecting — “I loved him and his violence for the pretty view / Rehearsed a strange reality what chaos is imaginary.”
Fortunately, on this album Tividad doesn’t have to concede to a false reality or relegate chaos to the realm of the imaginary. Through the fourteen tracks of the album Tividad and Tucker, sometimes independently and sometimes together, find new modes and methods of further exploring and becoming themselves.

Anjimile, a locally treasured singer-songwriter, has been self-releasing beautifully composed folk music and DIY indie rock since 2012. This year they’ve been named one of NPR’s twenty Slingshot Artists to Watch in 2019. Their latest release, "Maker Mixtape," features poetic meditations on love, loss, and the process of art-making itself, clearly demonstrates why Anjimile so rightly deserves the national recognition they are finally receiving.
Like much of Anjimile’s best work, particularly their album “Colors” released this past summer, the mixtape is a diverse yet connected listen. The five track EP opens and closes with acoustic tracks that, while similar in style, vary in theme. The opener and standout track from the mixtape, “Maker (Acoustic)”, is a moving exhortation to care for one’s muse, or as Anjimile memorably terms it: “Mind your maker.” In lines reminiscent of Frank Ocean’s verses on the JAY-Z and Kanye West 2011 track “No Church in the Wild” — "What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god? / What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?” — Anjimile sings over a stirringly strummed guitar line “I'm not just a boy I'm a man / I'm not just a man I'm a God / I'm not just a God I'm a maker / Mind your maker.” Where Ocean’s verses highlighted JAY-Z and West’s declaration of their cultural ascendency and musical sovereignty,  Anjimile’s lyrics both emphasize their own artistic achievement and serve as an appeal to, as they put it in an interview with the online magazine Vanyaland, “Listen to yourself. Take care of yourself. Watch yourself. Build love for yourself to yourself through yourself. Otherwise you are in danger of losing yourself.”
Anjimile returns to these themes — the importance of self-care and figuring out how to be a self in the world — throughout the mixtape. In “Pisces,” they explore how others can light the way for us in finding a way to be ourselves, singing on the chorus, “Yeah, you made a way for me / Feeling through... I can do that too.” Anjimile similarly explores the power of relationships to help us find our place in the world in “How Come,” singing, “this is where I want to be / with your hand in my hand / I know exactly where I stand.” This theme — that we are not alone in these existential struggles — is further emphasized through Anjimile’s choice to include background vocals from other artists such as Justine Bowe, Heather Scott, and Grant Bloom. These beautiful harmonizations, express the affirming power of community.
This is not to say that relationships with others are portrayed solely as a source of support in Anjimile’s work. In “Sonja Smokes Me Out,” they sing about getting high with a roommate after a difficult argument with a friend. Anjimile described the inspiration for the song in an interview with WBUR, saying, “I got into an argument with a friend of mine about race and racial justice, and he said some really stupid s--- to me,” adding that the lyrics describe “the way that I feel when white people who have no understanding of social justice attempt to, like, argue with me about it, and create pity as if I'm supposed to feel bad for them.”  Over bright, catchy indie rock backing Anjimile movingly captures the pain of feeling “erase[d]” and “dead” and the not uncomplicated relief of subsequently getting high. The emotional landscape of "Baby No More (Acoustic),” the mixtape’s closer, is also fraught. In the track, which by its sound ought to be a coffeehouse classic, Anjimile explores the breakdown of a relationship in which they’ve hurt their partner, asking self-critical rhetorical questions: “Am I not supposed to hurt you? / Am I not supposed to make you cry?” and then making the painful if necessary decision to end the relationship in a heartbroken cry: “I can't be your baby no more.” The song about sorrowful endings is a fitting conclusion to an all-too-brief release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Tune in, turn on, and drop out.” Spoken by Timothy F. Leary at a gathering of over 20,000 hippies in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park in 1967, these words were a call for young people across America to take psychedelics, seek divinity within, and reject all that exists without. And in the counterculture of the 1960s, Leary had disciples: The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan; kids at Woodstock, Newport Folk, Monterey Pop. Thousands of youths saw themselves as “part of a greater organism”: turning on, tuning in, and dropping out.
But some of Leary’s friends dropped back in. For young people on the left, psychedelic pandemonium came with resentful rebellion: railing against Cold War brinkmanship, sexual repression, and racial segregation. In North Carolina, teenage sit-ins sparked a countrywide sit-in movement. In Berkeley, thousands of students defied a ban on on-campus political activities. In Chicago, over 200,000 students boycotted classes in protest of ongoing segregation. And at Harvard, scandal erupted when the media found out that undergraduates were taking the separation of procreation and sex into new territory.
Sixties counterculture was by no means perfect. For many, the call to action paved the way for hedonistic utopianism; for others, it meant turning a blind eye to Soviet expansionism. Some exploited the atmosphere to feed their self-indulgent sense of entitlement; others abused and commoditized drugs to the point of death. Every triumph of the decade was accompanied by severe and important losses: reckless debauchery, years of potential research, and overlooked tyrants in Europe and South America.
Yet, despite all its faults, one cannot help but admire the spirit of sixties counterculture. For it is that spirit — that fighting, aspirational spirit — which, in addition to helping launch the welfare state and forcing through the Civil Rights Act, took it beyond national borders. By 1968, young people had become the world’s loudest voice against the Vietnam War: 4,000 outside the US embassy in London; a brave student killed at the University of Puerto Rico; thousands of draft cards burned in Australia and America. The sixties inspired a global leftist movement; it brought together a disparate collection of causes and identity groups for the sake of a greater political purpose. And the results, though flawed, contributed to the end of a disastrous conflict.
No such movement exists today, and that is not because there is nothing for young people to protest. America has a dangerous narcissist in the White House, and every day its democratic system becomes increasingly vulnerable to foreign manipulation. Islamist extremists continue to promote extremist ideology abroad while white supremacists call for the deportation of anyone who arrived in their nation from abroad. From voter suppression and environmental degradation to irresponsible social media companies and ever-increasing inequality, there is plenty for the youth to challenge.
But today, those seeking social justice are more often associated with political correctness than radical impudence; freedom of speech has become a talking point of the right rather than the left. Students would rather find enemies in their insufficiently woke neighbors than form powerful coalitions across political boundaries; they would sooner appear to be fighting false enemies than spend their time addressing real ones. The most popular college protests of the past five years have been over a conservative provocateur’s speaking platform, a Sanders-supporting professor’s rejection of segregation, and an email suggesting that the role of a college faculty should not extend to Halloween costume recommendations.
In all three cases, the students were the prosecutors, not the defendants. In all three cases, the students appealed to a pre-existing authority for their answers. And in all three cases, the students spent significant time arguing amongst themselves. Some might point to the Women’s March as an exception, but its leadership’s blatant anti-Semitism has alienated those who do not subscribe to a stream of illiberal opinions; and the result, despite initial promise, has been to mask unproductive infighting with Instagram icons.
As students have self-segregated into fanatical factions, their enemies have stepped in to take their place. Far-right racists have stolen the revolutionary spirit, claiming to fight on behalf of the people while doing all they can to divide them into hostile groups. Across Europe, nativist and neo-fascist parties are winning elections by exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment. In America, neo-Nazis are making a resurgence in the public sphere. A tribalistic president is putting destructive policies into action and former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon has just returned from an expansive European tour — all while our student activists complain about course syllabi and call out Kanye West’s tweets.
Young skins have become thinner, aspirations have grown smaller, and bigots have seized the countercultural mantle. Potential allies have been left politically deserted and students have grown perennially distracted. The notion that members of the free speech movement could have once marched alongside sexual liberators and drug legalizers is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine.
In her 1968 Class Day speech at Harvard, Coretta Scott King called every student of her day a “serious-minded, independent-thinking individual” with an “amazing power to influence the course of societies all over the world.” Her statement was a powerful one that accurately described the spirit of 1960s youth. But now, in an era dominated by virtue signalling and identity politics, its message is needed more than ever.
Progress, as Oscar Wilde put it, has been made through disobedience — anti-fragile revolutionaries confronting flawed arguments wherever they found them. Those revolutionaries have not always had the right answers, but they have always asked the right questions; they have disregarded fruitless battles in order to take part in the real war.

In association with the American Federation of Teachers, Harvard Medical School released an online course in mid-January to educate teachers on how to combat opioid abuse. The course, designed in the wake of considerable interest in a 2017 HarvardX course entitled “The Opioid Crisis In America,” is intended for educators but open to the general public. While we commend the Medical School’s efforts to reach out to the community and provide practical information for mitigating the opioid crisis, we believe the Medical School is in a unique position to use its expertise to help address the crisis on a more systemic level.
In order to address the opioid epidemic on a more systemic, action-oriented level, the Medical School should concentrate on the broader push to lessen the negative contribution to the opioid epidemic by medical professionals. The Medical School could achieve this through pursuing more active programs to educate doctors about the dangers of the opioids they prescribe. Increased trainings on how to approach patients about using opioids and potential alternative prescriptions should accompany these initiatives, as between 21 and 29 percent of patients who are prescribed opioids end up abusing them. Furthermore, 75 percent of those who began abusing opioids in the 2000s were first exposed to the drugs through a prescription. That said, medical professionals are often undereducated about this risk: An instance of this can be seen in a course at the Medical School entitled “Social Change, Injury Prevention, and the Practice of Medicine,” which seems to only cover opioids in the context of accidental ingestion, failing to mention the opioid abuse crisis. The Medical School should leverage its expertise to stop this source of opioid exposure, rather than focusing its efforts solely on damage limitation.
While the Medical School can and should look for better ways to address the opioid crisis, the existing program remains laudable. The fact that it was released in collaboration with the AFT allows the course to target educators who work with different age groups ranging from elementary school to higher education. We hope that the AFT will use its teaching expertise to empower teachers to protect their students from the opioid crisis in the way that is most consistent with their stage in life. To best combat the crisis, the Medical School should look to disseminate its medical knowledge the same way that these online courses allows the AFT to mobilize its expertise.
Another aspect of the class that deserves specific commendation is its open access format. It is always beneficial when ivory tower research institutions like the Medical School make their expertise accessible for the public good. Solving public health problems like the opioid epidemic may sometimes require raising mass awareness to influence relevant behavior at a population level, like hand-washing, flu vaccinations, or Narcan administration. This course and the choice to make it open to the public recognizes the potential that online classes have to spread such awareness. We hope that the Medical School will take the spirit of open access to knowledge embodied in this initiative and expand it to its other programs to promote best practices in public health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, like many members of the Government department, we were shocked and deeply concerned by allegations of persistent sexual harassment by Professor Jorge I. Dominguez, a faculty member in the department. In the weeks that followed, it became clear that the alleged behavior was well-known by many students long before reaching faculty and administrators. This revealed a problematic departmental climate: one that lacked transparency, equality, and accountability.
These events also provided an opportunity to reflect on and improve the climate in our community. This past fall, a committee in the Government department fielded a comprehensive survey of the department, looking specifically but not only at instances of exclusion, discrimination, and harassment. With high response rates from students, faculty, and staff, we feel confident that the results of this survey present the most accurate picture of the department to date. We have made this survey and the anonymized data available to all members of the community.
In many respects, the results of this survey give us reasons to be proud. 77 percent of our community would recommend the Government department to a peer, and most members have a strong feeling of belonging within our department. A majority of our undergraduate students believe the department provides them with the training necessary to be successful in their career and that faculty care about student success in the classroom. Similarly, 82 percent of graduate students believe faculty care about the success of their research.
But, importantly, the results also firmly point to shortcomings and further emphasize the urgency of the situation: Most significantly, women in the department, particularly women graduate students, are less satisfied with the climate than are men. Many political conservatives feel they are not able to fully express their opinions in the classroom. These findings reflect that members of our community — disproportionately women — reportedly have experienced some form of harassment (3 percent) or discrimination (9 percent). While these proportions indicate that harassment and discrimination are not widespread, they are not zero, which is the only acceptable number.
And, of course, harassment and discrimination have a chilling effect beyond the direct victims — affecting the ability of others to work and learn in an uncomfortable, hostile, or even unsafe environment. Because of this, harassment and discrimination cost us talent, make us less diverse, and inhibit our students’ best work.
As stated in the survey report, “all members [of the department] must be able to work and learn in an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination, and in which resources and support are available to all members as needed to fulfill their goals and to be commensurate with the merits of their endeavors.” The Harvard Government department is a significant part of undergraduate education at the College and is a leading political science department in the world. As such, we have a responsibility to set an example as a place where all members of our community can thrive while being treated with dignity and respect.
Last spring, a Committee on Climate Change of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff began examining our past failures and for teaching, mentoring, hiring and promotion, internal governance, and community building. The committee strives to develop norms and practices that are more transparent, inclusive, and supportive for all members of the Government department community. Their efforts have already yielded concrete actions, including a series of lectures and social events designed to bring students and faculty together across ranks and fields, an ongoing review of our graduate mentoring, and restructuring of our Teaching Fellow training, including expanded training on issues of diversity in the classroom.
Our survey has given us data to make informed decisions. In light of what we’ve learned, we will now renew our efforts for inclusion and gender equality. But the process of reform is only beginning: To become the department to which we aspire, we welcome and value the input of all members of our department and concerned members of the wider Harvard community.
In the past, the Government department fell short of the standard to which we should hold ourselves. As we move forward, we invite members of our community to examine the survey report and join us in our efforts to build a department that is diverse, democratic, and excellent.

In the wake of his announcement that he will serve on Harvey Weinstein’s legal team, Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. emailed Winthrop residents a list of resources for sexual assault and harassment issues late Monday night.
The email outlined several “processes” he and Stephanie R. Robinson — his wife and fellow Winthrop faculty dean — will put in place going forward, including designating Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers as the house’s “point person” for sexual assault issues. Monday’s email follows a separate message Sullivan sent Winthrop residents more than a week ago defending his decision to represent Weinstein.
“I write tonight after hearing, listening, reflecting, and processing what was shared with Stephanie and me,” Sullivan wrote Monday night. “We just finished another meeting with our tutor staff and Resident Dean, and we have worked up some suggestions and actions that we will be taking to move us forward so that all at Winthrop feel that this is a safe place and a happy and warm home.”
Sullivan wrote that students can consult Chavers and other house staff on issues of sexual assault.
“If any student feels as though the reporting structure of the House would inhibit them from accessing resources internally, know that Linda will be available to talk without any obligation to report the substance of your conversation internally,” Sullivan wrote.
Students will also be able to seek assistance from house tutors — all of whom have been briefed on resources for sexual misconduct issues — and non-house resources including the Dean of Students Office and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, according to Sullivan’s email.
Though he announced Chavers will serve as the “point person” for sexual abuse matters, Sullivan told The Crimson he will still be a resource for students.
“The email explicitly includes the [Faculty Deans] as one of many resources,” Sullivan wrote in an email Tuesday morning.
Sullivan’s email to Winthrop students also said Robinson, who leads a “Women of Winthrop” group in the house, will incorporate programming that deals with issues of sexual assault and harassment into the group’s already-scheduled programming for the semester.
“The foregoing is not intended to be exhaustive,” Sullivan wrote regarding the information he outlined in his email. “Rather, it represents a starting point.”
Sullivan told The Crimson that the “processes” he laid out in his Monday email are not changes, but rather a list of resources available to students.
“It highlights the multiplicity of resources available to students who seek guidance on sexual assault/harassment issues,” he wrote. “Enhanced WOW programming represents a supplement to what the House has always done.”
The missive from Sullivan comes a few days after the lawyer and Harvard Law School professor criticized Harvard’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. A Jan. 29 RealClearInvestigations article identifies Sullivan as Fryer’s lawyer, though Sullivan avoided directly answering multiple questions from The Crimson about his role in Fryer’s defense.
Sullivan has a history of representing high-profile clients, including former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez and the family of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014. He is representing Weinstein in a Manhattan sexual abuse case resulting from allegations that Weinstein raped one woman and forcibly performed oral sex on another. A pretrial conference has been scheduled for March 7.
Correction: Feb. 6, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly characterized the allegations that Prof. Fryer is facing.  He is facing allegations of sexual harassment, not assault.

The Harvard Law Review elected second-year Law student Lauren N. Beck as its 133rd president, according to an email from outgoing president Michael L. Thomas.
Beck, who was born in Northern California and raised in San Francisco, graduated from Columbia University in 2014 with a degree in English literature. Before starting at Harvard Law School, Beck worked at Codeacademy, an education startup based in New York that specializes in teaching students computer programming skills. This summer she will serve as a summer associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson.
The Harvard Law Review was founded in 1887 by former United States Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis. The publication is entirely student-edited with the largest circulation of any law journal in the world. The Law Review counts various notable alumni among its members, including former U.S. President Barack Obama.
Thomas praised Beck in an email for her suitability for the position and wrote he is excited for the future of the publication under her leadership.
“The Law Review is incredibly fortunate to have Lauren at the helm. She has consistently impressed her peers with her brilliance, thoughtfulness, and dedication to the institution.” Thomas wrote. “I am so excited to see all the ways that the Law Review will thrive under her leadership.”
Beck wrote in an emailed statement that her predecessor helmed the publication skillfully.
“Michael has led the Law Review with compassion, humility, and skill,” Beck wrote. “His exceptional tenure is a testament to his character, and to his remarkable intellect.”
Beck also wrote that she looks forward to continuing the legacy left by Thomas and other Law Review editors.
“Michael and his volume leave our scholarship and our internal community more ambitious, more cohesive, and simply stronger,” Beck wrote. “I’m grateful for the chance, alongside the brilliant editors in our volume, to follow their example.”
Beck’s election comes after the Law Review has made efforts in the past few years to increase diversity at the publication. The Law Review expanded its affirmative action policy in 2013, and has since elected its first majority female class in 2017.
This hiring policy has recently come under fire in a suit brought against the Law Review, Harvard Law School, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College — the University's highest governing board, otherwise known as the Harvard Corporation — for alleged violation of anti-discrimination laws Title VI and IX.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Corporation member and former CEO of American Express Kenneth I. Chenault was featured in a PBS and The HistoryMakers special “An Evening with Ken Chenault” that featured commentary from University President Lawrence S. Bacow, former University President Drew G. Faust, and two other Corporation members.
The hour-long special — hosted by CBS sportscaster James T. Brown ’73 — examines Chenault’s life and leadership, from steering American Express through the 2008 financial crisis to serving as a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Julieanna L. Richardson, founder and president of The HistoryMakers, a non-profit organization that preserves “untold personal stories of both well-known and unsung African Americans,” said Chenault’s experience in business and law made him a notable subject for the piece.
“Ken Chenault is much admired and much respected not only from the Law School and the general Harvard community, but in corporate America,” Richardson said. “There is no other corporate executive that has his record in terms of being the CEO of American Express for 17 years.”
Bacow and Faust both paid tribute to Chenault in the special, alongside former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, media mogul and billionaire philanthropist Oprah Winfrey, and numerous prominent businesspeople and professional athletes.
Bacow — Chenault’s classmate at Harvard Law School in the mid-70s — introduced a segment on Chenault’s education at Harvard, where he shared the halls of the Law School with figures like John Payton, former president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr.
“I think that the law school represented, for many of us at least, an opportunity to pursue ideals of social justice,” Bacow said.
Faust — who served as University president when Chenault joined the Corporation in 2014 — offered high praise, noting Chenault’s astuteness even at the very start of his tenure on the University’s highest governing body.
“Even though he was new and was just getting to know the details of where Harvard was and what the big questions before us were, I remember him at that meeting saying some stunningly insightful things,” Faust said during the program. “And I just was taken aback by his wisdom.”
One of the newer members of the Corporation, Chenault served on the presidential search committee that ultimately culminated in the selection of Bacow, his fellow Corporation member and classmate.
The two Corporation members featured in the special — Theodore V. Wells Jr. and David M. Rubenstein — also praised their colleague’s expertise and talent.
Rubenstein commended Chenault for serving as the leader of “a great company” with “compassion, intellect, humanity and with great skill.”
Wells — another of Chenault’s classmates at the Law School — noted the talent and fame of his and Chenault’s African-American colleagues from Cambridge, many of whom rose to prominence in business, academia, and law.
“It was an extraordinary period with an extraordinary group of black men and women,” he added.
After stepping down as the chief executive of American Express, Chenault became the chairman and managing director of venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners and joined the boards of technology companies like Facebook and Airbnb.
“An Evening with Ken Chenault” began airing on PBS stations Feb. 3 and will be broadcast on Boston’s local station, WGBH-TV, Feb. 24 at 4 p.m.

Cambridge residents riding with Uber can now take advantage of an enhanced security feature built into the application to improve emergency response.
The feature, called “911 Assistance,” enables passengers to call 911 swifely through Uber’s new Safety Toolkit — which riders can access by tapping the security icon on the bottom right of the screen without having to exit the app.
Cambridge emergency responders can now also access trip details, including vehicle information, precise location updates, and private information — such as medical history and emergency contacts — that Uber riders can provide in advance by creating an online user profile via an external application, according to the Cambridge Police website . Cambridge is the second city in Massachusetts to adopt this feature.
Director of Communications and Media Relations for Cambridge Police Department Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email that the emergency assistance program will benefit community members.
“Every second counts in an emergency, and these new updates will help ensure those living, working and visiting Cambridge get help quickly with accurate information if faced with an emergency situation,” he wrote.
Warnick highlighted the feature’s subtlety, writing that “these new enhancements enable passengers to be able to share extensive details with Emergency Dispatchers without drawing attention to Uber drivers.” He said users do not need to speak with a dispatcher for assistance.
Michael Martin — an alum of Harvard Business School — co-founded RapidSOS, a venture-backed company focusing on providing emergency response data. RapidSOS partnered with Uber to work on the 911 dispatch program. Martin wrote in an email that he created the company after finding himself in an emergency situation.
“In that moment I realized just how hard it is to get out your phone, dial a number, and have a coherent conversation in the middle of an emergency,” he wrote. “911 often doesn’t even know your name or your location when you call.”
During his time at HBS, Martin worked with first responders and the Emergency Communications Department in Cambridge to modernize 911 calling.
Some Harvard students using Uber said they welcome the enhanced security feature.
Morgan L. Whitten ’21 said that she has felt uncomfortable during Uber rides.
“It turned out alright, but it’s nice knowing that if something was wrong, I would have this feature to keep me safe,” she said.
Clarification: Feb. 11, 2019
A previous version of this article stated that Cambridge emergency responders could access trip details and private information that Uber riders provided in advance through an online profile. To clarify, Uber riders provide this information through an external application.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prominent labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores C. Huerta will receive this year’s Radcliffe Medal, the highest honor given by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the institute announced Wednesday.
Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, joins the ranks of United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former University President Drew G. Faust in receiving the medal. It is given annually to an individual committed to “excellence, inclusion, and social impact,” according to a press release.
Huerta, 88, directed a nearly five-year grape strike in Delano, Calif. beginning in 1965, which led to collective bargaining efforts between the employers and what became the United Farm Workers. She helped win concessions on wages, security, working conditions, benefits, for workers, along with workers’ choice on representation.
Huerta’s leadership in the labor movement centered on challenging ethnic and gender stereotypes. Her phrase “Sí Se Puede,” which she created as the slogan of UFW, has evolved into a symbol for the empowerment of marginalized groups across the United States. Former President Barack Obama based his campaign slogan, “Yes We Can,” on Huerta’s phrase.
Radcliffe Institute Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who will formally present Huerta with the medal at a ceremony in May, called her “a towering figure in the labor, civil rights, and women’s movements” in a press release.
Brown-Nagin said Huerta’s achievements are often overshadowed by her male counterparts, like Cesar Chavez.
“The fact that some individuals won’t immediately recognize Dolores Huerta’s name and know why we’re honoring her illustrates the all-too-common erasure of women from our histories,” Brown-Nagin said in the release. “As a historian, I am keenly aware that Huerta and other women from traditionally marginalized groups are especially likely to be omitted from our historical narratives.”
“Every American should know her name and her decades-long work to secure the rights of farmworkers, women, and other disadvantaged people,” Brown-Nagin added.
The Radcliffe Medal is not Huerta’s first honor from a Harvard-affiliated institution. She was also the recipient of Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ 2009 Humanitarian of the Year Award – an award that has also honored Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai and former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Huerta will receive the award May 31 as part of the annual Radcliffe Day during Harvard’s commencement week. The day’s program will start with a discussion panel on the “intersection of food and social justice” moderated by Emmy-winning journalist Soledad T. O’Brien ’88, followed by Huerta’s keynote remarks and a separate conversation with O’Brien, according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than one million fans, including several Harvard students, flocked to downtown Boston Tuesday to welcome home their Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots.
Students joined the crowd on the sidewalks of Boylston Street and Boston Common. Many of them skipped classes and put their studies on hold in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Patriots players as they held aloft the Vince Lombardi Trophy to celebrate their victory.
Fans screamed “I love you, Tom” to quarterback Tom Brady and directed obscenities at the Los Angeles Rams, the team the Patriots defeated 13-3 on Sunday. Music boomed from speakers mounted to the Duck Boats and flatbed trucks that carried the players and their families. “Let’s have another Super Bowl of Ram chowder,” one fan’s sign read, referring to Boston’s famous clam chowder.
The Boston Police Department estimated 1.5 million fans attended the parade, which began at Hynes Convention Center and made its way to City Hall.
Paul E. Kuechler ’22 said he skipped class for the first time at Harvard to commemorate his hometown team, an experience he said was “worth it.”
“Once in a lifetime is what they say, but hopefully not,” Kuechler said of the opportunity to attend a championship parade.
Boston sports fans have not had a dearth of championship parades in recent years. This year’s win was the Patriots’ sixth since 2002 and the Boston Red Sox held a parade just a couple months ago to celebrate winning the World Series. Boston teams have won 12 championships in the last 18 years.
Chris Kuang ’20, a self proclaimed “die-hard” Patriots fan and six other Harvard students spent three hours in Boston to watch the parade.
“I’ve grown up around Boston and been to a bunch of parades my whole life, and each one is special,” he said. “It only happens every once in a while. We’re lucky here in Boston to have had a lot of celebrations over the years, but you really can’t take them for granted.”
With warm temperatures and sunny skies, the weather presented prime conditions for the parade, a marked improvement compared to the snowy championship parade two years ago.
“The weather was a lot nicer, which was really good,” Feven Yohannes ’22 said after attending her second parade in three years. “There was that New England camaraderie, everyone coming together and having fun together.”
Yohannes said she did not mind missing lecture to attend the parade. But not every student — even longtime fans — could afford to miss class to partake in the festivities.
Jerome M. Edwards ’21 said he was disappointed that he had a class at the Medical School during the time of the parade.
“I personally felt like this season the team gave so much back and played so hard, so I hoped to attend to show my appreciation and love for them,” he said.

Harvard will join a group of higher education institutions focused on combating harassment and discrimination, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced at the faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday afternoon.
Bacow debriefed the faculty on initiatives the University is taking to combat sexual and gender-based harassment. In uniting with other higher education institutions, Harvard will be joining an initiative with the National Academies that focuses on sexual harassment of women in the academic sciences, engineering, and medicine.
He added that administrators are discussing ways to combat sexual and gender-based harassment, noting that he and others heard from experts on the topic during a retreat over winter break.
“It was an enlightening conversation for all of us,” he said.
Following Bacow’s announcement, the faculty sparred over a proposal to establish a concurrent degree program allowing students to obtain both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in four years.
The proposal, presented by Comparative Literature Professor Karen L. Thornber, would replace the current Advanced Standing program, which is currently being phased out. Advanced Standing allows students entering the College having completed advanced coursework to either obtain a bachelor’s degree in three years or a master’s and a bachelor’s in four.
Unlike the Advanced Standing program — which requires students to enter college with a certain number of Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credits to participate — the new system would be open to all students in the class of 2022 and beyond.
Students in the proposed program would be allowed to double-count three courses towards both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. They would then be required to take five graduate-level courses in addition to their normal undergraduate work to complete the program, likely requiring them to take five courses for five semesters.
Faculty opposing the proposal said the program could overburden students, damage the integrity of master’s degrees, and continue to advantage students who attended elite high schools.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, one of a handful of professors who spoke against the proposal, argued that requiring students to enroll in an extra course for multiple semesters in a row to achieve a dual degree is “too heavy a burden.”
“The quality of students’ work — and these are our best students — will go down as they split their daily 24 hours five ways instead of four,” he said.
Thornber said she would be open to increasing the number of courses students could double-count towards a master’s degree from three — as detailed in the current proposal — to four.
But that incremental change likely will not placate some of the more vocal opponents of the proposal at Tuesday’s meeting. Physics Professor Howard M. Georgi ’68 suggested allowing students to double-count all eight graduate-level courses towards a dual degree, so as not to constrain students’ research pursuits.
“In addition to making it clear that we value the quality of our students’ education over sheer quantity, this would eliminate the games that students can now play with their grade-point averages,” he said.
Robb Moss, chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, also presented a proposal at the meeting to change the name of his department to the “Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies,” saying the current name has become “opaque” after a decades-long shift in the focus of its classes and faculty research.
The Faculty Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — voted to approve both proposals at its meeting last week. The Council’s vote is purely advisory, and the full faculty will likely vote on the proposals next month.

Harvard presented its annual Town Gown report to the Cambridge Planning Board Tuesday, outlining 2018 campus infrastructure projects, University initiatives, and affiliate statistics. The report also included upcoming campus development plans and projections for future years.
The Town Gown is an annual report compiled by Harvard, as well as other Cambridge area universities, submitted to the city of Cambridge every year. Following publication, each school must present its report to city representatives.
The term “town gown” refers to the distinction between the academic — “gown” — and non-academic — “town” — parts of cities home to college campuses.
According to Harvard’s report, the document “provides data which characterize the University’s population, land and buildings, and payments to the City,” as well as plans for the next year. The 76-page report also outlines community partnerships, affordable housing initiatives, and sustainability efforts.
Harvard Planning Office and Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, the University’s central public relations office, help to compile the the Town Gown report.
During the University's presentation, Alexandra Offiong, Harvard’s director of planning services, shared plans for ongoing and future construction projects on Harvard’s campus including the completed Smith Campus Center, the House renewal program, and the construction of Harvard’s science and engineering complex in Allston. She also said the University is making progress on building a district energy facility to power parts of campus.
Heather Henriksen, the managing director of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, described the university’s progress toward fulfilling its Climate Action Plan, which aims for the campus to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. In outlining Harvard’s climate action goals, she specifically referenced Harvard’s commitment to developing technologies and strategies for global utilization.
“It is really about translating the research and teaching into practice, piloting it on campus, proving it, innovating, scaling it, and then getting it beyond Harvard to help others in society these global systemic sustainability challenges like climate,” she said.
Planning Board member Tom Sieniewicz commended the sustainability projects detailed in Harvard’s report, calling them “bona fide living labs.”
“I’m proud of that,” he said.
Thomas J. Lucey, HPAC’s director of government and community relations for Cambridge, discussed Harvard’s work towards creating and preserving affordable housing in and around Harvard Square.
“Our commitment to housing isn’t just housing our own students, but it’s working in partnerships with both the City of Cambridge and local community development corporations in a variety of different ways,” he said.
Touting Harvard’s community outreach work, he also listed several of the University’s efforts to connect and collaborate with Cambridge Public Schools.
Harvard offers opportunities for public school students of all ages to access Harvard’s resources, including the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture, the Harvard Art Museums, the American Repertory Theater, and various other Harvard laboratories and classrooms.
Planning Board Chair H. Theodore Cohen also commented on the role of the Town Gown in building bridges between Cambridge and its institutions of higher learning.
“This report helps strengthen the connection between the universities and the public,” he said.

Wielding signs with slogans like “a vote for Schultz is a vote for Trump” and chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Howard Schultz has got to go,” more than 30 demonstrators gathered outside Brattle Theatre to protest the billionaire’s possible independent presidential bid.
Schultz — the former CEO of Starbucks — visited Cambridge to promote his book “From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America.” He told the New York Times in January he plans to travel the country on a months-long book tour before making a final decision on whether to declare an independent bid among a widening field of 2020 presidential hopefuls.
Schultz’s sold-out talk, hosted by the Harvard Bookstore, drew at least 100 audience members.
The demonstration was part of a “coordinated effort across the country” by local chapters of Indivisible — a liberal grassroots organization — to oppose Schultz “at each and every single one of the book stops, or as many as we can,” said Monica R. Burke, the organizer of the protest and group leader for the Acton, Mass. chapter of Indivisible.
Many demonstrators said they are frustrated with Schultz’s choice to identify as an independent, if he chooses to run.
“I'm here because I want a different president than Donald Trump in 2020, and if Howard Schultz runs as an independent, he will split the Democratic votes, and we will lose,” protester Robin W. Parker, a resident affiliate of Quincy House, said.
“We don't particularly mind if Howard Schultz runs,” said protestor Lisa A. Baci, a member of Minutemen Indivisible, a chapter of the advocacy group based in Lexington, Mass. “We just wish he'd pick a party and run in one of the existing parties and not run in a way that might make him a spoiler and elect someone who doesn't have majority support.”
Adam M. Friedman, the director of political advocacy group Voter Choice Massachusetts, said independent candidates are evidence that the country’s two-party political system does not effectively represent voters’ wishes.
“Howard Schultz is just one spoiler in a long line of other potential spoilers — we like to call them ‘so-called spoilers’ because people shouldn't be blamed for running, but unfortunately our two-party system breaks down when more than two people run, so people are being as pragmatic as they can by pressuring candidates to drop out,” Friedman said.
Burke, too, said the two-party system is ineffective.
“If you want to actually fix the system, and actually get to the point where we can actually get behind independents, what he should then do is be the poster child for ranked-choice voting,” she said.
Inside the talk, Schultz conversed with moderator James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic. Protesters did not interrupt the event.
Many attendees said they bought their tickets before Schultz’s announcement that he was considering a presidential bid and chose to come because they were eager to hear him speak about his book and his life.
“Starbucks is a transformative company in the culture of the country, so I thought it would be interesting to hear him speak,” event attendee Debbie R. Silberstein said.
Some audience members said they appreciated Schultz’s business expertise and admired his possible political aspirations.
“He's a leader and has a lot of interesting things to say about the entrepreneur's journey,” Ann C. Mitchell ’94 said.
“I thought it was cool, just on his stance on being independent and why he thought that was the right strategy to go about to make a difference and how Americans might take that as being something that could be more transformative and different,” Christine L. Blims said.
Others, like Amy Gerber of Needham, Mass., said the talk left them disappointed.
“My impression with him is that he’s a Republican who just doesn’t want to go in and try and take over the Republican nomination rather than just being a spoiler,” Gerber said.
Schultz did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. During his talk, he argued he is not a spoiler candidate, according to Mitchell.
“He made a big disclaimer at the beginning saying that he is not [a spoiler],” Mitchell said. “He was adamant that he is not a spoiler.”
When asked about the protests as he signed copies of his book for event-goers outside the theatre, Schultz said the demonstrators have a right to free speech. He did not comment further.

The repeat vandalism of a sign for a gender-neutral bathroom in Adams House sparked allegations of transphobia and prompted house administrators to email residents condemning the act.
The sign includes three icons intended to represent male, female, and non-binary individuals. Adams House staff found the female icon colored in with a black marker Thursday night. After staff cleaned the sign, the icon was colored in a second time Monday evening.
Adams Faculty Deans Judith “Judy” S. Palfrey ’67 and John “Sean” G. Palfrey ’67, along with Resident Dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal, wrote in an email to residents that administrators will meet to discuss the issue within the next few days.
“There has been an unfortunate episode of vandalism here at Adams House,” they wrote. “Over the next few days we will meet to discuss this. We are committed to an inclusive environment at Adams House and will continue to promote policies and practices that support everyone’s sense of safety and belonging.”
The markings ignited widespread disagreement among house residents after Lily E. Gulledge ’21 posted an image of the vandalized sign on an internal house email list. Some students wrote the blacked-out sign made them feel unsafe in the house; others questioned the vandal’s intent.
Several students speculated over the email list that the vandalism was transphobic or sexist. Others suggested the bathroom’s proximity to a women’s bathroom — and the absence of a nearby men’s bathroom — may have inspired the graffiti.
Gulledge, who serves on the Adams House Committee, said the vandalism was a point of discussion at Monday night’s committee meeting and that it upset several committee members.
“Some people expressed in the meeting that they felt really uncomfortable because of it,” she said. “I thought it was really frustrating that someone had gone out of their way to do it again when they already made a point the first time.”
In their email, the Palfreys and Rosenthal wrote that resident tutors Eleanor C. Craig and Toby Oldham would host an “open dialogue” in their suite Tuesday evening.
Adams House first introduced gender-neutral bathrooms in 2015. At the time, administrators pointed to the House’s history as a supportive space for BGLTQ undergraduates and said the change would make Adams more welcoming.
Since then, several other houses have followed suit. In 2016, students in Eliot House shared photos of a broken sign for a gender-neutral bathroom over their email list. At the time, they said the act was sexist and offensive.
Catherine Y. Zhang ’19, a resident of Adams House, said she was disappointed to learn of the graffiti.
“Obviously I think they knew it would have a big symbolic impact on trans students who already feel uncomfortable here,” Zhang said. “For that reason I think it’s really terrible and whoever is doing it should stop.”
Zhang said she thinks the vandalism is unrepresentative of the Adams community as a whole.
“I think there’s also a pretty strong community of people in Adams who will not let this happen or when it happens will actively stand up for trans people in our community,” she said. “I feel confident that we will not let this happen anymore or at least be more active in our willingness to make a safe space in Adams.”

In the midst of political and economic turmoil in Venezuela resulting in international efforts to pressure President Nicolás Maduro to cede power, Venezuelans at the Harvard Kennedy School have spoken out with concerns about their country’s future.
Maduro was sworn into office for a second six-year term last month after a disputed election outcome. The opposition party accused the government of fraud and, later last month, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president.
Isaías A. Medina III, a former United Nations diplomat from Venezuela who is now a Kennedy School student, said he considers Guaidó the nation’s rightful leader.
“The constituent assembly convened an election — a fake and sham election — that was held last year supposedly electing Maduro for a second term,” Medina said. “[Guaidó] is filling the void of the executive power legally, and that has translated into an unstoppable Venezuelan Spring.”
Maduro has repeatedly declared the election results in his favor legitimate.
Medina worked in the Maduro administration for two years before resigning in protest two years ago.
“I was never asked to do anything that would violate my principles or morals until 2017,” Medina said. “They started shooting protesters in the street, mostly students...I was shocked.”
Maduro has been accused of human-rights abuses throughout his presidency.
Kennedy School Venezuelan Caucus members Nizar El Fakih and Armando I. Flores grew up in Caracas, the country’s capital, and still have family in Venezuela. El Fakih said that when he wakes up and sees news about the situation, his family is the first thing on his mind.
“The first thing I think about is whether or not my family is finding the medicines that they need, if they are finding the food that they need,” he said. “It’s a preoccupation I always have.”
Many in Venezuela are facing significant food shortages, power outages, and lack of access to medical products and services.
El Fakih said it’s difficult to predict how political conflict between Maduro and Guaidó will unfold in the coming weeks.
“Based on my daily communication with the people that are leading this movement in Venezuela — the politicians that are in the Congress — they are not sure about what is going to happen because they cannot predict the behavior of the regime,” he said.
Flores said that although the future of the country is uncertain, new developments inside and outside of Venezuela give him cause for optimism.
President Donald Trump recognized Guaidó as interim president within minutes of the leader’s public announcement Jan. 23, along with a majority of Latin American countries and Canada that backed the opposition. As of Monday, nine European nations have also recognized Guaidó as interim president after Maduro refused an eight-day ultimatum to call new elections.
“When I see what’s happening now, I have hope. Things are changing in the political landscape. We don’t know how it’s going to end yet, but at least things are changing,” Flores said.
Medina said the international response was justified.
“It’s the responsibility of the international community to step in when governments act against their own population,” he said.
In response to Maduro’s continued insistence on his presidency, the United States has imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, a blow to one of its largest industry at a time when the country is already facing major economic challenges.
Rodrigo Diamanti, founder of the international non-governmental organization “Un Mundo Sin Mordaza,” Spanish for “a world without censorship,” was one of many activists arrested in 2014. He fled Venezuela in 2015 and is now a research fellow at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation.
Diamanti said that rehabilitating Venezuela’s economy will be difficult since the nation has experienced levels of hyperinflation in recent months similar to those in post-World War I Germany.
“In order to recover from this level of collapse, we’ll need support from the whole continent,” Diamanti said.
“Malnutrition is affecting future generations, so it’s something that needs to be targeted very soon.”
Medina echoed the urgency in helping people suffering in Venezuela.
“This is a humanitarian problem,” he said. “It’s good against evil. It’s tyranny against democracy.”

Roughly a third of female respondents to a Government Department climate survey reported that their work or study within the department was “limited” by their gender, according to a report released Wednesday.
The survey, which featured questions about demographics and the general climate of the department, attained relatively high response rates — 72 percent among students and 87 percent among faculty and staff. The department sent the survey to all of its faculty, staff, and students in October. All responses were left anonymous.
The department decided to survey affiliates last fall, several months after more than 20 women publicly accused Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez of incidents of sexual misconduct spanning nearly 40 years. Government concentrators and graduate students called on the department to address climate issues and sanction Dominguez in the wake of the allegations.
The department established a “climate change” committee in March 2018 — weeks after the allegations became public — and tasked the committee with scrutinizing departmental culture.
One of the committee’s seven subcommittees, the “inclusive climate” subcommittee, was responsible for creating and distributing the survey in conjunction with the University’s Office of Institutional Research. The office processed the data in order to keep the responses anonymous, while the subcommittee analyzed the results.
Government Professor Ryan D. Enos, who chairs the inclusive climate subcommittee, said in a Tuesday interview that the goal of the survey was both to assess the “overall climate” of the department and to gauge the experiences of specific demographic groups.
Nine total respondents reported they have experienced harassment from “somebody associated with the Government Department.” In seven of the cases, the perpetrator was a faculty member, and three of the cases involved “undesired sexual attention.” Respondents were not asked to identify the perpetrator by name.
Roughly a quarter of the survey’s total respondents indicated there is not a Government Department faculty member or “other person in authority” in the department whom they would feel comfortable speaking to about issues of sexual harassment or “other issues of abuse.”
Additionally, nine percent of respondents overall reported that they had experienced some form of discrimination, defined in the report as “unjust or prejudicial treatment,” though there were significant disparities between groups. While just two percent of undergraduates reported discrimination, the figure rises to 16 percent for graduate students and 26 percent for female graduate students.
The most commonly cited reasons for discrimination were “gender identity” and “race/ethnicity,” according to the survey.
The survey also touched on issues of advising and mentorship.
More than 65 percent of all respondents reported being “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the department overall.
Graduate students generally reported facing challenges at higher rates than undergraduates: roughly half of graduate students indicated they feel the department’s system of assigning graduate teaching appointments is not “adequate to [their] needs.”
A plurality of female graduate students also reported that they “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with the statement, “Mentors, teachers, and advisors in the Government Department are not sufficiently sensitive to issues of inclusion, diversity, and belonging.”
The survey asked respondents how their political ideology affects their sense of belonging in the department. Sixty-one percent of self-identified conservatives reported their work or study was “limited” in some capacity by their political views, compared to nine percent of self-identified liberals.
“When it comes to saying they feel like they can be their authentic selves, conservatives are unlikely to do that, and they don't feel like they can speak out in class,” Enos said.
Much of the data in the survey cannot be adequately contextualized due to a lack of comparable data from other departments, according to Enos.
“The most important thing that we should compare it to is, what is the department that we aspire to be,” he said. “The Government Department, we not only educate a big portion of the College, but when it comes to our particular academic field, we’re a leader in the world.”
“So we have a duty to be a model,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Periodic laughter punctuated the live showing of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address at the Institute of Politics John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday night.
The IOP fellows kicked off the night by making predictions for the State of the Union before attendees watched Trump’s address on the forum’s big screen. By the end of the night, the fellows had correctly predicted most of Trump’s major points, especially those pertaining to immigration and the economy.
Gary D. Cohn drew on his experience as Trump’s former top economic advisor while outlining his expectations.
“He will come out and talk about the strength of the U.S. economy, he will talk about the jobs that have been created, he’ll talk about GDP growth, he’ll talk about wage growth,” Cohn said.
Trump did praise the state of the economy, touting his administration’s role in GDP growth.
“The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world,” Trump said.
Unexpected cheers broke out — both in the United States House of Representative chamber and at the IOP — when Trump highlighted advances for women in the workforce.
“No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year,” Trump said, before acknowledging the record-high number of women in Congress.
Trump also alluded to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s ongoing investigation, prompting criticism from Congressional Democrats who condemned him for obstruction after the event.
"An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations," Trump said.
During the IOP Fellows panel, former Tallahassee Mayor and 2018 Democratic Floridian gubernatorial candidate Andrew D. Gillum said he is concerned about Trump’s rhetoric surrounding undocumented immigrants and he predicted Trump would stereotype them during his speech.
“I fear that tonight will probably be a little bit of demagoging of immigrants,” Gillum said. “I think he will talk a lot about an invasion of the United States on the southern border despite the fact that illegal crossing at the border is at a 20-year low.”
Border security was indeed a central focus of Trump’s speech, and he pushed his proposal for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
“Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business," Trump said. “Walls work and walls save lives!”
Noticeably absent from Trump’s State of the Union address was the 35-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, caused by conflict over the proposed border wall. Former Rep. Barbara J. Comstock (R-VA) mentioned the shutdown during the IOP Fellows conversation. She said she thought it would be a significant talking point and an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation.
“I’ve always thought government shutdowns were a bad idea,” Comstock said. “They’re costly, they’re not conservative.”
The shutdown forced some Harvard professors to pause their research as they waited to renew grants from agencies that had closed. Some postdoctoral fellows also saw the status of their stipend payments remain in limbo as they depended on funding from the National Science Foundation, which had closed temporarily.
Though Trump did not address Comstock’s concerns about the shutdown, Comstock did correctly predict the mention of two bipartisan policies: modernizing infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices.
"Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure," Trump said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a crowded late-night audience filled with familiar faces and old friends, Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith and five former teammates shared their thoughts around gender and leadership in the arena of basketball and beyond.
Among those in the panel of alumni included Jessica Gelman ‘97, MBA ‘02, CEO of the Kraft Analytics Group; Megan Song ’98, former Harvard College Admission Officer; Hana Peljto Cluff ‘04, Vice President, Applied Analytics Solutions, Warner Media; Lindsay Miller ‘08, former assistant coach and current BU Master’s Candidate in Clinical Counseling and Sports Psychology; and Kit Metoyer ’16, Criminal Financial Investigator, Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office. The event was moderated by David Tannenwald ’08 of Harvard Magazine, who in conjunction with this talk released a piece entitled “An Authentic Act.”
In addition, almost the entire current team was present, seated in the front row at the Worklab in Central Square. The panel discussion revolved largely around the connectivity of female athlete empowerment to broader societal challenges facing gender equity and representation in the workforce.
Numerous panelists reflected on the impact that Coach Delaney-Smith — an outspoken advocate for gender equality who filed four anti-discrimination lawsuits while a coach at Westwood High in the 1970s and has voiced displeasure over pay differences in the coaching ranks — had on their own self-discovery and confidence as a woman in society.
“I looked at early on in my career where people would say, ‘You can’t do that or you’re not ready for that position,’” Gelman said. “I think in general [and] specifically for women, that’s a consistent theme which is, ‘you have to be able to do the work before you get the role.’ That’s not how Kathy [Delaney-Smith] taught us, which is there is a confidence thing too...to understand you can raise you hand and say you want to do more. I think that’s something that Kathy really preached.”
Delaney-Smith noted how she was a “bull in a china shop” initially as a high-school coach, but maintained a passion for her job and has stayed at Harvard for 37 seasons because of her platform to shift notions of female athletes and women in general.
“You guys can change the world,” said Delaney-Smith as she looked at her team. “That’s why I stayed at Harvard, as long as I have the talent in this room, the brainpower, motivation, and drives. I hope I can pass the baton to you, to know that, be that, and do that.”
At one point in the discussion, Delaney-Smith asked all of the male attendees in the audience to stand as a demonstration of how boys at a young age are taught to embrace confidence, while girls are instead ingrained with lessons of modesty and self-effacement.
“I ask every single recruit, ‘What’s your greatest strength?’”, Delaney-Smith said. “It’s better now, but they are very uncomfortable telling me what they are good at. I say, ‘What are your weaknesses?’ and I have a list for a half-hour.”
Miller, who is pursuing her postgraduate studies in psychology, added that this lack of embracing a positive identity has led teenage girls to lose a sense of their true selves. She noted that Delaney-Smith has exemplified the ability to “know who she is” at all times.
“I think we don’t have as many choices in our society today to choose authenticity,” Miller said. “We are more and more on this path either driven by the common app or by social media on what we’re supposed to be like...I think all of us have learned from Kathy this idea for going for comfort or greatness. You can choose comfort or greatness, but you can’t choose both.”
The open-ended portion of the talk concluded with Delaney-Smith emphasizing the need for increased financial and fan support for women’s sporting events, which despite the progress made since her earlier career continues to be a significant hurdle in the sports world. She called on collective assistance from all individuals, including “male allies.”
“You do more men’s events, you spend more time, energy, and effort on those events because they’re easier,” Delaney-Smith commented. “That’s the reality of the world. You think we should have equal pay, [but] where are we going to get the money from? I don’t have a simple answer for that, but I think the world needs to be comparable, period.”
On the hardwood, the women’s basketball team will head back on the road for Columbia-Cornell in the last of five games on the road, before returning back to Lavietes Pavilion for an all-important homestand with Princeton and Penn. Harvard currently holds a 3-1 record in Ivy play, and are looking for its first Ivy championship in 12 seasons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backstopped by a heroic goaltending effort, Harvard women’s hockey upset the nation’s seventh-ranked team to advance to its first Beanpot Championship since 2015. Its win over Boston College (19-10-0, 16-7-0 Hockey East) Tuesday night books the Crimson (8-11-3, 6-8-2 ECAC) a championship duel with the Boston University Terriers, who defeated Northeastern in the first semifinal of the day.
Despite putting only 12 shots on goal by the close of the second period — compared to the Eagles’ 38 — Harvard entered the final stanza clinging to a 2-1 lead. Spectators were just settling into their seats as the puck fell to the ice for the third period opening faceoff.
Co-captain and forward Lexie Laing won the draw, and freshman defender Kyra Willoughby quickly secured possession. Advancing the puck up the boards, Willoughby saw junior forward Kat Hughes, who pushed the puck to a streaking Laing. Maintaining an edge on the BC defender, Laing fired along the ice as she neared the faceoff dot.
The puck slid under Eagle freshman goalie Maddy McArthur and—just nine seconds into the period—the Crimson had widened its lead to a 3-1 advantage.
“We just went into the first draw...wanting to win that draw because we really think that that [faceoff] sets the tone for the entire period,” Laing said. “Kat [Hughes] did a great job of getting the puck past the defender, and I just picked it up and took it to the net. But I think that [goal] really was a turning point in the game because we kind of just shut them down at that point.”
Although Harvard found its stride in the third, striking instantly before later adding another goal to increase its lead to the 4-1 final tally, getting there was no walk in the park. A 53-shot onslaught by BC demanded impeccable defense from the Crimson. The Eagles struck early and often, putting 19 shots on goal in the opening period on the way to their jaw-dropping total.
Harvard’s defense was more than up to the challenge. Freshman goalie Lindsay Reed established control in the nets, locating shots through heavy traffic, beating BC passes with quick lateral movements, and stifling second-chance opportunities with tight rebound control.
Reed’s career high 52 saves on the night marked the first 50-plus-save performance by a Harvard keeper since 2016. Her most clutch play of the game came during a BC five-on-four advantage in the second period.
Riding a power play opportunity from a tripping minor by Laing, the Eagles funneled the puck across ice to set up a shot on a largely open net. Reed sprang into action, executing a sprawling kick save.
The Crimson killed the penalty moments later and went on to score barely a minute after Reed’s denial. With Reed as the squad’s backbone for the night, Harvard was able to muster the effort to pull off the upset of a top-ten opponent.
“I love playing against really good teams,” Reed said. “We had nothing to lose. I think we all showed up tonight, played really well in the [defensive] zone, and everyone helped me out.”
Embodying the “nothing to lose” attitude, the Crimson played at a frenetic pace in the first minutes of the game, and the Eagles matched the intensity. Constant end-to-end play carried on for more than seven minutes, interrupted only once by the referees’ whistle.
With activity settling down, Boston College took to the offensive and created the majority of the period’s scoring opportunities. Despite the Eagles’ offensive efforts, the Crimson defense proved impenetrable, bolstered by Reed coming up with several saves and Willoughby deflecting two dangerous centering pass attempts away from BC.
Eventually, the advantage in shots paid off for the Eagles. With 41 seconds to go in the first, sophomore forward Daryl Watts rounded the back of the net before curling up the half boards to set up a high-slot one-timer from BC captain and forward Makenna Newkirk. As Newkirk powered the shot towards the goal, the Harvard defense managed to tip the attempt. The deflection, however, was not enough, redirecting the puck through Reed and into the back of the net.
“You never want to let up a goal in the final minute,” Reed said. “But we went into the locker, took a deep breath, and knew we still had 40 minutes of Harvard Hockey left to play.”
Despite the Crimson’s intermission regroup, as the second period began, the offensive side of the ice saw BC continuing to heavily outshoot Harvard. The Eagles held a 26-8 lead in shots on goal as the second-period clock ticked below the 12:00 mark.
Then, sophomore forward Becca Gilmore cleared Crimson territory, carrying the puck through the neutral zone before relaying to sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich. Collecting the puck at the blue line, Jovanovich faced a one-on-one. Looking to create space, she cut to the faceoff dot and fired along the ice. Squeaking through the BC goalie’s 5-hole, the puck rattled inside the post to knot the game at one.
Less than six minutes later, Harvard continued its highly efficient offense as sophomore forward Kate Glover rushed the puck up the ice. With Eagle defensive attention glued on Glover as she crossed the blue, freshman forward Dominique Petrie found a pocket in the slot. Receiving a pass from Glover, Petrie netted a top-corner snipe to hand the Crimson a 2-1 lead, adding another set of points to the Jovanovich-Petrie-Gilmore line.
By the end of the night, the triumvirate would combine for five assists and three goals for an eight-point outing.
“We just had some chemistry,” said Jovanovich, who notched two goals and one assist, when asked about her line. “I played with Becca [Gilmore] last year, you throw Dom[inique Petrie] in the mix, [and] they’re both just very skilled players—great skaters, great hands, great vision. Playing with them, it’s just about getting open and communicating.”
With the Jovanovich-Petrie-Gilmore line clicking at high volume and Laing striking just nine seconds into the last act, BC had to alter its play. Down 3-1, the Eagles shifted their focus from defense to offense, exposing themselves to the Harvard counterattack.
“We thought we were playing pretty well in that second period, so we wanted to carry that momentum into the third,” said Eagles head coach Katie Crowley. “When they squeaked that one by, we needed to go a little more offensive. I think that’s probably why they got that fourth one.”
The Crimson seized on the gaps left by BC’s new offensive focus. With five minutes remaining, a Gilmore drive down the ice brought the puck past the blue line. Petrie crashed the net, and Jovanovich was there to score her second of the night off a far-pad rebound, booking Harvard’s ticket to the championship game.
The Crimson returns to ECAC play this weekend before vying for the Beanpot, with away games on Friday at Union College and Saturday at Rensselaer. Still needing to make up ground in the conference to secure a favorable playoff position, this weekend’s slate of games supersede Beanpot preparation for the time being.
“It just is what it is for all the schools in Boston,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone. “The hockey schools have to go back and play some pretty important league games themselves….We try to stay focused on what’s right in front of us…. We’re just taking every game as it comes.”
Next Tuesday, an 8 p.m. puck drop at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center marks the start of Harvard’s Beanpot Championship matchup against No. 8/8 Boston University. By then, the Crimson will have played six games in 12 days.
“We’re in a stage of the season where it’s playoff hockey, and the kids know it,” Stone said. “There’s this sense of urgency that we have, and we’ve been showing it recently… I think everyone understands that they’ve got to come to play as hard as they can together for the remainder of the season and make something happen.”

More often than not, the Grill is the only thing standing between Harvard students and sub-par HUDS days, making it a universal favorite. Tragedy struck at the Lowtel, however, when a thief nabbed the d-hall’s iPad, according to Grill staff member James C. Burdulis. After a grueling few weeks of putting pencil to paper to write their meal requests, the convenience of electronic ordering is finally back, thanks to the purchase of two new iPads (unfortunately, the OG iPad still remains missing). To the thief responsible: Instead of robbing the Grill of its beloved convenience, try these items instead.
That One Guy’s Canada Goose
As soon as the weather dips below 50 degrees, it’s open season on everybody’s favorite wintertime flex, the Canada Goose jacket. Whether you’re in need of a warm coat to shield you from the snow as you wait for the Quad Shuttle on a Friday night or just something to match those new Airpods you got for Christmas, this is a great option for those of us looking for a high stakes (but functional) steal.
Harvard Time
After a full semester without the beauty known as Harvard Time, now is the perfect time to steal it back. Stick it to Bacow and your professors by arriving on your own schedule — seven minutes late of course. Use your newfound extra time to get some extra Tinder swipes in (Valentine’s Day is closer than you think, folks), wait in the mile-long line at the Science Center Clover for a coffee, or hit the snooze button a few more times.
Dean Khurana’s Instagram
While his official role is Dean of the College, Rakesh Khurana’s true job is being the University’s hype man. The man’s Instagram is a legendary collection of selfies with students and other happenings around the University, but appearing on his feed is a blessing only a select few are fortunate enough to attain. Stealing Rakesh’s social media presence would also be a walk in the park — insider intel says that his password is CabotsNumberOneDad. Once you’ve stolen his account, take your rightful place on his Instagram page.
The John Harvard Statue
A random iPad is hardly a brag-worthy steal. Set your sights higher — snag the most photographed object on campus instead. The resulting tourist rage will put a bounty on your head, making the risk all the more tempting for true daredevils. If you really want to go the extra mile, list the stolen statue on eBay and reap the profits of a bidding war between alumni and Harvard-obsessed high schoolers.
The Declaration of Independence
For those of us (aka all of us) seeking to live out our Nicholas Cage-inspired dreams, grab a trusty sidekick or two and get over to Washington, D.C. Sure, this one could end with you being questioned by the FBI, but what better way to procrastinate all those essays and p-sets than going into hiding?
While all of these suggestions are preferable to sabotaging the Lowell Grill iPad, we don’t endorse adding a felony to your resume. And to the technology thief who’s still at large, we urge you to think of those sad, inconvenienced Lowell students and renounce your criminal ways.
