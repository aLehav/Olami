After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the top of the British secret service lurks a double agent, one who has been there for decades. Four men stand as suspects. There is Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), a bureaucrat who exudes sneakiness and craves power;  and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), a nervous Hungarian whose ambition rivals Alleline’s; Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), a charming womanizer who has a shady web of informants; and Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), a stoic presence whose loyalties change on a whim. One of these men is passing information to the Soviet Union, and it is up to George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to find out which.
“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” —so named for the codenames of the suspects—is a film that demands the viewer’s complete attention. One moment of distraction and the spy thriller can leave you trapped in a web of confusion. However, Oldman’s steady comportment, along with a cast of actors whose extensive stage training and film careers have prepared them well, create not only an ambiance of suspicion faithful to the eponymous John le Carré novel but also an immersing thriller in its own right.
Oldman’s presence grounds the action of the movie. He embodies the role of stoic agent with infrequent shows of emotion that enhance his believability as a character. In one such scene, Smiley combs the apartment of his boss and old friend Control (John Hurt) for clues. When he finds a chess set in Control’s apartment with cut-out photos of the four suspects crudely taped onto bishops and rooks, the discovery of his own image on a fifth piece provides one of the most emotional moments in the film as Smiley’s normally composed visage briefly cracks with emotion at the discovery of his old friend’s suspicion.
There are only a few instances where a member of the sizable cast bursts into anger or tears, but the emotionally sparse nature of the film serves it well. As opposed to an explosive revelation of who the spy’s identity, the film ends with a single tear of emotion. In a movie whose action contains precarious chases, a subdued conclusion meshes perfectly with the equally guarded natures of its characters.
The supporting cast members play their parts with similar thoroughness, much as the characters they represent. The portrayal of each of the four suspects as they move in and out of the viewer’s suspicion ranges from Hinds’ under-the-radar glances to Firth’s bonhomie. Benedict Cumberbatch masterfully plays Smiley’s contact and compatriot in the service Peter Guillam. In one of the  most harrowing scenes of the movie, when Guillam  must steal logbooks for Smiley to analyze, Cumberbatch provides a fascinating alternation between a calm deportment around his fellow employees and a fearful tremble as he grabs the file, alone while contemplating the ramifications of being discovered.
But even with masterful acting of a cast trained in subtlety, a vitally important aspect of the film is the equally careful construction of 1973 London at the height of the Cold War. The gray, damp mustiness of Smiley’s house and the metallic, impersonal bunker of the British secret service combine with the sinister soundtrack composed by Alberto Iglesias in order to create a whirring, mechanical setting that is crumbling around the characters. The costuming, from Guillam’s immaculately tailored suits to Smiley’s  appropriately dramatic traveling coat, works as costuming should—extensions of the characters themselves. Director Tomas Alfredson strikes the perfect balance between attention to the outward appearance of the characters and the setting combined with internal elements intended only for the audience such as the gorgeously dark soundtrack.
Ironically, the one flaw of the film lies in the generally faithful adherence to the plot. The original novel includes all of the theoretical elements needed to create an interesting movie—spies, intrigue, the Cold War, and complex unraveling of characters’ psyches. However, while all of these elements are preserved, Alfredson’s truncation of them into an 120-minute performance requires a devoted attention that can become exhausting to follow.
However, despite this condensation, “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” approaches the depth of the first screen adaptation of the novel—a seven-part miniseries—while keeping the momentum of a two-hour feature. Certainly, it is a sin that the picture did not receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture as it deserves more recognition than a movie about a boy and his horse. It is the epitome of a film that demands the audience’s engagement with each moment, and the superb acting makes this an absolute pleasure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the cinematic pantheon, there are supporting actresses, actresses in leading roles, and actresses who reliably receive copious nominations. Then there are figures like Meryl Streep who evade mere categorization. Streep most recently appears in the role of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the ambitious production, “The Iron Lady”. Streep dazzles in this biographical picture about the controversial and strong woman, but her on-screen presence is ultimately unable to make up for the shortcomings of an otherwise mediocre movie.
The film tells the story of Britain’s first female prime minister, who rose from humble beginnings as a grocer’s daughter to serve three terms as leader of the Conservative Party, from 1979 to 1990. Wary of what she believed might be the beginning of Britain’s decline, Thatcher imposed policies that privatized national firms, removed government regulations on businesses, and struck an unyielding stance against the Soviet Union.
This historical narrative is introduced through a series of flashbacks that Thatcher has as an older woman in retirement. Suffering from dementia, screenwriter Abi Morgan’s Thatcher is confined to her home with the exception of a few token public appearances. When encouraged to clean out the closet of her late husband, played by Jim Broadbent, she begins to hallucinate that he is alive and present. She sleeps little, drinks too much liquor, and pores over family videos of her children from when they were young. Morgan has taken on the challenging task of turning a historical account whose conclusion is already known into an interesting work of art—with mixed results. A sense of disorientation and chaos pervades the film, representing Thatcher’s encroaching loss of cognitive ability. However, this sense of confusion ultimately detracts from the focus of the film as it adds to the already complicated meshing of Thatcher’s home and political life.
Through a series of short scenes, we watch as the young Margaret (Alexandra Roach), takes her first forays into politics and tells her future husband (Harry Lloyd), that she will “never be one of those women...who stay silent and pretty on the arm of her husband or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter. One’s life must matter. I cannot die washing up a tea cup.” This determination, according to the film, is what carried Thatcher into a high position of power, overcoming snide criticism from onlookers about her lower class origins and her sex.
Thatcher’s fortitude at times turns dictatorial; she offends and tyrannizes her political advisors. Her decision to engage Britain in a war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands is portrayed as a function of her desire for validation, a dubious historical conclusion. Thatcher tells American General Alexander Haig (Matthew Marsh) that she has “done battle every single day of [her] life, and many men have underestimated [her] before. This lot seem bound to do the same, but they will rue the day.” At home she strains her relationship with her husband Denis and their children, and it is Thatcher’s daughter Carol (Olivia Colman) who most clearly comes off as a sympathetic figure in the movie as she tends to an ailing but demanding mother.
As the movie cuts from reality to memory to hallucination, Streep effectively portrays Thatcher in her many roles, whether delivering political speeches, defending herself against the opposition party at Prime Minister’s Questions, or shuffling along the route back home after evading the watchful gaze of her caretakers to buy milk. Unsurprisingly, Streep’s performance has earned her a nomination for the Oscar for Best Actress.
However, while it has much in common with “The Queen,” another film depicting a strong woman in a public position, “The Iron Lady” lacks the cogency and emotional resonance of its much-acclaimed antecedent. A critical shortcoming of “The Iron Lady” is that it wavers between focusing on Thatcher’s political life and her personal relationships, and in the end its coverage of both rings hollow due to time constraints. There is not quite enough exposition of her policies as prime minister to give uninformed viewers a grasp of her political accomplishments and acts, nor enough portrayal of her interactions with her children and husband to get a clear sense of their relationships.
Rather than try to include all aspects of Thatcher’s life, the filmmakers should have heeded a piece of advice that the former minister is famous for giving: “Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides.”

When examining David Fincher’s past works such as “Fight Club” and “Se7en,” one could assert that the director has a penchant for darkness and distress. Fincher supports that assertion by directing what will surely be one of the most gruesome, sadistic, and disturbing movie of the year: the English-language adaptation of Swedish author Stieg Larsson’s novel “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.”
Adapting a book into a film can be a tricky process. It can go horribly wrong, as with the cinematic adaptations of Dan Brown’s literary blockbusters “Angels & Demons” and “The Da Vinci Code,” or wonderfully right as with the Academy Award-winning “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” is somewhere in a nebulous middle. While  in this case the movie turns out to be more captivating and artfully created than the book, “Dragon Tattoo” feels incomplete due to its disappointing ending and stilted acting on the part of Daniel Craig.
The movie begins with down-on-his-luck financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) being hired by the elderly retired CEO (Christopher Plummer) of the dying Vanger Company to investigate his grandniece Harriet Vanger’s disappearance, which happened 40 years prior at a family meeting. For his role, Craig replaced 007’s six-pack and charismatic charm with a beer belly and a dreary, depressed demeanor. However, while the role of the Scandanavian journalist may call for solemnity, Craig is devoid of charm or appeal. The sex scenes, which should reveal something of Blomkvist’s character, are awkwardly mechanical.
The other main protagonist is the brilliant yet strange computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) who assists Blomkvist with his murder investigation. Saying Salander is unsociable would be a bit of an understatement. Sporting multiple tattoos, piercings, bleached eyebrows, and short black hair, Mara is unrecognizable as the clean-cut BU student who breaks up with Mark Zuckerberg in the opening scene of Fincher’s “The Social Network.”
However, the physical changes she underwent to play Salander pale in comparison to her typological transformation. On paper, Salander is a seemingly implausible character to play: a tiny, wasted-away young woman who exacts revenge on anyone who does her harm, no matter his or her size or importance. However, Mara brings every aspect of Salander’s unique personality to life: her intelligence, fragility, and subtle humor. In one scene, when Blomkvist walks into their shared cabin to find Salander using his computer, he asks her how she was able to bypass his security system. Craig stammers, ”But it’s encrypted,” to Salander’s sardonic gaze and dry retort, “Please.”
Mara has been nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress as well as an Academy Award for her work in this movie, and for good reason. Mara fashions a Salander who is relatable despite the character’s obvious emotional problems and transforms herself into the guarded protagonist without making herself soulless. This is no easy task as Salander must have been a difficult character to transfer from the novel to the screen due to her steely exterior.
The film’s cinematography also serves it well. The bleak, freezing Swedish landscape helps to provide an atmosphere worthy of the plot, and the film’s music adds effectively to the gloomy mood. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross teamed up once again after working together on the award-winning soundtrack for “The Social Network,” and the movie has a similar ominous, pulsing soundtrack.
Fans of the novel will be pleased to know that until the ending, the movie is a faithful adaptation that does not stray too far from the book’s plot. In fact, the film fortunately omits some of the boring segments. The movie’s conclusion is different than that of the book, though not enough to greatly upset fans. Unfortunately , if screenwriter Steve Zaillian was looking to provide a memorable twist, he failed, as his alternative ending is not nearly creative enough to be merit the change.
With two sequels on the horizon, there is the possibility of improvement for a series with a lot of potential. If Mara and Fincher return, the sequels have a fighting chance. Otherwise, the film’s supporting cast would not create an enjoyable picture.

The stage in the Loeb Experimental Theater is dark. A dimly lit figure approaches the audience slowly until people can clearly recognize the figure as…a banana. The Immediate Gratification Players—Harvard’s only long-form improvisational comedy troupe—hosted its 14th annual Laugh Riot Festival themed “Bananas Everywhere” on Friday and Saturday at the Loeb Experimental theater. The show was directed by Martha R. Farlow ’13 and produced by Aneliese K. Palmer ’12. Bananas were indeed everywhere, as the IGP performers pranced around on the stage in large banana suits, sometimes holding and interacting with real bananas.
“‘Bananas Everywhere’ was a party theme that was suggested once, and after a while it just stuck,” says Katherine C. Damm ’13, IGP’s so-called Czar, or troupe leader. The different comedy troupes performed for 20 minutes each, with intermittent commentary from IGP performers. The theme made appearances in some of the skits, though the dynamic nature of improvisational comedy often makes sticking to one consistent theme impossible. “Every one of our shows is different. That’s what makes [improvisation] fun,” says Palmer.
The Laugh Riot Festival is a weekend-long event where comedy troupes from other universities can perform together and participate in improvisational comedy workshops led by professionals from New York’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. This year, improvisational comedy troupes from Dartmouth University, Wesleyan University, and Ohio State University registered for the workshops at Harvard and performed for students at night. “It’s really cool to watch groups from other places perform, because we all have different styles,” says Farlow. The Immediate Gratification Players use a montage format in their performances, a series of scenes of no particular structure based on a single suggestion. Ohio State University’s improvisational comedy troupe 8th Floor uses another form of the montage called an Armando, which relies heavily on the use of comedic mologues. Other groups tend to use a variation of the Harold, the signature format of Chicago’s iO Theater. The Harold is more structured than a regular montage or an Armando and has a set number of scenes that should be performed in the time allotted.
The festival is about exchange between groups, both comedic and otherwise. “We travel with the other groups to festivals sometimes, so we get to know them pretty well,” says Farlow.
New York’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theater performed a few skits in the festival as well. Numerous alumni of the UCBT program have gone on to star in comedy shows like “Saturday Night Live”, “30 Rock”, and “The Daily Show.” Notable alumni include Amy Poehler, Ed Helms, Ian Roberts, and Bobby Moynihan, who are known for their comedic performances in TV shows such as “Human Giant” and movies such as “The Hangover.” It’s also home to former Crimson Arts editor Alison H. Rich ’09, who first encouraged the troupe to attend IGP’s Laugh Riot festivals. “We love working with IGP alums, and working with [UCBT] is always a treat for us,” says Damm.
The Laugh Riot Festival is one of the biggest events in the spring for IGP. “Planning for the event is sporadic at best, but it turns out great every year,” says Palmer. The group often uses the Loeb Experimental Theater for their festival because it can accommodate more people than the Fong Auditorium and still allows them to put on their shows for free. “It’s written in our constitution that our shows have to be free,” says Damm.
The group aims to keep their shows simple and fun, and this element of their performances adds to IGP’s enduring popularity. “Improv is a relaxing and fun way to enjoy the evening. That’s why people keep coming back to our shows year after year,” says Palmer. The Immediate Gratification players offer students more than just silly costumes and a lot of bananas. In an environment saturated with talk of tests, Q guide scores, and section notes, it’s important that students take a moment to take a break from Harvard life and just laugh.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery—or so the saying goes. Yet the line  between inspiration and sheer duplication is a thin one, and crossing over can be all too subtle. Charlotte Brontë’s classic “Jane Eyre” tells the story of a young orphan girl who is sent to a boarding school by her abusive relatives and later falls in love with the  guardian of the girl she takes care of. After the man betrays her trust, she runs away, finds family, and eventually ends up living happily ever after with newfound riches and a repentant lover. Funnily enough, “The Flight of Gemma Hardy” tells that same exact story.
Author Margot Livesey wrote her latest novel in homage to “Jane Eyre.” Her adaptation of the well-known Victorian novel, however, fails to add enough modern spark and vivacity to the old story; the end result is noticeably lacking in originality. Although the writing is impressive, the story moving, and the characters heartwarming, the blatant replication of such a revolutionary piece of literature creates the unshakeable notion that “The Flight of Gemma Hardy” is simply an uninspired counterfeit of the original.
The story, set in the 1960s in Scotland, follows the life of Gemma Hardy, who, after the deaths of her parents and benevolent uncle, lives with her cruel aunt and cousins. When she is 10 years old, her aunt decides to send her to the Claypoole School. Gemma withstands years of abuse from the headmistress and fellow students; throughout her struggles, however, Gemma makes friends and dreams of attending university. After the school closes due to bankruptcy, Gemma becomes an au pair for the niece of Mr. Sinclair, a wealthy bachelor in the Orkney Islands of northern Scotland. She and Mr. Sinclair fall in love and get engaged, but after a treacherous act of his comes to light the day of their wedding, Gemma runs away. Eventually, she travels to Iceland, her father’s homeland and her birthplace. There she finds her family, and, eventually, herself.
The story focuses on Gemma’s escape from the clasps of society, occupational demands, and familial responsibilities. Having been an orphan twice over, her ultimate desire is to break away from her duties and inhibitions and return to Iceland to find her true family. This aspect of the story is the one most altered from the plot of “Jane Eyre.” Although the original did extol the importance of female independence, Livesey centers much more of her narrative around this theme. Throughout the story, Gemma’s goals are always of education, independence, and discovery of her past, more so than Jane’s are in the original. This respectably self-centered view allows the adaptation to be realistic in the time period of the 1960s, where issues concerning female liberation played a larger role in society than when the original was published.
Though the story is set more than 100 years after “Jane Eyre,” Livesey includes timeless themes in her story that were also present in Brontë’s novel. There is a great emphasis on Gemma’s increasing separation from her religion. After she is asked if she believes in God, Gemma replies, “I don’t know. I used to because of my uncle, but since he died I’ve met plenty of people who claim to be good Christians and wouldn’t cross the road to help a starving child. If that’s what it means to believe in God, then I’d rather not.” Although thematic messages like this are important, it seems like a choice of convenience, not of narrative necessity, to include moral dilemmas identical to those present in the original. The end result is a plethora of issues like class structure, feminism, and the search for self that are left mostly unexplored. Prominent themes like these from “Jane Eyre” appear obligatory in “The Flight of Gemma Hardy,” and Livesey’s lack of committment to her themes creates a novel nowhere near as poignant as the original.
But this underwhelming facsimile of a classic novel does not disappoint completely. If viewed merely as a homage to the original, it is clearly a poor silhouette of “Jane Eyre,” but if read as a stand-alone novel, the uninspired nature of the book fades into the background, and the liveliness of the characters shines through due to the descriptive emotional territory Livesey creates. Reliving the experiences of Jane and Rochester through Gemma and Sinclair—one aspect of the original work that receives full exploration—feels natural and touching. For a book with such a broad timeline, Livesey paces the story well—an important skill. She does not rush through the early years to establish Gemma as a likeable, independent, and loving young woman, and so Gemma’s transformation from a plain, quiet young girl to a confident, intelligent young lady is believable.
Several times, Gemma revisits the last sermon her uncle writes in the first chapter. “We each begin as an island, but we soon build bridges. Even the most solitary person has, perhaps without knowing it, a causeway, a cable, a line of stepping-stones, connecting him or her to others, allowing for the possibility of communication and affection.” The story follows Gemma from Claypoole to Sinclair’s estate and finally to Iceland, where her path originated. As Gemma explains to her school friend Miriam, “Words are the stepping-stones between one person and another. Sometimes they’re under water and you have to wait for them to surface again.” This thread of emotional connection throughout the book provides the reader with a sentimental connection to Gemma as well as the supporting characters.
“The Flight of Gemma Hardy” is, at  its very best, an oft-absorbing replica of “Jane Eyre.” Livesey is a good writer, but her lack of creativity in the re-mastering of the classic novel proves fatal to the ingenuity of her story. As a complement to the original,  “The Flight of Gemma Hardy” provides a welcome return to beloved characters. It remains, however, a decidedly sub-par facsimile of its parent novel. If only Livesey had lived up to Gemma’s final champagne toast—“Here’s to living under our rightful names”—and written a more veiled homage to the Jane and Rochester of 165 years past.

How strong are the bonds of college friendship after decades of separation? Armitai, the protagonist of Thrity Umrigar’s “The World We Found,” finds herself contemplating this question at the onset of the novel. Afflicted with an incurable brain tumor, Armitai realizes what she wants most from the world: the company of her three best friends from college. Or, rather, the three women who are something more than that: “Her words were so weak, her description of Lal, Ka, and Nishta as ‘friends’ so inadequate and small…. Laleh and the others had not just been friends, they had been comrades.” Though Armitai immigrated to America years ago, her friends still live in Mumbai. To see them and fulfill her dying wish, Armitai pays for her three friends to undertake a transnational journey, an experience that will ultimately weave together the strands of lives that had parted 30 years ago.
But extracting the three women from their lives in Mumbai to witness the end of hers becomes more of a challenge than Armitai ever imagined. In particular, one of the three, Nishta, is trapped in a dangerous and controlling marriage to her college sweetheart. As Armitai’s life draws to an end, the pressure mounts for the friends to help Nishta escape from her husband and his family. The story that unfolds between Armitai’s diagnosis and Nishta’s freedom stretches from Mumbai to Florida and contrasts their mutual past with the dissolution of their present situations. Despite this wealth of dramatic potential, however, the story promises sparks that it fails to ignite.
Umrigar’s premise is interesting; her characters span generations and cultures, from the stereotypical American childhood of Armitai’s daughter, Diana, to the unconventional Muslim-Hindu marriage of Nishta and her husband Iqbal. Umrigar contemplates youthful radicalism, its evolution from generation to generation, and how people can painfully outgrow their earlier passions. She enlivens the story through the variety of narratives, from Kavita’s journey towards self-acceptance to Laleh’s surrender to a practical husband and a comfortable life.
Yet flaws in Umrigar’s descriptions and characterizations impair the emotions of the novel. The lack of a developed background creates an unfortunately two-dimensional story; recollections like Armitai staring down a line of policemen with Laleh at her side are only briefly explored, and the processes behind the dissolution of the friendships—a dissolution so complete that they’ve barely spoken in 20 years—come to light only very late in then novel. Umrigar’s storytelling is inadequate for the drama and passion of the events she suggests. Too often, she relies on her readers’ familiarity with archetypes in place of giving them a tangible sense of character and scene. Instead of exploring why the four friends were impassioned about the issues behind the demonstrations—issues that she never clearly indicates—Umrigar relies on stereotypes about college radicals and tacitly encourages readers to paint in their motivations along with all the other requisite details. “The Iqbal they knew wore bright floral shirts over tight jeans,” she writes, “and usually had his sunglasses perched on top of a headful of long hair.”
In addition, Umrigar vaguely uses traumas like police brutality and molestation as justifications for what her characters have become. Her authorial tendency to suggest characters instead of acquainting the reader with them can make the violence seem rather heavy-handed; Laleh and Kavita recall brief snapshots of brutality, and Laleh is torn up with guilt over something that happened to Armitai, yet neither seems to feel the violence vividly enough to reveal her deepest feelings to the reader or to justify the event’s existence in the story.
In a similar way, Umrigar has an inclination to suggest, rather than reveal, the places she travels in her narrative. “Bombay!” Armitai recalls. “The cool, tranquil rooms of Jehangir Art Gallery. The crazy, colorful exuberance of Fashion Street….” We never learn, however, what lies within the Jehangir Art Gallery or what exactly characterizes the nature of Fashion Street’s exuberance. Rather, Umrigar’s descriptions rely on profusions of adjectives, which seem to invite recollections of National Geographic photographs rather than establish an original space for the story. Ultimately, “The World We Found” becomes a frustrating novel to read, because it leaves the reader in the realm of what is already public. Instead of learning how Mumbai became meaningful to Armitai or why she recalls, near the end of her life, “a solitary squirrel racing on the smooth, white skin of a snowy lawn of a ski lodge in Colorado,” Umrigar leaves the reader with a sense of the beauty of beauty but none of the meaning of it. Her characters are clearly moved by what they remember, but it is nearly impossible to share or understand those memories.
And so, though it is a work of impressive narrative reach, “The World We Found” finishes without getting off the ground—at least, in a figurative sense. As Nishta leaves Mumbai on a plane in the final pages, she reflects on the “weak constellation” of the lights of the city. This image is an apt embodiment of the story—anyone can see constellations in city lights, but Umrigar never quite manages to explain which stars she’s looking at and why.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Mark Lawson from The Guardian reviewed Jonathan Safran Foer’s novel “Everything is Illuminated,” he wondered about an anti-sentimental streak in American writing. Noting Foer’s “scenic-facetious route towards the Holocaust” in that novel, Lawson suggested that American artists born since the late 1960s suffer from a “terror of sentimentality,” perhaps because they had all watched Bambi at an impressionable age.
Yet it is hard to write about World War II, and it is easy to aggravate people when trying to do so. From NBC’s “Holocaust” miniseries to Steven Spielberg’s “Schindler’s List” to Foer’s novel, Americans have repeatedly been criticized for their attempts to hew a narrative from distant suffering. It seems as if every use of imagination, sentiment, or catharsis is controversial in its own way, shaky under the unbearable and divisive weight of history.
In her debut novel, “No One Is Here Except All of Us,” Ramona Ausubel is all too aware of those burdens. Hers is a story about memory, about love, about the ruins of identity—but more than anything else, it is a story about stories.
The setting: Zalischik, a small Jewish village in remotest Romania, a “forgotten place” that is quaint and pristine and as simple as the towns that appear in fables—we meet the butcher, the lonely jeweler, the crazy aunt, and the healer. The hard-earned peace of Zalischik is disrupted, however, by the chaos of war and a beautiful stranger that the villagers pull out of their river.
Ausubel’s basic premise is exhilarating. Fearing the encroaching tumult of the world outside, the villagers decide to pray away reality: to start the world again and to rewrite their story from scratch. What do you keep, and what do you throw away? Basic questions of desertion and possession are laid wide open, and in the brave new order—as the 11-year old narrator Lena discovers—there are radically new possibilities for cruelty and for love.
The excitement and disorientation of rewriting an identity comes across in the giddy turns of Ausubel’s prose, which is forceful and incantatory: “We did not stand straight, but felt the weight of all the words, of all the things, of the ways all the things were the same and different from all the other things. Nothing was safe.”
Through a varied cast of characters, Ausubel explores the coexistence of selfishness and love—and, above all, the way that stories can be used for reinvention or for cruelty. The villagers are performing an act of imagination, just as the young writer Ausubel is doing in her attempt to access the lives of her ancestors. As such, the wonder and the fear that result from her characters’ uncertainty permeate every page of the novel.
The will to believe, the will to narrate, and the will to dominate are inextricably entwined with the experience of readership. Ausubel’s novel is at its most thought-provoking when it explores the real composition of love and worship; her analysis of power dynamics in daily relations is astute and incisive but lacks the despondency of writers exploring similar events of history.
“No One Is Here Except All of Us” is driven by a wild imaginative energy, and Ausubel’s talent for imagery is beyond doubt. The underlying tension in her project, however, is one that she does not entirely resolve. On the one hand, the novel is an ode to the power of stories and of mythmaking, yet on the other hand, the success of any narrative depends on the realistic portrayal of believable characters—for without a true connection to characters, the message of a novel can get lost in translation. Ausubel’s surreal, mystical impulses clash with her commitment to realism, and she far too often pushes the novel into the abstract, the fabled, and the sentimental.
Aside from Lena and the inscrutable stranger, the characters lack real human interest. The boy Igor is a tremendous sleeper; “You won’t be surprised by this,” he interjects in one scene, “but I’m tired.” It is all he ever really does. Ausubel frequently gets carried away with the force of the narrative, as she does where Igor is concerned; in doing so, she suppresses the story in order to ruminate more directly on the centrality of stories.
The other main fault of “No One Is Here Except All of Us” is the tendency to reach too eagerly into the abstract, with the result that important moments are ruined by triteness or cliché. “Sometimes it happens,” Ausubel writes, “that two very different stories, two distant lives, come crashing together.” Another pithy prophesy that emerges awkwardly out of the text: “You are yourself, no matter how much you have to change.”
In Ausubel’s expansive project, she truly shines in moments when she relaxes the urgency of her procession through explicit ideas and constructed scenarios. When she takes the time to characterize, she does so deftly. When she properly pays attention to little details that make characters realistic, her styling is superb. This happens especially in scenes of motherhood, a major feature in Ausubel’s short fiction to date that is re-imagined here with success.
Above all, the novel is strongest when it leaves the urge to forge a unifying story in the first-person plural and instead focuses on the enchanting voice of the main character. And yet, it is hard to escape the feeling that perhaps that’s the point: that the struggle to entangle an “I” from a “we” is an integral element of Ausubel’s fable.
However uncomfortable it is at moments, “No One Is Here Except All of Us” is redeemed by the force of its ideas and the beauty of its prose. Ausubel’s approach to well-worn questions of identity and the past is an innovative one; because it is so aware of its status as a story in performance, her novel dodges both the cheap catharsis of works like “Schindler’s List” and the dull insensitivity of films such as “Inglorious Basterds” that reduce European fascism to impotent semiotics.
“No One Is Here Except All of Us” is inconsistent and occasionally predictable, but as a debut work, it bears great promise. Instead of writing with history—or against it, as a literature of alterability should have it—Ausubel positions her writing under history; that is, both her novel and her characters squirm under the weight of mad and incomprehensible violence, desperately trying to forge a life story from a history of cruelty.

Rope
Feb. 10-12, 7:30 p.m., Feb. 16-18, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by  Sarah M.
Batista-Pereira ’13
Produced by Ryan M. Rossner ’13, Rose C. Bailey ’14
A dastardly murder, a dead bodies, and a splendid dinner party all come together in Patrick Hamilton’s “Rope,” the first show of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s spring season. Hamilton’s psychological thriller, which was turned into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock in 1948, will be at the Loeb Experimental Theatre starting this week.
“Rope” follows two college students, Brandon (Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14)  and Granillo (Eduardo J. Perez-Torres ’12.) as they attempt to prove their superiority over the rest of humanity by committing the perfect crime. They murder a fellow student, hide him in a chest, and then throw a dinner party with their makeshift coffin as the centerpiece. “It’s a twist on the classic whodunit,” says director Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13. “The audience knows who the murderers are, and they watch as one of the party guests slowly puts the pieces together.”
The two lead actors strive to unearth the real psychology of these intellectual sociopaths. “It’s been fun, and a little scary, to explore a character who has absolutely no moral understanding of his actions,” says Hilgartner. “The action is entirely continuous, so the tension just builds and builds until it’s ready to snap.”
The production uses lighting as opposed to a complicated set to add to the show’s phychological drama. In order to heighten this sense of inescapable peril, lighting designer Hannah R. Phillips ’15 creates ways to isolate the main characters from the rest of the action during their tyrannical power trip. “We are using floor lights to create the illusion of a fireplace,” she says, “and at some points during the show this is the only source of light.” It is tricks like these that allow the set, which is only comprised of one room, to evole with the action on stage
Batista-Pereira adds that the essential aim of the play is to use tension to entertain her audience. “I want people to come ready to have a good time,” she says. “The play is hugely relevant to a Harvard audience. It’s about us—about students—and the responsibilities we have as intelligent human beings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Mother could believe this about anyone, but she cannot believe it about you.” These were some of the last words the late Mother Teresa spoke to Mary Johnson twenty-four years ago; saints have a habit of speaking in the third-person. Johnson, a former nun turned bestselling author,  provoked the world-renowned religious figure to this rebuke by leaving Mother Teresa’s religious order, Missionaries of Charity, for good. Johnson reflected on the meaning of these words in front of a small, disparate group of humanists, who shifted in their fold-up chairs with curiosity as she gave a talk about her memoir, “An Unquenchable Thirst,” two Sundays ago. Though far from the convents and cathedrals where she spent much of her life, Johnson still reads with religious theatricality, alternately projecting and whispering within the cozy Eliot St. office space that serves as the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy’s headquarters.
The Nobel Peace Prize-winning nun’s disheartened words are the epitaph to the 20 years Johnson spent rising in the ranks of the Missionaries of Charity and a part of the story contained within her memoir, which was published last year. A tale of a firm humanitarian spirit continually checked by bureaucratic nonsense, hyperbolized piety, and sexual scandal, “An Unquenchable Thirst” represents religion at its most complex and conflicted. Now a self-described “non-religious person” who no longer believes in God, Johnson has spent the majority of her years since leaving the order developing the resources and skills to flourish as a writer. “[When I was with the Missionaries of Charity], the question had always been, ‘Where is the greatest need?’” Johnson says. “Then, the question shifted to, ‘What is it that I have to offer?’ I realized that a lot of that had to do with telling my story and a lot to do with sharing some of the lessons that I had learned.”
Johnson represents an extreme case of the predicament that atheists, agnostics, and humanists face at Harvard and across the world: How does one maintain the good, important parts of formalized religion, the parts that people like Johnson find especially difficult to give up—community, dedication, and responsibility to others—if one denies the existence of a higher being? Johnson’s answer has been to find purpose and community in telling her story and aiding other female writers in telling their own tales.
ELECTROMAGNETISM
In 1977, at the age of 19 and after only a year at the University of Texas, Johnson found herself following the call of God to the doors of a cramped convent in the Bronx, where her career with the Missionaries of Charity officially began. “I felt that it was my vocation,” she says, “that this is what I had to do.” Johnson had once felt a connection with Mother Teresa’s portrait on the cover of Time magazine, which she saw in her high  school library. She skipped French class to read the article. The self-certain and rebellious Johnson felt an uncannily strong spiritual connection with Mother Teresa’s radical focus on asceticism and direct involvement with the plight of the poor. “How did one write about electromagnetism?” she writes in her memoir. “That’s what the pull had felt like.”
From the beginning, Johnson felt uncomfortable with the authoritarian structure of the Missionaries of Charity. Early in her memoir, she mentions her immediate uncertainties: “The Constitutions [the code of law Mother Teresa wrote], the Rules, and our superiors were…God’s voice and governed when we could speak, what we could read, how to sit, walk, or kneel, sometimes even what to think.” Once, the arbitrary authority became so overbearing that Johnson impulsively picked up her superior and shook her out of frustration.
After six months in the Bronx, Johnson was transferred to Rome, where she spent most of the next 20 years, aside from some work in Winnipeg, Canada, and Washington D.C. In Rome, Johnson ascended the ranks of the Missionaries of Charity, eventually being sworn in as a nun under the chosen name Sister Donata. Intimating Johnson’s intentions, the Italian name Donata means “the freely given one.”
Johnson’s desire for satisfaction and human connection, both of which were heavily condemned by the Rules, became real problems as she continually found herself rebuffed precisely when she began to feel fulfilled in her work. “We weren’t allowed to get anything for ourselves from the work,” Johnson says. “No pleasure, no gratitude from the people: nothing. It’s one of the reasons that our work suffered.”
“CHURCH WITHOUT THE GOD”
Johnson’s book reading was presented by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, a small 35-year-old organization that has recently garnered national attention due to the ambitions of its head, chaplain Greg Epstein. With the oratorical deliberateness of a priest and the casual, disarming manner of a youth group leader, Epstein is as personable as his believer counterparts. “Up until now in human history,” Epstein says, “religion has been a primary source of community for people. If humanism is going to provide an alternative to that, we need to study how to make it the best alternative for people. We want to learn from religious groups; we want to learn from anything that we can in order to figure out how to have the most effective community.”
Through frequent events involving prominent humanists and weekly Sunday meetings to discuss and meditate, Epstein hopes to provide the kind of community typically associated with houses of worship. Humanists have adopted the religious tradition since, Epstein says, “there is a lot of documentation that this sort of thing is helpful for a lot of people.”
For some, humanism fills a void. Stephen Goeman, a junior at Tufts University, attended church and a youth group throughout high school, so when he lost his religion in college, he felt he had lost an important means of connecting with people. Now, he attends the events of the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard regularly, because, he said, “It’s like church without the God.” Creating a formal community out of a group defined by a lack of a common creed may seem a formidable task. However, Epstein thinks humanists cannot ignore the fact that natural inclination for community sometimes impedes the personal transition from a religious background to non-belief. Speaking of Johnson’s own journey, Epstein says,  “[Defining your own values] is often a very scary process. I think that’s what took Mary so long, since it can be very isolating to have to leave a community that you’re from and define yourself.” Johnson’s need for community made it difficult to leave the order in which she had invested so much, but her desire for true human connection soon made it even harder to stay.
TIME CAPSULE
When one of Johnson’s fellow missionaries, a nun with the chosen name Sister Niobe, confessed her romantic love for Johnson during Johnson’s time in Rome, she was thrilled. Suffering from a lack of personal attachment—touch of any sort between sisters, even a simple hug, was prohibited, and private conversations were supposed to be limited to scheduled meetings with superiors—Johnson leaped at the opportunity for some intimate contact with another human being. But the relationship threatened the two sisters’ vows of chastity.
Hugs, kisses, and eventually trysts in a secluded room by night jeopardized Johnson’s faith in herself as a Missionary of Charity. However, it also proved to her a richness of experience that the order had denied her: not merely the pleasures of love and sex, but the basic joys of enjoying another’s company and feeling valued. “Niobe had taught me about my own goodness, and about the joys of tenderness,” Johnson writes in her memoir. “I was grateful.”
But Johnson’s relationship with Sister Niobe eventually became exploitative and unmanageable. Sister Niobe would take any opportunity that they had alone in an empty room to violently press their bodies together, despite Johnson’s insistent protests. Soon, Johnson found out that Sister Niobe had a history of coercing sisters into sexual relationships, and she tried her hardest to bring this to the attention of superiors, even Mother Teresa herself. “Sister Niobe was a sexual predator, which took me a long time to understand," Johnson says. “The sisters who had sexual relations with Sister Niobe were nearly all very sexually naïve adults who had really no experience. I hadn’t either.”
In addition to revealing an essential vulnerability that a life of chastity engenders, the case of Sister Niobe also exposed a fundamental flaw in the ability of Mother Teresa and the superior sisters in the Missionaries of Charity. The order was unable to deal with sexual exploitation, even if it threatened the well-being of many sisters. “Mother Teresa made it known that this was something not to be talked about,” Johnson says. “She even went so far as to imply that talking about this sexual sin was worse than anything that had happened.”
With doubts about Mother Teresa’s infallibility, a continual yearning for tenderness with other people, and her rebuffed attempts to have more contact with the poor, Johnson began questioning whether she belonged with the Missionaries of Charity. She set an ultimatum for herself. “I thought, ‘I’m going to give myself one more year,’” she said. “‘By the end of the year, if I feel like I can be myself in this group, I’ll stay. If I feel like I can’t be myself in this group, I’ll go.’ At the end of the year, it was very clear to me that I had to go.”
Leaving the Missionaries of Charity in 1997 was like stepping out of a time capsule. “I had never used an ATM before,” Johnson says. “I didn’t know what to do with a microwave. I could prepare a meal for 60 sisters over a wood-burning stove, but a microwave?” The last 20 years of her life were gone, along with any sense of the direction or purpose that accompanied them. Johnson faced a new life at 39 years old.
ROOM OF HER OWN
“I’m Mary Johnson from Beaumont, Texas, and this workshop is my fifth choice. You should know that at this point in my life I don’t trust women much, especially older women.” These were the first words Darlene Chandler Bassett heard Johnson speak in July 2000, three years after leaving the order. Bassett was a retired corporate executive also seeking a direction to lead the rest of her life. They were on the same women’s retreat at Ghost Ranch, Georgia O’Keefe’s old house in the New Mexico desert that holds many retreats and workshops. Bassett took an immediate interest in this standoffish stranger.
Once she had returned to life outside the convent, Johnson’s first instinct was to continue working with the poor through institutions like soup kitchens and homeless shelters, but she stopped when people in her life suggested otherwise. “They said, ‘Don’t do that! You’ve been doing that for 20 years, and you need to try something else now,’” she says, “That kind of made sense to me.”
Johnson wondered what was to constitute the center of her life now, without religion and the Missionaries of Charity. She decided that her primary goal was to learn how to tell her story in all its rich complexity. Most accounts of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity at the time were motivated by dogma, from unquestioning reverence of Mother Teresa’s sainthood to Christopher Hitchens’ vitriolic and equally unsubtle view of Mother Teresa as a fraud. Johnson thought that she could bring a multi-faceted evaluation of the Missionaries of Charity based on the quotidian experience of being a sister. “What interests me is looking at the whole picture [of the Missionaries of Charity]. There are good things and there are things that need to be changed, but that doesn’t mean you have to throw the whole thing out the window,” says Johnson.
Later that evening at the retreat, Johnson expressed her innermost desire to the group of strangers to whom she had been initially so hostile: She wanted to write her story, but for that purpose, she needed a room of her own. The invocation of Virginia Woolf’s titular assertion, that women needed to be able to support themselves and have their own, personal space if they were to write, immediately gave Bassett an idea. She would provide the necessary funds to support Johnson through the writing process, as long as Johnson would help her establish an organization that sponsored and taught women writers. “The idea came to me fully formed, in that instant,” says Bassett. “I had never considered doing anything like this before.”
When Johnson agreed to the idea, A Room of Her Own Foundation was born. The Foundation began by funding Johnson’s MFA program in creative writing at Goddard College, during which she developed a behemoth of a thesis—which at one point reached around 900 pages—that she eventually tamed into her much more moderately-sized memoir. Meanwhile, A Room of Her Own has become nationally renowned as a  birthplace of successful female writers. For Johnson, the organization has provided the impetus for a mutually-reinforcing sense of purpose and community: with financial support and by virtue of her own writing, Johnson spurs other women to write, forming a national network of women sharing their perspectives. “I know that I can turn to so many of these different women when I have a question, when I have a problem about technical parts of the writing process, or when I’m just scared,” says Johnson of the community the organization has created.
Now that Mary Johnson’s book rests on bookshelves across the country—ironically, often in the “Christian Inspiration” section—anyone can read about her trials, her triumphs, her doubts, her journey, and, as she characterizes them, “all the racy details” as well. Johnson feels that she has grown tremendously from the process of writing. “Whether I have a reading public or not, there’s the simple fact of writing: it’s a very healing sort of process.” However, she hopes that many are intrigued enough by her story to crack the spine of “An Unquenchable Thirst,” because, after all, honesty breeds honesty. “One of the things that’s impressed me,” she said, “is the fact that many people have gotten in touch with me after the memoir was published and they tell me things like, ‘I’ve never been able to tell anybody about what happened to me, but after reading the honest account of your story, I now have the courage to tell my story to somebody.’”
Johnson hopes her writing and the tales of other women will foster an understanding of how life could be outside the comforting and confining walls of religion. “I think that we create these ideas of perfect people like Mother Teresa because it makes us feel better about our own possibilities,” Johnson says. “We create idols, when in fact, we need to look at the real complexities of life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant Dance Director Christine Bennett has served as the visionary behind large-scale dance installations and pieces that incorporated dancing on stilts, maneuvering through water, and climbing on ropes. In 1996, she founded the Bennett Dance Company in Boston, which she directed until 2007.
Bennett holds an M.F.A. in dance from Smith College and a B.F.A. in dance from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She has also worked to combine dance with advocacy for causes including breast cancer support and art in public spaces. Last Wednesday, she was the first speaker in the Dance Department’s Practice Is Performance discussion series.
The Harvard Crimson: What led you to the world of dance?
Christine Bennett: I have a pretty common experience in that I started taking classes as a three-year-old. It was as a high school student that I was fortunate enough to be exposed to a lot of dance, even though I was from the midwest and had to travel three hours to Chicago. But I saw Bill T. Jones and “Last Supper at Uncle Tom’s Cabin/The Promised Land.” I also saw Twyla Tharp perform “In the Upper Room.” Seeing these works solidified for me my interest not only in dance as an art form but also in choreography and the greater form of seeing dance onstage. I learned to look at dance by pulling back and looking at the whole, sculpted experience.
THC: What were some of the ways in which you tackled large-scale installations?
CB: There was always something in the [studio] space that was larger than us. That might have been climbing up eight feet in the air on rope nets. The question was always: how close can we get to the other elements in the space with us?... For me, the work itself represented always trying to take on a larger-than-life element—not necessarily that we’re mastering this thing, but that the beauty would lie within the effort. It’s the push/pull of, ‘What does it feel like, taste like, smell like? Does it attract? Does it repel? Physically, what does it do for you? How do I get closer to the materials?’ For instance, we used stilts to become taller in relationship to 30-[foot tall] columns. What does this do to inform our bodies as dancers? We ended up transitioning from being earthbound to being bound by something much higher.
THC: What can students gain from dancing? What are the drawbacks to engaging in this opportunity?
CB: You’re here and have so many different extracurricular opportunities. But for a lot of people who have been very focused on the academic pursuit or some other art forms or some other personal commitments—I have a sense that Harvard students are wholly committed to these things. But there’s an opportunity: if you haven’t studied dance, there are several classes that have no barrier to entry. There are many people who are in the same position where they want to try something new…. Do it because it’s fun and because there’s a sense of community…. I think the toughest part of the co-curricular classes is that when it comes time for midterms and finals, the class size can become smaller. When the class size becomes smaller, it’s harder to draw the group’s energy and fully experience it.
THC: How would you describe the arts community here at Harvard?
CB: Highly collaborative. I’ve been amazed by what people can pull off in a large scale. The concert I attended [during] Arts First last year, when the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and Holden Choirs joined forces, was incredible. We as a dance program, especially with [Dance Director] Jill [Johnson], with her dual position in the Music Department as a Senior Lecturer, are keen on seeing collaborations happen.
THC: Any advice for dancers here at Harvard and beyond?
CB: Don’t limit yourself to what you currently have studied [up] to this point. Try to come into the studio every single day and ask yourself what you don’t know. Harvard time doesn’t work for dance. On time is late. Get there, and get there early. Let yourself drop into the room and ask yourself, “What are you looking for today in this class?” When you’re traveling through that class, whether it’s your first one, or if you’re at your 10,000th-hour point, ask yourself, ‘What does it feel like, look like, taste like? How thick is the air as I execute this movement? What is the point of initiation as I move my body?’ There are endless questions and answers to be found as a mover. You should walk in with your shell cracked wide open and falling off of your body. It’s a true gift to be among people who are asking the same questions as you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it unfolded, my first summer out of high school seemed longer than any other I’d known. No longer returning to my high school yet still not a college student, for the first time I spent those months  free from the cycle of school following summer and summer following school. For the first half of that summer, I didn’t take a job. Instead, I drove, played guitar, and listened to Bruce Springsteen constantly.
All my life, I’d sought joyful music, though I’d never consciously acknowledged that overriding characteristic in my favorite songs. One muggy night in mid-July of that summer, I found a soft-focus, black-and-white video of “Racing in the Street” performed live in 1978. The song was, and remains, my favorite of Springsteen’s—the ballad of a man who struggles through life, hoping to find redemption in the late night street races he and his friend Sonny follow across the East Coast. On the record, soon after Springsteen’s protagonist describes his wife’s descent into loneliness—sitting on her father’s porch “with the eyes of one who hates for just being born”—overdubbed guitars quietly guide the track into a slow fade. But in the Passaic, N.J., performance, as Springsteen backs into the darkness onstage, he begins wailing through his harmonica, and something entirely different takes place.
Just as the song sinks into relative darkness, the late organist Danny Federici takes up the hopeless harmonica line and transforms it into glinting supplication. Max Weinberg’s drums push the timid line to the fore with insistent rim clicks, and he soon joins his steady quarter taps with a booming bass kick, as if in agreement with the hopeful organ. The bassist follows the heartbeat bass drum pattern, and suddenly Springsteen dons his guitar and begins picking out a simple major triad. Bittan gleefully shakes down glistening octaves and declarative fifths, and Springsteen begins strumming faster, moving to the front of the stage, dropping to his knees and mouthing “yes” through disbelieving laughter. That night, I watched the clip until dawn. I remember asking myself why I would sleep when something so joyful existed. From that moment on, I’ve knowingly dedicated my listening life to the pursuit of such moments.
Two and a half years later, in the 23rd hour of an all-nighter spent trying to learn everything about the human brain—including the impossibility of consolidating long-term memory while sleep-deprived—my quest for joyful music hit bottom. At 8:30 that morning, my roommate found me in my room shivering and hitting “play” again and again on the Youtube video of Coldplay’s “Christmas Lights.” I felt my spiritual poverty like a pocket too deep. At this point, I’d more or less stopped listening to Springsteen.
For the rest of that over-long exam period, I got by on the Scottish indie band Frightened Rabbit. Switching from Coldplay to Frightened Rabbit for infusions of joy, though, is equivalent to a junkie’s upgrading to purer ecstasy. That’s not to say I don’t enjoy Frightened Rabbit—I do. Their best songs ride defiant and controlled builds, with pulsing drums that clatter yet cohere, complex and big production work that creates the illusion of space, and Scott Hutchison’s broken Scottsman wail to joyful statures that exhilarate and cut more than the average Coldplay song. Even the lyrics offer a special pleasure—they are so blatant that you can’t help but notice that this man actually intends to ward off loneliness, materialism, exes’ new lovers, and all the rest of it with his swaggering shouts and cracked bellows.
The song that ended that phase was “Not Miserable,” a track that climaxes around backing singers calling, “I am!” while Hutchinson moans “not miserable” in response. I began to feel exhausted after listening to Frightened Rabbit, and I realized that its music is that of sugar highs—of the rush that brings the fall. They know precisely when the drums will kick in with the most force and efficiently overwhelm the listener with major key overdubs and background chants.
Now, I’m listening to Bruce again. The yaraghs of Van Morrison, the cries of the Temptations, the bubbling pianos of South African jazz, and the soaring everythings of U2 warm my speakers once more. And when I listen to Frightened Rabbit, it’s with appreciation for a perfected craft, not the same febrile reach for the “replay” button. I hope, in this column, to write in service of joyful music of all sorts—to sketch an anatomy of the moments on which such music is built, but most importantly to reflect as a night spent enthralled with a sound shapes yet another year of listening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to get away with infidelity, even if you are a count. The characters of Dunster House Opera’s new production of Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro” find out just how true this maxim can be. Directed by Stewart N. Kramer ’12  and continuing its run from Feb. 9th to 11th, “Figaro’s” plot features people jumping out of windows, cases of mistaken identity, and revelations of unknown familial relationships. Its hilarious plot, combined with some wonderful performances by the DHO’s singers, makes “Figaro” an extravaganza for both those knowledgeable about opera and those who have yet to experience one.
The plot of “The Marriage of Figaro” may not be as incomprehensible as, say, Verdi’s “Il Trovatore,” but it still borders on the absurd. The opera’s main plot concerns a butler by the name of Figaro (Thomas C. Wilhoit ’13) who attempts to protect his wife Susanna (Liv A. Redpath ’14) from the lecherous advances of his boss, the count (Eric Padilla ’14). They are aided in their efforts by the countess (Allison A. Ray ’14) and, between the three of them, hatch a plot to catch the count “in flagrante.” These plans are almost upended by the meddling of several secondary characters, such as the Count’s youthful, philandering page Cherubino (Elizabeth  K. Leimkuhler ’15) and the old maid Marcellina (Amelia H. Ross ’14), who attempts to force Figaro into marrying her as punishment for an unpaid debt.
The DHO’s production of “Figaro” embraces the opera’s pre-existing absurdity and  builds its production around it. Perhaps no part of the production exemplifies this better than Leimkuhler’s absolutely stellar performance as Cherubino. Her combination of physical comedy, acting talent, and serious singing chops make her the clear star of the show. Her rendition of Cherubino’s aria in the second act is perhaps one of the opera’s highlight. While others stand and sing, Leimkuhler cavorts on stage, her expressions often revealing more than her lyrics. But her acting does not distract her from what really counts: the singing. Leimkuhler’s free singing style is a perfect fit to the youthful Cherubino, and her rendition of Cherubino’s aria in the second act is one of the production’s highlights.
“The Marriage of Figaro” is well served by all of its actresses. Redpath gives an admirable performance as Susanna, playing the straig-laced and serious woman who watches as complete chaos unfolds around her. Her stage companion, Ray, gives an equally impressive performance as the Countess. There is not a single bad note sung by any of the female leads, and the songs in which they harmonize together are some of the stand-out moments of the opera. Wilhoit settles into the role of Figaro nicely, and his acting ability is matched by his powerful singing. Padilla, as the Count, performs his role with the right amount of sleaze; seeing him slide his hand along Redpath’s arm in the first act is enough to give anyone the creeps. Unfortunately, he lacks Wilhoit’s singing ability, and his perforance suffers for it.
The performers are backed by the DHO’s able orchestra. “Figaro” begins with the orchestra barreling into an energetic rendition of the opera’s famous overture. Such energy is not sustained throughout the opera itself, but the musicians capably support the characters and time their accompaniment. The pit does have some issues with balance. The brass section sometimes intrudes rudely in the middle of arias, and there are a few points where the orchestra overpowers the singers; these are, however, minor quibbles with their performance.
The set is sparse. It consists of only a few doors, a window that features prominently in Act II, and a few props, such as the sofa used by many characters as a hiding place. The costumes give an ambience of shabby elegance, which is a perfect fit for “Figaro.” Despite the main characters’ aristocratic pretentions, none of thesm are particularly chivalrous; and it is this lack of morality that gives “Figaro” most of its humor.  They not only hide from each other but also dress up as each other, all in a farcical game of cat and mouse that drives the plot foward. The protagonists are both deceitful and vindictive, but the storyline is so ridiculous that their various antics are more entertaing than cruel.
The new English translation by Kramer and music director Matt Aucoin ’12 represents the largest divergence from the original opera. Translations often fill operagoers with some trepidation: Mozart’s music was designed to be sung in Italian, and it is difficult to fit the same music to a different language. This is evidenced by Wilhoit’s and Kramer’s—who also plays the laywer Bartolo— stumbling over forced syllables in the faster parts of the opera. However, by halfway through the first act, the English begins to feel almost as natural as the Italian.
With “The Marriage of Figaro,” the Dunster House Opera continues its tradition of providing student-led opera that approaches professional quality. The DHO’s consistently strong singing enables the gracefulness of the new translation to shine through to the audience. This group performance,  combined with Kramer’s stellar stage direction, make this newest production a total success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“White Material,” the latest film by internationally celebrated director Claire Denis, opens with a vision of violent apocalypse. The house of French plantation owner Maria Vial (Isabelle Huppert) burns down, along with the dead and living bodies left inside—a bleak opening sequence to a troubling film.
Denis addressed the film’s central themes at the Harvard Film Archive on January 28, where a discussion with the director followed a screening of the work. Afterwards, Denis presented a short documentary “Aller au Diable” (To the Devil) about her trip to South America in preparation for a future project. Both films explored ideas central to Denis’ body of work: issues of race, culture, and control.
Set in an unnamed country in Africa, “White Material” follows Vial’s headstrong refusal to leave her land despite an impending of civil war. Playing in counterpoint with her early breakout “Chocolat,” Denis in “White Material” continues to confront the instability and imprecision of identity in the aftermath of imperialism. The former film ended with a black man whose American origin deters him from truly assimilating to his new home in Africa. The latter finds the problematic destiny of Vial’s African-born white son: “This is his country…but it doesn’t like him,” utters a character in the film.
The film “has its roots in the early work that she was doing. It also has its roots in the filmmakers she was beginning to work with, [like] Jim Jarmusch, Wim Wenders. Cinema is very much about this idea of the fluidity between ideas about the nation,” said HFA director Haden R. Guest.
The film also addresses violent conflict on racial lines: “white material” is an epithet that categorizes the white man as “other,” and the Vial tribe suffers from their distinction. “They have a sort of cowardice to pretend they are not in danger, as if they were invincible, protected by their whiteness.... [Vial] thinks nobody is going to touch her property. She is wrong, of course. She is not protected by her color,” Denis said in the discussion.
Abby P. Sun ’13, a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator who attended the screening, said of the work, “It wasn’t disturbing in a sense of blood and gore; it’s disturbing thematically. Claire Denis doesn’t shy away from the things that are very disturbing: genocide, race, and class warfare.”
Throughout her cinema, Denis has also drawn out the visceral, fragile nature of human life. Whether through the physicality of the soldiers in “Beau Travail” or the tragic suicide in “35 Rhums,” people are mortal bodies in Denis’ work, hanging by a thread at all times. “White Material” is no exception. In one scene, Vial’s blond son is chillingly stripped bare by two child rebels, and the image of his shining ivory skin becomes the film’s central emblem—the white material of the title. Identities in Denis’ works are tied to an irreducible corporeality.
The film abounds with textures and sensory experiences, a personal mark Denis has used to immense effect in her other works. During the discussion, the director explained a scene where two child rebels root through the possessions of the Vial estate: “The smell of the bathroom, soft and fresh materials—.films are made also of [these] impressions that are very difficult to write.”
Denis also emphasized the sensitivity of the young soldiers in the film, making the violence they effect and experience all the more disturbing. “They are not innocent; it is naïve to say innocent, but they were the victim of the story. They were hurt.” Denis said.
According to HFA director Guest, the filmmaker herself turned away from watching a climactic scene involving the slaughter of several child soldiers: “She couldn’t watch that scene. She said ‘I can’t watch it; it’s just so horrible.’”
Following the discussion of “White Material,” Denis introduced “Aller au Diable,” which featured her interviews with illegal gold miner Jean Bena. The film incorporated an array of Denis’ usual obsessions: the people and places born out of intertwining diasporas, the tension against authority and foreign control, and the perseverance and day-to-day experience of the poor.
Perhaps most evident in the work was Denis’ fondness for strange locales. She has often dealt with surreal geographies, such as the harsh and vaporous landscapes of “Beau Travail” and “Chocolat.” Yet “Aller au Diable,” which takes place between Surinam and French Guiana, revealed possibly the strangest of Denis’ landscapes in her documentation of Bena’s esoteric techniques for gold mining.
“She’s really interested in what it’s like to be a stranger, what it means to be foreign in a place and the different complexities and nuances of being a stranger,” Sun said. The best of Claire Denis’ films capture these rich relations of man and his context, from the local to the geopolitical and historical.

“They told me, ‘Everyone takes pictures of the Israeli soldiers—soldiers at the checkpoints, soldiers with guns. But what nobody takes pictures of is kids going to school,’” Alex W. Palmer ’12 said, walking through an exhibition of his photography in CGIS Knafel. The exhibition, entitled “The Beautiful Resistance: Life Beyond the Wall in the West Bank,” runs through March 30 and is composed of photographs taken at Aida, a Palestinian refugee camp in Bethlehem. Palmer, a social studies concentrator, taught photography in Aida last summer through Al-Rowwad, a Palestinian organization that works to promote nonviolence among Palestinian children through education and artwork.
Al-Rowwad was founded in 1998 and has been in Aida for over 10 years; according to its website, its mission has been the “promotion of human values and respect of human rights through arts and education as ways of beautiful and non-violent means of self-expression.” Palmer’s photos suggest that in Aida, art is a force to both communicate and encourage resilience. Street art covers the camp’s walls in many photographs, and Palmer explains that it is one way Aida’s inhabitants make the camp feel like a home.
Still, the street art may be not  enough for them to entirely reclaim a place. Palmer says many residents still do not see Aida as their own. “These people had been [in Aida] since 1948, but they still consider themselves to be refugees,” Palmer says. “A popular conversation topic is what the idea of home really means to them.”
Many of Palmer’s photographs are of children—a boy teaching his friend to ride a bike that’s far too big, three boys wrestling happily on a street, a sliver of a little girl peeping around a doorway. There are adults, too, and even some soldiers, but none of them show hostility. The photograph by which Palmer is standing instead shows the Palestinian soldier caught in the act of preparing dinner for his comrades, smiling at the camera as he kneels on the street behind a couple of food sacks and a large bottle of Pepsi.
As Palmer pauses by another photograph—a man operating his all-night falafel stand in the peace of an open doorway—he explains the approach that many of Aida’s inhabitants took to their circumstances: to “counter by living the best life you can.” The residents express their philosophy in a favorite phrase, “the beautiful resistance,” which inspired the title of Palmer’s exhibit. “The Beautiful Resistance” implies a focus on the grace and power of ordinary living, or, as Palmer puts it, “The best thing you can do [in the circumstances of a refugee camp] is to live a beautiful life.”
The everyday reality of this attitude is apparent in the spirit and animation of Palmer’s subjects. Palmer remarks that in a Kenyan refugee camp where he hsd done some work in the past, people were not nearly so eager to have their photographs taken; “20 percent of the time, they’d refuse,” he says. In Aida, he explains, “[the residents] realize that what they’re doing every day has a big impact.”
“What really strikes me about these photos is how happy [the subjects] are despite their living situation,” Caroline D. Huang ’13 says. The residents’ vigorous approach to life is evident in Palmer’s photos, partly in the vibrancy of the streets he captures—the elaborate graffiti on the high white stucco walls, the unexpected colors of hanging laundry or fruit juice around a child’s mouth—but partly in the subjects themselves, almost all of whom are making eye contact with Palmer’s camera.
Palmer has a story to tell about every person he photographed. He met the group of soldiers while he was buying yogurt in a local grocery, and they invited him to have dinner with them. In another photo, a man bicycles down the street while carrying his contented daughter over one shoulder. “He did that every day for about 40 minutes in front of my house,” Palmer says.
One of Palmer’s photographs depicts a teenager he met on arrival; the young man is waiting for someone to seesaw with him at a playground at a culture center in the middle of the camp. It’s one of Palmer’s many favorite shots that feature a personal friend.
The final photo in the exhibition shows a mural, done in muted tones, of what Palmer describes as “an ideal Palestinian community”—a woman and two children stand in front of a pale brown house and a bland green field. Next to the mural, two boys in red shirts stand in the street, beneath a cascade of balconies bright with drying laundry. “They’re waiting for their friend to come over,” Palmer says. He smiles and then continues, “I like it because life here is so much brighter than even the artwork.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past 50 years, Sir Paul McCartney has seemed perfectly happy to fill the world with silly love songs. While he has released a few branch-out projects, such as his electronic experiment “The Fireman” or his classical projects like the ballet “Ocean’s Kingdom,” they all somehow have the stamp of McCartney’s ‘70s band Wings and of a man set in his ways. However, in another apparent stylistic departure, Sir Paul is releasing an album almost entirely composed of jazz standards. Ill-advisedly entitled “Kisses on the Bottom,” the album appears to represent Sir Paul’s jump onto a standards-bandwagon that has gotten pretty crowded of late, as aging singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson (“Stardust,” 1978), Rod Stewart (“It Had To Be You,” 2002), and Joni Mitchell (“Both Sides Now,” 2000) have both offered their particular take on the Great American Songbook. McCartney’s new album provides further evidence in affirming the increasingly evident yet unfortunate truth that pop singers offer very little in artistically transforming these standards.
What is motivating the pop stars of yesterday to embrace the popular songs of eighty years ago? The question is perplexing, especially when the result is as bad as “Kisses on the Bottom.” McCartney’s attempt to cross over into the genre of jazz is unrelentingly tedious. Crooning wispily over gushes of over-orchestrated strings and saccharine harp arpeggi, McCartney sounds tellingly (and given that he will be 70 this June, unsurprisingly) old, especially in the upper register. The man has made a career out of pleasant high-tenor smoothness, but this late in the game he sounds fragile and ready to snap, like an overstretched guitar string. McCartney’s attempts to vocally adapt to the style of a standards album likewise end up sounding stilted and uncomfortable; coy and nonchalant, he seems at times to be trying out his lounge-singer act rather than sentimentalizing in his usual staggeringly earnest way.
McCartney is poorly served by his choice of songs, which brings us back to the question of why pop stars are even releasing these standards albums. The lyrics are almost uniformly insipid—McCartney knows way more about writing a love song than most of the songwriters he’s covering did—which makes his choice to do the album all the more perplexing.
What are standards, even? Why do they persist? A standard is defined by the Oxford Encyclopedia of Music as “a popular song that becomes an established item in the repertory…including popular songs from the late 19th century, songs from Broadway musicals and Hollywood films.” They quickly became the staple of jazz recordings in the 1920s and ‘30s. The song “Dinah,” for example, was published in 1925, with music by Harry Akst and lyrics by Sam M. Lewis and Joe Young. It was added to the Ziegfeld musical “Kid Boots” at the 11th hour; it was not until Ethel Waters recorded it as a single later that same year that it became a hit. The lyrics are mind-numbing (“Dinah / Is there anyone finah / In the state of Carolinah?”), but all the same, dozens of popular artists recorded the song in the ensuing decades. Between Ethel Waters and Bing Crosby, very few of these artists created recordings with any redeeming features.
In sharp contrast stands Thelonious Monk’s 1964 solo piano rendition of “Dinah.” The absurd lyrics are thankfully absent, cast aside in favor of the deeper meaning and expressivity of Monk’s pianistic craftsmanship. He begins with sharp, irreverently bouncing staccato, deliberately parodying the big-band silliness of the song’s origin—Monk plays the piano more as a percussion instrument than anything, and his cheeky riffing is full of sharp, overzealous wackiness and unexpected delays. But near the end of the track, the tone shifts from mocking giddiness to quiet sincerity. Monk plays the final bars with uninhibited reverberation and an almost hymnal care—he’s transcended “Kid Boots,” the tackiness of the other recordings, and perhaps even the song itself. As a final unresolved suspension rings out, Monk crowns his achievement by trilling the top two notes on the piano with sneaky, tinny irreverence.
Thus we see the story of standards as a battleground for a contention as old as jazz itself: the polarization between the mainstream commercial entities, out for palatable schmaltz, and innovative musicians, prepared to take even the most asinine song as a template for stunningly brilliant virtuosity. Apart from a baseline of chordal complexity, there’s nothing special about these songs—in fact, most of them are nothing less than terrible if played straight, as McCartney has done in the tradition of innumerable pop stars. The artistic importance of the standard is dependent on the musicians who are able, somehow, to create something transcendent out of them. The studio musicians on “Kisses on the Bottom,” including pianist Diana Krall, are kept on an excessively tight leash by producer Tommy LiPuma, and even when guitar deity Eric Clapton makes an appearance for the McCartney original “My Valentine,” he only contributes a bit of lazy acoustic strumming. The album, as a result, is sterile. It recycles old, bad pop songs that have, in the absence of innovation, outlived their usefulness.
To be fair, McCartney could have done worse—all one has to do is listen to Willie Nelson’s rendition of “All of Me” to see that—but it’s clear that the entire concept of the pop singer-sings-standards album is misdirected. Jazz standards aren’t made immortal by the compositions themselves, but by the ingenious jazz arrengements created for them. In 1961, John Coltrane was able to take a song as whimsical as Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things” and transform it into a revelation. If McCartney and Rod Stewart want sentimentality, they’d be better off to write it themselves—that’s what they’re best at anyway.

The mind of Nicki Minaj must be a confused and frightening place. Mostly confused, but still very frightening. I picture a basic brain stem, a cerebellum, and an amalgam of fake eyelashes, eye shadow, and ass.
That’s not to say that she doesn’t have talent. Minaj can spit some fire, and she shows off her talent on “Stupid Hoe” with lines like “‘Cause I pull up and I’m stuntin’ but I ain’t a stuntman / Yes I’m rockin’ Jordans but I ain’t a jumpman.” However, the profound weirdness of the video distracts from the track itself. “Stupid Hoe” isn’t strange in a “Oh-look-at-how-much-personality-she-has-hahaha” kind of way—just in the good old-fashioned, “Good-Lord-what-am-I-watching” kind of way.
It is hard to evaluate the thematic elements of the video for “Stupid Hoe” because it is hard to identify any thematic elements at all. The video feels like Minaj strolled through the FAO Schwarz of hip-hop music video tropes and grabbed whatever toys were the loudest and most immediately indicative of her aggressive and vibrantly colorful style. As a result, “Stupid Hoe” is filled with pink sports cars, war-paint application of neon makeup, and wild beehive hair.
Buried amongst the liberal and boisterous displays of Minaj’s persona are several obvious references to other female pop artists. She morphs into a leopard while cavorting about inside a cage, à la Shakira in “She Wolf.” There are also a few frames in which Minaj possesses grotesquely enlarged eyes, like Lady Gaga in “Bad Romance.” Unfortunately, both references serve only to highlight deficiencies of “Stupid Hoe.” Shakira is alarmingly sexy in her video, whereas Minaj is just plain alarming. “Bad Romance” was a triumph of choreography and artistic vision; “Stupid Hoe” is a mess of jump cuts and misguided attempts to be edgy.
While Minaj’s image is largely based on quirkiness, she overextends herself in this latest video. The track itself is a throwback to her earlier work, with snappy one-liners and disses whizzing about every which way. Unfortunately, in trying to emulate that high energy, the video ends up feeling disjointed and a bit disturbing. To Minaj’s credit, however, it takes real talent to make so much ass look so un-sexy.

The only thing that has stuck for a decade in my memory from Edith Nesbit’s classic novel “Five Children and It” is the set of instructions on how to will yourself into waking up at a certain hour. “You get into bed at night,” Nesbit writes, “and lie down quite flat on your little back with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say ‘I must wake up at five’ (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time is that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on to your chest and then bang your head back on the pillow. And you do this as many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is quite an easy sum.)”
I remember being skeptical of this system as a 12 year-old—was Nesbit trying to make a joke at the expense of her “little” readers? But over the years, I discovered that if I thought concertedly about the time I needed to get up the following morning, I often woke up a few minutes before my alarm clock, no matter how irregular the hours I was keeping. Apparently, you can will yourself into waking up when you need to, along with the proven facts that you can will yourself into a better mood by smiling, and that you can will yourself into believing a placebo will help you even when you know it’s a placebo. I also think that you can will yourself into finding the exact piece of art that you’ve been looking for, knowingly or not.
Two summers ago, due to a flight-planning error, I had a day to pass in London with absolutely nothing to do. I ended up going for an all-day walk, mostly because all the Underground stations were being fixed up for the Olympics. My backpack was heavy, and my walk was aimless and depressing. I was alone and had no money to speak of—I ate four toffee-flavored yogurts because they were on sale. I walked to the palace, along the river, to the Tate Modern, and up to the Brick Lane area, where I found a lot of beautiful full-mink stoles that I didn’t have the money to buy. Finally, evening was falling, and I could start heading to the airport where I was to spend the night.
I had just turned westward and begun the slog from Brick Lane to King’s Cross when I found, along a wide, gray street, a wall of paintings by Ben Eine, the alphabet-obsessed street artist whose work British Prime Minster David Cameron had recently presented to Barack Obama. Following Eine’s letters, I found a massive weasel painted by another famous street artist, Roa, whose intensely detailed, morbid, textural, drawing-like depictions of rodents and birds had been cycling through my Google Reader for years. The weasel did not look like an etching, the way Roa’s pieces look online. I could see the powdery sweep of the fine-nozzled black spray can. I was just as tall as its stomach.
Though the beating heart of street art is its accessibility and its rejection of all kinds of formal art institutions, from schools to galleries, the works’ indivisibility from their places of creation makes them even more elusive to enjoy in person than even the most elite painting. Seen live, the weasel was beautiful, monstrous, and totally unmanageable—the kind of megafauna that prehistoric humans killed off as they developed more advanced missile technology. I could not contain my excitement and exclaimed about the piece to passersby. Looking at the Roa in the twilight did not suddenly bring my life into focus for me. It did not diminish any grander site that I had seen earlier in the city. It was not the symbol of my travels, or anything else. But it was a powerful experience.
I think that one possible key to enjoying art is allowing yourself to accept what you see, the way you would accept the 7:58 that you see on your clock upon waking when you have set your alarm to ring at 8:00. Let art be something that contains the force of that personal will. Street art like Roa’s weasel, which requires some kind of wandering and stumbling upon, is particularly apt for this kind of discovery. Art always anticipates, and it will be there when you wake. Enjoying art is an act of will: You meet it halfway with hope, and it will repay you many times over.

In 2009, Heartless Bastards’ frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom appeared on Nerve’s list of the “Forty Sexiest Frontwomen in Rock History,” and deservedly so—in the last seven years, Wennerstrom has established herself as one of rock’s most alluring vocalists. The band’s newest album, “Arrow,” reinforces this reputation. Wennerstrom is in impeccable form as she purrs, yelps, and growls her way through a lyrically weak but otherwise impressive album that draws influences from garage rock, folk, and blues.
“Arrow” begins in the traditional rock and roll style that the Heartless Bastards play so well. “Marathon,” the album opener, is a nostalgic description of life as a journey home. Like “Into the Open,” the opening track on their sophomore album “All This Time,” “Marathon” starts softly with a bluesy ostinato. The track simmers quietly for several minutes before churning upward toward the Heartless Bastard’s trademark driving sound. Above splashing cymbals and soothing guitar, Wennerstrom sings yearningly, “Time, it takes you so far / And I am longing to be back home.”
The band hits a musical highpoint on “Simple Feeling,” a garage rock jam that features sludgy guitars and vigorous tom fills. This song is characterized by reckless abandon and supreme joyfulness, especially during the outstanding bass-driven bridge, when the drums drop out and the guitars take off in a whirlwind of sound.
Besides the staple rock-and-roll and blues tracks, the album explores new musical territory. While “All This Time,” stayed mainly within traditional rock and blues, “Arrow” shows more complex chord changes and intricate song structure. “The Arrow Killed the Beast” is a gentle waltz that makes use of orchestral percussion, and “Skin and Bone,” opens with bongos and a shaker. “Late in the Night” returns to heavy guitar riffs that sound like they came right off of Jack White’s fingers. Each track of “Arrow” offers a new and potentially jarring musical style, but the album remains cohesive due to its strong blues rock roots.
The variation is a welcome addition, but “Arrow” derives its true power from Wennerstrom’s vocals. At times, she possesses quiet vulnerability, but she sheds this timidity in soaring, majestic choruses. As each track gains momentum and complexity, Wennerstrom’s fiery and confident voice holds the music together. On “Only For You,” she shows off her range, slyly slurring her low notes together during the verse while hitting a delicate falsetto during the expansive chorus. From her bright energy of “Parted Ways” to her sultry drawl of “Down In The Canyon,” Wennerstrom’s voice is perhaps the biggest contributor toward making the album so memorable.
But while the instrumentation and vocals remain strong throughout, the band’s shallow lyrics keep the album from being a complete success. Overall, their unimaginative words rely on overused themes. The attempts at heartfelt meaning come up short when the band relies on dull lines such as “Cause you can’t always do it alone / Sometimes you just need a / Need a little help.” Often, as in “Simple Feeling” and “Low Low Low,” the chorus is largely a repetition of the title of the track.
However, the album’s vocals and experimentation make up for its lyrical shortcomings. Due to its huge choruses and infectious melodies, “Arrow” makes for an extremely fun listen. With differing musical styles in every song, the album shows a blues rock band that has evolved immensely since its beginnings. “Arrow” pulls from varied influences without being derivative, and Wennerstrom carries the album with her charisma.

of Montreal has never shied away from the weird, abstruse, and generally unconventional. Past live performances have featured absurdist gems like Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon spanking men dressed as pigs, and the band’s lyrics, titles, and artwork all fall somewhere between the silly and the grotesque. Given how veiled and showy of Montreal has been in years past, it is thus surprising that “Paralytic Stalks,” the band’s newest album, is largely characterized by a genuine vulnerability  Front man Kevin Barnes’s emotional sincerity adds a fiery depth that was not present in much of their past work. “Paralytic Stalks” is driven by this depth and reaffirms of Montreal’s creative genius while providing a glimpse into Barnes’s beautiful, troubled soul.
On this album, Kevin Barnes takes back center stage from his alter-ego Georgie Fruit, who dominated their last few releases. Fruit—a black, middle-aged, former funk musician who has undergone multiple sex change operations—brought a flamboyance to of Montreal’s music. Now Barnes’s own depression and personal problems are at the forefront. Poignant themes of frustration, loneliness, and violence run rampant throughout the lyrics with lines like, “Now I’m considered ugly from every angle / You’re the only beauty I don’t want to strangle / Can’t you hear me crying out for guidance?” Though Barnes is no longer writing the epic, surreal lyrics of his past successes, his poetic viruosity still shines through in lines like “Can’t seem to get my saddle on the spoils of this morbid fugue.” Georgie Fruit may not be inspiring him anymore, but Barnes remains a superb lyricist.
Thankfully, the actually music on “Paralytic Stalks” is not nearly as morose as the lyrics would suggest. The gloomy lyrical themes are tempered by robust, rollicking melodies coupled with energetic funk beats. Bleak sentiments and paranoia envelop the lyrics of tracks like “Spiteful Intervention” and “Dour Percentage,” yet judging only from the instrumentation and the smooth, lighthearted quality of Barnes’s voice, the song could just as well have been about butterflies and birthday cake.
There are moments where Barnes’s sentiments are conveyed more completely, as the charged emotion of the lyrics cross over into the music and vocal quality. When Barnes sings, “What I feel is corrupted, broken, impotent and insane” in “Ye, Renew the Plaintiff,” the coarser tone in Barnes’s voice channels and augments the insistent desperation of the lyrics. The same effect is achieved in “Gelid Ascent” through distortion, an eerie synthesizer, and harsh industrial sounds.
This new sound is an element the band’s constant evolution. When of Montreal first appeared on the scene 15 years ago, their music was full of retro-pop naivety, but in the years since, the band has incorporated psychedelic rock, folk, funk and R&B. “Paralytic Stalks” displays post-punk tendencies in “Gelid Ascent,” country twang in parts of “Wintered Debt,” industrial severity in the intro of “Authentic Pyrrhic Remission,” and funky bass and drum rhythms in almost all of the tracks. Toward the latter half of the album, Barnes enthusiastically reveals experimental influences. “Authentic Pyrrhic Remission,” “Wintered Debts,” and “Exorcismic Breeding Knife,” include long portions of dissonant instrumental jamming. Flutes, violins, synthesizers, bells, and chanting and humming fade in and out in a curious menagerie.
Such a complete shift from popular music to avant-garde is quite a shock. The contrast between cacophonous instrumentation and engaging melodies create a vexing friction, and the transitions are sometimes jarring. These experimental sections are often bloated and excessive, particularly in the 13-minute-long final track “Authentic Pyrrhic Remission.”
However, there are some brief moments when these abstract sections perfectly complement the album’s catchy melodies and show the potential of a new genre based on bizzare stylistic fusions. Given that “Paralytic Stalks” is of Montreal’s 11th release, it it is a relief to still see Barnes trying his hardest to stay inventive and relevant. “Paralytic Stalks” has tedious moments, but its charming, melodic lines and its raw, expressive tone on the whole make for a resounding triumph.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was indifferent to the Occupy Harvard movement for a long time. Yes, it was a pain to present my ID every morning as though I were trying to buy beer rather than drag myself to class. Yes, I cried out in frustration when I realized the gate I had been hurrying toward was unyieldingly barred. But in some ways I admired the protesters. If I were them, I would get bloody sick of looking at John Harvard and thinking of how many people’s pee has coursed down his breeches. One day, however, my ambivalence toward the Occupy movement turned to unbridled dislike. I was walking from the direction of Annenberg through the Yard one nippy evening during finals period when a security guard asked me, “What’s with everyone wearing these big glasses?” My reaction, admittedly, was rather severe, but I couldn’t help it. I was incensed. “Sorry that I’m minus 5.5 in one eye and have thick frames,” I snapped.
But as soon as the words were out of my mouth I felt guilty—not because I had been rude to the security guard (What right did he have to comment on my eyewear, anyway?), but because I had lied. I lied not about my eyesight—yes, my myopia really is that severe—but about the reasons I wear thick frames. Who am I kidding? Just because I’m almost blind in one eye doesn’t mean I have to go around with frames as thick as Velma’s. Thankfully, technology has advanced enough to allow large visual correction with relatively slender lenses. Indeed, technology has advanced so far that, if I wanted to, I could chuck my glasses out the window and get laser eye surgery for as little as $299 an eye, according to Google ads.
Yet I have chosen to wear glasses for the past 10 or so years, and each new pair has gotten thicker and thicker until I reached my current pair. Granted, my vision was deteriorating each year, but my choice of frames had less to do with my declining eyesight and more to do with my increasing awareness of my “artsiness,” and, even more, my desire to seem artsy to my peers. I got my first pair of thick glasses, by which I mean chunky, dark plastic frames, my sophomore year of high school. “Look at me,” they proclaimed on my behalf. “I can wear bold frames and not feel self conscious about it. I’m embracing my inner geek.” I flatter myself that I embraced my inner geek before it was hipster or cool to do so, which really means that I just looked like an idiot, instead of a suave, intellectual hipster. But whatever, I’m still giving myself some credit for being ahead of the curve.
My second pair of thick glasses out-nerded the first by a long shot. I still have this pair, and it is the pair that sparked the testy encounter in the yard. They are made by Cutler and Gross, a British eyeglass manufacturer whose website is far too trendy for its own good. Google it—it’s quite a laugh. It markets its current collection with a Hong Kong Love Story: “He was a broken hearted journalist, she was a beautiful but world-weary young married secretary….” Seriously. This is on the website. And as silly as it is, I think it’s actually rather a clever bit of marketing. What glasses-wearing woman doesn’t want to look like a “beautiful but world-weary young married secretary?” That’s what I was going for when I chose those Cutler and Gross frames: big, black, bold, ballsy. The purchase of that storied pair coincided with the veritable pinnacle of my high school artsiness: I was editor of the newspaper and spent the summer acting in a play at the Edinburgh Fringe, and my glasses were proud of it.
I wish I could say I have outgrown this need to affirm my interest in literary and dramatic arts through my eyewear, but the truth is I haven’t. This winter vacation, I made the mistake of travelling in contact lenses, brilliantly leaving my two pairs of costly glasses in my dorm room. I know how bad my eyesight is. A month with no glasses just wasn’t going to happen. And so my first stop once I got home was the glasses store. With hardly a moment’s thought, I selected a slightly smaller but thicker pair of black Persols, rather more “Mad Men” than the Cutler and Gross pair, but, I hoped, just as artsy.

Plato argued that theater is destructive for society because it presents a false picture of reality. Once viewed, a play leads its audience to adopt ideas or emotions based on “fictio,” or amoral falsehood, and not on “praxis,” or the world as it truly exists. Plato’s theater traffics in the subtle and pernicious art of deception.
Though he affects a Plato-friendly stoicism in sporting hoodies midwinter and making characteristically stony replies to news conference reporters, Pats coach Bill Belichick proved himself last Sunday to be the ultimate Platonic deceiver. Belichick, who runs his team with the mechanical efficiency of a trash compactor, has married success with bland ruthlessness even more thoroughly than the fat cat Yankees. While the Yanks’ fortune is in money, however, the Pats’ unmatched asset has been Belichick’s genius. His powerful mind is unafraid of a turn to the dark arts.
The score: 17 to 15 Pats. One minute and four seconds left. Second down. The Giants are in the Pats red zone, well within kicker Lawrence Tynes’ field goal range. With only one timeout, the Pats look fated to watch the Giants score a field goal, go down by a point, and receive the ball with too little time to respond with a drive of their own. Giants quarterback Eli Manning hands the ball off to runningback Ahmad Bradshaw, whose only job is to kill time. Bradshaw strides up the middle with the humble wish to fall quickly and watch as the clock winds down. Instead, he finds himself past the line of scrimmage, in the open field, and running to the endzone. But that’s not what he wants; a quick score would give the Patriots’ Tom Brady the ball with ample time to march down the field in terminating heroics. An inch away from the threshold, Bradshaw stops in his tracks, and, like a child dipping his toe in the ocean, totters into six points.
How could Bradshaw have mistakenly scored? Only due to genius play-acting. Belichick, suddenly a theater director, had instructed his defensive line to fight back just enough to create the appearance of conventional football effort—and so to induce Bradshaw to run as he normally does—without trying so hard that they would get near to actually stopping Bradshaw. The physical impetus of the game—motion meeting motion, advancing drive against backward repulsion—was replaced, in the most critical moment of the 2011-2012 season, with concept art. Bradshaw’s accidental touchdown was a charming testament to his unthinking faith in football conventions, especially in the face of Belichick’s counter-intuitive performance piece. The running back was simply too tied to the ingrained desire to score; the gravitational pull of the endzone was too strong. Belichick, on the other hand, saw past the brute instinct to immediate success. He realized that the self-destruction of allowing the score was his only path to victory.
The trick proved insufficient, and the Giants won 21-17. That does not mean, however, that Belichick’s perversion was anything short of a miraculous success. It gave the Pats a potent dying breath. Harvard students in particular ought to appreciate this Pyrrhic victory of mind over muscle. Plato would have called him a great liar, but Belichick’s artful trap does not ask for moral understanding. It demands a round of applause.

Harvard University Dining Services recently changed its name, and even bigger changes are underway. Since coming back from winter break, we have been pleasantly surprised by the new food selections offered in the dining halls.
Like other students, we have thus far enjoyed the more diverse menu HUDS has offered this semester. We applaud HUDS for listening to student concerns about food quality, healthiness, and sustainability, as well as labor rights, and for taking those issues into consideration when choosing the winter menu.
New menu changes have introduced the taste of many different cultures to Harvard’s dining halls. For example, the world cuisines featured during dinner—including Peking chicken on Monday night and Korean barbecue on Wednesday night—bring an exciting change to weeknight dinner. Last week’s French bistro brunch was also an excellent addition to normal brunch fare. These “cuisine-themed” meals provide a great way for Harvard students to experience diverse food without having to eat off-campus.
HUDS has also attempted to increase the quality and diversity of food in the dining halls—for example, larger selections of fruit on Tuesday nights and better frozen yogurt in every dining hall. These changes are also commendable.
Some of the positive changes are the work of the Joint Best Practices Committee which Harvard formed as part of the food service workers’ union contract. This committee has already met and made positive changes in the dining halls: for example, the egg salad and tofu salad in the deli bar are now made on-campus by Harvard dining hall workers instead of being shipped to Harvard pre-made, and roast beef will also be roasted on campus. Chicken salad and tuna salad will soon be made by HUDS as well.
By increasing food quality while also increasing environmental sustainability and hopefully providing more hours for underemployed workers, the Joint Best Practices Committee has been a great model thus far for instituting change in the menu. We hope that the Committee will continue to make changes in every section of the dining hall.
While HUDS’s recent changes have been positive, students will certainly have additional feedback about the food this semester. While making future decisions about food, HUDS must been sustainable sourcing and preparation high on its agenda. For example, the small stations where food is prepared fresh in the dining hall allow HUDS to use local vegetables, often from the Harvard Community Garden, to prepare delicious and healthy food that students enjoy. We hope that the changes made this semester in the dining hall bode well for a future of increasingly delicious and high-quality food in Harvard’s dining halls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Politics in America have officially become destructive. Polarization and heated political rhetoric may have been unpleasant last year, but in 2012, the brute ambition of the Machiavellian prince has emerged roaring from behind the curtain, and he’s ready to destroy. With the Obama administration’s decision to force certain religious employers to provide health care coverage for all Food and Drug Administration approved-contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and other controversial services, Obama has officially declared war against liberty.
Contrary to what some have argued, the contraceptive mandate is not contingent on the insurance provider receiving public funding. The statute applies to every health insurance provider in the country. As such, religious institutions not granted exemptions are forced to either stop providing health coverage (and face a stiff penalty under the law) or violate their religious convictions. On this issue, however, the First Amendment to the Constitution leaves little room for ambiguity: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” By forcing religious institutions to provide contraceptives and procedures that they have consistently regarded as evil, the Obama administration has effectively reduced the free exercise of religion to the freedom to worship. They have ordered Americans to leave their beliefs and principles at the altar. The mandate is an order to choose between one’s soul and one’s government, and despite what Obama may believe, a soul is far more precious than a government. Who you are is far more important than who your government orders you to be.
The contraceptive mandate is a blow not only to religion but also to civil society. By only exempting houses of worship but not other religious institutions from the mandate, the administration has decreed that religion and religious values are no longer welcome in civil society. In reality, religion is a major foundation of civil society. Throughout the history of the United States, religious institutions have provided critical aid to the poor, homes for orphans, and education for students. A personal belief is something that one acts upon: a religious call to care for the poor drives one to volunteer one’s time, talent, and treasure to charity. To order Catholic and other religious institutions to cover abortifacients and contraceptives is to order them to violate their beliefs. James Madison, author of much of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, argued, “conscience is the most sacred of all property.” If the government can control one’s conscience, there remains nothing outside of its reach.
The worst of it is the fact that the Obama administration and its allies remain indifferent to what they have done. After the thundering condemnation of the mandate from multiple religious leaders and religious freedom advocates, the White House's only response was that “the issue here is we want to be sure women, all women, have access to good health care.” Even if one believed this was good health care policy, it fails to explain why the president has the authority to explicitly violate the basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights. Planned Parenthood attacked the response of Catholic bishops: “They are in the very small minority who believe this is a bad policy, and the majority of men and women think they should have access to birth control through their health coverage.” The Constitution and fundamental rights do not depend on popular opinion; if they did, federal judges would be elected, not appointed. By refusing to defend its Constitutional position, President Obama has effectively recognized that he remains indifferent towards the fundamental rights of America’s citizens. Lincoln once famously asked, “Was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?” Obama is asking whether it is possible to lose the Constitution and yet preserve his electoral base.
In 2012, America faces more than a choice between political parties and tax rates. The polarized American electorate must collectively resolve a crisis in government. Under President Obama, liberalism has transformed government from the protector of rights to the granter of tolerance. The problem is that, while rights are inalienable, tolerance can be taken away. Now that the tolerance for religion has been revoked, religious leaders face the crushing power of the state, imposing its liberal views on any institution that dares step in its way. The president and his supporters have officially declared executive authority over religion. In 2012, the American voter must decide whether he wishes to complete the path to serfdom. The price will be our freedom.

“Smile: Your Mother Chose Life,” a series of posters beamed throughout the Yard. But you, if you are a Harvard female, have a few reasons to be less flippant about your potential motherhood.  In the United States, as a college-age female you are a member of the single most at-risk group for sexual violence.  One in five female college students will be sexually assaulted by the time they graduate.  Although accurate data on pregnancies due to rape is notoriously difficult to obtain, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network estimates that five percent of rape survivors become pregnant.  Even when the pregnancy test comes back negative, often those uncertain moments, hours, or days remain a harrowing memory.
No one can tell a rape survivor how she must feel.  To imply, as some pro-life politicians do, that rape is only one tiny tumor wrapped up in that great gift of fertility is crass and insensitive, to say the least.  No one but a rape survivor can decide whether her ordeal was a blessing, pregnancy or no.  Not when one out of three survivors will develop rape-related post-traumatic stress disorder.  Not when rape can cause or is linked to sexually transmitted diseases, flashbacks, eating disorders, sleeping disorders, self-harm, depression, suicide, Stockholm syndrome, borderline personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.
It is a common refrain among the pro-life contingency that an abortion replicates the violence of rape on the fetus.  But rape is not strictly a “violence.”  It is not like getting hit in the face or stabbed with a knife.  It is a violation. It is someone deciding that your body is not your own to do with as you see fit.  It is someone bull-dozing over your right to consent or decline.  It is manipulating a vulnerable person—sometimes a child, a subordinate, a family member—into unwanted sex.   It is taking advantage of an incapacitated person.  It is believing that a woman does not know what she truly wants. That a man knows better. That “no” actually means “yes.”
Do you know what else violates women?  Telling a woman that she has no control over her body: That a single insentient cell, which has more in common with a bacterium than with a human, is the only part of her that matters.  That killing this single cell is equivalent to what her rapist did to her—regardless of whether she has developed serious PTSD and cannot handle the stress of the pregnancy, or is on medication that would seriously harm or kill the fetus, or is too young to safely carry a child to term.
What violates women is reiterating to survivors that abortion is risky to women’s mental health and can lead to even worse post-trauma problems—a claim that has been thoroughly debunked many times. Those same forces rely on an outdated and unscientific study, in which only thirty-seven women were surveyed, to claim that up to 80 percent of rape victims choose not to abort and therefore no woman should ever be given that choice.  They would rather send vulnerable women to anti-abortion Crisis Pregnancy Centers, which distribute information that a US Congressional Report found to be false or misleading 87 percent of the time.
Violation is when people poster Harvard dorms, as Harvard Right to Life did in 2004, with a picture of a woman stating, "I was raped and therefore 'justified' in my abortion, but it didn't change a thing.  I suffered because I was led to believe that taking my child's life was okay. It was not.” Such insensitive propaganda campaigns force every woman who was every raped to relive her own experience of powerlessness and shame.
Violation is when anti-abortion activists protest and harass women in front of Planned Parenthood, one of the largest organizations for women’s health as well as the nation’s most reliable way to obtain STD and pregnancy tests.  It is shouting “It’s a child, not a choice!” at women who might be entering the building because they need an HIV test after a rape.
Harvard Right to Life, the Daughters of Isabella, and the Knights of Columbus can find ways to reduce the number of abortions by pushing for sexual education, easy access to contraception, services for young or poor mothers, or for legislation that would prevent a rapist from gaining custody of the child. They need not re-victimize some of the most vulnerable and invisible members of society.  Rape survivors have lived through enough.

Those seeking to redefine marriage to include same-sex unions often make their case by calling for “equality” in our marriage laws.  Claiming that traditional marriage laws are unjust and discriminatory, they seek to right these wrongs and achieve “marriage equality.”  However, equality is not a principle that can settle the issue, nor even one that separates the two sides of the marriage debate. Neither advocates of traditional marriage nor revisionists seeking legal recognition for same sex unions are opposed to equality in our marriage laws.  The real difference of opinion actually centers on the nature of marriage itself.
Equality under the law does not mean treating everything the same.  Rather, it means treating things the same if they actually are the same in relevant and meaningful ways.  For example, all individuals deserve equal respect for their human rights.  People are all the same with respect to being human, and so they all deserve equal protection of basic human rights like the right to life, free speech, and religious freedom.
Equality certainly does not require that all relationships be recognized as marriages. Many proponents of same-sex marriage would no doubt oppose the recognition of polyamorous relationships (that is, relationships among more than two people), but this does not mean that such people oppose full marriage equality.  No one claims that ordinary friendships should be treated as marriages; there is simply no reason they should be.  People who form friendships or polyamorous relationships are not somehow given unequal treatment because they cannot legally marry.  Current laws simply recognize these relationships for what they truly are: decidedly non-marital.
Despite the rallying cries of some revisionists, laws enshrining traditional marriage do not discriminate in the way that Jim Crow laws against mixed-race marriages did.  Those laws had nothing to do with the definition of marriage and instead placed prohibitions on who was eligible for marriage that had no intelligible connection to the actual nature of the union.  Proponents of such laws did not believe that members of different races could not physically be wed, but that it was an undesirable threat to a society based on segregation.  These laws set up barriers to equality among persons, whereas traditional marriage laws, if their definition of marriage is correct, do not.
Thus the central question of the debate is not “Whom should we allow to marry?” but “What is marriage?”  The answer to the latter question can tell us what our marriage laws should be and which relationships ought to be recognized as marriages.  It should inform people as to whether marriage ought to be between one man and one woman only, between any two people only, or perhaps even between two or more people.
Defenders of traditional marriage believe that the institution is, and can only be, between one man and one woman.  We believe that marriage is by nature comprehensive, uniting spouses in every aspect of the person, including the bodily aspect.  Spouses seal their marriage by becoming a single biological principle: that is, by together forming the basic unit that carries out some organic function.  This can only be achieved by an act of sexual intercourse that is reproductive in kind (though not necessarily in result).  In such acts, spouses quite literally become “one flesh,” like two organs acting in concert for the biological good of the whole.  For this reason, marriage must be consummated through intercourse, and only spouses that can possibly perform such acts can truly be married.
It is less clear what most revisionists think about the definition of marriage.  Of course, most (though by no means all) want marriage to be a union of any two people, but they generally leave ambiguous the specific characteristics of marriage that lead to this definition.  What features of marriage, so conceived, distinguish it from other kinds of relationships?  What can consummate it?  Why are people only able to enter into it in pairs?  These questions are rarely answered in discussions of “marriage equality.”
If revisionists think marriage should be redefined, they must develop an alternative definition for it.  They must determine what they think marriage truly is and what its core characteristics are, then present their definition alongside the traditional conception of marriage and argue that theirs is superior.  However, mere appeals to equality are insufficient.   Equality demands adherence to the true definition of marriage, not unprincipled inclusivity.  If there is a case to be made for same-sex marriage, it has little to do with a short slogan.

On Jan. 28, the Harvard Law Review elected Conor S. Tochilin ’06 as its 126th president.
Tochilin, a second-year student at the Law School, is currently pursuing an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School in addition to a law degree.
Tochilin said that he hopes that serving as president of the Law Review will allow him to combine his interests in business and law.
“Because I have a law and business background, I felt like it would be a fun management challenge in addition to immersing myself in the legal scholarship,” he said.
Tochilin said that his duties as president will include both an editorial component, which involves a careful reading of articles and making substantive memos, and a management component, which includes overseeing a staff of 88 editors on the Law Review and spearheading new initiatives and long-term projects.
Tochilin was chosen from a pool of 14 candidates in an election process that lasted eight hours, the departing president Mitchell Reich said.
Self-nominated candidates for Law Review president are elected by a vote of the entire active body of editors, including second- and third-year law students.
“Conor is a superb editor, an extremely effective manager, and a person whom all of the editors like and respect,” Reich said.
“I’ve been impressed—but not at all surprised—by how easily he’s slid into the position in his first week.”
Hailing from Atlanta, Tochilin graduated from Harvard with a degree in economics and philosophy.
During his time at the College, Tochilin played cello for the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. After graduating, he worked as a consultant and investor in New York and London before returning to Harvard.
Tochilin is not a stranger to leadership at Harvard. He also served as the president of the Hasty Pudding Social Club while he was an undergraduate.
“The law review publishes major academic pieces and requires a great deal of hard work, whereas the Pudding is more of a fun thing,” he said.
Although Tochilin said he never envisioned himself as the president of the Law Review, he said that he is prepared to take on the challenge.
“I feel really honored because it means at least some of the people respect and trust you to do the job right. It’s a big responsibility, and I am flattered and humbled to have been chosen,” he said.
As the president, Tochilin said his main focus will be on “continuing our tradition of great legal scholarship” and “providing a forum for the editors to develop and publish our own writings.”
“I love throwing myself into big projects and working hard,” Tochilin said. “It will be an intense year, but hopefully a good one.”
The Law Review—founded in 1887 by Louis D. Brandeis—publishes a mix of articles from students, professors, judges, and legal practitioners.

At the start of the first lecture for Life Sciences 1b, lecturer Andrew Berry said to his students, “Welcome to Harvard’s most unpopular class.” A round of applause followed.
Life Sciences 1b’s famously low Q score last year—a 1.8 compared to the 3.7 out of 5 that is average for natural sciences classes—has prompted a number of changes to the course, including a new set of lecturers and curriculum reforms.
Berry is teaching the course for the first time this semester, taking over for Daniel L. Hartl, a professor in the department of immunology and infectious diseases. Hartl declined to comment for this story.
The switch in staff was accompanied by a change in curriculum inspired by suggestions in students’ end-of-semester evaluations.
Berry said that students, for example, will no longer be responsible for completing online quizzes, which required students to answer questions about the reading before lecture. He explained that students and some faculty agreed that the quizzes’ purpose was unclear.
After attending Berry’s first lecture, many students said that his enthusiasm for the subject encouraged them to take the course.
Although almost 70 percent of students say that they were “unlikely to recommend” or would “definitely not recommend” the course in the most recent Q guide, enrollment rose this year by 16 percent.
“What I’m trying to do as an educator is communicate that sense of excitement and hope that students at the end of the day are on board,” Berry said.
“If we get this right, this should be a course that students look forward to taking.”
In theorizing why the course received a low Q score in the past, Berry said the method in which the course was delivered may have been a factor.
“Harvard professors who just deliver the facts and nothing more—however sagely they do it—are sometimes penalized by undergraduates in the Q,” Berry said.
Berry also spoke of a symptom he dubbed “mega-course fatigue,” which he said may have been one reason that students did not enjoy the course in the past.
The course fulfills requirements for almost every science concentration, so the large size may be impossible to avoid, he said.
Students said that they are excited about the course this year and the energy that Berry brings to the material.
Johnny F. Li ’15 said that Berry “pays attention to the class and how [the class] is reacting”—waking up students who are falling asleep, for example.
Sheila O. Ojeaburu ’15 expressed similar sentiments.
“The mood of the class is very upbeat, it’s very different from what I would have expected,” Ojeaburu said.
Maryellen Ruvolo, a professor of human evolutionary biology, and Hopi Hoekstra, a professor of organismic and evolutionary biology and molecular and cellular biology, teach the course alongside Berry. Neither Ruvolo nor Hoekstra responded to multiple requests for comment.

Curious George & Friends, a beloved children’s bookstore prominently located in Harvard Square, will reopen under new management this spring after it closed this past June.
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the close of Curious George prompted a tremendous outpouring of public support for the store last summer. Jillson said she partially attributes its reopening to public pressure.
The quirky bookstore has long helped to “train the next generation of passionate readers,” said Jeffrey Mayersohn ‘73, owner of Harvard Bookstore, one of Cambridge’s few remaining independent bookstores.
Curious George will continue to carry books, clothing, games, and toys centered around the Curious George brand and aim to take advantage of the many tourists and residents passing through Cambridge.
According to the Cambridge Chronicle, new owners Adam and Jamie Hirsch want to revamp the store’s marketing approach. They have been working with NBC Universal to refresh their business strategy, according to the Chronicle.
For example, they plan to refashion the store’s logo and name to cement their position as the only Curious George specialty store in the world.
The Hirsches have set up a website as part of a new focus on online multimedia and marketing. The site will eventually allow customers to order their merchandise online.
The store will open at the end of April after significant interior renovation and redecoration.
The bookstore had closed around the same time that Globe Corner Books, another legendary bookseller in the Square, shut down. The two closings were the latest in a series of losses of independent bookstore in Cambridge.
“When they closed, book lovers mourned their loss,” Mayersohn said. “It’s great that that tradition will continue.”
Although the Harvard Book Store expanded its children and travel sections after Curious George & Friends closed last summer, Harvard Book Store could never replace Curious George’s niche as a specialty provider of children’s books, Mayersohn said.
Mayersohn said he is not concerned about potential competition posed by the reopening.
Curious George “will bring more booklovers into the Square,” Mayersohn said. “We all benefit from it.”

During a relatively brief Cambridge City Council meeting, the councillors failed for a seventh time to elect a mayor.
Every two years, the nine members of the Cambridge City Council elect a  mayor from amongst themselves.
Cambridge uses a Plan E form of government, meaning the City Council hires a city manager who has the responsibility of dealing with the day-to-day affairs of the city.
The mayor chairs the Council, is a voting member and the chairperson of the School Committee, and receives a substantial pay increase.
To be elected, a candidate needs a majority of the nine votes of his fellow councillors.
Councillor Leland Cheung, a student at the Kennedy School of Government and the MIT Sloan School of Management, has been consistently collecting three votes—his own, and those of Councillors E. Denise Simmons and Minka Y. vanBeuzekom. No other candidate received more than two votes on the last ballot.
The Council voted once more on Monday, despite the absence of Councillor Craig A. Kelley.
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. voted for Councillor David P. Maher, who has served as mayor for the past two years.
This was Toomey’s first vote for anyone other than himself since the first ballot on Jan. 2, when both he and Maher voted for Maher.
Since no councillor won a majority of the votes, the Council remains without a mayor.
Two Cambridge Rindge and Latin School students also addressed the Council on the issue of student MBTA passes.
The monthly passes, which are currently sold to students for $20, only work on weekdays until 11 p.m.
The MBTA is considering proposals that would raise the fare to either $39 or $40.
“It adds insult to injury. Already they don’t work on weekends. Already they’re very limited, and to double the price is just ridiculous for students,” said Zachary A. Spitz, a sophomore at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
The passes, at the proposed price of $40, would cost $400 for students who need to buy them for each of the 10 months of the school year.
“My parents did pay for mine,” Spitz said. “But I know a lot of parents can’t afford it.”
Allentza Michel accompanied the students to the meeting. Michel is an adult member of the Youth Involvement Subcommittee, which is a part of the Cambridge Kids’ Council.
“Now’s a worse time than ever to start raising fares,” she said. “If people are arguing that they can’t afford $20 now, then to double that is just out of the question.”
The Council voted unanimously to request that the city manager arrange for a meeting between the students and the MBTA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Anderson Memorial Bridge, which spans the Charles River to connect Harvard’s campuses in Cambridge and Allston, is slated for a $20 million refurbishment to be completed in approximately two years.
The bridge, which links JFK Street in Cambridge to North Harvard Street in Allston, is one of the many bridges that the Massachusetts Department of Transportation has deemed “structurally deficient” in recent years.
The revamp—which will be funded and facilitated by the Department of Transportation’s $3 billion Accelerated Bridge Program—will decrease the number of car lanes from four to three, create a five-foot-wide bike lane, and expand the bridge’s sidewalks.
The bridge’s new design was planned with students in mind, according to Sara R. Lavoie, a DOT press secretary.
“Biking is a really attractive option, especially to students trying to watch their pocketbooks,” said Lavoie.
The University said that the construction will benefit Harvard, as well as the surrounding community.
“During the public process for the project, MassDOT proposed new dedicated bike lanes and better pedestrian ways that should improve conditions for the communities on both sides of the Charles River including the Harvard community,” University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an email.
But Harvard Allston Task Force member Harry E. Mattison said that the state-funded project marks another way in which Harvard has failed to realize its plans for the development  of its property in Allston, adding to the complaints that Allston residents have voiced for years about a host of projects.
“The bridge certainly needs to be rebuilt, but the state redoing it also represents a missed opportunity,” Mattison added. “Harvard had a vision for the bridge, but they never followed through.”
“It’s another example of Harvard having all of these really grandiose ideas, but then they just sort of silently say, ‘We aren’t really doing that anymore.’”
In 2004, Harvard administrators released a series of reports that proposed ideas for Allston construction. A Harvard-funded revamp of the Anderson Memorial Bridge was among the ideas floated.
One proposal suggested that the University lay down tracks for a state-of-the-art tram that would shuttle Harvardians across the bridge.
However, the University never officially incorporated such an idea into its Institutional Master Plan, a document which sketches out potential long-term building projects.
In the last few decades, Harvard’s relationship with the working- and middle-class neighborhood across the Charles has been marked by a series of dramatic flare-ups and tense exchanges. This tension worsened in 2009 when Harvard announced that it was halting construction on its $1 billion Allston Science Complex—an endeavour which the University had said would bring thousands of jobs to the community.
Though the University will not undertake the Anderson Memorial Bridge refurbishment, Harvard laid out ideas for its future development in Allston last year. Plans include resuming construction on the science center and partnering with third-party developers to build graduate student housing in Allston.

During a speech at the Graduate School of Education on Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86 said that schools should not limit the scope of their focus and support to a child’s life within the classroom.
“Educators should be attacking both in-school and out-of-school problems,” said Duncan to an audience that included Massachusetts Secretary of Education Paul Reville, Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Mitchell D. Chester, Superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools Jeffrey M. Young, and President of the Massachusetts Teachers Association Paul F. Toner. Approximately 360 watched the address, part of the Askwith Forum lecture series, by simulcast on the Graduate School of Education’s website.
Duncan said that wraparound programs, which target students’ general quality of life, are an important way to improve standards of education, especially in poverty stricken areas.
As CEO of Chicago Public Schools, Duncan opened health clinics with dental and vision services for students. He said that these resources were an example of a program that was effective in improving the quality of life of children and young adults within the Chicago school system.
Duncan said that one of his heroes is President and CEO of the Harlem Children’s Zone, Geoffrey Canada, who was recently announced as the recipient of the Ed School’s Medal for Education Impact.
However, Duncan said that support services are not enough to bridge the achievement gap and that the quality of schools themselves must be improved.
“The education challenges facing our nation are both massive and urgent,” Duncan said. He cited the statistic that one out of four American students does not graduate high school in four years or does not graduate at all.
Duncan cited a recent study led by Harvard economics professor Nadarajan Chetty, which showed that the benefits of a high quality early education  included higher salaries as an adult.
Duncan also addressed the issue of teacher evaluations, a system which many see as broken.
“Teacher evaluation should never, ever be based on test scores,” Duncan said.
Speaking about the No Child Left Behind Act, Duncan said that he would like to make changes to the education strategies that it put forth.
“No Child Left Behind was very loose on goals,” Duncan said. Instead of following this model, Duncan said that he would rather set up a system that holds schools to high standards, but gives states greater ability to attain those goals in the ways they see fit.
A small group of demonstrators outside of Longfellow Hall voiced their support for reassessment of the No Child Left Behind Act before the event.
However, some attendees said they felt that Duncan did not take many risks in his speech.
“He pretty much said what I expected,” Ed School student Kathryn E. Nestler said.

The Harvard Chaplains, Memorial Church, the Harvard Foundation, and student groups joined Monday night for “A Celebration of the Life and Message of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.” in Memorial Church.
Rami Nashashibi, executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, delivered the keynote speech.
The celebration kicked off Interfaith Awareness Week, which consists of daily diversity-themed events sponsored by a range of religious, activist, and academic organizations.
Debra A. Dawson, a staff assistant to the Harvard Chaplains, said that the event used to be held on the federal holiday celebrating King’s birthday in January. Organizers decided to push the event back to February to accommodate students who were not on campus during Wintersession.
“A lot of the community is disappointed, but we’re trying to do it for the students,” Dawson said.
The celebration included performances from several student groups, including the Kuumba Singers and the spoken word poetry group Speak out Loud.
In his speech “MLK and Spiritual Agitation: An American Muslim Reflection,” Nashashibi spoke about how King inspired his own work for social justice. King’s message still applies to modern day activists working in the face of recent “ridiculous” legislation that marginalizes immigrants, Muslims, the working class, and other minorities, Nashashibi said.
Aubrey J. Walker ’15, who recited a passage from one of King’s speeches, said Nashashibi’s address made the event unique.
Nashashibi reminded the audience of religious as well as racial diversity and encouraged his listeners to “reach across  comfortable barriers,” said Walker, who is an intern at the Harvard Foundation and president of the Freshman Black Table, a subsidiary of the Black Students Association.
“I couldn’t have imagined a more powerful, more moving, significant event that I could have attended,” Walker said.
Christina C. Twicken ’14, who attended the event, said that she had already been interested in activism prior to the commemoration, but that the event reaffirmed that commitment and gave her the chance to celebrate with people who were similarly minded.
“I thought the imagery was really beautiful,” Twicken said. “I definitely came here because I wanted to be in an environment where a lot of people wanted to celebrate activism.”­

Peter A. Thiel, founding CEO of PayPal and Facebook board member, discussed education, innovation, and the role of government in solving major societal problems at the Institute of Politics on Monday night.
History professor Niall C. D. Ferguson moderated the discussion, which focused on the relationship between technology and economic growth in the U.S.
Thiel addressed the uncertain future of technological development, an issue that he explored in a 2011 article entitled “The End of the Future,” published in the National Review Online.
Thiel argued that innovation in fields such as agriculture and transportation has become dangerously slow, leading to economic stagnation around the world.
“I think that we’ve seen progress in the virtual world, but not in the world of stuff,” Thiel said. “The U.S. has produced a ton of innovation in computers and finance over the past 30 years, but we have to ask if that implicitly twisted innovation in other areas.”
Thiel attributed this lack of innovation to structural defects in politics and education today.
When the conversation shifted to the 2012 election, Thiel had harsh words for politicians on both sides of the aisle.
“I think we are headed towards a period of chaotic austerity, because people in our political system are not able to discuss our true problems openly,” Thiel said.
He added, “Our government is not organized to find democratic solutions to problems, because our politicians are more focused on procedural issues than substantive ones.”
Thiel said that he believes the greatest hope for future technological and economic growth lies in free enterprise, and in particular, the innovation of young people.
Thiel said that he believes that young people need new creative avenues, citing his Thiel Fellowship, also known as the “20 Under 20,” which gives $100,000 to students 19 or younger to drop out of college and pursue creative expeditions in science, investment, and entrepreneurship.
Two Harvard students have received Thiel Fellowships, Ben Yu ’14 and Sujay Tyle ’13.
Thiel—who is a self-identified libertarian—said he is skeptical of welfare programs, which he believes may hinder innovation and healthy economic growth.
“A lot of the New Deal economic theories were not quite correct. But in the 30s—a world of incredible economic advancement—there was a powerful tailwind of support,” Thiel said, later adding that “welfare states lead to horizontal movement.”
Thiel was unable to discuss Facebook’s recent initial public offering because of his involvement in the company.
“He has some controversial ideas, but I think they can be very helpful,” said Ha H. Le ’14, who attended the event. “You don’t see a lot of people offering grants for students to drop out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more students than ever applying for the Institute of Politics’ Director’s Internship program last summer, the IOP has diversified and expanded the offerings for the 2012 cycle.
After about 500 students applied for the 62 opportunities last year, the IOP staff said they began looking for more internships in new fields. This year, the IOP is offering 90 spots; applications are due on Friday.
The program, which places students in summer jobs at companies and organizations ranging from Politico to the Peace Corps and pays them $4,000 stipends for the work, has seen a dramatic rise in interest over the past few years. In 2009, 375 students applied for 51 slots. The following year, 494 submitted applications for roughly the same number of opportunities.
“One driver to do more this year was thinking of all the people we said no to,” said IOP Director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ‘94.
When looking for new positions, the staff focused on diversifying the program to attract students not already involved in the IOP, according to Medha B. Gargeya ’14, the IOP internship chair.
“We hope more students are going to apply who do not necessarily want to go into politics,” Gargeya said. “We want a broader theme of public service, so that the IOP becomes home to many more people.”
New additions to the roster this year include Facebook and The New Republic. Gargeya said that the IOP also focused on finding connections with organizations that could appeal to those with more specific political interests, including Greenpeace and Victory Fund, an advocacy group focusing on electing LGBT leaders. Nine new international opportunities also were added this year.
“The largest changes are that we’ve expanded the offerings drastically and diversified the opportunities,” said Amy Howell, director of the IOP’s internship programs.
Grayson attributed the increasing interest in the program to the quality of the placements and the support the IOP offered.
“The draw is that [the internship] is a package,” Grayson said. “It’s a combination of an interesting experience and a process that’s easy to follow, not just a run-of-the-mill internship experience.”
In addition, the $4,000 stipend makes usually-unpaid internships with nonprofits and government offices a viable summer option.
“You don’t need to worry about finances during the summer—a lot of internships are unpaid, so the IOP makes sure it is covered,” said Harvard Republican Club President Derek J. Bekebrede ’13, who worked with the Heritage Foundation last summer.
According to Howell, students have used the Director’s Internship program to connect with potential employers and gain experience in the field.
“On the scale of summer internships, it is much more meaningful than sitting on Capitol Hill, answering phone calls and making people coffee,” said Lange P. Luntao ’12, who worked on social media, networking, and reaching out to policy makers as an intern with the MacArthur Foundation. “It’s absolutely the best way to make a summer internship viable.”

BOSTON, Mass.—The Harvard men’s hockey team came into last year’s Beanpot consolation game against then-No. 15 Boston University as the heavy underdog, having easily fallen a week before to a weaker Northeastern team.
But in a shocking upset, the Crimson topped the Terriers, 5-4.
The scenario played out again on Monday night at TD Garden, as an unranked Harvard squad faced off against No. 1 BU in the Beanpot semifinals. But history didn’t repeat itself, as the Terriers rolled to a 3-1 win over the Crimson, snapping Harvard’s six-game unbeaten streak.
“We’re obviously frustrated,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Give BU a lot of credit. They were able to get out ahead of us early.... I think they did a good job blocking shots, and when they didn’t, [BU goaltender Kieran Millan] was there to make the save.”
BU junior forward Wade Megan led the scoring on the night, tallying two second-period goals to put the Terriers (17-8-1, 13-6-1 Hockey East) up by three with just under six minutes remaining in the frame.
Crimson senior forward Alex Killorn scored Harvard’s only goal of the night just 85 seconds later to whittle the Terriers’ lead to two. Junior Marshall Everson found Killorn in the slot, and Killorn moved to his left before backhanding the puck into the net.
The score, which came on a Crimson power play, marked the 20th time in 23 games this season that Harvard (7-7-9, 6-4-7 ECAC) has scored at least one goal with a man advantage.
But in the end, BU goaltender Kieran Millan proved too much for the Harvard attack. Coming into the contest with a .923 save percentage, good for 18th in the nation, Millan stopped 29 of the 30 shots that came his way.
Crimson freshman goaltender Steve Michalek had a tougher time between the pipes, letting in three goals before being pulled in favor of sophomore Raphael Girard for the second straight game. Girard was perfect on the night.
“It wasn’t really pointing the finger in any way,” Donato said. “Girard plays the puck very well, which might allow us to offensively be able to transition a little quicker…. It was just an opportunity to get a goalie who handles the puck a little bit better.”
After both squads traded shots early in the contest, BU struck first. Just over eight minutes in, Matt Nieto, who was tied for a team-leading 26 points coming into the game, started on Michalek’s right, skated around the goal, and hit a wrap-around shot past the freshman to give the Terriers the 1-0 edge.
While BU controlled the pace of play for most of the period, earning three power plays and firing a number of dangerous passes that skidded just wide of the intended target in front of the Crimson net, the Terriers couldn’t grab another score in the opening 20 minutes.
Harvard had its chances in the first frame. In addition to matching BU with nine shots, the Crimson nearly tied the contest at one during a Terriers’ power play.
Freshman forward Colin Blackwell managed to break free from the poorly-positioned BU defense, earning a one on one with Millan. Blackwell faked right and tried to drag the puck left, but Millan read the play perfectly, making a pad save to preserve the tenuous lead.
“Blackwell seems to be pretty good on breakways, and he actually beat Millan with a shot fake,” Killorn said. “He just kind of played it one move too much.”
The start mirrored the beginning of last year’s Beanpot contest between the two squads, when the Terriers opened up a one-goal lead coming into the first intermission.
But comparisons with last year’s Harvard-Boston University matchup—in which the Crimson responded with three second-period goals—quickly fell apart. This time around, the Terriers quieted the Crimson attack, and Megan opened the gap to 2-0 a little over seven minutes into the second.
Megan struck again at 14:02, when, just outside the crease, he dragged the puck to his right before slotting it over Michalek’s left shoulder.
Killorn’s goal 1:25 later brought the Crimson within striking distance, down by two.
“It’s a position we’ve been in a bunch of times this year,” Killorn said. “It’s not like we’re sagging our heads in disappointment. We kind of take it as a challenge. We thought that we could mount a comeback.”
The score prompted Donato to substitute Girard in favor of Michalek. But against BU, the Crimson couldn’t manage the late-game theatrics that had lifted the team to a number of ties and wins throughout the season, failing to score the rest of the way.
“I really felt that if we could’ve somehow gotten a second one,” Donato said. “It would’ve kind of taken some momentum and really made the game a little bit different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just looking at most of the box score for Monday evening’s Beanpot matchup between Boston University and Harvard, it would seem as if the Crimson had the slight edge over the Terriers.
Harvard (7-7-9, 6-4-7 ECAC) outshot BU 30-25, won more faceoffs than the Terriers, 36-31, and had only one more penalty.
But with BU (17-8-1, 13-6-1 Hockey East) being the No. 1 team in the nation, the Crimson had little room for error. Making a few too many mistakes and not converting on all of its opportunities, Harvard suffered a 3-1 loss in the semifinals of the Beanpot Monday night at the TD Banknorth Garden.
The Crimson had trouble generating any momentum in the first portion of the game, and was whistled for six penalties by the end of the second period. The Terriers’ goaltender Kieran Millan didn’t make it any easier for underdog Harvard, earning 29 saves including a couple on breakaways while frustrating the Crimson throughout most of the night.
FRUSTRATING PENALTIES
Although BU was only one of five on the power play, early penalties by Harvard contributed to team’s initial deficit and eventual loss.
“We were in the box far too often in the first half of the game,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “It made it awfully tough for us to back into it.”
Evan Rodrigues had the first penalty of the night 9:12 into the first frame for BU, but then Harvard was called for five consecutive penalties, including two straight by junior Marshall Everson.
The man-down disadvantages prevented the Crimson from generating any consistent, offensive threat, while also fatiguing the penalty-kill lines early on.
“It gets frustrating because, when you’re on the [penalty-kill] for like ten minutes, you only rotate like four guys,” said assistant captain Alex Killorn, who scored the Crimson’s lone goal on a power play. “So you’re shortening the bench, and you’re not getting into a flow of players. It’s tough grabbing momentum like that.”
The Terriers were 0-3 in the first period on the power play but were able to score an even-strength goal on a Matt Nieto wraparound 8:14 into the first.
And on its fourth power-play bid, BU was finally able to convert, with Wade Megan scoring his first of two goals on the night on a turnover and breakdown by Harvard in the defensive zone. He added his second a few minutes later, putting the Terriers up 3-0.
Despite being called for only one of remaining five penalties in the game, the Crimson could not muster a comeback and will not reach its first Beanpot finals since 2008.
CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR
Harvard had various chances to score throughout Monday night’s game but was thwarted time and time again by the BU defense and the stellar play of goalie Kieran Millan.
“It seemed like this whole game [Millan] played really great,” Killorn said. “There were a few chances where I thought we could have scored. We had some net to shoot at but he was moving side to side really well.”
Second chances also proved hard to come.
“They swarmed the front of the net,” freshman Colin Blackwell said. “So even if there was some loose change, they had bodies there.”
One of the best chances all night came on a Blackwell breakaway towards the end of the first period. Led down the ice by a sharp pass from sophomore Dan Ford, Blackwell found himself one-on-one with Millan. The rookie faked his opponent once but was unable to put the puck past the BU netminder.
“I tried to pump him and make a move,” Blackwell said. “My original thought was to go five-hole, and I think that’s what I tried. I actually had the right side wide open, but [Millan] made a good calculation.”
After Killorn’s goal near the end of the second, the Crimson had a chance to take the momentum entering the final frame. Harvard earned a power play opportunity, but the Terriers’ solid penalty kill kept the momentum on their side.
“That was a great opportunity to grab [the momentum],” Killorn said. “I thought they played the four-on-three really well. That could’ve been a real momentum change, but we kind of lost it there.”
The Crimson played a very strong No. 1 BU squad evenly for the most part, except for a few mistakes and strong play by Millan.
“It’s definitely a good sign,” Blackwell said. “It’s just that we couldn’t bury some of the opportunities we had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down one goal at the end of the first period on Saturday, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team found itself in an early hole against Princeton. It was familiar territory for the Crimson, as the squad found itself in a similar position against Quinnipiac the previous night.
But when Harvard needed it most against ECAC rivals, Jill Dempsey proved to be the spark to the offensive engine.
In the second period against the Tigers, Dempsey came charging out of the gates with three consecutive goals and went on to notch a total of four goals in the frame. And the Crimson never looked back, scoring ten unanswered goals to take the game, 10-1. Dempsey ended the day with five scores three-star recognition.
The Winthrop, Mass. native leads the team in goals, points and points per game. She demonstrated that skill as she scored at a frenetic pace this weekend, netting two goals against the Bobcats and five goals against Princeton.
Dempsey’s five goals on Saturday against the Tigers helped the Harvard tie an NCAA record for goals in a period with seven in the second frame, and Dempsey came within one goal of tying the NCAA record for individual goals in a game. This offensive performance has raised Dempsey’s goal total for the year to 21.
For Dempsey, this weekend was test of the Crimson’s mental and physical toughness.
“After a tough loss on Tuesday night [against BU], we came in fired up and ready to go against Quinnipiac,” Dempsey said. “We came into the game knowing it was tight in the standings and we needed to bounce back.”
And with their backs against the wall, Dempsey and her team knew they had a tough task ahead of them.
“With a [2-1] deficit going into the third period, we decided to dig down deep,” Dempsey said. “We decided what we needed to do and what kind of team we were going to be.”
And behind Dempsey two goals, Harvard rallied late and up-ended the Bobcats, 4-2, for the come-from-behind victory.
Saturday’s game against Princeton also started with an early Crimson deficit.
“We came ready to go, but fell behind, 1-0, going into the second period,” Dempsey said. “But then, … momentum changed so quickly, and we were able to capitalize on our opponent’s mistakes.”
Dempsey’s five-goal haul inspired an offensive explosion, as the team continued the rout, beating Princeton, 10-1.
Dempsey, a Classics concentrator in Pforzheimer House, spent the beginning of the school year helping the U.S. Women’s National Team win a gold medal at the 2011 Four Nations Cup in Vierumaki, Finland.
“[Dempsey is] relentless,” said fellow U.S. women’s hockey team member and Harvard junior assistant captain Josephine Pucci. “She just doesn’t give up.”
Pucci is quick to credit Dempsey for inspiring the team’s success this past weekend.
“She [plays] a huge role in getting us going and focused,” Pucci continued, “[This weekend], we had all lines firing on all cylinders sparked by Jill’s performances.”
Last season, Dempsey finished the year as the top scorer for the Crimson, with 28 points on 14 goals and 14 assists. She also finished with All-ECAC and All-Ivy League second team honors and was voted the team’s Most Valuable Player.
“Nobody works harder [than Jill],” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said, “She’s as passionate about hockey as anyone in the sport.”
Bellamy believes that Dempsey’s unyielding work ethic is something the team is used to from their leading scorer.
“It’s hard to pick one moment that really captures her intensity,” Bellamy said. “She brings it every day. She’s one of those players that is the first one at the rink and the last to leave. She takes pressure off the defense with her scoring and in practice helps to make us better as goalies”
Pucci agrees with her goalkeeper’s sentiments.
“[Jill] has a big role on the team as a leader,” Pucci said. “She is always working her hardest, focusing on improving the little things, and has a positive attitude.”
Despite posting dominant back-to-back performances this weekend, Dempsey insists that there is room for this team to grow.
“We need to start [games] with [more] urgency,” Dempsey said. “This past weekend, we saw what we’re capable of doing as a team. I have faith in this team, and I think we have a great chance going forward.”
Harvard, which is currently ranked second in the ECAC behind Ivy foe Cornell, faces Boston College in the consolation match of the Beanpot Tuesday night.
“We can’t control what the other team does” Dempsey said. “Instead, all we can do is come ready to play and focus on what we can do better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of his career-record-setting, twitter-trending, ESPN-talked-about 25-point game on Saturday night, Jeremy Lin ’10 may not have been expected to perform like that again anytime soon. But that is exactly what he proceeded to do, as his New York Knicks took on the Utah Jazz Monday night at Madison Square Garden.
In the first NBA start of his young professional career, Lin managed to pull the Knicks past their opponents, tallying 28 points, eight assists, two steals, and two rebounds in the process. He was on the court for all but three minutes of game play and managed to shoot 59 percent from the field.  How good are these stats? Well, let’s just say that according to ESPN’s Jared Zwerling, this was the best first start for any player since ex-Knicks coach Isiah Thomas posted 31 points in 1981.
Despite the fact that he committed eight turnovers, Lin had almost exclusively favorable press after his second consecutive 20+ game. NBC Sports’ ProBasketballTalk called him “king of New York,” ESPN labeled him a “point guard savior,” and the Harvard alum now even has a version of a popular song by DJ Khaled created exclusively for him.
Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni clearly understood the effect that Lin was having on the team and the fans, stating in a postgame interview that he was “riding him like freakin’ Secretariat.”
Not many people could have foreseen this chapter in Lin’s saga, considering only two weeks ago he was stuck playing in the NBA Development League. But one person who has watched Lin for years and helped hone his skills wasn't as surprised: Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. And as ESPN reported, Amaker had positive, encouraging things to say about his former player following the contest: “I was really happy for him…I think he’s showing everyone again that he belongs and he’s capable.”
Who knows where he will take us next, but for now, every step on this journey is pure Linsanity.

Forget about the SportsCenter highlights and M.V.P chants, you know you’ve really made it when rappers are spitting bars about you. It may not be by Hov, Yeezy, or Wayne, but former Harvard men’s basketball standout Jeremy Lin ’10 now has his own track courtesy of an artist named Mega Ran. Sure, “Six-foot-three, with a four-two/grade-point average, not vertical” isn’t exactly the definition of flow, but we still think you will enjoy giving this joint a listen.

Like it or not, summer is fast approaching and, with it, the deadlines for summer funding applications. If you want Harvard to pay for your summer experience, check out the tips in this post and start gearing up for some hardcore grant-writing.
In general, the best way to find grants specific to your interests is to use the Harvard College Funding Database. A variety of categories allows you limit your search criteria to aspects that apply to your needs, including purpose of activity, time frame, location, and areas of interest.
Make sure to check out the database, but in the meantime, the summary below should help to explain the general timeframe of when applications are due.
Study Abroad:
For those of you looking to give your passport a little exercise this summer, the deadline to apply for any study abroad grants is Feb. 17. Your best bet might be the David Rockefeller International Experience Grant, which donates anywhere from $1,500 to the full cost of the trip plus flight expenses.
International Internships:
For those ambitious students looking to intern, research, or do service abroad, or for those who just have a really great—and educational—travel plan to pursue, apply for the international internship grants due Feb. 10. Rockefeller is also a safe bet here, but the Weissman International Internship Program is also very generous, granting between $4,000 and $6,000 to individuals last year.
Domestic Service:
For those looking to stay a little bit more local this summer, applying for domestic service grants might be the way to go. The grants are given out on a rolling deadline, starting Feb. 24 and lasting until funding runs out. Apply early, though!—dishing out $1,500 per student, the domestic service grant is a sweet deal that definitely won't be around in May.
For students whose interests are not listed above, never fear! The Office of Career Services has many more programs available. For more information, refer to their funding website.
Oh, and good luck. We're right there with you.

If you happened to have passed by Brattle Street today, you may have noticed a cluster of multicolored post-it notes brightening the windows of an empty storefront. In response to the words "Who inspires you?" written in bold black sharpie, the post-it notes express gratitude for a range of beloved people and things. If you're looking for a pick-me-up, these 3x3 inch squares may do the trick.
