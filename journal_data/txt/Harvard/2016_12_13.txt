“Hate is not inborn; it has to be constantly
cultivated, to be brought into being, in conflict with more or less recognized
guilt complexes.” – Frantz Fanon
From a demographic perspective, South Asia is relatively racially homogenous—everyone is “brown.” But the shades of brown matter.
A lot.
A deeper analysis may show that race is arguably more prominent in South Asian culture than at first glance. Inferiority complexes of all kinds—linguistic, physical, ethnic, and religious—run deep in the South Asian public imaginary, inside and outside of the region.
Skin-color presents itself as a particularly important case, since all one needs to do is look. Prevailing sentiments within most circles equate beauty, goodness, and success with fair skin color. Skin tone continues to exist in a discursive space: While Indian cosmetics companies like Fair & Lovely feed on an insecurity and promise lighter skin to their consumers, campaigns such as Dark is Beautiful applaud a diversity of skin tones, underwritten by slogans such as “Celebrating 1.2 Billion Shades of Beautiful.” The campaign has also called out Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone for her "glaring change” to a lighter skin tone over time. Padukone was an ambassador for Neutrogena Fine Fairness cream.
In a broader context, the ironic denouement of colonialism may just be that South Asia is attempting to become the type of society that oppressed it for centuries. The British conceived of and used categories of difference like ethnicity and religion to administer their colonies all over the world—categories that were incredibly effective in cold, calculated management of populations. Now South Asian corporations are using those same categories, and the deep, abiding scars that they created, to make a profit.
At Harvard, many would like to think that such distinctions are absent—after all, the norm on campus is a markedly liberal political commitment. However students have an imperfect sense of obligation to a post-racial (or post-color) ideal, an ideal that they also lack a complete understanding of. Because of this, as with other social issues, colorism has definitely made a blotch on campus. Implicit in dating in general, for example, is a preference for lighter skinned women in particular—the Harvard Women’s Center held an event last semester addressing race and dating.
To extend this framework and include Latinx and black students would not be beyond a reasonable charge of colorism on campus. Concerns surrounding differential treatment of minorities manifested themselves in campus movements at Mizzou and Yale last year. The Harvard community has shown solidarity with these movements, through plays such as Black Magic, written and performed by students of color to highlight the black student experience on campus. Moreover, the social impact and work of movements like Black Lives Matter have brought skin color to the forefront of the American quotidian routine, during class, meals, or sports events.
It may be difficult for students to admit that they “like” a certain skin tone (light skin in this case) in a period in history where such sentiment would be seen as offensive. So it would not seem ludicrous for many to think that colorism is not an issue on campus. However, like racism in recent years, colorism simply exhibits itself in very subtle ways. Overcoming these barriers will not come without struggle, a struggle in the form of honest and open dialogue about dating preferences and deeply internalized prejudices about skin tone—issues that are certainly difficult even in the most intimate of settings.
Fanon’s insights hold more true today on Harvard’s campus and in the wider world than possibly during his own time. That the United States has transitioned to a post-racial society is a pervasive mawkishness that has been challenged by recent tensions about race—especially the 2016 American presidential elections. Parameters of social differentiation like race, ethnicity, and skin tone are still incredibly important to the way people perceive one another.
The lessons from conversations about colorism will allow Harvard students to think hard about how they betray the values of racial equality they claim to uphold. Regardless of the (ostensible) progress that has been made in race relations, darkness remains an undesirable physicality, maintained as a sickness South Asians attempt to cure, but to no avail—even on campus. That may be because darkness isn’t a sickness, but something to be proud of. Something to love. Whereas some might (and do) demand darkness be wretched, others might (and should) demand it be celebrated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College honored 99 students who are completing their degrees off-cycle at a recognition ceremony on Dec. 2 that featured History professor Jill M. Lepore and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana as speakers.
According to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, 23 students completed their studies this November and 76 are projected to finish in March. November degree candidates completed their coursework over the summer, while the projected March degree candidates will finish their final semester this term.
Khurana, who graduated mid-year from Cornell, addressed the students at the ceremony, which was held at the Student Organization Center at Hilles. He reminded them of the importance of including and tolerating others even in the face of risks.
Lepore said in an interview that she hoped that graduates would take with them a “spirit of inquiry in the service of the public good.”
“We live in a very instrumental time when people feel a lot of obligation to do the most straightforward and obvious and practical thing,” Lepore said. “I wanted to ask people to remember to think about beauty and truth.”
An increasing number of undergraduates have taken voluntary leaves of absence in the past five years, according to the College’s Administrative Board. During the 2014-2015 academic year, 242 students took time off, which does not include those studying abroad or on mandated leaves of absence.
Eliza R. Pugh ’16-’17, who was the student speaker at the event, discussed her experience taking her junior fall off, when she spent a semester in the Andes region of South America. She said the decision to take time off campus creates a shared experience for mid-year graduates.
“We all shared this commonality of taking time away from Harvard and that made our time here at Harvard different,” Pugh said. “I was really inspired to speak because I think my time off was very transformative.”
Pugh described the feeling of taking time off from college and returning as distinct from those of her classmates.
“It’s the same Harvard. Classes are the same, midterms are the same, homework is the same, but a little bit different socially,” she said. “Blockmates and roommates have graduated; your timing is off for your extracurriculars.”
Like many of his fellow off-cycle graduates, Reylon A. Yount ’16-’17 participated in the commencement exercises with his peers in May. Seniors who graduate off-cycle are invited to participate in commencement exercises either with the class with which they entered the College, prior to the completion of their final term, or the following spring.
Yount, who was the first marshal of the Class of 2016, said that the time he finished his degree requirements remained independent of the emotional experience of commencement and helping plan Class Day.
“I liked being able to phase out of Harvard more gradually,” Yount said. “[It] made me really appreciate the following summer and fall more.”
Justin P. Giallorenzo ’16-’17 took time off to travel in Italy, to study Italian, and connect with relatives. He said that his final semester has been like a “reset button”—a different, but positive experience.
“Being here after most of your class graduates is a different Harvard,” Giallorenzo said. “I found that it’s created a bit more of space for me to engage with Harvard how I want to.”
